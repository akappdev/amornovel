He was large, the size of a bobcat, with sleek fur the color of jet. His coat shimmered as he moved, gleaming in the dull glow of streetlights in between shadows, and he moved with speed and grace, if not purpose. Eyes that burned like blue embers stayed focused on the path ahead of him.</p><p>The cat had gone by several names in his long life. For more than a century now, he had been simply Jaden, or even more simply, \u201ccat.\u201d If pressed, he would answer to either, and neither if he could get away with it.</p> <p>Tonight, in the night\u2019s seductive and silent embrace, Jaden answered to no one but himself.</p><p>Jaden took his time as he made his way through town, savoring the stillness of the blessed lack of humanity with all its noise and emotion and complication. He paused in front of the darkened windows of a beauty salon, letting his gaze drift over the sign that read, CHARMED, I\u2019M SURE, and then lifted his head higher to catch the scent of air that was heavy with moisture and ripe with the promise of rain. Jaden could sense that summer was making its way to this little corner of New England, while aware that even in early May the frost could arrive on any given night to give the season\u2019s fresh blooms a deadly kiss.</p><p>Deadly kisses, Jaden thought, lashing his tail. Yeah, he knew all about those. When you were a vampire, especially a lowly shape-shifting cat of a vampire, deadly kisses were sort of your stock in trade.</p><p>Damn it. So much for a late-night walk to clear his head.</p><p>The shift came as easily as breathing to him, and in a single heartbeat Jaden stood on two feet instead of four, his clothes firmly in place by some magic he had never understood but always appreciated. He stuffed his hands deeply into the pockets of his coat and continued on down the street, glaring at the ground in front of him as he moved. Though he\u2019d spent years seething silently at the Ptolemy, his highblood masters who had treated \u201cpets\u201d like him with little mercy and even less respect, these days he didn\u2019t seem to have much anger for anyone but himself.</p> <p>Jaden now had what he\u2019d always thought he wanted: friends, a home, and most important, his freedom. The Ptolemy were not gone, but they were cowed for the time being, and his kind, the much-maligned Cait Sith, had been chosen for an incredible honor. They were to be the foundation for the rebirth of a dynasty of highbloods that had vanished ages ago but had now resurfaced in the form of a single mortal woman who carried the blood.</p><p>The seven months since Jaden had helped that woman, Lily, make a stand against the Ptolemy had passed like nothing. And though it had been considerably less time since the Vampiric Council had given Lily\u2019s plan its grudging blessing, Jaden was now really and truly free. Whether it had been a wise decision, Jaden couldn\u2019t say. The Cait Sith were an unruly lot at best.</p><p>But he was grateful, as were the rest, which had to count for something.</p><p>Jaden rubbed at his collarbone without really being aware that he was doing it. There, beneath layers of clothing, was his mark, the symbol of his bloodline. Until recently, the mark had been a coiling knot of black cats. But a drink of Lily\u2019s powerful blood had changed it, adding the pentagram and snake of the Lilim. It meant new abilities he was still exploring, newfound standing in a world where he had always been beneath notice. It should have meant hope, Jaden knew. After all, for the first time in his long life, he was not a pariah. He could be his own master. It should be everything. And yet...</p><p>The empty places inside him still ached like open wounds. Something was missing. He just wished he knew what it was.</p><p>A soft breath of wind ruffled through his hair, and Jaden caught a whiff of something both familiar and unfamiliar.</p> <p>Then he heard the voices.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no place to run to now, is there?\u201d That was a gravelly male voice, reeking of self-satisfaction. Its owner gave a low and vicious chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to accept me. I\u2019ve caught you. It\u2019s my right.\u201d</p><p>A female voice responded, and a pleasant shiver rippled through Jaden\u2019s body at the low, melodious sound of it.</p><p>\u201cYou have no rights with me. And chasing me down like prey isn\u2019t going to get you what you want.\u201d</p><p>He was almost certain he\u2019d heard that voice before, though he couldn\u2019t place it. What Jaden could place, however, was the scent that had his hackles rising and the adrenaline flooding his system.</p><p>Werewolves.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s lips curled, and he had to fight the instinctive urge to hiss. Not only were the wolves vilified by vampires as savages, banned from their cities under penalty of death, but the smell of their musk caused a physical reaction in him that was difficult to control. He had two options: fight or flight. It was less trouble to run. But this was his territory now, vampire territory. And these wolves had a hell of a lot of nerve coming into it.</p><p>Jaden was moving before he could think better of it. His feet made no sound on the pavement as he headed for the parking lot behind the building. And as he slipped into shadow, he listened.</p> <p>\u201cYou can make this easy or hard, honey. But you\u2019re going to have me one way or the other. And there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>A low growl from the female. A warning. \u201cI\u2019m not about to take a backseat to some social-climbing stray. I don\u2019t want a mate.\u201d</p><p>The male\u2019s voice went thick and rough, as though he was fighting a losing battle with the beast within. \u201cMy family is plenty good enough to mate with an Alpha. You should be glad it\u2019s me, Lyra. I won\u2019t be as rough as some. And you and I both know there\u2019s no way the pack is ever going to have a female Alpha. There\u2019s too much at stake to let the weak lead.\u201d</p><p>Lyra... The pieces clicked into place, and Jaden\u2019s stomach sank like a stone.</p><p>He did know her. And that brief meeting had put him in one of the fouler moods of his unnatural life.</p><p>Memories surfaced of a Chicago safe house, full of vampires in hiding, in trouble, or on the run. And on the occasion he remembered, it had also been a hiding place for a female werewolf with a sharp tongue and a nasty attitude. Rogan, the owner of the safe house, had mentioned something about Lyra being a future Alpha... right after Jaden had demanded she leave the room.</p><p>Lyra had gone, though she hadn\u2019t taken the slight quietly. And now, she was here, in the seat of the Lilim. It was almost inconceivable. Jaden wondered briefly if Lyra hadn\u2019t hunted him here to finish their brief altercation with blood. That would be like a werewolf, brutish and nonsensical. But no, Jaden realized as she and the male who was accosting her came into view. Lyra seemed to have bigger problems than any grudge she bore him.</p><p>Jaden kept to the shadows, melting into darkness as effectively as he did in his feline form. He now had a clear view of a tall, over-muscled Neanderthal who was wearing the expected smug sneer. A predator. Being one himself, Jaden had gotten very good at identifying others. Lyra he saw only from behind, but he would have known her anywhere. Long, lean, and tall, with a wild tangle of dark hair shot through with platinum and tumbling halfway down her back. He let his eyes skim the length of her, suddenly apprehensive... hoping that his reaction to her the last time had been some kind of sick fluke. It had been easy enough to dismiss then. Being under constant threat of annihilation could do strange things to a man. But he knew it had fueled his anger at her presence in the safe house.</p><p>And now, just as before, the sight of her sent desire cascading through him in a wild rush like no other woman had provoked in him.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s sudden arousal mingled with a punch of bloodlust, creating a tangled mix of wants and needs that had his breath beginning to hitch in his chest. He moved slowly, walking the increasingly fine edge between man and beast as he struggled to stay concealed. He remembered more than just his brief meeting with her, no matter how he\u2019d tried to block it all out. He\u2019d had dreams... bodies tangled together, biting, clawing... licking...</p><p>Appalled, Jaden told himself he couldn\u2019t truly want a werewolf. Apart from being forbidden by both races, it was just wrong. Wasn\u2019t he screwed up enough?</p><p>It was a relief when the Neanderthal provided a distraction from his thoughts. The male moved like lightning, and far more gracefully than his bulky form would suggest. A hand shot out, snatching something from around Lyra\u2019s neck. The werewolf dangled the item in front of her, and Jaden could see it was a silver pendant hanging from a leather cord. She tried to snatch the pendant back, but the male held it high above his head like a schoolyard bully.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an old necklace,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cIf you want it that badly, come and get it.\u201d</p><p>Jaden could hear the helpless outrage in her voice when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t here right now, is he? No one is.\u201d The Neanderthal shifted, crooked a finger at her. His stance said he knew he\u2019d won. \u201cI\u2019ve got a hotel room. Or we can do it right here. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>His grin was foul. She seemed to think so too.</p><p>\u201cLike hell, Mark.\u201d</p><p>Lyra\u2019s muscles tensed. She was going to run. What choice did she have? But the other man knew it. And while she might be fast, there was no way she would be able to match his strength.</p><p>Jaden hissed out a breath through gritted teeth. He was no hero. He might be nothing more than a lowblood vampire, a gutter cat with a gift for the hunt, but even among his kind, there were unspoken rules. And something in Lyra\u2019s voice, the hopeless outrage of someone railing against a fate they knew was inevitable, struck a chord deep within him. He had spent centuries being pushed and pulled by forces he couldn\u2019t fight. No one had ever given a damn what he had wanted, not from the first.</p><p>Gods help him with what he was about to get tangled up in.</p><p>Lyra spun, leaping away with a startling amount of grace. The man she\u2019d called Mark lunged almost as quickly. His hand caught in all the glorious hair, fisting so that her head snapped back. Jaden heard her pained cry, heard the man\u2019s roar of victory. Then Mark\u2019s hands were on her, grabbing, tearing... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One look at Lyra\u2019s eyes, wild and afraid, and nothing on earth could have prevented Jaden from stepping in. He sprang from the shadows with a vicious snarl, fury hazing the darkness with bloodred. He landed directly in front of the grappling pair, fangs elongated and bared. The shock of his appearance gave Lyra the opening he\u2019d hoped for. She twisted away, but not quickly enough. Mark took her down with a quick clout to the side of the head before whipping back around. Jaden watched, an odd twist of pain in his chest, as Lyra gave a single, shocked sob and collapsed to her knees.</p><p>Still, Jaden had gotten part of what he wanted. Lyra could no longer be used as a shield.</p><p>Recognition dawned in Mark\u2019s eyes a split-second before the instinctive hatred did.</p> <p>Then another set of fangs were bared. Eyes flashed hot gold. The werewolf gave a guttural growl and reached for Jaden, long claws already extended from his fingertips. Jaden hissed as he stepped out of reach and waited for his chance. Jaden knew from experience that a wolf would always go for brute force over finesse. And against a vampire, it was almost always the wolf\u2019s downfall.</p><p>This time was no different.</p><p>Mark lunged, swiped. Jaden ducked easily and extended claws of his own, drawing first blood across the vulnerable belly. The thin ribbons of blood darkening his opponent\u2019s T-shirt seemed to incense his adversary, and he launched himself at Jaden only to find himself with a face full of asphalt. Unable to control himself, Jaden laughed, though it sounded nasty and hollow to his own ears.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I think someone\u2019s going home alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>Face bloodied, the werewolf dragged himself off the ground and growled at his tormentor.</p> <p>\u201cGet out of here, bloodsucker. This is wolf business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Looks like garden-variety jackassery to me,\u201d Jaden said, watching Lyra out of the corner of his eye. She had shifted to a sitting position, and was holding her head in her hands staying very still. How badly she was hurt, Jaden didn\u2019t know. It was so like a wolf to try to win a woman by damaging her. Regardless, it was time to run this bastard off and give Lyra what care she needed.</p><p>He tried to ignore the way his heart began to stutter in his chest at the thought.</p><p>\u201cLeave now,\u201d Jaden said, his voice soft, deadly. \u201cOr I kill you.\u201d</p><p>Mark snorted. \u201cSkinny piece of shit bloodsucker like you? I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words were cut off abruptly by two kicks, one to his gut and one across his thick head. At that, he went down like a ton of bricks with only a soft grunt for a response. This time, he stayed down. Jaden glared down at him for a moment, only barely denying himself the extra kick he wanted to give the wolf for good measure. But the stupid bastard should feel lousy enough when he awakened facedown in the parking lot in the morning. Although it might be momentarily satisfying, killing him would be nothing more than a messy waste of time.</p> <p>And despite his disturbing interest in Lyra, Jaden had no interest in getting the Lilim into a pissing match with whatever scruffy pack of werewolves this loser belonged to.</p><p>Satisfied that they were now, for all practical purposes, alone, Jaden moved to Lyra\u2019s side and crouched down beside her. A light, intoxicating scent drifted from her, making his mouth water. Apples, he remembered. Sweet, tart apples, with something earthier beneath. Strangely enough, he felt no urge to run, to hiss and spit. He realized now it was a good thing he hadn\u2019t gotten this close the last time. He might have done something really stupid.</p><p>Though he supposed his current actions qualified.</p><p>\u201cLyra?\u201d he asked, trying to keep his voice low and soothing. He wasn\u2019t sure how successful he was... he was way out of practice at damage control. Usually, he was the damage. \u201cAre you all right? Do you need a doctor?\u201d Wolves were self-healers, he knew, but it could take a while, which was dangerous when the wound was severe.</p><p>She said nothing, moved not a muscle, and Jaden\u2019s concern deepened. He reached for her, momentarily overcome by the urge to make even the simplest physical connection. But his hand stilled in midair when she finally lifted her head to look at him. And whatever he\u2019d expected to see\u2014fear, confusion, even a little gratitude\u2014none of it was in evidence as he looked into Lyra\u2019s burning, furious eyes glowing fire-bright in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about touching me, cat,\u201d she said. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>AND SHE\u2019D THOUGHT her night couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p> <p>Lyra Black glared into the face of her would-be savior. He looked comically surprised that she wasn\u2019t already batting her eyes and breathlessly thanking him. That was what all vamps expected: mindless adoration. And thanks to their talents with manipulating human minds, they tended to get it. Especially vamps as pretty as this one, she thought, seeing big, almost innocent blue eyes set in a face made for sin. Fortunately, werewolves were immune to the bloodsuckers\u2019 brand of \u201ccharm.\u201d</p><p>Not that this one had tried very hard the last time they\u2019d met. Of all the vamps who could have interfered tonight, did it have to be him?</p><p>He drew back his hand as though she\u2019d burned him. Lyra felt a fleeting instant of shame when his expression, so open and filled with what appeared to be genuine concern, shifted into a narrow-eyed glare. But it was no more than he deserved, she reminded herself. When she\u2019d been holed up at that rat-infested vampire safe house all those months ago, he\u2019d all but announced she was unfit to be in the same room with him. She\u2019d quickly gathered that the other people in residence were his refugee friends\u2014some other cat vamp and a human woman who\u2019d seemed nice enough, despite her questionable taste in companions, as Lyra remembered.</p><p>But this one. This one was a Grade A, certified cat vamp asshole.</p><p>Knowing it made it easier to say what she needed to, easier to look into those big baby blues and tell him where to go, and she was glad. Because a non-vamp who looked as good as he did might have tempted her to trouble, and the gods knew she had enough of that in her life already.</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re as sweet as ever,\u201d he muttered, getting to his feet in a single graceful movement that left Lyra, normally so confident, feeling awkward as she regained her own footing.</p><p>Stupid vampires.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have a lot of reason to be sweet to you,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cFirst throwing me out of your super secret vampire meeting because I\u2019m not the right species, and now cold-cocking some idiot I could have taken out myself.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, disconcerted by the way his eyes darted to her breasts and then away. She could almost think\u2014but that was stupid. Vamps didn\u2019t check weres out. They took them out, and that was always going to be the way of it.</p><p>Still, beholden to her own morbid curiosity, she shifted so that her folded arms pushed her breasts up and together, displaying them attractively beneath her cami. Sure enough, his eyes flickered back and then away a couple more times, as though he wanted not to look but couldn\u2019t quite help himself. Lyra tipped her head to regard him, stunned to realize that not only was her erstwhile savior most definitely checking her out, he was flushed. His nostrils flared ever so slightly, as though he were scenting something. Prey, maybe.</p><p>And when she caught his eye again, he looked both miserable and so hungry it took her breath away. Lyra let her arms fall back to her sides, suddenly very uncomfortable with the game she\u2019d just played. Every lesson she\u2019d ever learned, everything she\u2019d been taught by her pack, filled her head at once, admonishing her.</p><p>To toy with a vamp, even a lone and seemingly well-intentioned one like this, was to play with fire. Nothing would ever come from mixing wolves and vampires but blood. And more often than not, fair or not, it was the wolves who would shed most of it.</p><p>It was small consolation, but the vampire looked just as uncomfortable as she felt all of a sudden. He turned his head to look down at Mark sprawled out on the pavement, sleeping the sleep of the deservedly unconscious. She watched the sharp flicker of his movement and felt a momentary pang of... something... as she allowed herself the barest of moments to take in the lithe perfection of his form encased in slim-fitting black jeans, scuffed black boots, and a high-collared military-style coat. His chin-length hair was black as night and tucked behind his ears, making his features that much more sharply appealing.</p><p>He could have been a sullen young rock star instead of a centuries-old vampire. And Lyra found, with no small amount of horror, that her mouth watered either way.</p><p>\u201cYou could have taken him, huh?\u201d The vamp prodded Mark\u2019s prone body with the toe of his boot, and Lyra finally remembered his name. Actually, she remembered the human woman saying it in a tone usually reserved for small and badly behaving children, which nearly brought a smile to her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, I could have, Jaden,\u201d she said, enjoying the startle it gave him to hear his name fall from her lips. A strange name for one as old as he must be, she decided. Very modern. But he\u2019d probably renamed himself at some point. Lyra had heard they did that, living so long they got sick of the name they were born with. She might... but then again, she enjoyed being the only Lyra she knew.</p><p>\u201cGuess I did make an impression that night,\u201d he remarked. \u201cSince you feel the need to bitch me out, by name, instead of thanking me. But there was no way you were going to take this guy down. I was watching. It was over the second he got his fist in your hair.\u201d</p><p>Whatever oddball fantasy she had been entertaining about him up to this point crumbled into dust. Just another arrogant vamp, Lyra decided. It didn\u2019t matter that he was right, that she knew he was right about Mark. What mattered was that he and the rest of his ilk had no respect for either her or her kind.</p><p>\u201cI would have found a way,\u201d she growled, stepping closer to Jaden. \u201cI don\u2019t need some cat vamp rescuer who expects me to lick his paws for gracing me with his presence.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted, mocking her subtly. He knew she\u2019d needed him... needed someone, anyway... and that was the thing Lyra hated most. She was already considered unfit to lead because of her sex. Her entire life had been about projecting strength, about watching what the males of the pack did and then doing it better. To have to be rescued from a single wolf who\u2019d caught her off guard was humiliating. The only silver lining that she could see was that the story of it would never reach her pack. Or Mark\u2019s, Lyra thought, shooting another glance at his unconscious form and barely restraining herself from curling her lip at the sight. She wasn\u2019t the only one who wouldn\u2019t want word of this encounter getting out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as your thank-you, I guess,\u201d Jaden said, \u201csince it\u2019s obviously all I\u2019m going to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it however you want,\u201d Lyra replied. \u201cAs long as you take it and go. I\u2019m not interested in chatting right now and lucky for you, not in the mood for cat chasing either. But I might change my mind.\u201d When her words seemed to amuse him for some perverse reason, Lyra narrowed her eyes and added, \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>She thought, and hoped, he would leave now that his heroics were finished. Instead, he surprised her by lingering. And she surprised herself by not turning and walking away, which is what she knew she should have done. Now that she had stepped closer to him, she was unable to avoid his scent. He smelled unmistakably of vampire, the faint whiff of some rare and ancient spice that Lyra doubted he could even smell himself, just as she\u2019d been told (snarled at, more like) on several memorable occasions that her breed stank of wild animal musk. She had never seen anyone but a vamp react to her as though she\u2019d rolled in garbage, and she certainly saw nothing wrong with the wolf scent.</p> <p>But Jaden wasn\u2019t reacting normally to her, wasn\u2019t cringing and backing off as though she had some dread disease. He simply acted... interested. And it had affected her, Lyra realized, because she didn\u2019t find him to be an assault on her senses either. He smelled good to her. Really good. Good enough to make her want to roll over on her back and\u2014</p><p>She took a quick step back, sucking in a breath as she realized what was happening to her. Her skin had warmed, her heart rate had increased, and she was greedily drinking in Jaden\u2019s vampire musk. Beneath her shirt, her nipples had pebbled into tight little buds, and it had nothing to do with the cold. Her sex was swollen and slick already, demanding she accept him, bare her neck to him, get him behind her and let him... let him...</p><p>Lyra exhaled harshly and stared at Jaden as though he were the Hellhound himself, a mythical beast come to drag her to the underworld for her disloyalty to the pack. He watched her steadily, his eyes still blue but grown decidedly more feline. The pupils were long, dilated, the irises a glowing blaze of blue. And she knew she was in trouble when he took two steps toward her, closing the distance until he was only inches from her, his breath fanning her face.</p><p>Only pride kept her from backing away again. Lyra stood her ground, even when those unusual eyes dropped to her lips. She licked them nervously, saw his jaw tighten. She decided it was not to her advantage that Jaden was only perhaps an inch taller than she. She\u2019d always hated the way the males of her kind used their height and brawn to try to intimidate her, though at five feet eight she was tall for a woman. But she saw now that there had been one good thing. When those men had tried to move in on her, their mouths hadn\u2019t been so very close, so evenly matched with the position of her own. If Jaden leaned in just a bit, he would have her.</p><p>Lyra couldn\u2019t let that happen. But the thought of it was so much more tempting than it should have been. Her skin tingled pleasurably. Her fingers flexed, itching to grab him by the shoulders, the hair, and plunge.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re something,\u201d he said softly, his British accent doing terrible, forbidden things to the muscles deep in her belly. \u201cTelling me where to go on my own territory. You shouldn\u2019t even be here, Lyra. You know the wolves are banned from our cities, and this place belongs to the Lilim now. So this is twice I\u2019ve met you when I\u2019d be well within my rights to tear you apart for crossing the line.\u201d</p><p>It was a threat, but she knew instinctively it wasn\u2019t a real one. Killing her was the last thing on Jaden\u2019s mind, just as fighting him was the last thing on hers. Still, she knew the reality of the situation would intrude soon enough, and at that point she was going to have to get away from him, no matter what it took. Sure enough, his next words set her already frayed nerves on edge.</p><p>He tilted his head, putting her in mind of a curious and not altogether benevolent cat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, here? First it was hiding in that safe house in Chicago, and now you\u2019ve turned up in a small town in Massachusetts that just happens to be the home of the newest vampire dynasty. What are you looking for?\u201d He drew even closer. \u201cSpying so you can run back and tell your leader what a dynasty full of cats looks like, are you? Or were you thinking we wouldn\u2019t notice if you holed up here for a while? What are you running from, Lyra?\u201d</p><p>Lyra swallowed with a dry click, and the words wouldn\u2019t come. He would think what he would think, she knew. It didn\u2019t matter what she said. His kind didn\u2019t understand hers, and never would. And he would never understand the desperation she\u2019d been grappling with, looking for ideas, or even scraps of ideas, that might save her.</p><p>It was a shame she couldn\u2019t have stayed, seen more. She\u2019d really hoped to find a way to see Lily, without Lily seeing her, of course, and study how a woman with so much power and responsibility conducted herself. Was there some secret to the way she walked, moved, talked? Why had they allowed her to claim so much so easily, with no males fighting for dominance? The whispers she\u2019d heard of the human woman\u2019s ascendance to the upper echelons of vampire society had been true. But as insane as it had sounded to all the wolves who had heard the rumors, Lyra now knew the rest was true as well. This was now a dynasty of Cait Sith, the vampire cat-shifters, no matter the new name they had taken. And if there was a more poisonous relationship than the one between that bloodline and her kind, she\u2019d never heard of it.</p> <p>There would be no help for her here, not now that her presence had been discovered by both a Cait and one of her many unwanted suitors. If Mark had sniffed her out, others would too. They were getting better at it, especially with the Proving so close at hand. So she would run again. Run home, this time, where she would have to begin preparations in earnest. Alone.</p><p>Defiantly, Lyra raised her chin and glared into Jaden\u2019s searching eyes. \u201cWhere I go and what I do are none of your business,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to your territory. There\u2019s nothing here I want.\u201d</p><p>She started to spin away, and as she did caught the dangerous flash of his eyes too late. His hand closed around her arm, and Lyra could feel the incredible, tightly controlled strength in his grip. He pulled her back hard, and she wound up plastered against him. For a brief, heated instant their bodies connected, and she could feel every hard knot of muscle in his long, lean form. Her body wanted to curve against it, fitting itself so that they were fused together, two pieces formed to connect with the other.</p><p>Jaden pressed his mouth to her ear, and she could feel the briefest rub of his head against her hair, like a cat marking a possession with its scent. She tried to struggle: she was no man\u2019s to possess, and certainly not his! But with the slightest flex of deceptively strong muscle, she was forced to be still.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Lyra. What are you running from?\u201d he breathed against her ear. Such a simple question from a stranger, and still she felt herself tremble with the need to pour it out to him, to plead for help from a man who would doubtless laugh at her before turning away. It was the stress, she knew. The knowledge of what was building against her back at home, from both within the pack and without.</p><p>Finally, she found the strength to wrench away from him, and this time he let her go. She bared her teeth and growled at him, the only warning Lyra could give now since words had failed her. Fear, anger, and helpless lust tangled together inside her, threatening to push her back toward Jaden and make her do something she would later regret. And he was so still, standing there watching her, as poised and inscrutable as the sphinx with his eyes glowing like blue flames. But she could feel his want, the beast half of her sensing it and demanding she respond.</p><p>There was only one response she could give that she wouldn\u2019t regret.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me, cat,\u201d she snapped, her voice rough as it began to morph into a wolf\u2019s snarl. \u201cI have enough problems.\u201d</p> <p>She turned from him, surprised by how hard it was to leave him standing there. She was losing it, Lyra feared. Losing it from the pressure of being hunted, ridiculed, and discounted for so long. But it would be over soon, one way or another.</p><p>Lyra took off at a sprint, her muscles coiling and responding like a well-oiled machine. Her heeled black boots were no impediment to speed. She didn\u2019t give a damn how she looked, running away from him. He was nothing to her. Just like any vampire. She felt her limbs burn and change, pulling her toward the ground and into a four-legged lope, clothing vanishing as fur bristled over her skin. As the wolf, she could breathe again. Never looking back, Lyra raced away from where Jaden stood watching and let the seductive embrace of the night be her freedom, if only for a little while.</p><p>It was time to go home.</p><p>Jaden watched the wolf, her silvery fur the color of smoke, vanish around the corner and into the darkness. Lyra was as long limbed and graceful in this form as she was in the other, the very picture of deadly beauty. And she was beautiful, even if his nature stood in dangerous opposition to her own.</p><p>There were a few drawn-out moments when he didn\u2019t trust himself to move, worried that he\u2019d wind up chasing after the wolf. He had no doubt now that Lyra was still in some sort of trouble, still running, and that the unfortunate suitor lying on the ground was only a piece of the problem.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no concern of mine,\u201d he said out loud, hoping the sound of his own voice would bring him back to reality and lift whatever spell he\u2019d fallen under. But nothing was going to remove the memory of how Lyra had felt against him, as if she\u2019d been burned into his skin. Silently, he cursed himself for having touched her. Impulse control wasn\u2019t an area where he usually failed. But something about Lyra Black\u2014yes, that had been her last name, he remembered\u2014had made it impossible to resist. Her hair had been like silk against his cheek, and the scent of her skin...</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled, and turned his head away from the direction she had gone. She had let it go, walked away. He needed to do the same. Jaden didn\u2019t know where this interest in the ornery she-wolf had come from, but he knew nothing good could possibly come of it. Time to get out of here. The sun would be up before long, and at that point he could brood about it in his dreams and hopefully wake up refreshed and past this madness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was just turning to go when his eyes caught a glint of something. Inside him, some voice of self-preservation began screaming at him to leave it, to just keep going. Although he had ample control over most of his impulses, curiosity, like all cats eventually discovered, had often been his downfall. Jaden walked to the locket, glittering atop its length of broken chain, and picked it up.</p><p>Jaden let it dangle from his fist for a moment, examining what Mark had torn from Lyra\u2019s neck. What caught his eye first was the stone; it was large, about the size of a silver dollar, and worn so long that the surface was perfectly smooth. The shimmering silver-blue was familiar to him: moonstone. The gem was set into a larger disc of white gold that framed the stone in scrollwork. The design put him in mind of his years spent in Scotland. Not a particularly feminine piece, but strong, and for no reason Jaden could really pinpoint it seemed to him that it suited the woman who had left it behind.</p><p>Lyra would no doubt be angry when she discovered her talisman had been forgotten. Before he could think better of it, Jaden closed his hand around the pendant and pocketed it, feeling the faint hum of power given off by the moonstone. He\u2019d been around long enough to know that a powerful artifact such as this should be treated with respect.</p> <p>She was going to want it back. Perhaps he could send it to her, if he could discover where she was from. Or maybe she would come find him, though Jaden didn\u2019t think that was likely. Lyra had made it very clear that she didn\u2019t want to see him again, and considering his reaction to her, maybe that was best.</p><p>No, definitely that was best, he qualified, stroking a thumb over the stone before removing his hand from his pocket and setting off in the opposite direction from Lyra, heading back toward the mansion. Not really home, but a fine place to stay... for now. He would sleep, Jaden decided, and figure out what to do with the she-wolf\u2019s pendant when he awoke. Until then, he would put her out of his mind. His life was troubled enough. He didn\u2019t need to fixate on an unimportant woman who would as soon tear his head off as look at him.</p><p>But he dreamed of her eyes.</p><p>And of the wild, uncontrollable hunger of beasts in the dark.</p><p>Chapter THREE</p> <p>LYRA AWAKENED around noon, sprawled on her bed with the blankets and sheets twisted around her waist. Her head was turned to the side as she lay on her stomach, her arms curled beneath the pillow her head rested on. For a brief instant, she was pleased to greet the day, late though she was. It was justified: yesterday had been spent in a car as she\u2019d headed home, and the night before that had taken a lot out of her.</p><p>But as she recalled, for the millionth time, what exactly that late night had involved, her pleasure at the warm spring sunlight died.</p><p>Her necklace had been on the ground. And she would bet, she\u2019d just bet that vampire bastard had picked it up.</p><p>Lyra gave an irritated little groan and buried her face in her pillow. One hand went instinctively to her throat, hoping against hope to feel the smooth metal of her mother\u2019s talisman. But no. Her birthright, a symbol of her position and full of warm memories of her mother, was back in Massachusetts, probably displayed prominently in Jaden\u2019s bedroom or coffin or whatever vamps like him used for a sleep space. And once her father realized she\u2019d lost it, she was in for an ass-kicking of epic proportions.</p><p>A soft knock at her door had her cringing. He was checking on her. Of course he was. Dorien Black seemed to think his only child was headed right over the edge of the Cliffs of Insanity, especially once he\u2019d figured out she\u2019d thrown her hat in the ring for the Proving. She knew he was waiting for her to back off and withdraw, to either find a mate who would fight in her stead or to throw her support behind one of the other \u201cviable\u201d candidates. Like her cousin.</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth. Her father had made it very clear, along with just about everyone else in the pack, that she\u2019d thrown a major wrench in the works by refusing to step back. Too damn bad. The way she figured it, the position was hers to lose. And if things kept going so badly, she knew she very well might. But nothing worth fighting for was easy.</p> <p>His voice, warm, familiar, and still beloved despite everything, came through a crack he opened in the door.</p><p>\u201cLyra? You feeling all right, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad,\u201d Lyra said, clearing her throat when she heard how ragged her voice sounded. \u201cYou might as well come in.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Dorien walked in to sit at the edge of her bed while Lyra scooted up into a sitting position and pulled her knees into her chest. In that moment, she felt like she was eight years old again, waiting to be scolded for misbehaving... likely for fighting with the boys again. Remembering that she\u2019d usually won brought a soft smile to her face, but it was gone as quickly as it had come.</p><p>She was not a child anymore. She was twenty-three, and the ensuing years had been etched onto Dorien\u2019s handsome face. He was still larger than life to her... but no longer infallible. And she would be caught in the ancient, and very sticky, web of werewolf succession unless she figured out a way to tear free. To prove that worthiness didn\u2019t always go hand in hand with a massive male body.</p><p>So far, she wasn\u2019t exactly doing a bang-up job.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s eyes, the same burnished gold as her own, searched her face.</p><p>\u201cSo? You plan on telling me where you were this time?\u201d he finally asked, his voice gruff.</p> <p>Lyra tried for a smile, but she only half succeeded. \u201cDo I ever?\u201d</p><p>Instead of finding it funny, Dorien heaved a sigh so long-suffering that Lyra felt the prickle of guilt. This was partially his fault, she reminded herself. As much as she loved him, he would never take a stand for her and buck tradition. He was a Black, and he was in far too deep to go against what that name meant. And it definitely did not mean training your daughters as warriors.</p><p>\u201cAt least you don\u2019t stink of vampires this time,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you were smart enough, after all we talked about, not to risk so much again.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Lyra\u2019s turn to sigh, but the sound was far more irritated coming from her. \u201cYou talked,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cEvery time I tried, you cut me off. Do you honestly think I would have holed up at a vampire safe house if I\u2019d felt I had any other choice? I needed to get out of here, to get away from all the macho BS. Guys I\u2019ve known my whole life were just about taking one another\u2019s heads off to get near me, Dad! I\u2019m not stupid. They weren\u2019t nearly as interested back before I hit twenty-two and could be mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful girl\u2014er, woman, Lyra,\u201d Dorien said, patting her awkwardly. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance they didn\u2019t notice before.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWhatever. Explain to me why I had to go away to college to get a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very confident, sweetheart. You can be a little intimidating.\u201d</p><p>That made Lyra grin. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m bitchy. Sweet, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo, confident. With a sharp tongue sometimes. You get both from me, so I\u2019m not calling it anything but good.\u201d His humor, which she\u2019d always loved, subsided far too quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt you to give them a chance, Lyra. They\u2019re not boys anymore. But you\u2019ve managed to send them running in the other direction all on your own; they all think you\u2019ve lost your damned mind.\u201d</p><p>Lyra dug her fingers into her hair and glowered at her father. \u201cOh yes. I want to fight in the Proving, so obviously I\u2019m nuts. I\u2019d like a shot at my birthright, but going for it makes me a weak, stupid little she-wolf. You do realize how sexist you sound, right? I\u2019m actually surprised you haven\u2019t tried to shove an arranged marriage down my throat.\u201d</p><p>She saw the mulish expression and knew immediately that he\u2019d thought about it. She growled and threw her head back in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You really think I\u2019d go for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, which is why it hasn\u2019t happened. In some packs, it would have happened as soon as you were of age, so consider yourself lucky. I want you to be able to choose, but you\u2019re not making it easy.\u201d</p><p>Lyra tried hard not to bristle. She loved her father dearly. But once she\u2019d hit her twenty-second year and all hell had broken loose where male werewolves were concerned, it seemed like every conversation had turned into a battle. He wouldn\u2019t get off her case until she had done what was expected of her. Yet there was no way she could in good conscience do what was expected of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman,\u201d she said, trying to keep the bitterness from her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I haven\u2019t run. I\u2019ve heard of that happening in some of the other packs too.\u201d</p><p>But not often, Lyra thought as her father\u2019s eyes reflected the misery he felt she was putting him through. It wasn\u2019t often that an Alpha male had only a single, female child. A strong male son would still have had to go through a Proving, but he would have been trained, prepared, and generally accepted as his father\u2019s Second even before he had to go through the motions. But a daughter... in a patriarchal system like the wolves\u2019, there was no place for a female Alpha.</p><p>Especially when the males were mostly built like linebackers and would sometimes fight to the death to become Alpha.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d wanted to leave, you would have left already,\u201d Dorien said. He sighed again, this time wistfully. \u201cI\u2019d almost rather you\u2019d chosen that, Lyra, instead of the mess you\u2019ve gotten yourself into. But you can\u2019t leave the Thorn any more than I can. This is your place, just like it is mine.\u201d</p><p>She hated that he was right, but he knew her better than anyone. She loved Silver Falls, loved the forest and the hidden clearings, the sound of the running waters deep in the trees. She loved the way the town and the surrounding landscape wore each season, and the way it felt to run on four legs here when the moon was high.</p><p>Moreover, she loved her pack. They were her blood, true relations or no. A number of the women had had a hand in raising her after her mother was killed, women she could still go to with problems when her crusty father just wouldn\u2019t do. Most of the pack loved her, as well, Lyra knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if a lot of them now thought she must be crazy, suicidal, or both.</p><p>She looked down, plucking at the comforter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay here! You keep running off the way you do, you\u2019re going to get hurt. I try to keep things sane here, Lyra. The Thorn have worked very hard at not being the savages our kind is seen as. But some of your suitors are going to use any means to get at you, and you know that!\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, recognizing the riff from so many of their arguments lately. \u201cDad, I\u2019ve got suitors from every pack in the eastern US sniffing at my heels. Some of whom, I will have you know, have gotten plenty aggressive on our own territory. And off of it,\u201d she added, thinking of Mark. His pack was neighbor to her own, and the two groups congregated from time to time. She hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to see him again, but the chances of that sort of luck were slim to none.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s expression turned thunderous as his protective instinct kicked in. \u201cWho\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Lyra interjected, cutting him off. Dorien\u2019s face said that it damn well did matter, but Lyra didn\u2019t really want to get into it. Instead, she continued, \u201cI have no intention of picking up some stray loser who wants me just because I\u2019m an Alpha\u2019s daughter, Dad. I don\u2019t like being the way in. Especially because when it comes to being your Second, I\u2019m the best candidate this pack has. I learned from you, even if you weren\u2019t trying to teach me.\u201d</p><p>Dorien reached out, tucking a wild curl behind her ear with a tenderness that made Lyra want to weep. She knew this was killing him. But if she didn\u2019t step up, Eric would surely become the new Alpha to the pack. If her father was traditional with welcome little dashes of forward thinking\u2014a little old-fashioned but beloved\u2014her cousin was conservative with a capital \u201cC,\u201d an authoritarian puritan isolationist with a massive stick up his ass. Sideways.</p><p>Not only would he not move the Thorn forward, he seemed destined to push the pack back at least a hundred years. It was something Lyra couldn\u2019t bear to endure. Not when she had so many ideas to bring the Thorn into the twenty-first century... even if they came kicking and screaming. It was adapt or die out. Sadly, with the pack shrinking in recent years, the latter had begun to be whispered about as a possibility.</p> <p>There would have to be a female Alpha somewhere eventually, she reasoned. A new voice, a new point of view. Why not here?</p><p>Why not her?</p><p>Her father seemed to have plenty of ideas on that subject himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you one last time, Lyra. Step back. There\u2019s no shame in withdrawing from the Proving. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if the other males will consent to fight you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to,\u201d Lyra replied. \u201cI looked it up in the histories. I\u2019m to be treated just like the male candidates.\u201d</p><p>Dorien\u2019s brows went up. \u201cI don\u2019t recall that in the histories, though it\u2019s been a while since I had to look to them. When was this?\u201d</p> <p>Lyra felt her shoulders beginning to hunch defensively and forced herself to straighten. \u201cIn 1759. Pack of the Broken Arrow. There was a female wolf in that Proving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd... well, she didn\u2019t succeed, but she made it pretty far.\u201d</p><p>He zeroed in immediately on what she wasn\u2019t saying. \u201cHow was she treated when she fell, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I... I think it was something like being torn apart by the remaining candidates once she\u2019d fallen.\u201d Lyra mumbled it as quickly as she could, but Dorien\u2019s sharp intake of breath indicated he\u2019d heard her just fine.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lyra!\u201d he snapped, his patience for her obviously already exhausted for the day. \u201cThis can\u2019t end well. You\u2019ll get that, or worse, especially with your cousin likely to lead the pack! I\u2019m not going to be able to save you either. Do you understand that? No one will!\u201d</p><p>Lyra did understand, better than he knew. She thought of Mark, the determination in his eyes, his strength. A single wolf, and she couldn\u2019t even manage him. No amount of bravado was going to make up for her limitations in strength and size, and Lyra knew it. But there had to be a way. Jaden appeared in her mind\u2019s eye, taking Mark out in a series of quick moves that looked effortless. It wasn\u2019t exactly inspiring, considering she couldn\u2019t move like a vampire and likely never would. But Jaden had used something other than raw power to win, and that was encouraging... if she could find a way to emulate it.</p><p>Lyra was tough. No one in the pack would argue that. But she hadn\u2019t been trained to fight like the males. She\u2019d had to pick that up herself. Dorien\u2019s refusal to teach her still cut deep.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. I always do,\u201d Lyra said. What else could she say? She had no plan, and she certainly had no one willing to help her. But every time she considered backing down from what seemed an increasingly untenable position, she thought of the silent, humorless figure of her cousin. His stark view of right and wrong, his unnerving ability to quote whole passages from the histories of any given year and then apply it to a given situation made her nervous, to say the least. Hell, he made a lot of people nervous. To be born without a sense of humor wasn\u2019t normal. And then there were the things Simon had told her he\u2019d heard about him. If even a small amount of those rumors were true, her quiet, creepy cousin had plenty of ugliness lurking just beneath the surface.</p><p>Eric Black had always put her hackles up. But as it stood, he would be Second unless she found a way to stop it. And he would be the ruin of the pack.</p><p>Dorien dragged a hand through russet-colored waves of hair only slightly touched with gray and looked upward, as though the mystical wolf gods themselves might descend from on high to help with his unruly daughter.</p><p>\u201cI know it seems unfair to you,\u201d he said, and Lyra could hear the way he tried to modulate his tone, to hide the fear and anger running beneath them. \u201cBut like it or not, we survive through strength and ferocity. The vampires have it in for us, and half the damned time we have it in for each other. The pack looks to the Alpha to be the strongest of all. You\u2019re plenty strong, and very clever, Lyra. But physically, you couldn\u2019t take down even the larger males in our own pack. That matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could learn if you\u2019d train me properly. Any human would think this is bullshit. They treat their women as equals,\u201d Lyra snapped, hating the old argument, the one that always seemed to poison their conversations anymore.</p><p>\u201cThe humans don\u2019t have to live by fang and claw the way we do!\u201d Dorien snarled. \u201cAnd my training you wouldn\u2019t have done a bit of good. You versus a two-hundred-pound wolf, each of you fighting the same, is never going to come out in your favor. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Lyra snapped. Dorien dug his fingers into his hair and looked like he wanted to bite something.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lyra, why can\u2019t you just accept the way things are instead of fighting so hard?\u201d He stopped, closed his eyes, and collected himself. It was an action Lyra had seen plenty of times when she was the subject of his discussion. She knew he was counting to ten so he didn\u2019t blow. Sure enough, when his eyes opened, his voice had softened, though it was thick with emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen a Proving, sweetheart. You think you can be ready for it, but no one ever is. All you\u2019ll have is your wits and brute strength. You\u2019ve got the first in spades, but the other...\u201d He trailed off for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI already lost your mother. Don\u2019t you leave me too.\u201d</p><p>It hurt her. And it made Lyra angry, because he knew it hurt her, even though he meant it. When she focused on the latter, Lyra managed to cool off a little. But as far as bending, she just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFemale or not, tradition or not, Alpha is my birthright,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s in my blood. If I give up, the Thorn will get Eric. You know it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dorien exhaled loudly through his nose. He looked at her, and the bleakness in his eyes brought on a fresh wave of guilt despite her best efforts. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard a word I said, have you? You can\u2019t win. Rules are rules, and if Eric wins the Proving I\u2019ll take him. He\u2019s a Black, and he\u2019s got the strength to prove it. I know he\u2019s a bit... dour. It\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s my brother\u2019s boy sometimes... Gerik would be sad, I think, to know how he came up with Mara\u2019s family. But I can work with him, mold him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a waste of a werewolf, and there\u2019ll be no changing him,\u201d Lyra burst out. \u201cHe\u2019s so obsessed with rules that he can\u2019t see the benefit of change. He wants everything to stay the same, harsh punishment for anyone who bucks the system... and besides that, he\u2019s twisted.\u201d</p><p>Dorien looked at her sharply. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that. I\u2019ve heard whisperings, same as you, Lyra, but there\u2019s never been any proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time you have proof that he enjoys hunting human women in his spare time, the humans will be on our doorstep,\u201d Lyra snapped. \u201cAnd if you want to talk about running off, he\u2019s made himself pretty scarce lately too. So the solution is to hand him the pack on a silver platter? At least I still care, even if I\u2019ve had to put my life on hold because of these stupid traditions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make the Thorn; I only keep it, Lyra. You\u2019ve heard it for enough years to know how it works. Eric will win the Proving on his own merits or not,\u201d Dorien said, rising from the bed. \u201cAnd as for you, better a life on hold than over.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door, but Lyra\u2019s question stopped him in his tracks. She knew Dorien had been hoping that her signing up for the Proving had been a stunt, a way of expressing her anger with pack tradition when it came to the relentless marginalizing of their women. So she decided to let him know she meant it.</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to try and stop me from competing?\u201d she asked. A simple question, but a loaded one. Lyra tensed in anticipation of his answer. A great deal rode on this. And if he said yes, then she knew she might have no options but leaving. The very idea was like a knife in her heart. Still, if she couldn\u2019t be free to choose her destiny here, then life was too short to stay encased in amber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His shoulders slumped, making Dorien look every one of his forty-five years.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said without turning around. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you, Lyra. Just know that if you do this, I won\u2019t be able to save you. No matter what happens. At the Proving, I have to be Alpha first and a father second. I must uphold the law. Some traditions really can\u2019t be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to prove I can do this,\u201d Lyra replied, feeling a little desperate to gain even a bit of support. He was her father. It would mean everything to know he was rooting for her, if only silently. \u201cHave some faith in me. Just a little. Please?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He turned his head to the side, and the small smile he gave her was sad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about faith,\u201d he said. Then he left the room without another word. Lyra watched him go, watched the door shut behind him, and then put her head in her hands and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>JADEN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING in here all by yourself? Hiding?\u201d</p> <p>Jaden looked up, startled by the warm female voice that cut smoothly through the silence he\u2019d been sitting in for the better part of an hour. His first thought was to hide the necklace he\u2019d been toying with, but it was already too late for that. He\u2019d assumed no one would bother him, since apart from the fact that he wasn\u2019t known for being a particularly friendly cat, this was one of the rooms in the mansion that hadn\u2019t been renovated yet. No television, and nothing of interest except for some hideous floral furniture, meant solitude. Usually.</p><p>He should have known better.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. You\u2019re brooding,\u201d Lily said, narrowing her eyes when she leaned into the room to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brooding,\u201d Jaden grumbled, curling his fingers around the pendant and pulling it in toward his body. \u201cYour husband broods. I\u2019m just... thinking.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at the necklace disappearing into his fist, but didn\u2019t seem inclined to say anything about it. Yet. Instead, she walked in, settled herself on the ugly couch across from his chair, and smiled at him. That smile went a long way toward smoothing his ruffled fur, Jaden had to admit. And of course, she knew it would.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all sure he liked how quickly she\u2019d figured him out.</p> <p>\u201cDeflection, hmm? Interesting. Yes, Ty broods. But he\u2019s usually got a good reason for it. And it\u2019s fun to tease him out of his moods.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, Jaden, but I don\u2019t think the methods that work with Ty are really appropriate for this situation, so you\u2019re going to have to just tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to lean on her, Jaden thought. He\u2019d liked her from the start, and the ever-increasing numbers of Cait Sith showing up on her doorstep to become a part of her dynasty seemed to agree. In the past, there were a few moments when Jaden had wished she\u2019d been meant for him, that he\u2019d been the one sent to find her. Lily was a beauty, and as strong as they came. But she and Ty were perfectly matched, and Jaden had never seen his old friend so disgustingly happy.</p><p>He was glad for them. He should be happy here too, but instead he felt a gnawing ache in his gut. Why couldn\u2019t he just be happy?</p><p>Lily frowned suddenly as something occurred to her. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Ptolemy again, is it? I\u2019ve got Ty recruiting more guards, but it\u2019s a slower process than I\u2019d like, and the Council seems determined not to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not helping because they would like you, and all of us, to go away. We don\u2019t belong in the club, Lily. It\u2019s easier for them if the Lilim are smothered in their infancy while they\u2019re turning a blind eye.\u201d</p><p>Lily swore softly, making Jaden smile. Such a sweet thing shouldn\u2019t have such a foul vocabulary. He was sure that he and Ty had been bad influences.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I know you\u2019re right,\u201d Lily said, shaking her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this would be easy, but I never imagined that the Council would be so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHostile?\u201d Jaden supplied. \u201cThese are men and women who\u2019ve actively participated in the suppression of mixed bloods for centuries. They may not go out of their way to hurt us\u2014most of them\u2014but they certainly won\u2019t help us if we\u2019re sinking.\u201d He leaned back and looked at Lily. She looked very young, and very vulnerable, in that moment. It made him wish he hadn\u2019t just used his dagger on that traitor Nero\u2019s head.</p> <p>He should have taken Arsin\u00f6e that night, and saved all of them this trouble. Whatever Ptolemy might have taken her place, there would be no threat anywhere near as great as the ancient queen. Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s grudge wasn\u2019t about her dynasty\u2019s liberated slaves anymore. She\u2019d been humiliated. And she would make the Lilim pay until she was satisfied.</p><p>Lily rubbed one hand restlessly over the frayed fabric on the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever anyone thinks, if we catch any more Ptolemy slinking around here, I swear I\u2019m dragging Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s ass before the Council. I may be new, but that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to pick off my people because she\u2019s angry and down a few hundred slaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out looking nights,\u201d Jaden said, \u201cand I haven\u2019t seen anything. It\u2019s been a month since the last sighting. Maybe they\u2019ve knocked it off.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t believe it, and he saw Lily didn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stick closer to the house and not go wandering around alone,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI worry.\u201d</p><p>He understood her concern, and it touched him. But Ptolemy scouts would keep circling Tipton like the vultures they were, and Cait Sith would keep disappearing, one by one. At some point, there would be another confrontation. He just hoped it wasn\u2019t soon. Lily, powerful though she was, wasn\u2019t ready. And Jaden, though he hadn\u2019t said anything to anyone, was concerned that he\u2019d escaped one prison only to find himself in a more comfortable one of his own making.</p><p>The scars they\u2019d left him with were never going to be enough. Was there a list of defectors to be hauled back or destroyed? He would guess there was. Arsin\u00f6e was focused about her grudges. And Jaden was quite sure that the Ptolemy queen wanted his death.</p><p>It would likely get a lot messier before things settled down.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Lily. You shouldn\u2019t worry. But for what it\u2019s worth, I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather know you were safe than appreciative,\u201d Lily said, then heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cI swear the Council wants to see me and Arsin\u00f6e in some kind of steel-cage death match and just solve it that way. Two-thousand-year-old bitch.\u201d</p><p>Jaden couldn\u2019t help his smile. \u201cI\u2019d pay to see it. My money would be on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was as confident about that,\u201d she said with a wry smile. \u201cI never thought this would be easy, but... well, it\u2019s definitely not easy. Anyway, enough of my complaining. I\u2019m glad this isn\u2019t about the Ptolemy.\u201d She tucked her hair behind her ear, and Jaden could actually feel her honing in on him. Inwardly, he cursed. She was like a dog with a bone over things she wanted, or wanted to know.</p><p>It was funny when he wasn\u2019t the target.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve stumped me. What is it? What\u2019s making you look like you\u2019re staring into the face of impending doom?\u201d She drew the last word out dramatically, trying to soften him up, Jaden knew. But it wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He hedged. \u201cSince when does me wanting to be by myself mean anything\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d Lily said, angling her head at him, \u201cI know you. You have degrees of unapproachable, and you\u2019ve been way above baseline for two nights running. Does this have something to do with that necklace you\u2019re doing a lousy job of hiding?\u201d</p><p>Jaden felt his jaw tighten, his muscles tense. She knew. Of course she knew; this was Lily. But how could he talk about it when he didn\u2019t even understand exactly how he felt?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding it. It\u2019s just... something I found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Lily considered him, and he fought the urge to squirm under the scrutiny. She was an unnervingly perceptive creature, and becoming a vampire only seemed to have intensified the fact. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find it in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Lily exhaled loudly, her patience with him finally strained. \u201cJames Dennis Harrison,\u201d she said irritably. \u201cJust tell me where you got the damned necklace or I\u2019ll come over there and get it. And don\u2019t think I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Jaden cringed at the sound of his given name and rued the day she\u2019d wheedled it out of him. He\u2019d left that name behind with his old life. Its stodginess had never suited him anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember where I picked it up. Off the ground, I suppose,\u201d Jaden said, his voice taking on a growly edge. When Lily simply arched one slim brow, he hunched reflexively, feeling like a child who\u2019d been caught doing something naughty. She tapped long fingernails on the arm of the couch and waited silently. Jaden was slightly ashamed at how quickly he broke.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of\u2014I helped a woman out of a tight spot last night. This got left behind, and I picked it up. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>Her knowing smile was almost worse than the prying.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of brooding. Never mind, then.\u201d She stood, surprising him. He\u2019d figured she would stick around to harass him for a while longer. He found it a sign of how twisted he\u2019d become when he realized he didn\u2019t actually feel like being left alone after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of brooding?\u201d Jaden asked, puzzled. \u201cDo you think you might enlighten me before you wander off? Because I don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary here.\u201d</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes, hand on her hip, looking for a moment like an irritated teenager. \u201cJaden. Helping out humans isn\u2019t a habit of yours, not that I\u2019ve noticed. So you save this woman, she drops a necklace, I find you sitting up here mooning over it, and you think your rotten mood is... mysterious to me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened his mouth to give her a smart reply, but nothing came. Instead, he had to settle for a chagrined, \u201cWell, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are. I was looking for both of you.\u201d</p><p>Jaden took one look at Ty MacGillivray\u2019s long, rangy form striding in the door and had to bite back a groan. Instead of solitude, he now had a party. If he decided to stick around Tipton for much longer... and that was still a big if in his mind... he was really going to have to get his own place.</p> <p>Naturally, Ty didn\u2019t seem bothered at all by the extra company. Being with Lily had changed him from the solitary, humorless man he\u2019d been for so long, consumed only with survival and staying indispensible to the Ptolemy queen. His natural intensity had remained, but Lily had softened him and brought out a good humor and playfulness that still amazed Jaden.</p><p>\u201cNot interrupting an illicit tryst or anything, am I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lily\u2019s smile was slow and warm as she looked at her husband. \u201cPretty much.\u201d She strolled over and wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cGo away, you\u2019re killing the mood.\u201d</p><p>Jaden watched the two of them, the way they fit together. He\u2019d never had that. Nothing even close after two hundred years of living. Some of it was being a Cait Sith, of course... female vampires weren\u2019t exactly clamoring to hook up with Ptolemy slaves... but some of it was just him. He\u2019d never had a woman he was so hungry for, never met one he couldn\u2019t walk away from.</p><p>Until that night at Rogan\u2019s. But that couldn\u2019t possibly be the same thing\u2014</p> <p>\u201cHell, you\u2019re brooding,\u201d Ty remarked when he finally turned his attention to Jaden, his musical Scottish burr rolling out the last word and making Jaden seriously consider walking out of the room and leaving Ty and Lily to make love on the ugly furniture or whatever they did when they were alone.</p><p>Actually, he was pretty positive about what they did when they were alone, and that didn\u2019t make him feel any better right this second.</p><p>Jaden started to say something snide, but Lily cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through that already. Jaden isn\u2019t brooding. He\u2019s thinking. And since I already told him I\u2019d leave him to it, I\u2019ve got to go make a few phone calls. If we\u2019re going to petition the Council for our own territory any time in the near future, we\u2019ve got to get a little more organized.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Dracul, I\u2019d have to ask the Shades for help. That\u2019d look good... not that it probably matters at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien could probably set that up for you,\u201d Jaden said with a smile, referring to his blood brother who had eschewed slavery to the Ptolemy in favor of a career as a thief and assassin with the notorious House of Shadows. \u201cHe\u2019s in good with the Shade Master. And they know all sorts of things about the highbloods you could use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the wrong things,\u201d Lily replied. \u201cI\u2019m not into blackmail. And I\u2019d hate to have to start checking our blood supply for poison. Anyway, duty calls. Later.\u201d She gave Ty a quick kiss, waved at Jaden, and headed to her office downstairs.</p> <p>Ty watched her go, his heart in his silver eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tired,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDamn Arsin\u00f6e. Lily saving her life wasn\u2019t enough. She\u2019s still got to prove hers is the only dynasty that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get taken care of,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cOne way or another. We both know it.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a short nod, then turned back to look at Jaden. Jaden saw immediately that Lily wasn\u2019t the only one who looked a little tired, and for a vampire, that was a feat. He shouldn\u2019t be here causing them more worry, Jaden thought. Out of sight, out of mind. Or further from their minds, at least. They had enough to deal with, and everyone expected he was high up on Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s hit list.</p><p>Maybe it would be best to skip town for a while.</p><p>\u201cSo whose ass do we need to kick?\u201d Ty asked, relaxing a little as he sauntered further into the room.</p><p>Jaden looked at the ceiling and chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s. Though you and your wife are so ready for it, I ought to just make something up so you can run off and fight for my honor.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden was slightly more comfortable talking with Ty about this, only because the man was as good as a real brother to him. Ty had taken Jaden under his wing early on in Jaden\u2019s days with the Ptolemy. He would understand the difficulties inherent in the situation, where Lily, still so new to their world, would not. There were such deep divisions between night races. He was almost sorry Lily would have to learn them and then try to navigate the minefield they presented. She had enough minefields right now. Maybe it was better she not learn the truth of the necklace\u2019s origins. The truth would only bring her trouble, and trouble was the last thing Jaden wanted for her.</p><p>She and Ty were family to him, Jaden realized. He\u2019d forgotten what a blessing and a curse having such a thing could be.</p><p>Jaden looked back at Ty, at his earnest concern, and began to relent. \u201cIf I tell you, will you leave me be?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s answer was succinct. \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d</p><p>Jaden didn\u2019t bother to hide his smile, though he was certain it looked as weary as he felt these past two nights. \u201cAt least you\u2019re honest about it. Fine, then. When I was out last night I ran into a woman who was being given a... bit of a rough time by a man she didn\u2019t want anything to do with. I took care of the problem for her, and she was, let\u2019s say, less than appreciative. She left in a huff and forgot the stupid bastard had thrown her necklace on the ground. So now I have it.\u201d</p><p>Ty held out his hand. \u201cHmm. Let\u2019s have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he handed over the disc and chain, wondering whether Ty might recognize it. His friend studied it, turning it over in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite old. Older than I am, at any rate, and probably valuable. Not the kind of thing you\u2019d see someone wearing every day. And you already know all of this, of course.\u201d He lifted his eyes to meet Jaden\u2019s, and Jaden could see the question in them. \u201cMoonstone, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and with good reason.\u201d</p><p>Jaden was relieved to find that his fears about revealing what sort of woman the necklace had come from had been unfounded. Ty might be a dangerous man, but he wasn\u2019t judgmental, even in this. Mainly, he looked puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou took it upon yourself to help a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>Jaden nodded. \u201cFor some ungodly reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder she didn\u2019t appreciate it. Brutish lot, even the women. I\u2019m surprised she hadn\u2019t ripped the male\u2019s throat out herself. I\u2019m not going to bother asking what you were thinking, but what the hell was she doing here? There isn\u2019t a wolf pack that I\u2019m aware of for miles.\u201d</p><p>Ty handed the necklace back, and Jaden was ashamed at the rush of relief he felt to have it in his hands again. The metal warmed against his palm quickly. The fact that the pendant had rested against Lyra\u2019s skin, probably many times, fascinated him. Holding on to it was as close as he might ever get to touching her again. She was so warm... and he was so cold...</p><p>\u201cAs you might imagine, she wasn\u2019t in the mood for conversation. I think she was a little embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t managed to deal with her admirer herself, actually.\u201d He paused, wondering whether to reveal the rest of the story. At this point, it could hardly hurt, and Ty would keep it to himself. \u201cI recognized her,\u201d Jaden continued. \u201cFrom Rogan\u2019s, when you and I were there with Lily.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s dark brows winged up, and he sank down to perch on the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cThat pretty she-wolf? The one you hated on sight?\u201d To Jaden\u2019s surprise, Ty started laughing. \u201cNo wonder she was angry. That would have been adding insult to injury. You\u2019ve got a sick sense of humor, brother. Now I understand why you helped her. Though there has to be a better way of entertaining yourself around here.\u201d</p><p>Jaden forced a chuckle, unsure whether he was glad to have kept the heart of his secret. He wished he could have spoken to someone with a similar experience, but one didn\u2019t just wander around asking random vampires whether they\u2019d ever been possessed by the desire to get naked with a werewolf.</p><p>He\u2019d had his ass kicked a time or two for lesser offenses. That one would find his head and his body residing in different parts of the country.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why she was here, though. It\u2019s possible her pack doesn\u2019t know that the Lilim are set up here, at least for now. Then again, she could still just be running from... whatever it was that had her at Rogan\u2019s, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Jaden nodded. \u201cIt definitely looked like she was here on her own. Whatever problems had her holed up at a vampire safe house last October seem to have followed her right along. Annoying her was an amusing side benefit, but trust me, I wouldn\u2019t have jumped in if Lyra hadn\u2019t been in serious danger of losing more than her pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I remember Rogan mentioning her name at some point. And he was pissed off about you giving her a hard time too. I think he said she was an Alpha\u2019s daughter or something like that. Mentioned she was a probable pack leader too, though I don\u2019t see how. The wolves aren\u2019t much on female Alphas. Or female anything.\u201d He looked in the direction Lily had gone. \u201cThey\u2019re missing out. Not that they\u2019d know it, bunch of hairy savages that they are. It should scare everyone that there are places in this country where they blend in so well, since those attitudes don\u2019t change in their human skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve always found refuges,\u201d Jaden replied with a shrug. \u201cJust as we have. And I agree, I\u2019m not keen on running into a wolf pack. From what I saw with Lyra, things are just as backward among them as they ever were. Still, I don\u2019t feel right hanging on to this. I do think she\u2019s an Alpha\u2019s daughter. Actually, that seemed to be the attraction where the other furry bastard was concerned. But this is something important to her family. She didn\u2019t lose it on purpose, and considering that she might get in serious trouble over it, it just seems like...\u201d He trailed off, frowning at the necklace in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I can mail it to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That wasn\u2019t what he wanted, though. He wanted to see her again. Everything he\u2019d thought about werewolves, everything he\u2019d been told, didn\u2019t seem to mesh with the tough, confident beauty he\u2019d saved against her will. And in the back of his mind, the memories of a couple of centuries of being thought a veritable savage because of his own bloodline were very fresh. Werewolves and vampires were apples and oranges, of course, but he couldn\u2019t shake the parallels. Nor could he forget the way she had melted against him, vulnerable for just a moment, only a breath away from tasting.</p><p>It was a few moments before he realized Ty was watching him closely with an odd expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right? That there isn\u2019t something more to this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat more could there be?\u201d Jaden replied, a bit more gruffly than he normally would have. He tucked the necklace into the back pocket of his jeans, hoping that having it out of his hands would improve his mental state a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You just seem... odd over this.\u201d</p><p>Jaden reached for an explanation and found one that was actually part of the truth. \u201cI was whipped simply for being what I am, Ty,\u201d Jaden said, referring to the long scars that still scored the length of his back. \u201cI\u2019ll carry the marks for the rest of my life, or forever, whichever comes first. I don\u2019t like to think of Lyra Black being punished this way, or possibly some worse way, for losing something that was torn off her while she was being threatened in the worst possible way. You know what her father probably is.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lip curled in disgust, and Jaden saw that he did indeed remember. The two of them had taken down an Alpha just once, when Arsin\u00f6e had grown tired of the Alpha\u2019s pack\u2019s constant encroachment on her territory. The leader of the Pack of the Nine Trees had been a beast in both forms, a slobbering hulk with several unhappy wives and, if the rumors were true, a taste for human flesh. Jaden had never forgotten the eyes of the ragged women of the pack.</p><p>In sharp contrast, Lyra\u2019s eyes had been full of fire. But that meant nothing. Her spirit would obviously be a hard one to break.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Ty reached over and gave Jaden a rough pat on the shoulder. \u201cIf you\u2019re that worried about her well-being, Jaden, go deliver it in person. Even if she\u2019s got two black eyes, she\u2019ll probably spit in your face when you hand it to her. You can\u2019t change what she is or how her kind lives. But go. I can see you won\u2019t rest until you\u2019ve done it, and you\u2019re no help to anyone here when you\u2019re this miserable.\u201d</p><p>Jaden cocked his head, catching the insinuation beneath Ty\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cDo you need my help for something?\u201d Jaden asked.</p><p>Ty sighed and rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cLily needs to assemble an actual court, and a good guard. She\u2019s been putting it off, but we can\u2019t keep running this place like a boarding house, and no matter how much she wants the Lilim to be modern and free and easy, there are certain things that need to be in place. Not only for her to be taken seriously, but also to keep her safe. Vlad and I have both been working on her, and she\u2019s finally started to relent.\u201d</p><p>Jaden tensed. \u201cBecause of the Ptolemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and Damien let her know that there are a lot of highbloods asking the House of Shadows for information on her weaknesses. At this point, she has plenty.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden sighed. He had worried about this. Lily was on a steep learning curve, even with the help of Ty and him, as well as the support of the Dracul. Every house would be looking for an angle to exploit to chip away at the legitimacy of what they were making. Highbloods weren\u2019t fond of making room for others in their rarified little world.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you need from me?\u201d Jaden asked. Had he really thought he was being freed? He had just traded one set of responsibilities for another. Though at least with the Lilim, he didn\u2019t run quite as high a risk of being killed for screwing up.</p><p>\u201cLily wants you to help choose the guard,\u201d Ty said. \u201cYou and me both. I\u2019m not comfortable without extra input anyway, and it\u2019s what we both know. Vlad has a better eye for loyal courtiers, so he\u2019ll help her on that end. And... don\u2019t run screaming, but I think she has an idea you\u2019d do quite a job as her Captain of the Guard.\u201d</p><p>Jaden winced, though he was flattered along with the horror of such a proposition. \u201cCaptain? Is she crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she is, then so am I. I agreed with her when she brought it up, as it\u2019s something I\u2019d considered as well. You\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of talent as a hunter, as a fighter, and you know how to train others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just be a lazy courtier and sit around here on my ass?\u201d</p><p>Ty angled his head and gave him a knowing look. \u201cThat\u2019s basically what you\u2019ve been doing, and you\u2019re miserable. You like having a job. This would be a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaden stammered, taken a little aback by the revelation. Everything Ty had said was true, but Jaden wasn\u2019t sure he ever wanted to be tethered to a dynasty again. Even one he respected. Moreover, being responsible for Lily\u2019s safety when he knew damn well the long knives would be out for her was a daunting thought. Still, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to reject it outright.</p> <p>Ty, at least, seemed to understand his quandary. He stood up, preparing to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide right now. I\u2019m telling you so you can think it over while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Jaden frowned. \u201cWhile I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded with a half smile. \u201cThe guard can wait a few days. Go deliver your necklace, satisfy your curiosity about this woman, and then come home. You can tell me what you want to do then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not curious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the hell you\u2019re not,\u201d Ty snorted. \u201cBut you need to see that Lyra Black is a typical werewolf from a typical pack, for whatever reason. And after that you\u2019ll be begging to meet the trio of pretty Cait Sith who just came into town. So go. The Blacks have always led the Pack of the Thorn. I can tell you how to get to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d was all Jaden could say. Inside, however, his slow-beating heart had assumed a rhythm that was almost human. He would see Lyra again, come what may. And then maybe, hopefully, he could work out why his head had been full of nothing but her for months.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works. You can spend the rest of the evening figuring out how to see her without the rest of the pack tearing you apart,\u201d Ty said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask how I knew where they were. I had a nasty run-in with the Thorn in last year\u2019s travels. A tip: I would avoid being a cat among them as much as possible. That crew has a high prey drive no matter what form they\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Jaden replied, already feeling a little uneasy about the wisdom of a lone vampire heading into a pack\u2019s stronghold. Ty was right, however. Jaden would never be happy unless he followed his instincts.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so. Come on. We can butt in and use Lily\u2019s computer. She likes the company.\u201d</p><p>Jaden rose to follow without another word, grateful that he had friends who would help him even in this, and hoping that his curiosity wasn\u2019t finally going to do him in after all.</p><p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>JADEN DIDN\u2019T KNOW what he\u2019d expected as he drove into Silver Falls, New York, but it wasn\u2019t what he was seeing so far. He\u2019d imagined an off-the-beaten-path hillbilly haven, full of rusted-out pickups on blocks, trailers with tires on the roofs, and the occasional sad-looking specimen of livestock hanging out in someone\u2019s front yard. Instead, he\u2019d driven through a quaint downtown and navigated streets lined with mostly well-kept homes dating from the Victorian era all the way up to the present. There were no grizzled locals giving he and his \u2019Vette the stink eye, no roving bands of barely human werewolves patrolling for intruders like himself. And best of all, he hadn\u2019t caught so much as a hint of wolf musk as he\u2019d driven around.</p><p>Maybe it was a smaller pack than Ty thought, Jaden reasoned as he made the final turn onto what the GPS told him was Lyra\u2019s street. Maybe it was just a handful of mangy stragglers bound together and trying to hang on to their only item of value. He\u2019d never heard of werewolves taking up residence in such pretty environs, at least. Silver Falls wasn\u2019t terribly far from Syracuse, nestled more in the middle of the state among the Finger Lakes. Like many of the towns in the area, it was picturesque and surrounded by beautiful landscape that was just awakening from another long New York winter. The town did sit by itself, probably fifteen miles in any direction from another one. That part made sense.</p><p>But the charming Craftsman with the inviting front porch he pulled up in front of didn\u2019t make any sense at all.</p><p>The Alpha wolf of the Pack of the Thorn, a pack that according to Ty was known for its ferocity, lived here?</p><p>Jaden killed the engine and sat for a moment, trying to absorb the fact that not only was the house immaculate, but someone who lived there obviously liked to garden. He had a hard time picturing Lyra as that person. Her mother, maybe? And what sort of woman would have given birth to a fiery thing like Lyra? He supposed he was about to find out, if he could work up the nerve.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I could outfight a pack of werewolves if I needed to,\u201d Jaden grumbled. He hated the way he felt, all twisted up with nerves like some pathetic teenager. He hadn\u2019t been one of those in over two hundred years, and he had no intention of revisiting his adolescence. Jaden jerked the keys from the ignition and got out of the car.</p><p>Immediately, he realized his mistake, but it was far too late to do anything but stand there and try desperately to acclimate before he lost his mind.</p><p>The scent of werewolf was everywhere.</p><p>Jaden had no idea how he had missed it. Maybe he\u2019d had the air in the car set to recirculate. Certainly he should have rolled down a window a while ago to acclimate slowly, because this was a shock to his system. The air he breathed, the breeze that ruffled his hair, everything in this place smelled of wolf. And the cat inside of him wanted, no, demanded that he dive back into the car and get out of town as fast as possible. Jaden only barely swallowed back a pained yowl. His muscles seemed frozen, and beads of sweat broke out on his brow. His breath came in shallow little sips. All his senses screamed that he was surrounded by the enemy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He might have run for it, might not have been able to help it, except that at that moment he saw Lyra through one of the front windows. She paid no attention to the outside, instead looking lost in her own thoughts as she wandered into the room, stooped to pick something up, and then left.</p><p>Instantly, Jaden was transfixed. The smell, the fear, all faded away into the background, then vanished. He didn\u2019t stop to question why. All he could think about was Lyra, her wild hair tumbling around her shoulders, her face drawn and tight, as though she had a great deal to worry about.</p><p>Maybe he could help relieve some small part of that worry.</p> <p>Jaden reached into his jacket pocket, gave her necklace a quick squeeze for luck, and with a deep breath, headed up the stone steps.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect for one another. Damn it, Simon, tell her!\u201d</p><p>Lyra stopped pacing to glare at her father. It was lost on him, however. He was too busy begging Simon to marry her. She would have been embarrassed, but Simon looked mortified enough for both of them.</p><p>\u201cI can hear you just fine, thanks,\u201d Lyra said finally. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not getting married. Not now, and possibly not ever,\u201d she added pointedly, shooting a warning look at the friend who sat stiffly on the couch, looking as though he would rather be anywhere but here. Simon Dale had been her closest friend since they were children, and she knew that if push came to shove and her father leaned hard enough, he would give in and try whatever facsimile of wooing Simon was capable of.</p><p>She tried to stay away from that part of his life, but she\u2019d caught glimpses. What she\u2019d seen didn\u2019t bode well. What some girls called \u201cawkwardly charming\u201d usually just looked awkward to her, and Simon was the poster boy. Cute... but clueless. And damn it, he was wavering already.</p> <p>Gods, she was tired of overbearing males.</p><p>Simon scrubbed a hand through his already tousled crop of chocolate-brown hair and looked at her with big, soulful eyes of gold-flecked green hazel. As friends, they had always been an excellent match: he was calm where she was fiery; he was thoughtful where she was brash. They\u2019d decided long ago, however, that they were unsuited to be anything more.</p><p>She had the sudden urge to plug her ears.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lyra,\u201d Simon said, \u201che has a point. It doesn\u2019t have to be some stranger. There are plenty of guys right here who would be happy to protect you, and it\u2019s not like Eric already has a lock on the Proving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d was all Lyra said, turning away to pace a different part of the room and hoping, very strongly, that Simon would stop there. Naturally, he didn\u2019t. When Simon had something to say, he usually finished.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should think about it. We\u2019re already friends. It could work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it would work!\u201d her father cried happily. \u201cProblem solved!\u201d</p><p>Lyra stopped, tipped her head back, and closed her eyes, wishing for patience she currently didn\u2019t have. \u201cSimon,\u201d she said, trying not to sound as frustrated with him as she felt. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to remind you that we don\u2019t actually like each other that way. And as a couple, we would make one another really unhappy. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him and saw she\u2019d managed to hurt his feelings despite the fact that she\u2019d spoken nothing but the truth. Lyra blew out an exasperated breath. She didn\u2019t know why he had to be the one who was more sensitive. It was so backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just think you could have toyed with my emotions a little longer before shooting me down,\u201d Simon said. \u201cEspecially since I was lured here with free pizza and got a free rejection instead.\u201d His dimples winked for a moment, then vanished as his expression once more turned serious. He hesitated for a moment, then glanced at Dorien like he wished the man would leave. Since that didn\u2019t seem likely, he murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s not the world\u2019s worst idea, though. I could take Eric\u2014especially with your father\u2019s help beforehand. He could back me fully if I was yours. And friendship isn\u2019t such an awful way to start...\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked at him, full of as much affection as exasperation. He looked so adorably disgruntled about the whole thing. She wished, as she often had, that she could have wanted Simon as a lover along with their friendship. Life would have been easier in a lot of ways, and she knew very well that if Simon became the Alpha through their marriage, he would be more than happy to let her run things behind the scenes. But the necessary feeling just wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>And besides, though she had a lot of faith in Simon as a fighter, he had a sense of honor. He wouldn\u2019t fight dirty... Eric would. Meaning Simon would lose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lyra said firmly, shaking her head. \u201cNo way. I can do this. I want to do this. The Proving\u2019s not exactly Mortal Kombat, right? It\u2019s speed, stealth, agility\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeating and slashing one another to a bloody pulp in the dark,\u201d Simon added quietly. Lyra decided to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is a month of the most intensive training you two can give me. Every technique, every dirty trick, I want to know it and practice it. We go to the course, we train, we work out a way for me to take out the big boys.\u201d</p><p>Her father and Simon shared a look, and Dorien opened his mouth to speak. Lyra was quite sure she wasn\u2019t going to like what he had to say. More excuses, probably. She was a she-wolf, she wouldn\u2019t understand, it would upset the other candidates, blah blah blah. She moved to cut him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sudden knock at the door startled her. Lyra turned her head sharply toward the sound, as did the men. The three werewolves stood frozen in silence for a long moment. She shot a quick look at the clock. It was a little past eight, and with the moon just recently begun to wane again, visitors were unexpected. It took most pack members a full week to recover from a Full Moon\u2019s Feast, and this last one had been as wild as ever. Wilder, since she\u2019d caused such a stir by stepping forward when the Proving candidates were asked to announce themselves.</p><p>Another knock. When no one moved, Lyra rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay, I guess I\u2019ll get that,\u201d she grumbled, stalking from the room. \u201cMaybe someone else wants to marry me and save me from my own crushing stupidity.\u201d</p><p>She moved into the foyer, already dreading what she expected to find on the steps. It likely wasn\u2019t another wannabe mate, but since an entire week had passed and she hadn\u2019t yet pulled out of the Proving, it probably was an elder pack member come to dispense some comforting wisdom along the same lines as what her father had been spouting all day. \u201cFind a strong mate to fight for you, put an end to this nonsense... and by the way, do you remember that my daughter married into the Pack of the Black Tree? Well, she has the nicest boy about your age...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even bother to look through the crackle glass sidelights, catching only the vaguest impression of a single human shape standing outside. She had already decided that if her guess was correct, whoever this was would quickly find him- or herself with a door slammed in their face.</p><p>Lyra pulled the door open with an angry jerk, ready to verbally carve up her nosy visitor.</p><p>When she saw who it was, her mouth dropped open, but whatever words she\u2019d had in her head blew away like dead leaves in the wind.</p><p>He was everything she remembered, everything she\u2019d replayed in her head a thousand times. Slim and pale and preternaturally beautiful, with that shaggy black hair that looked as though it would feel like silk against her skin. His eyes, an impossible blue that her memory had insistently dimmed simply because eyes couldn\u2019t truly be a shade so vibrant, were fixed on her.</p><p>Words finally appeared in Lyra\u2019s head. Sadly, they didn\u2019t make any sense when put together. The shock of seeing Jaden here, as though he\u2019d wandered out of one of her fevered dreams to find himself smack in the middle of werewolf country, was just a little too much for her.</p><p>It was some small consolation that Jaden seemed as startled as she was. He had his hands stuffed into the pockets of the same black military-style jacket he\u2019d been wearing the other night, and stood very, very still, as though moving might provoke her into attacking him.</p><p>At the moment, she was in no shape to do that.</p><p>Finally, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d One word, in that soft, sultry voice, and he never let his eyes leave hers. She would almost have thought he was trying to thrall her, except that sort of thing didn\u2019t work on her kind and he knew it. So his wide-eyed, hopeful, slightly terrified stare meant... what, exactly?</p><p>\u201cLyra? Who is it?\u201d Her father\u2019s voice called from the other room, bringing Lyra back to reality with an unpleasant jolt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... nothing, be right back,\u201d she called, hoping her father and Simon didn\u2019t hear how strange her voice sounded. Then she took a deep breath, catching a whiff of Jaden\u2019s cologne. Gods, he smelled good. Why did he have to smell good? She needed to get him the hell out of here, now, before something awful happened. She had enough shit to deal with right now without trying to prevent her pack from dismembering a stray cat vamp.</p><p>She leaned in close to talk to him but immediately wished she hadn\u2019t. The memory of being pressed against him was still too raw, and it hadn\u2019t stopped haunting her, both in her sleep and in her unguarded waking moments.</p><p>She steeled herself. This was too important to lose her head over. And she sure wasn\u2019t going to get ridiculous over a vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she hissed. \u201cAre you nuts? The other wolves will kill you the second they smell you!\u201d</p><p>Incredibly, Jaden shrugged. \u201cYeah, well, I can take care of myself. I brought you something.\u201d</p><p>From his pocket, he pulled out a disc hanging from a long chain, one Lyra knew immediately. She exhaled a shaky breath, hardly able to believe her luck. Her father had thus far been too upset to notice she wasn\u2019t wearing it. Now he didn\u2019t ever have to know it had been gone. And all because Jaden had decided to bring it back to her.</p><p>All this way back to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaden frowned as he held it out to her, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cYou hunted me down just to give this back?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d There had to be some kind of angle. But what a vampire could want from her, apart from verbal abuse, was completely beyond her. Lyra felt strangely off-balance, just as she had when Jaden had saved her from Mark. She couldn\u2019t think of a good reason why he might have done that either, apart from some twisted enjoyment he might have received from making her angry.</p><p>Unless Jaden was just kind of... sweet. Which was a possibility she had no interest in considering. Trying to figure out vampires was an exercise in futility.</p> <p>\u201cIt looked important,\u201d Jaden replied, keeping his voice quiet, eyes darting quickly over her shoulder. Lyra noted that her father and Simon had fallen suspiciously silent, and she knew it was only a matter of time before they came out to where she and Jaden stood. That wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you seemed pretty protective of it when that guy\u2014Mark, was it?\u2014ripped it off of your neck. So I figured I would bring it back.\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to believe it, to take Jaden and his soothing, melodious British accent at face value. But Lyra was too used to being bitten, literally and figuratively, when she let her guard down.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that easy and you know it,\u201d Lyra replied, keeping her own voice down, though she had a feeling that it was no longer making any difference. Wolves\u2019 hearing was impeccable. She quickly took the necklace, feeling a burst of relief as her fingers closed around the metal disc. Lyra noticed that Jaden let his hand linger against hers, cool and smooth against her own vital warmth. She should have been repulsed. But like everything else about this vampire, she found it strangely compelling.</p><p>\u201cHow did you even find me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat do you want, Jaden?\u201d</p> <p>To her surprise, he seemed unsure how to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was cut off by the sound of an animal\u2019s snarl, accompanied by her father\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this? Get away from my daughter, you piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dorien\u2019s curse was drowned out by Lyra\u2019s startled cry as an enormous red wolf leaped from behind her and landed on top of Jaden. She was knocked to the side and quickly felt her father\u2019s hands on her, steadying her. Just as quickly she shook him off. Lyra turned to look at him. Her stomach sank. He had murder in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that bloodsucker thinks he\u2019s after, coming into my town, but Simon will make sure he understands what it means to come onto our territory. There,\u201d he growled, jerking his head toward the scene. \u201cThat\u2019s how you fight, Lyra. No mercy.\u201d</p> <p>Dorien jerked his head toward the fiasco unfolding in the front yard, urging her to look. Vampire or not, she really didn\u2019t want to see Jaden being torn apart. It was a good thing it was dark, and that all their neighbors were part of the pack. A scene like this would have merited plenty of calls to both the police and Animal Control in a normal town.</p><p>Still, after a few seconds of listening to vicious snarling, Lyra couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked out, expecting to see Simon with one of Jaden\u2019s limbs in his mouth and one or two others littering the ground around them. Instead, she ended up watching, wide-eyed, as Jaden proved himself more than a match for the brute strength of a werewolf. With a series of moves that were almost balletic in their grace, he extracted himself from Simon\u2019s claws, extended his own, and with bared fangs proceeded to open Simon up, slash-slash-slash. When Simon roared in anger, blood coursing down both sides and his nose sliced open, Lyra saw him make what would, she knew, be a fatal mistake.</p><p>He let the anger drive him.</p><p>The anger made Simon sloppy, whereas Jaden\u2019s cold focus seemed only to intensify. Every time Simon lunged, Jaden avoided him with a simple quick feint. His shoulders were hunched, almost like a threatened cat. Without taking his eyes from his opponent, Jaden addressed Dorien.</p><p>Lyra realized she\u2019d moved from terror to fascination. The man wasn\u2019t even winded.</p><p>\u201cSir, I only came to return something to your daughter. If you have a problem with that, fine, but I don\u2019t think it merits killing me. I came alone.\u201d</p><p>Dorien didn\u2019t even look at Lyra to confirm this. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what you say. Why should I trust one of your kind? You\u2019ve banned us from your cities. Maybe you\u2019re looking to take the countryside too, and that isn\u2019t going to happen. We\u2019ll send you back in pieces. That should take care of the problem for a while.\u201d</p><p>Lyra knew she wasn\u2019t imagining Jaden\u2019s exasperated groan, as though he was engaging in a polite disagreement instead of a life-or-death battle. Simon threw himself at Jaden again, and Jaden spun away, opening up Simon\u2019s left flank. The wolf reacted with a roar that was now far more pain than fury. Simon, Lyra saw even by the dim light in the front yard, was bleeding heavily now. Her kind healed quickly, but in a battle like this, not quickly enough. He would need to rest, to sleep.</p> <p>If this kept up he wasn\u2019t going to get that chance.</p><p>She stopped worrying about Jaden dying and started worrying that he was going to kill Simon.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Lyra said, beginning to panic as she saw Simon had no intention of stopping, \u201che\u2019s telling the truth. He brought me Mom\u2019s necklace. I... I lost it the other night, and he brought it back to me.\u201d When her father looked back at her like she\u2019d suddenly grown another head, she raised her voice to a shout, hoping it would get through his thick skull.</p><p>\u201cTell Simon to stop! Damn it, he\u2019s going to get killed, and Jaden didn\u2019t come here to fight! This is my fault, okay? Make him stop!\u201d</p><p>She saw the instant of understanding, then reproach mixed with disgust. It settled like a rock in the pit of her stomach, but there was nothing for it now. Lyra wasn\u2019t about to cause the death of her dear friend by stubbornly refusing to tell the truth.</p><p>Dorien moved like lightning, staying in human form but leaping with the sort of controlled power that a human could only dream of having. He landed squarely in between Jaden and Simon, who were circling one another again. Jaden\u2019s eyes glittered like blue fire, and Simon staggered stubbornly along, though obviously he was very wounded.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Dorien bellowed, his voice so loud the very air seemed to vibrate. Lyra stepped into the night, noticing that curious faces looked out at the scene from windows of houses all around them. Inwardly, she groaned. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the neighbors came out for a closer look, and there would be no restraining them once they caught a whiff of vampire. Lyra doubted her father would try very hard to stop them.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s voice dropped to a harsh growl as he addressed first Simon, then Jaden.</p><p>\u201cYou, get inside. Those wounds will need tending. Lyra can take care of that... it\u2019s the least she can do.\u201d</p><p>Simon complied immediately, remaining in wolf form as he limped past Lyra and into the house. He didn\u2019t spare her a glance. Ashamed, Lyra supposed. And later, he would be angry when he learned what had brought the vampire here to begin with. She started to follow, but slowly, wanting to hear what her father had to say to Jaden. Dorien saw what she was up to, however, and the glare he fixed her with would have caused ice to burst into flame.</p><p>\u201cGo with Simon,\u201d Dorien snapped. \u201cIf you\u2019re really responsible for this vamp being here, I won\u2019t harm him. He may be a bloodsucker, but he isn\u2019t the one who told you to go running unprotected all over the country. And I\u2019m guessing the necklace didn\u2019t leave you willingly, did it?\u201d</p><p>Lyra said nothing. What could she say? She had no defense. Even for Mark. Her father would no doubt lay the blame for that squarely at her feet because she had left the protection of the pack. And now this... bringing a vampire onto pack territory...</p><p>She nodded and spared a final look at Jaden, whom she was quite sure she would never see again. Her only consolation was that Dorien Black was a man of his word. If he said he wouldn\u2019t harm Jaden, he meant it. Jaden\u2019s eyes met hers in the half light, beautiful and strange, so different from the wolf eyes she had grown up around. Her anger at him had fled, replaced by confusion and a strange longing that seemed to come from deep within... a thing she knew she needed to deny at all costs, lest it take root and grow.</p><p>Wanting things she couldn\u2019t have was standard operating procedure. Wanting Jaden would not only be pointless, but also an incredibly stupid waste of energy. Still, he deserved some thanks. Even if he\u2019d brought her as much trouble as relief.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said to him, \u201cthanks for bringing it back to me.\u201d</p><p>Jaden gave a curt nod, his expression deadly serious. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated only a moment longer, feeling like there was more to be said, though she wasn\u2019t quite sure what it was. But in the end, she had to turn away, go inside.</p><p>Running again. But this time, for whatever reason, she felt like she was running in the exact wrong direction.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>JADEN WATCHED LYRA turn to go inside, allowing himself a second or two to admire the sensual sway of her hips. She was abrasive enough that he doubted she was fully aware of her own appeal. He supposed it was for the best that her father was now going to get around to throwing him out of town.</p><p>Or trying to kill him.</p><p>Or both.</p><p>Now that he finally had a moment to size the man up, Jaden turned a cautious eye to Dorien Black. Lyra didn\u2019t favor him in looks particularly, Jaden thought. Dorien\u2019s hair was reddish-brown instead of Lyra\u2019s deep chocolate color, and his features were rough and blocky. She most definitely had his eyes, however. Hot gold, with a wild glitter and a slight upward tilt.</p><p>It was small comfort, that little reminder of the woman who\u2019d drawn him here. But above all, Dorien Black was a werewolf, and an Alpha wolf at that. Which meant he was too damned big for his own good. Simon had been young, easy to defeat. This one, one-on-one, might pose a few problems if he decided to give chase.</p><p>The Alpha\u2019s gruff tone was far from reassuring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou bolt, and I\u2019ll run you down until you drop. I want some answers.\u201d</p><p>Jaden didn\u2019t move. He knew he ought to\u2014the wolf was probably bluffing\u2014but if all it took to leave were a few simple questions, that was preferable to running for his life.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on what the questions are,\u201d Jaden said.</p> <p>Dorien snorted dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019re on my territory now, boy. Why you thought setting foot in it was a good idea is beyond me, but here you are. My territory, my rules.\u201d</p><p>The words were typical wolf posturing, but generally best heeded. Jaden hadn\u2019t yet met a wolf without a short fuse, Lyra included. He suspected she came by it honestly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be obvious.\u201d Dorien\u2019s eyes glittered in the semidarkness. \u201cWhy did you have my daughter\u2019s necklace? How do you know Lyra? And again... what the hell are you doing in the middle of my pack\u2019s territory?\u201d</p><p>Jaden shifted, then raised an eyebrow. \u201cJust passing through?\u201d</p> <p>The attempt at humor fell flat as Dorien bared his teeth. His incisors were as sharp as any vampire\u2019s. \u201cThis is a joke to you, then. My family, our honor, our kind... a joke.\u201d</p><p>Jaden felt his hackles rising and had to swallow a hiss. His eyes saw a man, but his senses were screaming wolf... his natural enemy. Dorien likely fought much the same battle as he stood there, a low growl giving Jaden fair warning that the situation was deteriorating rapidly.</p><p>He might have fought the Alpha after all, had he not glanced up and caught a glimpse of Lyra\u2019s face at one of the upstairs windows. Their eyes locked for the barest of seconds, but it was long enough for Jaden to see worry, fear... and the same strange longing that had pulled him here. The last sensation shook him to his core. He knew he was probably imagining it, just like he knew he was the only one reliving their last meeting over and over in strange, heated dreams.</p><p>But that glimpse of interest, of faintest possibility, was enough to pull him back from the edge.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s face vanished. Time sped back up. And Jaden put his hands before him in a sign of truce.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke, sir. I might be a vampire, but since I was a slave up until not very long ago, poking fun at other races isn\u2019t all that appealing as entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment where Dorien looked like he could go either way, and Jaden half expected to see the claws start to lengthen, the fur begin to sprout. Instead, with a deep breath, Dorien, too, stepped back from the edge.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Dorien said flatly. \u201cWe do hear things out here, from time to time. It\u2019s in our best interest to keep an eye on your kind, just in case they decide the cities aren\u2019t for them and that they like what we have even better. You\u2019re one of the Cait Sith. I smell cat all over you. So I guess that means you\u2019re newly respectable these days.\u201d</p><p>Jaden knew he was skating on thin ice. \u201cYou could say that,\u201d he hedged, unsure of just how much the wolves had heard.</p><p>The Alpha snorted contemptuously. \u201cYes, I could. Your kind has joined up with that demon bloodline. I\u2019m not surprised, considering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily MacGillivray is not a demon,\u201d Jaden snapped, defensive at the first mention of his friend, the woman who had saved his bloodline from the gutter. \u201cAnd I might not know much about the wolf definition of honor, but you obviously don\u2019t know shit about my bloodline.\u201d</p><p>For some strange reason, Jaden\u2019s outburst seemed to please Dorien. His lips slowly lifted into a grin.</p><p>\u201cNope. Don\u2019t want to either. But I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve got some loyalty, and some spine... for a vampire. It\u2019s not the sort of thing we expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well... I don\u2019t expect to be standing here talking to an Alpha wolf after I\u2019ve just torn one of his young wolves to ribbons, so I\u2019d call this a new experience for us both.\u201d He paused, then threw caution to the wind when he saw the calculating gleam in Dorien\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, Black? You want something, or I wouldn\u2019t still be standing here.\u201d</p><p>Dorien chuckled at that, and Jaden could see he\u2019d been right: there was more. Dorien stepped closer to Jaden, shooting a look around them to ensure they were still alone. Jaden glanced around too, curious. The faces were gone from the windows, and all was quiet. He imagined the occasional tussle was the norm around here. To the casual observer, it likely hadn\u2019t looked like any big deal. Still, he knew full well someone could be lurking in shadows, trying to figure out what was going on. There were so many wolves here... he wondered whether there were even any humans in this town. The air was thick with werewolf musk, though he\u2019d acclimated to it somewhat by now. It surprised Jaden that he could manage to stand it so well. But then, he\u2019d never been interested in finding out if he could desensitize himself at all. His nerves were still on edge\u2014that was to be expected when you were continuously inhaling the scent of a natural enemy\u2014but he could stand here and breathe normally, speak normally, without swinging between fight and flight.</p><p>The distraction of Simon\u2019s attack seemed to have done Jaden a world of good after all.</p><p>After a moment, Dorien seemed satisfied that they weren\u2019t being listened to. \u201cWhat do you know about werewolf Provings?\u201d</p><p>Jaden thought the question was an odd one, but he tried to be accommodating.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Bunch of wolves ripping one another apart while the pack cheers? Winner takes all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... an interesting simplification,\u201d Dorien said blandly. \u201cIt\u2019s how the pack chooses who will be the next Alpha. It\u2019s a test of strength, of skill, of wits. And the winner has the honor of becoming the current Alpha\u2019s apprentice, what we call a Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me it doesn\u2019t involve tearing one another to shreds?\u201d</p><p>Dorien exhaled loudly, looking annoyed. \u201cThat\u2019s sometimes a part of it. Think what you like about it. Vamps are plenty vicious in their own way.\u201d</p><p>Jaden thought about the long scars on his back from the Ptolemy\u2019s whip. \u201cYou won\u2019t get an argument from me on that.\u201d</p><p>The wolf looked slightly surprised at Jaden\u2019s response. \u201cWell. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does this Proving have to do with anything?\u201d Jaden asked, shoving his hands in his pockets against a chilly breath of wind. Maybe it was because his natural temperature was already cooler than a mortal\u2019s, but he preferred the warmer weather.</p><p>\u201cWe have one coming up, actually. At the next full moon. There, I\u2019ll choose my Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExciting,\u201d Jaden replied in a tone that indicated he thought it was anything but. His life had been full of violence, but it had always been something he\u2019d considered necessary, not something to be enjoyed. Werewolves, on the other hand, were known to draw one another\u2019s blood for the slightest things, just for the hell of it. The line between animal and man was very thin there, at least with some. There were reasons why they\u2019d been hunted so fiercely in the Dark Ages.</p><p>\u201cLyra has declared herself.\u201d</p><p>It took Jaden a moment to process what Dorien was saying. \u201cLyra has...\u201d Then he realized what the Alpha meant. He looked at Dorien, typically big and bulky as the males of his kind tended to be, and then thought of Lyra, who was long and lean as both a woman and a wolf. He tried to picture her throwing herself into some bloody fray with a bunch of enormous beasts, but he found it was too disturbing to think about in any detail. Maybe he was wrong about these Provings... maybe there was more to them than he\u2019d thought, that she felt she had enough of a chance at winning to enter.</p><p>And hell if he knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ambitious,\u201d was all he could think of.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be killed,\u201d Dorien replied flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that. Most would just hurt her badly enough to take her out of the running early. But her cousin, my brother\u2019s boy, has been waiting for an excuse to get his teeth in her throat. He\u2019ll win. And then I\u2019ll have to train the wolf who killed my only child, and who I\u2019ll always know enjoyed doing it.\u201d</p><p>Jaden stared at Dorien, stunned at the man\u2019s blunt assessment of the likely outcome. Finally, he noticed how tired the wolf looked, the faint smudges beneath his eyes that told the tale of plenty of sleepless nights. And though Jaden had no children of his own, or many people he cared enough to worry like that about, he felt something surprising for the wolf.</p><p>Sympathy.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get her to see reason? Lyra doesn\u2019t seem like a stupid woman. Stubborn, but not stupid. She must know what the chances are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she knows,\u201d Dorien interjected. \u201cI think if she thought there were a better candidate here than Eric\u2014that\u2019s my nephew\u2014she might consider throwing her support behind whoever that was. She doesn\u2019t have a death wish... or at least, she didn\u2019t used to. I don\u2019t blame her for being angry about the way women in the packs have always been shunted aside for leadership. But I didn\u2019t make our ways, and I can\u2019t change them. We rule by fang and claw, we follow the strongest... and it doesn\u2019t get much stronger than a full grown male werewolf.\u201d He sighed and shook his head, looking away. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of what Eric will do to the pack. Besides, so many look to Lyra for advice, for leadership, that I think she has an idea they\u2019d accept her if she managed to pull out a victory in the Proving. Maybe they would. But she\u2019ll never get that far.\u201d He looked back at Jaden wearily. \u201cThis would be a lot easier if she\u2019d just find a mate to fight for her. But she\u2019s never done what she was told. I shouldn\u2019t have expected she\u2019d start now.\u201d</p><p>Thinking about Lyra\u2019s stubbornness made Jaden smile a little, despite the pall that had been cast over the night. The shame was that someone so spirited had to be born into a race that would likely never appreciate her. She would have made a hell of a vampiress, Jaden thought, and then pushed the tantalizing image aside as his smile faded. Thoughts like that were stupid. She wasn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t be. And the reception she\u2019d given him here hadn\u2019t exactly been warm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wondered for the umpteenth time what had possessed him to come here. And what he had gotten himself into by staying.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d Jaden asked quietly. All the tension had left the air with Dorien\u2019s confession, leaving behind it nothing but a faint sense that he was about to ask something of Jaden. Something he should stay hundreds of miles away from, if he had any sense. Yet Jaden felt glued to the spot. Over a couple hundred years of life, he\u2019d rarely had any sense that his destiny was unfolding before his eyes. Mostly he\u2019d just tried to get by, saving his own skin and lending a hand if anyone else\u2019s skin seemed worth saving without much trouble. But this was... different.</p><p>Sort of like knowing a piano was about to fall on your head and being unable to get out of the way. But if he bolted, Jaden thought, as he should, then he would be haunted by the image of Lyra\u2019s golden eyes, so full of life, closing forever.</p> <p>Gods, he was losing it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you this because I\u2019m desperate, of course,\u201d Dorien said with a dry little chuckle, his small smile humorless. \u201cYou were interested enough in Lyra\u2019s welfare to bring her necklace\u2014my late wife\u2019s necklace\u2014back to her. Maybe you\u2019ll be interested enough to listen to my proposition. You seem to be an odd one, for a vamp. And frankly, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept your daughter,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s expression turned grim. \u201cIf I do nothing, I\u2019ll lose her anyway. Better to take a leap of faith, I think. At least then I will have tried everything I can think of.\u201d</p><p>He hated to admit it, but Jaden was inclined to agree. The chances of him even being alive right now had been slim, and yet here he was... because he and his friends had taken a huge risk and taken on an entire dynasty.</p> <p>Realizing that he had any of this in common with a creature he would normally have considered a big, worthless, violent beast was uncomfortable, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cYou may as well tell me what I\u2019ve stumbled into,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cI have no idea how I can help with your problem, but I guess you\u2019ve thought of something.\u201d</p><p>Dorien\u2019s gaze was unnervingly direct. \u201cI have. While you were dealing with Simon\u2019s... welcome... in fact. You made short work of him, and he\u2019s a hell of a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s young,\u201d Jaden said with a shrug. \u201cHe let his anger get ahead of him. He\u2019ll learn. Hopefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also danced circles around him,\u201d Dorien said. \u201cI\u2019m no expert about vamp fights, and I\u2019ll deny I said this to my dying day, but you\u2019ve got impressive skill, boy. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever paid much attention to one of your kind in battle... usually too busy trying to take his or her head off... but I expected you to fight dirty. You didn\u2019t need to.\u201d He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that says much for Simon, though.\u201d</p><p>Jaden lifted an eyebrow, bemused. He hadn\u2019t been called \u201cboy\u201d in a very long time, and then certainly not by a man who was a good two hundred years younger. Still, he appreciated the compliment, even though he was well aware he was being buttered up. It was funny. Dorien looked like a prizefighter, not a negotiator, but looks, it seemed, were deceiving.</p> <p>Jaden found it hard to be anything but gracious in return.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just young, like I said. I\u2019ve had a few years to work on my technique, if you want to call it that. And you still haven\u2019t told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach her to fight like you do. I\u2019ll pay you anything you like.\u201d</p><p>Jaden blinked, not sure he\u2019d heard the man correctly. \u201cTeach her?\u201d</p><p>Dorien\u2019s gaze was direct, completely confident. \u201cLyra. She\u2019s built more like you... not that you\u2019re built like a woman or anything, but size-wise, you\u2019re more in line. She\u2019s strong, quicker than most of the males in the pack. And if you want grace, she\u2019s got that too. I can\u2019t help her. You could.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in ages, Jaden found himself caught completely off guard. He\u2019d expected a request to maybe watch Lyra\u2019s back. This, however... hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind. Probably because it was completely insane.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that would work, Dorien. I mean, even setting aside the fact that I\u2019ve never taught anyone to fight before, she and I aren\u2019t exactly the same species.\u201d</p><p>Dorien waved his hand dismissively. \u201cSo she\u2019s not a vampire. Wolves are fighters. And she\u2019s sharp, she\u2019ll pick up quickly. You\u2019re telling me you knew how to move like that the moment you were sired? You turned into a vamp and could miraculously take out random wolves in under five minutes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... no. No, I guess I was shown a few things,\u201d Jaden admitted, trying to remember. \u201cI think most of it was on-the-job training, though. I wanted to stay alive. So I watched the others, picked up the skills I needed. And when the Ptolemy grabbed me, I got better at everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could teach her, like you were taught,\u201d Dorien said with a nod. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had a sparring partner in quite a long time. The males wouldn\u2019t spar once she got older. But I know she stays in shape. Lyra will get it. Or get whatever she can out of it as a wolf. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Jaden had a sudden mental image of sparring with Lyra. Except they weren\u2019t fighting. And they were both naked. He shuffled his feet, trying to come up with an answer that would make some sense. The process was incredibly frustrating, since there didn\u2019t appear to be an answer for him that made any sense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as crazy as your daughter,\u201d Jaden finally said, his voice carrying plenty of bite. \u201cYou honestly think I can just... just magically turn her into a fighter who can take on wolves twice her size? This is insanity! Just tell this nephew of yours he can\u2019t be Alpha, then pick someone else!\u201d</p><p>Dorien\u2019s frown returned with a vengeance. \u201cThat isn\u2019t how it\u2019s done. And outwardly, he\u2019s fit. As far as taking down a big wolf... you did it just now when you sliced up one of my men. Be grateful you\u2019re not hearing my offer while I\u2019ve got you pinned to the ground by the neck.\u201d</p><p>It was Jaden\u2019s turn to bare his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to railroad me into this. I don\u2019t know how to teach someone to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter doesn\u2019t even like me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I checked that wasn\u2019t necessary to teach someone. I hated most of my teachers.\u201d</p><p>Jaden shoved his hands into his hair and growled at the indifferent moon. \u201cDamn it, Black, you\u2019re asking me to set up camp here, in a town full of wolves who are going to try to kill me on sight just like Simon did, to try and show Lyra how to win a contest of brute strength that I\u2019m completely unfamiliar with! I don\u2019t care how much you want to pay me, what about any of that sounds like a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part where what you teach her saves her life.\u201d</p><p>Dorien said it so calmly, but he must have known his words would take all the wind out of Jaden\u2019s sails in an instant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any idea if it would even come close,\u201d Jaden replied. He hadn\u2019t had to pull out any of his real tricks to take Simon down, it was true. If he had, Lyra would have been out of luck. No wolf could toss around psychic energy, for instance. But to teach her how to move, how to use her smaller size to her advantage... he wasn\u2019t sure if that was possible. He had memories of being banged around a fair bit before he\u2019d really come into his own. The natural ability had been there, but it was raw, much like Lyra\u2019s probably was. He\u2019d had to hone his skill, learn to fight well.</p><p>But he was a vampire. And he\u2019d had a hell of a lot longer than a month to prepare.</p><p>Dorien stared at him, into him, it seemed. His eyes were so wolflike in that instant, full of pride, power, and an instinctive intelligence that vampires tended to pretend didn\u2019t exist in their bestial counterparts. They were the eyes of a being that demanded respect. Jaden had the queerest sensation, like a rush of cool wind over his skin. He knew, suddenly and without any doubt, he wasn\u2019t going to walk away from this. Maybe it was because he\u2019d always been told to do things, and this was completely his decision. Maybe it was because he knew what it was to be in a desperate fight you were unlikely to win. Or maybe it was simply because, for whatever reason, he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of walking away from Lyra and letting her sacrifice herself for nothing more than a bunch of stupid werewolves.</p><p>Whatever kept him glued in place, Jaden knew that if he left now, Dorien\u2019s request would haunt him. With an eternity ahead of him, that wasn\u2019t a prospect he relished. He heard his own voice speaking as though he were hearing himself over a great distance.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you offering me, here?\u201d</p><p>Dorien gave a curt nod, and Jaden didn\u2019t miss the flash of relief in the Alpha\u2019s eyes. The wolf knew he had Jaden... though Jaden hoped he didn\u2019t understand exactly why. If the father had any idea that Jaden had entertained some enjoyably impure thoughts about the very daughter he was supposed to teach, Jaden thought Dorien might try to take him apart regardless, Proving or no.</p><p>Fortunately, the man seemed more concerned with money.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what a creature like you needs or wants. I can\u2019t give you blood, but there is some money. You\u2019d have complete safety while you were here, of course. I\u2019ll come up with something to tell the others.\u201d His voice hardened and grew intense, vibrating in his rich baritone. \u201cLook. She won\u2019t budge and I\u2019m out of options. I won\u2019t have my daughter die for this. Even if it doesn\u2019t look good at the end, I\u2019ll... well, we\u2019ll talk about that. But I\u2019d rather have her hating me and alive than dead proving me right. I\u2019ll give you whatever is in my power to give if you\u2019ll teach my Lyra. Give her a chance. She might surprise you.\u201d</p><p>And that, thought Jaden, was exactly what he was worried about. Still, the acceptance was right on the tip of his tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anything it was in his power to give. Such a rash and generous offer. How could Dorien know that he wouldn\u2019t ask for some exorbitant sum or maybe a piece of the pack\u2019s territory? The answer was simple: he couldn\u2019t. And it made Lyra\u2019s situation seem that much more desperate. So much could go wrong... in fact, it was likely to. And the thought of Dorien\u2019s contingency plan, whatever it was, already gave him the creeping horrors. In the end, Jaden could only think to ask one question, simple and yet encompassing everything.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dorien gave Jaden a look that was equal parts mystified and pitying. \u201cShe\u2019s my girl. I love her. Haven\u2019t you ever had someone you\u2019d give everything up for?\u201d</p> <p>Jaden could give only a single negative shake of his head. No. But that didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t\u2014that he didn\u2019t want to\u2014understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s expression turned deadly serious, full of wariness and cautious hope. \u201cAnd... in return, what are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cI want a boon from your pack, to be decided later, which means when I need it. Anything I ask. No refusals. One thing.\u201d</p><p>The wolf frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t much like the sound of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t much care. That\u2019s my price.\u201d He knew the value of a promise tucked in the back pocket. One never knew when it would be needed most.</p><p>Finally, after a minute, Dorien nodded. \u201cGods forgive me, but all right. A promise for later. But I\u2019m warning you now, cat: hurt her, or break faith with me in any way, and I\u2019ll have you rent limb from limb. Your fancy footwork won\u2019t save you from the wrath of my pack. Got it?\u201d He stretched out his hand, a gesture that Jaden had never seen extended from a wolf to a vampire.</p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Jaden grumbled, but he gripped Dorien\u2019s hand with his own, feeling the iron strength in the clasp. \u201cYou\u2019d think I was going to teach her dancing.\u201d</p><p>When they broke the connection, Dorien beckoned him along and turned for the house. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ve got a lot to talk about. And then we\u2019ll need to speak to Lyra, get that screaming out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Jaden felt his lips curve into a smile despite himself, watching as Dorien made his way up the steps, muttering incoherently. Slowly, Jaden started after him, toward the welcoming glow of the house. He should have been appalled with himself, should have at least felt some sense of misgiving. But he felt better than he had in a long time.</p><p>If nothing else, his life, or what passed for it, was about to get a lot more interesting. For the first time in a long time, he didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next. And though a wolf would never understand the interminable sameness of forever, Jaden recognized this uncertainty as the gift it was.</p> <p>He\u2019d spent years enslaved, been tortured, escaped, and helped to defeat one dynasty in order to begin another. No one could say his long life hadn\u2019t been eventful. But it now seemed possible, even probable, that he was embarking on something like an adventure.</p><p>Lyra Black might be bad news in every way imaginable.</p><p>But she, and this, might be just what he needed.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>IT WAS LATE by the time Simon left, slinking home in a foul mood that Lyra hadn\u2019t been able to tease him out of. She\u2019d doctored him in the upstairs bathroom as best she could, and put up with as much surly growling as she had patience for, but in the end she knew it would take him a good night\u2019s sleep and possibly a couple days more of wound licking to straighten up. She might love him like a brother, but Lyra was more than happy to send him on his way when he was ready.</p><p>She took some time to work up to going downstairs. Normally she didn\u2019t suffer from a lack of nerve, but then, normally she wasn\u2019t the cause of a vampire showing up on her doorstep. She had an idea that it might take her father some time to get over that, and that there might be shouting involved.</p><p>The week had been a long one. Lyra really wanted to postpone the shouting part.</p><p>In the end, she decided to get comfortable and take her chances. She put on a pair of cotton pajama shorts, pulled on a hooded sweatshirt, swirled her hair up into a messy bun, and then headed downstairs in her bare feet. The house was quiet. She had no idea if that was a good sign, because Dorien was fully capable of fuming quietly.</p> <p>If he was laying in wait somewhere, Lyra just hoped he\u2019d let her grab a snack before he really started in on her. Her stomach was growling, and there was a bag of Cheetos stashed in the cupboard calling her name.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a sound as she headed through the foyer, then back to the kitchen. When she rounded the corner, it didn\u2019t surprise her to see a figure seated at the table.</p><p>The shock came when she realized who it was.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s bright blue eyes flashed when they met her own. He straightened where he\u2019d been slouched at the heavy wooden table, and Lyra watched him quickly look her over, seeming to take her measure while she tried to process the fact that he was still here. Not just in her town, but in her house. With her father nowhere to be found. Surprise quickly gave way to dark suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here? What did you do with my father?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A ghost of a smile hovered at the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou have a knack,\u201d he said, \u201cfor thinking the absolute worst of my intentions. You realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest, standing her ground. \u201cDon\u2019t play harmless with me. There\u2019s no way in hell he would have invited you in. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Jaden sighed, looking slightly uncomfortable. \u201cOut. He had a few things to deal with. I was... kind of hoping he\u2019d be back by the time you came down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, he\u2019s sharing his social schedule with you too. I don\u2019t remember him having anything to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does now, if he wants to keep me around long enough to help you. From what he said, he\u2019s busy putting out the alert that I\u2019m here, and that I\u2019m not to be chased, dismembered, or eaten if spotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me? Is this some kind of joke?\u201d Lyra asked incredulously, narrowing her eyes. That he\u2019d brought her the family talisman was a welcome surprise, and made her think he might even have a few redeeming qualities... for a vamp, at least. She\u2019d even worried a little when she\u2019d left him alone with her father, stupid though she knew it was. What did she care about what happened to him? It wasn\u2019t like they ran in the same circles, and with things coming to a head with the Proving so soon, she wasn\u2019t likely to bump into him again.</p><p>The necklace should have been the end of it. He should be long gone.</p><p>And yet here he still was, tying her insides up in knots just by hanging out in her kitchen like he belonged there. Did such annoying creatures have to be so ridiculously beautiful? Lyra wondered. And this one had a face that was way too innocent. It had messed with her head from the beginning. Apparently, even now, she wasn\u2019t over it.</p><p>She remembered how he had spoken so softly in her ear, how silky his hair had felt when he\u2019d rubbed his cheek against her...</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d Jaden said calmly, snapping her back to the situation at hand, \u201chas hired me to do a job. And since I currently have nothing better to do, and am apparently a glutton for punishment besides, I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull.\u201d</p><p>His placid expression quickly became irritated. Lyra was glad. It was a lot easier when she could tell what Jaden was feeling. He seemed sincere... but she knew from experience that vampires excelled at manipulation. Still, she\u2019d thought it was odd to look out the window earlier, expecting to see some sort of a confrontation between Jaden and her father, only to find them engrossed in an apparently nonviolent conversation.</p><p>But no Alpha would ever invite a vampire into his home... ask for his help, when it went against everything the pack stood for...</p><p>Unless he were completely desperate. Unless he had a daughter who\u2019d finally driven him over the edge.</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cLyra, I haven\u2019t killed your father. He\u2019s not stashed in a closet around here. I\u2019m not sitting here waiting for the right moment to go all Hannibal Lecter on you. Would you please just sit down or something? If either of us ought to be nervous, it\u2019s me. This entire town smells like a kennel.\u201d</p><p>His beleaguered tone sealed it for her. He was here with her father\u2019s blessing. For a moment, Lyra wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or scream. If it had been any other vamp, she might have been intrigued. She might even have been excited to see that Dorien could think beyond the very limiting confines of pack tradition. But of all the vampires he might have approached, it had to be the one whose ass she wanted to bite.</p><p>He lifted one dark brow. \u201cAfraid of me now, are you?\u201d</p><p>Lyra decided she could be grateful, at least, that Jaden made it impossible to moon over him when he started running his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d She sauntered into the kitchen, taking her time while she opened the pantry and found the Cheetos. Jaden sat watching her with an inscrutable expression that she found irritatingly catlike while he waited for her to sit down. Just to be contrary, she stopped to dig in the fridge for a soda.</p><p>\u201cI think Dorien left you a note on the refrigerator,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Curious, Lyra looked at the new yellow Post-it stuck to the fridge door. Scrawled on it in permanent marker was a message:</p><p>Don\u2019t eat the cat. Be back soon.</p><p>\u2014Dad</p><p>She turned her head to glare at Jaden.</p><p>\u201cPointing this out earlier would have saved you some time trying to convince me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was more interesting the other way.\u201d</p><p>Lyra snorted as she headed for the table, decidedly more comfortable in her own house now that the last of her doubts had been removed.</p><p>\u201cOh, you enjoy seeing me pissed off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>She grinned despite herself. \u201cYou\u2019re in for a treat then.\u201d</p><p>Lyra tossed herself into the chair opposite Jaden, tucked one leg up against her chest, and dug into her bag of artificial cheese powder heaven. Her taste buds thanked her immediately. Jaden\u2019s presence here was still unnerving, and she couldn\u2019t think of a single reason why her father would have allowed him to stay, but at least now she was on her own turf. Being in familiar surroundings helped soothe the nerves he seemed to awaken in her, at least enough that she could appear comfortable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyra doubted it would ever be possible to be really comfortable around Jaden. And not only because he was a vampire.</p><p>The attraction was deeply annoying to her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Jaden said, \u201cnow that I\u2019ve met your father I can see where you get your charm from. That\u2019s disgusting, by the way,\u201d he said, gesturing at the bag of Cheetos.</p><p>Lyra lifted her eyebrows. \u201cYou really want to discuss who has the more disgusting eating habits? Deal with it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t explained this ultra-helpful job you seem to have conned my father into giving you. Apart from being bait, there\u2019s nothing we need a vampire for.\u201d She paused. \u201cThough having some extra bait around could come in handy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jaden said, looking smug, \u201cyour father seems to think I\u2019m just what you need.\u201d</p><p>His wording, or maybe the way he said it, had her stomach suddenly feeling like it was full of caged butterflies, flustering her. Almost immediately, he seemed to realize the other way his words could be taken and surprised her by flushing slightly. She hadn\u2019t even known vampires could blush. For the first time, Jaden looked away, finding something on the far wall worthy of glaring at.</p><p>Lyra tried to brush off his reaction. She didn\u2019t need this. Not now, not ever.</p> <p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Lyra snapped out, fighting to regain her footing in the conversation, \u201chas a lot of ideas I don\u2019t necessarily agree with. And if he thinks I need anything you can give me, I\u2019d say he\u2019s lost it.\u201d</p><p>Jaden seemed more than ready to rise to the bait. It was a relief. Anger was far easier to deal with than... whatever else was festering beneath the surface here. Maybe for both of them.</p><p>\u201cIf wanting you to live through this fight you\u2019ve got coming is insane, then yes, he might be. And if you\u2019d rather find a kickboxing class to take instead of having me as a teacher, then go for it. You might entertain everyone for a few minutes before your cousin takes you apart.\u201d</p><p>Lyra inhaled sharply, sucked in a bit of junk food with the air, and began coughing furiously. She managed to get out only a single word, but it was enough to convey the source of her shock.</p><p>\u201cTeacher?\u201d</p><p>She had to have misheard him. Had to have. Because there was no way in hell her father would ever have come up with such a crazy scheme. Lyra fought to regain control over her windpipe and registered that Jaden still looked very defensive. His next words confirmed that he was.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I get that it\u2019s unconventional, but choking to death over it still seems like an overreaction.\u201d</p><p>She finally got the coughing mostly under control. To fix what lingered, she popped the top of her soda. Lyra took a long swig, savoring the coolness running down her irritated throat, and then returned her attention to Jaden. Her voice sounded strained when she spoke, and it wasn\u2019t all from the coughing fit.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly expect me to believe that my father\u2014a man who I have never heard say a good or even a neutral word about your kind\u2014has decided you need to stick around to be some kind of vampire version of Mr. Miyagi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe laid it out for me,\u201d Jaden said evenly, though his eyes burned blue. \u201cHe can\u2019t teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t teach me, is more like it,\u201d Lyra shot back. \u201cNot him, not any of them. I mean, did he explain why he can\u2019t teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it wouldn\u2019t do you any good,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cHe thinks if you go in trying to do the same thing as the rest, you\u2019ll be knocked out pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>Lyra rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, well, he wouldn\u2019t know, since he\u2019s never even given me a chance to prove myself.\u201d She took another swig of the soda, knowing she shouldn\u2019t even be getting into this with Jaden. It was wolf business, her business, and he had no part in it. But except for Simon, she didn\u2019t really have anyone to unload on... and Simon, for all his kindness, wasn\u2019t exactly a neutral party. He wouldn\u2019t help her either.</p><p>As a reasonably neutral party, Jaden would do.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know there have only ever been three female Alphas in the entire history of werewolves? Three. That\u2019s pathetic. And those were some really unusual, really specific circumstances. We\u2019re years past women\u2019s suffrage and women\u2019s lib, but here, it\u2019s still whoever has the biggest muscles wins the day.\u201d She knew she was bitching, knew her voice was heating up, but Lyra couldn\u2019t help it. All this had been building for the longest time. And oddly enough, it seemed like Jaden was actually listening to her.</p><p>\u201cAt least if I\u2019d been born into one of the other pack families I would have been able to make my own life. Leave if I wanted, mate with who I wanted, get a job, a house, a life of my own! But no. I\u2019m Dorien Black\u2019s daughter, so here I am, living with Daddy at twenty-three, no job because no one here will hire me until I find a mate and quit drawing all sorts of strays into town, and locked out of what should be my birthright because I don\u2019t have the right plumbing. Gods forbid they train a lowly female as a warrior. I could fight just as well as they can. It\u2019s asinine!\u201d</p><p>To punctuate the end of her rant, she slammed her fist on the table and pulverized an unsuspecting Cheeto. Lyra heard the crunch, lifted her fist, and saw the mess. She sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d She lifted her eyes back to Jaden\u2019s, feeling a little sheepish. Her nerves might be ragged at this point, her tolerance stretched to its limits, but she realized that ranting to a stranger was probably not the solution.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I get... um... wound up. It\u2019s been a little rough lately.\u201d He was watching her with the strangest expression, Lyra thought. Well, she\u2019d wanted to get rid of him. Looking like an escaped mental patient was as good a method as any. Except that didn\u2019t seem to be the reason he was looking at her so closely. Lyra thought she saw... could she really see... sympathy?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I listened to you. Now it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Jaden said. Lyra had to marvel at his ability to change gears. Just minutes ago he\u2019d been an uncomfortable vampire. Now he was all business.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right. I agree with you. That is, I would agree under normal circumstances. But these aren\u2019t. According to your father, who is definitely desperate by the way, you\u2019ve got less than a month to figure out how to overcome not only the bigger males in your pack, but also some hulking murderous cousin in a fight that is unlikely to be fair. Whether or not you\u2019ll be able to use what I can teach you, I think you should have been trained from the beginning just for practicality, but I\u2019m not even going to touch the weird gender issues your kind has. The point is that as of now, you don\u2019t have time to learn to beat these wolves the way one of your males would, even if you could.\u201d</p><p>Lyra huffed out a surprised breath that was almost a laugh. \u201cThe conventional wisdom around here is that I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m too small and female.\u201d She knew she growled out the last word, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Her sex wouldn\u2019t have been an impediment to her if her interests had been different. That is, anything other than leading her pack. But in her case, her gender had been tossed at her as a backhanded insult for years.</p><p>It would have cowed a lot of women, Lyra knew, or at least sent them looking for something else to do. In her case, it had just made her mad. And even more determined.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s calm and slightly disdainful reaction to all this was what she would have expected from a vampire, but she found it strangely reassuring. She wasn\u2019t the only one who found the werewolves\u2019 system unfair, outdated, and flat-out stupid. It surprised her to find him, just like that night in Massachusetts, an ally.</p><p>Hell if she knew quite what to do with that knowledge though.</p><p>Jaden waved away her comment. \u201cSize isn\u2019t everything. Talent is more important. But considering the constraints you\u2019ve got on you now, it\u2019s going to take more than anything a wolf could teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you come in.\u201d Lyra shook her head disbelievingly and popped another Cheeto in her mouth. \u201cThis is insane. Seriously, seriously insane.\u201d She tilted her head at Jaden. \u201cWhat, was my father that impressed with the way you kicked Simon\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>Jaden nodded. \u201cGuess so. It wasn\u2019t the reaction I was expecting either, but there you go.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sighed, tucking an errant curl behind her ear. She\u2019d been impressed too. He moved with so much grace, so much power. Simon fought well for a wolf, but it was all claws and teeth and muscle with her kind. It worked... but watching Jaden fight was like watching the master of some deadly dance. It was kind of beautiful. And unnervingly sexy, Lyra realized, as the mere memory of Jaden leaping and slashing got her motor running all over again.</p><p>\u201cHe loves to watch a good fighter do his thing,\u201d she said, trying to get her mind back on more practical things. \u201cSimon\u2019s going to want to kill you, though. That was ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor him, maybe.\u201d Jaden smiled, a sultry little lift of the lips that made his eyes glitter with humor. \u201cHe can try. He won\u2019t like what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him. Or hurt him again.\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished as quickly as it had come. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t realize you had a... boyfriend? Lover? That might make things more difficult. Especially if he\u2019s been lobbying to stand for you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra gave an impatient little growl. \u201cYes, he has, but not because he\u2019s any of those things. Simon is one of my closest friends, ever since we were kids. And if you don\u2019t like me jumping to conclusions about you, I suggest you give me the same courtesy.\u201d</p><p>Jaden shifted in his chair, looking disgruntled. \u201cOh,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Lyra rolled her eyes back into her head. \u201cYes, oh. And back on the topic before we got sidetracked by your weird ideas about my love life, what I was going to say is that while my father might have gotten some wild idea that you can teach me to fight dirty to win, you are both missing one very simple point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a vamp. I\u2019m a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Jaden angled his head at her. \u201cThis is... not news.\u201d</p> <p>Lyra threw her hands up, narrowly missing knocking the bag of junk food to the floor. \u201cBut it\u2019s relevant! I can\u2019t move like you. I don\u2019t have all the different funky abilities that your kind has. I can only work with what I have. And that is very different from what you started with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point,\u201d Jaden agreed. \u201cBut I took out Mark and then Simon without a lot of effort, and using very little of the ability I have at my disposal. Trust me.\u201d He leaned forward, and Lyra was struck again by his natural intensity, an interesting contrast to the glimmers of humor, and even of kindness, that she\u2019d now seen beneath. Interesting, puzzling, and slightly unwelcome. She wasn\u2019t big on surprises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I can make sure you win, Lyra. But I can teach you to compensate for your smaller size, and to attack in ways the others won\u2019t expect. You\u2019ve got plenty of natural grace and strength. There are more effective ways for you to use it than throwing yourself at another beast and biting and slashing away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? You haven\u2019t seen me fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014can tell.\u201d Blushing again, Lyra noted. It was probably wrong to be entertained by this reaction, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. It was cute. Dangerously cute.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way you move,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cI can just tell. A couple hundred years of scrapping will give you a pretty good eye, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Lyra played it off like she didn\u2019t care, but knowing that he\u2019d been watching her move\u2014closely watching her\u2014had her belly immediately tangled up in knots again. The memory of his hands on her, of the heat between them, tried to surface. Lyra pushed it away with all the force she could muster. Even if she was willing to consider this insanity, which was still a big \u201cif,\u201d she needed to consider the effect Jaden had on her. This feeling wasn\u2019t healthy, it couldn\u2019t go anywhere, and if anyone found out about it, she\u2019d be run out of town with her tail between her legs. So the question was not only whether she could handle training with a vamp, but whether she could handle that much alone time with this particular vamp.</p><p>It bothered her that she really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re going to just hang out and teach me how to fight like a vampire? That\u2019s the whole plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah.\u201d He moved his head just a little, and a lock of his hair slipped out from behind his ear and swung into his face. He didn\u2019t bother to put it back, but Lyra\u2019s fingers itched to. She lifted a hand to toy with a curl that had escaped her bun instead.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to hide out...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn your basement. Dorien said he\u2019d figure out some excuse for my being here, though, so it\u2019s not exactly hiding out.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed then, a real laugh, and the loud and lusty roll of it seemed to surprise Jaden. But the entire situation, so completely strange and ridiculous, struck her all at once. He raised an eyebrow while he watched her, but he didn\u2019t seem offended, just curious.</p><p>She shook her head, amused all over again at how confident he was in his ability to stay alive for any length of time in a town full of werewolves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cocky bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have heard that a time or two,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize that people around here are going to get one whiff of you, smell vamp and cat, and go ballistic, right? And you don\u2019t see that as a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t gone ballistic, and you\u2019ve been sitting here a while. Nor have you ever grown fangs and chased me around,\u201d he pointed out. The thought of it made her grin despite the fact that she didn\u2019t think he grasped the seriousness of his situation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I guess I\u2019m used to your particular stink by now. And I love my pack, but not everyone here is a model of self-restraint.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden shrugged. \u201cDorien assured me he would work something out. Since I would assume he\u2019s remained Alpha for so long for a reason, I\u2019m giving him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, sitting there so calm and collected, and realized two things: one, Jaden didn\u2019t understand a damned thing about werewolves, and two, he was completely serious about helping her win her rightful position in the pack. The first was strangely charming, even if it was probably going to get him killed. The second was a puzzle she couldn\u2019t begin to figure out, and that bothered her. She was pretty good at sizing people up. But Jaden was completely outside her realm of experience. Since he was determined that a vampire walking around in the heart of the Pack of the Thorn was totally hunky-dory, Lyra asked him the only question she really had remaining.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at the guarded expression that returned so quickly. \u201cWhy any of this? Why show up with my family\u2019s talisman? Why stick around to help me? I\u2019m assuming Dad is paying you, but it wouldn\u2019t be anything that would rock your world. You\u2019ve got to have better things to do than get involved in werewolf politics, and it\u2019s not like you and I hit it off right off the bat or anything. I just... don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Jaden\u2019s forehead creased with a small frown. Lyra toyed with her snack, turning her fingers orange while she poked at it. Her appetite had evaporated, an unusual occurrence. But it suddenly seemed very important to understand exactly what Jaden was doing here. Even if she had a suspicion that there were a lot of things about him she would never understand.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cI\u2019m well over two hundred years old, Lyra. For most of it, I had to do as I was told instead of doing things that interested me. But things are different now, and this interests me. I don\u2019t know why. Does it matter? You\u2019ll have my help if you want it, regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go find something else to do,\u201d Jaden replied. The words were casual, but he looked deadly serious. Lyra watched him, seeing the tension in the line of his shoulders, the set of his jaw. For whatever reason, it seemed he really wanted to be here. To be with her, in some capacity. Despite her own reaction to him, she could hardly fathom why.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d Jaden asked softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dorien was really listening when I told him this was up to you, but obviously it is. This is your fight, your decision. I can be out of here, and out of town, before he gets back if you\u2019d rather. And if you want me to stay, we can get started as soon as we have a safe place to work.\u201d</p><p>Lyra shifted uncomfortably, busying herself rolling up and clipping the top of the Cheetos bag so she didn\u2019t have to look at him. She hated being put on the spot, and this was an awfully big deal. Too big to make a snap decision about. Apart from that, the fact that she couldn\u2019t get a good read on Jaden\u2019s motivations, and that she might not ever, was tough to swallow. She knew a little about his bloodline\u2014or at least, the bloodline he\u2019d been sired into before he\u2019d hooked up with the Lilim. But all that dynastic crap, with the aristocracy and the weird medieval way the vamps governed their own, was not her world and not her concern.</p><p>Jaden was a big unknown. And she wasn\u2019t sure she was in a position to be taking a risk with him. Then again... she wasn\u2019t sure she could afford to refuse.</p><p>Frustrated, and not really thinking about what she was doing, Lyra stuck a finger in her mouth to suck off a last bit of cheese. After a moment she realized that Jaden\u2019s attention had become completely fixed on her mouth. His expression, in the instant before his eyes met hers, was one that Lyra didn\u2019t think she would ever forget. He looked hungry in a way she\u2019d never experienced, plagued by a longing so deep that it was unlikely anything could ever assuage it.</p><p>In that instant, he looked every bit the vampire: ancient, and lost, and nearly consumed by need.</p><p>Then he lifted his gaze to meet hers, and Lyra felt the hot punch of all that fathomless hunger blow right through her. He might be a vampire, she realized, but the animal in her responded frighteningly well to the animal in him. It was all she could do not to leap across the table, wrap her legs around him, and sink her teeth in.</p><p>She stiffened, folded her fingers together on the table, and crossed her legs. Jaden, too, seemed to withdraw a little. He leaned back in his chair, crossed his arms over his chest, and looked away as though bored, as though nothing had just passed between them.</p><p>Lyra realized he didn\u2019t want this either. It was a relief, in a way. But it was also no guarantee he would continue to behave himself. Or that she would.</p><p>Finally, she gave the only answer possible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m wiped, and this is a lot to take in. So why don\u2019t we do this: stick around for now. We\u2019ll give it a shot. If the whole idea crashes and burns, you go, and I come up with something else. No hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Jaden nodded. \u201cOkay. Sounds reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lyra said, trying to sound relaxed when she was anything but. She needed to get some air and some space, and wished she could get out for a four-legged run beneath the waning moon. But even that small pleasure had been denied her for some time. Too dangerous. Even here.</p><p>All she could do was head for another part of the house. It would have to be enough. And hopefully, a good night\u2019s sleep would provide her with perspective she currently lacked.</p><p>\u201cLook, I need to, um, do a couple things before I hit the sack, and I have no idea when my father will show back up.\u201d She tried for a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s probably hiding from me. Anyway, I\u2019m usually pretty nocturnal, but it\u2019s been kind of a rough week, so...\u201d She trailed off, hoping he\u2019d get the hint.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. I don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d Jaden said easily. \u201cI\u2019ll find something to do until Dorien gets back. You go ahead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Relief, and a desire to run from the room now that she\u2019d been let off the hook, had Lyra rising too quickly. She didn\u2019t register that Jaden had risen with her until it was too late and she\u2019d walked right into him. Which, she realized later, had almost certainly been by design.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she blurted, her hands coming up instinctively to regain her balance. And of course she gripped the nearest available thing: him. She felt his hands at her waist, felt the taut muscle beneath her own hands. And whether it was her weariness that had shut her usual defenses down or something more subversive, Lyra found herself melting into him, against him, allowing herself just a few seconds of the wonderful sensation of simply being held.</p><p>She heard him breathe in, felt his arms go around her to hold her up, hold her against him. Lyra let herself linger, even though she knew it was dangerous. She sensed that Jaden felt it, too, this invisible thread that seemed determined to pull them together. She allowed herself only a moment to savor the way her body fit so perfectly against his, the feel of his breath on her skin.</p> <p>Then she drew back and stood on her own two feet, trying to ignore the waves of longing and regret that swept over her the instant their connection was broken. It was a test, she told herself. To see whether she could handle being so close to Jaden without throwing herself at him or doing something stupid. And she\u2019d passed, mostly.</p><p>But it was hard to feel much triumph when she looked at Jaden and saw the raw desire reflected back at her.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Lyra,\u201d he said softly, his voice like darkest silk.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she replied. And more shaken than she could have imagined, Lyra did the only thing she knew was safe, though it was the last thing she wanted. On unsteady legs, she turned and walked away.</p><p>And wondered whether it would be so easy the next time.</p> <p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>HE SLEPT LIKE THE DEAD because he had no choice, but Jaden was haunted by dreams. He awoke agitated and disoriented, eyes darting around unfamiliar surroundings as he sat up with a jolt. He saw ugly wood paneling, a pool table, an older TV. Small windows that had had thick cloth tacked over them to keep out the light. A look down told him he\u2019d been sleeping on an old brown plaid couch, comfortably sprung and made up with sheets, blankets, and a pillow.</p><p>Jaden had woken up in so many odd places during his lifetimes that panicking didn\u2019t even occur to him. Instead, he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and collected thoughts that were always muddled upon waking at sundown. In that self-imposed darkness, he saw Lyra, her big golden eyes glowing softly as she looked up at him while he held her in his arms.</p><p>Then he remembered.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Jaden groaned, drew his knees into his chest, and dug his hands into his hair. All around him her scent rose, warm and spicy and singularly Lyra. The whole house was suffused with it. And he would be here, marinating in it, driving himself completely insane for a few more weeks.</p><p>Brilliant.</p> <p>This had all seemed like a great idea last night. Amazing what a little sleep would do for perspective. Still, he was in it now, right up to his neck.</p><p>With a low groan, Jaden swung his feet onto the floor, gave his head a sleepy scratch, and yawned. He shoved the blankets aside and stood to stretch, exhaling with pleasure as his body awakened. The cool air of the basement swirled around his naked torso, over legs that were bare but for a pair of low-slung boxers.</p><p>He seemed to remember Dorien showing him a bathroom down here with a shower. Pouring water on his head for a while sounded like a great idea, Jaden decided. He turned his head to look around, knowing he\u2019d brought in the duffel bag he always packed and carried with him in case of an extended stay anywhere.</p><p>Her voice, low and sultry, stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cHey, I brought you\u2014oh, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jaden turned to find Lyra, just three steps above the bottom of the stairs, staring at him wide-eyed in utter mortification. There was a small basket of toiletries dangling from one hand. She lifted it a little, almost apologetically.</p><p>\u201cBrought some... um... bathroom stuff. For you. You\u2019re not dressed. Yeah, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>It struck Jaden as funny that all it took to embarrass the seemingly un-embarrassable Lyra Black was to strip down to your skivvies. She turned to flee, but he had no intention of letting her. The thought of tormenting her was way too entertaining.</p> <p>\u201cNo, hang on, I can use all that,\u201d he said, walking very deliberately over and extending his hand. Intense color flooded her cheeks, and he didn\u2019t miss the way her eyes swept over every inch of him before they moved to the far wall.</p><p>She wanted him. He\u2019d finally been sure of it when she\u2019d fallen into his arms last night. Or rather, when she\u2019d let herself fall into his arms. He\u2019d felt the brief instant when she let go, felt the way her body responded to his. And if he\u2019d needed more proof, the way she\u2019d hightailed it out of the kitchen would have been more than enough.</p><p>Ordinarily, that knowledge would have been sufficient for him to make a move on her. He\u2019d be rusty, but Jaden was pretty sure he could manage a seduction without too much trouble. Going there with Lyra, however, was a far more complicated matter. What she was... what she wanted to be... and that was to say nothing of the fact that her father would happily dismember him if he so much as touched her.</p><p>He knew it was better to keep this whole operation platonic. But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t enjoy the simple things... like her reaction to finding him mostly undressed.</p><p>Jaden took the little basket by the handle and perused the contents, curious. Someone had been shopping\u2014everything, including the basket, was new. He looked up at her, though she was still very pointedly not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me dental floss.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid to meet his. \u201cYeah. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me aftershave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you used it. Do vamps not grow facial hair? There\u2019s a razor in there too. Are you going to give me a laundry list of the stuff I bought? Jesus. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. He couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d had no idea Lyra would be so appealing when she was caught off guard like this.</p><p>\u201cThanks. The poofy thing to go with the body wash is a little girly, but I\u2019ll live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I can give you some other ideas about where to shove it,\u201d grumbled Lyra. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Just... do what you have to do and come upstairs. It\u2019s been a long day already, so don\u2019t take forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what your thoughts were, but I\u2019d like to have a look at the area where you\u2019ll have the Proving before we do anything. You can give me an idea of how it works, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. I\u2019ll be upstairs waiting.\u201d She turned to go, but Jaden couldn\u2019t resist one last poke.</p><p>\u201cLyra?\u201d</p><p>She stopped, stiffened, and didn\u2019t turn around. Her voice sounded strained. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it a long day? Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>She gave a short, humorless little laugh. \u201cOh sure. The whole pack knows I\u2019m living with our very first vampire ambassador, and I spent the afternoon shopping and getting meowed at. Do days get any better than that?\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she stomped up the stairs, and Jaden didn\u2019t have the heart to make her come back. She\u2019d gotten herself into this mess, certainly... but even for as short a time as he\u2019d known her, he was sure she had good reasons. And had she said \u201cvampire ambassador\u201d?</p><p>Jaden shook his head and carried the things she had bought for him into the bathroom, stupidly pleased that she\u2019d taken the trouble. When was the last time a woman had bought him anything? Of course, this was just toothpaste and shampoo, he reminded himself. Which Lyra would be quick to reiterate if he brought it up again. But once in the little bathroom, as Jaden ran the water and picked up the shampoo from the basket, he saw there was something he\u2019d missed. It was just a small thing, a little sample of what he knew was expensive cologne, hooked into a paper card.</p><p>Intrigued, he removed the plastic tube, pulled the stopper, and sniffed. It was subtle, but warm... exactly something he would have chosen. And something he would use, as she\u2019d taken the trouble to get it for him. He knew she would brush it off when he thanked her... but he was going to thank her anyway. In her own way, Lyra was trying to make him feel at home. Him, with his perpetual duffel bag, always ready to take off at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>The sweetness of her small gesture made him realize how very long he\u2019d been running. How long it had been since he\u2019d had a real place for his things, and things for a place, anywhere.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to feel touched, but that\u2019s exactly what he was feeling. More when the realization hit him that he\u2019d been turned around when Lyra had come downstairs: she\u2019d seen his bare back, which meant she\u2019d seen his whip scars. And he\u2019d seen no evidence of it, no disgust, no judgment, and most of all, no pity when he\u2019d turned to look at her.</p><p>Unexpected. Like everything else about the woman.</p><p>Jaden sighed and slid out of his boxers, then got into the shower and closed the curtain. For a sharp-tongued, reasonably rude little she-wolf, Lyra seemed to have a disturbing number of attractive qualities. And that was before he took into account how she looked in those jeans she was wearing tonight.</p><p>All he could do was hope she kept the rest of her better nature under wraps so he could concentrate on teaching\u2014instead of further unwrapping. He\u2019d already decided not to pursue the attraction. It was tantalizing, but pointless. When this was over, he\u2019d go back to drinking blood in Tipton, she\u2019d go back to being an overgrown dog in her spare time, and that would be that. Maybe he\u2019d ask after that trio of Cait Sith Ty had mentioned, Jaden decided. Which reminded him... he needed to send Ty a quick text to check in, since he had no doubt there was at least one message waiting for him already. And after that, the phone was getting turned off and stuffed in the bottom of his duffel bag for the duration of his stay here. They knew where he was. He wasn\u2019t a child who needed looking after. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And really, the less anyone back in Tipton knew about what he\u2019d gotten up to out here, the better.</p><p>So thinking, Jaden tried to focus on the present, on the bloody Proving and where he should even begin with teaching Lyra.</p><p>But in the end, he still soaked his head.</p> <p>He\u2019d been tortured.</p><p>She\u2019d tried like hell to get the image of Jaden\u2019s back out of her head all evening, but so far, no luck. It had stunned her. And then it had taken every ounce of her willpower not to ask him about it. Jaden seemed like a fairly private person. She doubted he\u2019d open right up if she decided to push \u201cHey, who whipped you so badly you couldn\u2019t heal?\u201d as the question of the evening.</p><p>Thinking of a vampire as oppressed was just strange, completely flipped from what she\u2019d been raised with. But then, she wasn\u2019t shocked either. Lyra had spent a little time around vamps when she felt like she needed to blow Silver Falls for a while, much to her father\u2019s dismay. Not that any vampires had exactly wanted her around, but slinking into a \u201cforbidden\u201d city for shopping, fun, and cute guys who weren\u2019t any weirder at the full moon than they were any other time was an excellent way to take a break from the pressure and blow off a little steam. In her travels, she\u2019d definitely noted that there was a large underclass of bloodsuckers. And the ones they called \u201chighbloods,\u201d though less numerous, were mostly not very sweet. No one wanted a wolf around... but it was usually only the highbloods you had to actively watch out for.</p><p>Mean suckers.</p><p>Lyra glanced over at Jaden when she pulled into a parking place and killed the engine of her little red pickup. He seemed relaxed enough. For him. Of course, he\u2019d found plenty to occupy his attention out the window, so it wasn\u2019t that easy to tell.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, here we are.\u201d She glanced around the parking lot, which sat some distance from where the grass began and rolled off into the ever-encroaching trees. It was empty\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean anything. They\u2019d need to watch it.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d And before she could warn him\u2014again\u2014about the fact that there might be other wolves hanging around here, he was out of the car and striding toward the green area as though he owned the place. Lyra pursed her lips, annoyed, but she did allow herself a moment, just one, to admire the way he moved. Wolves were built for power.</p><p>Jaden was built for grace and speed. And... other things.</p><p>She groaned and got out of the car, too, anxious to get as far away from these recurring thoughts as possible. If things went well, she\u2019d be sparring with him before long. She needed to get in the mind-set of not wanting his hands on her body.</p><p>Lyra took the time Jaden hadn\u2019t, scenting the air, listening for the faintest sound of voices, or even paws treading softly. When she caught up to him, he was standing quietly, seeming to drink everything in. She figured it was worth a few quiet minutes to see if he came up with some miraculous insight she hadn\u2019t about this place, so she backed off. She walked a few paces away, tipped her head back, and enjoyed the stars dotting the night sky.</p><p>\u201cSo werewolves make their most important leadership decisions at... a playground.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke as softly as he always did, but his voice carried in the still air. Lyra looked sharply at him, arms crossed over her chest to ward off the rapidly cooling temperature. She loved it up here, but man, she really wished summer would consider coming early once in a while instead of leaving winter and spring to play tug-of-war right up until June.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a playground. Grant Park is a large open space, genius,\u201d Lyra replied. \u201cLive with it.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved just a little with the humor Lyra was beginning to understand always lived just beneath the surface, even if he was good at hiding it.</p><p>\u201cSo where does everyone sit? On the jungle gym? Or maybe the swings. Or the bouncy pony.\u201d</p><p>Lyra gritted her teeth, and it took considerable effort to unclench them enough to respond. Jaden\u2019s cute almost-smile had turned into a cocky vamp smirk. She knew that look, the patented \u201cWolves are dumb, yuk yuk yuk\u201d look she\u2019d seen on plenty of his kind. It made her want to bite him\u2014and not in a way he\u2019d enjoy. Since she couldn\u2019t do that, she went with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also a gazebo. And trees. And probably a Port-o-San somewhere, too, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find hysterical since you haven\u2019t mentally progressed since age five. Regardless, this is the place. Can we move on?\u201d</p><p>That sexy little smile, Lyra decided, was awfully feline.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJackass,\u201d she muttered under her breath, but loud enough for him to catch it. It was at that moment, watching Jaden as he craned his neck and took another look around, that Lyra realized something strange: she was actually enjoying herself.</p><p>Lyra pretended to scuff at something interesting on the ground while looking at Jaden through half-lowered lashes. He didn\u2019t need to know how closely she was watching him. It was just that his reactions to everything out here were so interesting, she thought. He acted like all this was a novelty: parks, trees, even the night sky, which she was pretty sure Silver Falls didn\u2019t have a monopoly on. He\u2019d even made some random comment about her father\u2019s flower beds on the way over. Nothing snarky, just interested... though Lyra imagined Jaden\u2019s reaction to the news that her father actually owned a garden center would be a little more cringe-worthy.</p><p>That information could remain under wraps for a while.</p><p>Lyra waited for him to say something, but when all he did was slowly wander around with wide eyes, she gave up.</p><p>\u201cJaden, seriously. They\u2019re trees. Thrillsville. Unless they have some bearing on my training as a vampire ninja, you might want to refocus.\u201d</p><p>Lyra found she actually looked forward to whatever biting response he would come up with. She didn\u2019t know many people who would engage her in verbal warfare except for Simon, and even he got tired of her sometimes. But when Jaden turned his head to look at her, she didn\u2019t get what she was hoping for. Instead, his expression was so full of honest wonderment that Lyra felt a suspicious fluttering in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Butterflies, she thought, frustrated that she couldn\u2019t just banish them. Between this and the weirdness in the kitchen, she was starting to worry this was going to be a trend.</p><p>\u201cSorry, got a little sidetracked,\u201d he said, then grinned. It lit up his entire face, and what was already darkly compelling became completely enchanting.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized how long I\u2019d been away from places like this,\u201d he added.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cPlaygrounds? You want me to push you on the swing set?\u201d</p><p>Jaden chuckled, a soft, warm sound that was completely at odds with everything Lyra associated with vampires. But then so far, so was Jaden.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d just forgotten how nice it is not to be closed in. Cities can get claustrophobic. I mean, I\u2019m used to it now, but it was hard at first. Before, I was just a\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped short, shook his head with a rueful smile. Lyra, her curiosity piqued, hoped he would finish. Why had it been hard at first? Where was he from? Who had he been? Not that it mattered, she told herself. But it was easy to forget that a couple hundred years ago, Jaden had been fully human, no doubt with a very different life planned than the one he had now.</p><p>\u201cYou were a country boy?\u201d she asked. He hesitated, looking uncertain, but then nodded.</p><p>\u201cSomerset. I\u2019d never even been to London. Now, though... I\u2019ve been everywhere.\u201d He shoved his hands in his jacket pockets and hunched slightly, what Lyra was already coming to recognize as his defensive position. He didn\u2019t seem to want to go into it. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t, either, Lyra thought, if she\u2019d lost everything and had to start from scratch.</p><p>Soothing people was not a natural ability of hers. But Lyra found herself trying to put Jaden back at ease even before she really realized what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t the English countryside, but it\u2019s got its points. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere but here,\u201d she said.</p><p>A ghost of a smile touched his lips then, so different from the irreverent grin he\u2019d worn only minutes ago. He was a moody creature, Lyra decided. One minute teasing, the next wistful. He kept surprising her.</p><p>Yet another thing she liked when she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Jaden said simply, and then shifted gears completely. The subject of his origins seemed to be closed.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Why don\u2019t you start by explaining this mystical process to me so I can understand what, exactly, the Proving is about.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded, trying to be grateful that things had veered away from the personal and back to the professional... if that\u2019s what this operation was.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Walk with me.\u201d She closed the distance between them with a few steps, and the two of them made their way across the rolling landscape of the park. The young green of the trees and grass was vibrant even in the scattered light of the wrought-iron lampposts dotting the scenery. The air smelled of damp, rich earth and spring.</p><p>She pointed off to her right, where the ground sloped down into a long, flat area. White soccer goals rose, ghostly, from the ground. \u201cThere\u2019s the soccer field. We don\u2019t use it for the Full Moon Feast every month, since it would make things... a little obvious. But it\u2019s always been used for Provings.\u201d</p><p>Jaden snorted. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t obvious at all. What do you plan to do with all the humans in town when all this is going on? Lock them in their closets?\u201d</p><p>It was Lyra\u2019s turn to chuckle. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any humans in town, Jaden. When wolves set up shop, we do it right. Plus they can sense us. Subconsciously, I guess. But humanity\u2019s survival instinct seems to kick in pretty well when it comes to not moving into a town full of their natural predators. Hunting them may be outlawed now, but it wasn\u2019t always that way... and something in them remembers.\u201d</p><p>The smile faded from her face as she thought of her cousin and his sycophants in the pack, wolves who wanted to turn the clock backward a few hundred years. He\u2019d never said he wanted to hunt humans, of course... that would be the kiss of death for his aspirations no matter how strong he was... but his attitude about them was just short of disgusting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The reign of Eric Black wouldn\u2019t exactly be a golden age if he managed to get what he wanted.</p><p>Troubled, Lyra tried to shake it off and continue. \u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a huge farm field on the other side of town that works better for the full moon celebrations, and it\u2019s a much better place to do the bonfire. Here, the layout of the woods is better suited to the Proving. We\u2019re only a couple of miles from the falls too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is significant because...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where my father will place the talisman that will eventually belong to the next Alpha. See,\u201d Lyra explained, \u201cit\u2019s actually very simple. All of us run into the woods, race to the falls, and try to sniff out the talisman. And then someone, eventually, will have to bring it back out. On two legs or four, doesn\u2019t matter. Anything goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jaden said, and Lyra didn\u2019t like the cast of doubt to his expression. \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is this is basically a free-for-all until someone delivers the talisman to your father.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight from foot to foot. \u201cWell. Yes. I did tell you this was about strength, speed... and cleverness, supposedly, though I don\u2019t think that usually comes much into play.\u201d She laughed, but it sounded a little desperate. None of this had sounded quite so hopeless when she\u2019d talked about it with her father and Simon. But she hadn\u2019t had to explain it... maybe that was the difference. She hadn\u2019t had to say it out loud and confront just how little chance she had of even surviving if she saw the matter through.</p><p>His eyes drifted back to the dark of the woods. \u201cYou, in there, with a bunch of enormous male werewolves ready to kill one another for the prize? Yes, Lyra, getting out alive is going to require some cleverness on your part. Being able to fight, sure, that\u2019ll come in handy if you end up one on one, but the rest...\u201d He trailed off, muttering to himself, and wandered away from her in the direction of the woods. Watching his retreating back, Lyra let him go and hoped he was formulating some kind of strategy.</p><p>If there was even a plausible one to be had.</p> <p>Doubt flooded her, as it did sometimes when she was alone. The pack wanted to force a destiny on her. But Lyra knew that if she accepted that fate she would die just as surely as she would if she failed at the Proving. It would just be on the inside, where no one could see.</p><p>So she would take a stand and make her own destiny. No mate to stand for her, in front of her, and hold her back. If she was fortunate enough to lead the pack she loved, she would make it there on her own merit... and there would be no questions about her fitness for the job.</p><p>\u201cI can handle this,\u201d Lyra said quietly, watching Jaden move deeper into the darkness, away from her. \u201cI can handle anything.\u201d</p><p>That was when she saw it, a fast-moving shadow flying over the ground toward Jaden, whose back was turned. It passed several feet from her, and the breeze it kicked up from its rapid movement carried with it the scent of ancient death\u2014the scent of vampire. Lyra reacted instinctively. There was no thought as she sprang forward, her body shifting in midair to become the sleek, muscular form of the wolf. When her paws hit the ground, she leaped again, pushing forward with all her might to try to reach Jaden before this interloper did.</p><p>Though what followed happened in seconds, in her memory Lyra would always see everything in slow motion: The way the shadow finally began to look like a man when it reached Jaden, the way Jaden turned, ready to fight, his coat flying around him and his eyes ablaze with unholy fire. She saw the blood burst from Jaden\u2019s chest, saw the shock and fury on his face, and then she slammed into the attacking vampire full force. They rolled together, Lyra snarling and snapping, looking for purchase with her teeth and claws.</p><p>She bit down hard on a fleshy upper arm, heard a banshee-like wail of pain just as a foul taste flooded her mouth. The vampire ripped the arm away and fled with a feral hiss, tossing Lyra aside as though she weighed nothing. She stayed loose, allowing herself to fall, to roll harmlessly when she hit the ground. Still, she was thrown with enough force to knock the wind out of her.</p> <p>It took a few precious seconds for her to drag in a breath, longer to stagger to her feet and make sure that the new vampire was gone. But he was... though she could smell him on the light breeze, lingering. Fear, anger\u2014retreat. Lyra showed her teeth in the direction it had gone, staking her claim on this territory\u2014this man.</p><p>Then she was just a woman again, stumbling in her haste to get to Jaden. She found him lying on the ground, overly pale, spidery lashes twined shut. He wore a faded royal blue T-shirt beneath his coat, and she saw it was soaked with dark blood that spread out from a puncture wound in his chest like some malignant bloom. He was splayed at an odd angle, head turned to one side.</p><p>She switched gears from fury to worry almost instantly, falling to her knees beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jaden,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou can\u2019t be dead. Your head\u2019s still attached, you can\u2019t be dead.\u201d But she remembered the sight of those vicious scars across his back. You weren\u2019t supposed to be able to scar a vampire, and yet someone had figured out how to do that. Who was to say that his torturers hadn\u2019t found a way to kill a vampire without separating the head from the body or burning him to a crisp in the sun?</p><p>Then he inhaled, a long, shuddering gasp like a man surfacing from the depths. She knew she shouldn\u2019t feel the relief that crashed through her system, so strong it would have taken her to her knees if she hadn\u2019t already been on them. But then, all of her reactions seemed outsized when it came to him.</p><p>Lyra realized now that she wasn\u2019t the only one whose life was on the line. And that was the last thing she\u2019d expected to find in common with him. But she was beginning to see that nothing about Jaden was as it seemed. So she gave up thinking for the time being and simply went with what she felt. Lyra put her hands on his chest to find that amazingly slow vampire\u2019s pulse, and she waited for him to open his eyes and tell her he was all right.</p><p>Chapter NINE</p><p>THERE WERE WORSE THINGS than waking up with a beautiful woman\u2019s hands on you.</p> <p>He surfaced, groggy but thankfully very much alive, and opened his eyes to see Lyra hovering over him. Her curls tumbled around her face, and even through his haze Jaden was struck by the concern in her bright golden eyes, twin sparks in the darkness. Her hands moved tentatively over his chest, searching for a wound he knew was no longer there.</p><p>He had no intention of stopping her examination though.</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d she said, her voice betraying her relief. \u201cAre you all right? What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother vampire. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you mean, is it?\u201d His voice sounded too quiet, too shaken to his own ears. He didn\u2019t want her to know how the encounter had rattled him. It had to be the Ptolemy\u2014had to be. The speed of the attack alone was a dead giveaway. How had they tracked him here? Was killing him, a nobody any way you looked at it no matter what mark he wore, really so important?</p><p>For once, Lyra didn\u2019t have a snide comeback. It was a shock to realize she was just as shaken as he was.</p><p>\u201cYou had a hole. Like halfway through your chest,\u201d she said, her hands continuing to roam and press and stroke. He didn\u2019t think she even knew she was doing it.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was your heart. I mean, I know the whole stake through the heart thing isn\u2019t supposed to be true, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he said gently, catching her hands with his. He held them against his chest, letting her feel the slow and steady beat of the heart that had been keeping this rhythm for centuries. His hands warmed quickly to hers, and he felt another curl of unexpected pleasure when Lyra made no move to pull away from him.</p><p>\u201cA stake through the heart wouldn\u2019t kill me,\u201d Jaden explained. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good way to incapacitate someone so you can finish the job the right way.\u201d He tried for a smile, but it felt tight and put on. \u201cHe missed, thanks to you. I guess we\u2019re even now.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been there, if her sudden transformation and attack hadn\u2019t startled his would-be assassin, Jaden knew he wouldn\u2019t still have his head attached to his shoulders. Lyra Black had saved his life. It was a difficult thing to wrap his mind around, but he knew it was something he\u2019d be grappling with as the shock receded.</p><p>And she looked so bloody concerned about him. He wanted it\u2014and he was afraid to want it. To want her. He gave a damn about very few people. Every single one he cared about had put him through hell once or twice by trying to get him- or herself killed, so he was glad it was a small group. But he had never expected to add Lyra to it. This was just supposed to be a one-off for him, a strange little physical fascination that burned itself out for him before too long.</p><p>With his hands tangled with hers, her breath warming his face, Jaden realized he\u2019d been very, very wrong.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let some outside vamp come in here and take you down,\u201d Lyra said, looking flustered at his thanks. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, you\u2019re under pack protection. Which means no one kicks your ass, or stabs you with pointed sticks, but me.\u201d</p><p>She was coming around, he saw, and this time his smile was genuine. He\u2019d caught enough tantalizing glimpses of what was beneath the tough, beautiful shell she wore to know there was a softer heart there than she let on. Jaden knew she would move soon, pull her hands away and break contact, ending the moment. He rubbed his thumb over her knuckles, willing her to stay. Her expression softened, changed.</p><p>Jaden slowly sat up, her hands still in his. He disentangled one hand, brushed his fingers down the silken softness of her cheek. She went very still but made no move to push him away. Instead, her eyes simply stayed locked with his, her expression open, waiting\u2014longing. Before he could dwell on how many ways he might regret doing it, Jaden slid his hand into her hair and pulled her mouth to his.</p><p>She leaned in and met him halfway.</p><p>Her lips were soft, so incredibly soft. Jaden kept the pressure light, lingering against her mouth, savoring this first small taste of her. He heard her soft, startled intake of breath at the initial contact. For a moment, he thought she might shove him away, or slap him, or bite... and she would have been justified in any of those reactions. She wasn\u2019t his. He was taking advantage. He was taking an enormous chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he felt what she must have felt\u2014hot sparks of pleasure where their lips touched that quickly spread to the rest of his body. It might have startled him if he\u2019d been able to focus on anything but that incredible sensation. Jaden had never felt anything like it.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s arms slid up and around his neck, and her body curved into him, melting against him just as her mouth did. Her lips parted, her tongue flickered out to give his a tentative brush. The slow burn between them ignited with a wave of hot need that rolled through him like a summer storm. Jaden heard himself make a sound, some soft, longing sound that he knew gave away far too much of what he was feeling, what he wanted of her.</p><p>She seemed to know, to understand. They fell into one another at the same time.</p> <p>Lyra\u2019s hand fisted in his shirt as the kiss began to turn hotter, hungrier. The initial sweetness of the moment vanished in the face of a desire that had been simmering beneath the surface ever since Jaden had first set eyes on her. When he felt her pushing him back to the ground, he allowed it, pulling her with him and then rolling her so that she was the one on her back. Jaden partially covered her, his weight on one hip, savoring the feeling of finally having her beneath him. Lyra didn\u2019t seem to mind: her kisses became insistent nips and licks while her hands roamed over his shirt, then slipped under it, seeking out bare skin. The muscles of his stomach jumped and twitched at the light glide of her fingers.</p><p>Jaden let out a shuddering breath. He cupped one small, perfect breast through her shirt, thumbing the taut pebble of her nipple. He was rewarded with an approving moan. Her hands grew more demanding, as did her mouth. Jaden was happy to urge her on, filling his hands with her, drawing out the wild thing that was the natural essence of her being.</p><p>Letting his own beast surface in response.</p><p>So this is what it\u2019s like with a wolf, he thought dazedly. The vamps have been missing out...</p><p>A thin sheen of perspiration began to appear on his normally cool skin. Lyra was making him hot, hotter than he ever remembered being. His heart picked up the rhythm of hers as they fumbled together on the ground in an eager tangle of hands and mouths and teeth. He could think of nothing but getting closer to her, of lying with her in the grass, skin to skin. It wasn\u2019t until Jaden moved to settle himself fully between her legs, throbbing hard and hot against the very center of her, that he realized how perilously close he was to embarrassing himself the way he hadn\u2019t since he was a young and awkward mortal. He pressed into her, a gentle, teasing thrust, and groaned. The sensation made his head swim. Her accompanying gasp only intensified the sensation.</p> <p>He could imagine how she would look, spread beneath him, her skin tawny in the moonlight. How she would feel, so slick, so ready for him to move within her...</p><p>Lyra\u2019s fingers slipped beneath the waist of his jeans, seeking out the hottest part of him. His eyes slipped shut. Her fingers closed around him.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cLyra!\u201d</p><p>The unfamiliar voice sliced through the air, freezing the two of them in place. For a moment, neither of them moved, waiting to see if the disembodied voice was real or simply some kind of warning from whatever powers lurked behind the immortal veil, informing the two of them that the various vampire and werewolf deities did not find their performance amusing.</p><p>\u201cLyra!\u201d</p> <p>The second time, there was no question the voice belonged to a real person, and getting closer. Jaden opened his eyes to see the raw passion on Lyra\u2019s face vanish in favor of confusion and embarrassment. Her hand was quickly withdrawn, which sadly did nothing to quell his very obvious arousal. Jaden struggled to find something, anything to say that might bring back some of the heat she\u2019d just allowed herself to feel for him. His entire body felt kissed by the sun.</p><p>Don\u2019t be ashamed of it, he willed her. Just don\u2019t be ashamed of me, of this...</p><p>\u201cI... Jaden, that\u2019s Simon... crap, we need to... can you...?\u201d She spoke breathlessly, wiggling a little to try to get him off her. Jaden had to grit his teeth to grant her fragmented request, since her wiggling had the opposite effect of what she\u2019d intended. He managed to shift his weight, sliding off her to rest on one hip on the ground. Lyra slid up to a sitting position, her knees tucked close to her chest. He noted how quickly she scooted away from him, how she angled her body toward the approaching Simon instead of him.</p><p>He knew, on a rational level, they\u2019d let it go too far. But he wasn\u2019t interested in rational right now. Not with his body screaming they hadn\u2019t gone nearly far enough.</p><p>Jealousy was quick to move in. And the young wolf now running toward them was a perfect target.</p><p>Simon\u2019s face was dark with concern and suspicion when he reached them, and when he spoke, it had the slightly breathless quality that indicated he\u2019d come to find them in a hurry. Jaden watched the wolf\u2019s sharp gaze take in the picture he and Lyra presented, on the ground together in the dark and fairly rumpled besides. It was hard to suppress a smug smile when he saw the pieces click together.</p><p>\u201cWell. I guess I don\u2019t need to ask if everything\u2019s all right out here,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jaden saw Lyra flush. Fortunately, he had no similar shame to get in his way.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaden said, rising to a sitting position from where he\u2019d been resting on one arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were... I was just... Jaden had some trouble,\u201d Lyra said, rushing out the words so that she sounded even guiltier. It didn\u2019t bother Jaden a bit, and he enjoyed watching Simon\u2019s expression darken even further.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So you were playing doctor. Got it.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s tone was so dry that a single laugh escaped Jaden before he could swallow it. It didn\u2019t seem like the wolf wanted his sense of humor appreciated right then, though. When he turned his dark eyes on Jaden, they were hot and accusatory.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny, huh? You just waltz into town like you own it, set yourself up at the Alpha\u2019s house, have yourself a little sample of the local wares\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, Jesus, I am not a product!\u201d Lyra snapped. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not sampling anything! Do you see the blood on his shirt? Some other vamp was out here and took a shot at him. I was making sure he was still alive\u2014which is what most non-heartless people would be doing when the person they\u2019re with gets a stake through the chest!\u201d</p><p>It was to Simon\u2019s credit, Jaden supposed, that he was able to put his anger aside so quickly. Even if most of his concern seemed to be for Lyra.</p><p>\u201cSo there was a vamp out here.\u201d He cursed colorfully, then extended a hand to Lyra. \u201cDid he touch you, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Simon helped Lyra to her feet, his hands lingering on hers as he looked her over. Lyra\u2019s easy acceptance of Simon\u2019s assistance only fed the little green monster now perched on Jaden\u2019s shoulder. He watched silently and fumed as he got to his own feet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Whoever it was, he was only interested in me,\u201d Jaden growled. \u201cLyra drove him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter safe than sorry,\u201d Simon said. He no longer looked angry, but the suspicion remained. Jaden glanced at Lyra, but she intentionally looked away from him. Frustration formed into a hard little knot in his gut, which only intensified when she focused her attention back on Simon.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine. Nearly took the guy\u2019s arm off, so there\u2019s that.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNot very tasty, but it worked.\u201d</p><p>Simon looked grim. \u201cYou got lucky,\u201d he said, and Jaden felt a smug satisfaction when Lyra stiffened, a murderous gleam coming into her eyes. It had been the exact wrong thing to say. He decided to add a little fuel to the fire.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck. It\u2019s called courage and strength, both of which Lyra has. The vampire who attacked us wouldn\u2019t have run if he\u2019d thought he could win easily.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou may not see it, but my kind has no problem recognizing those qualities in our women.\u201d</p><p>The knot in his gut eased a little when Lyra looked at him again. Some of the softness and warmth had returned to her eyes, and the tightness around her mouth eased a little to make way for a small smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>Simon looked between them, suspicion written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing out here anyway? Dorien said the vamp wanted a look at the site of the Proving, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything to see.\u201d His tone sharpened when he focused on Lyra again. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t run into Eric. You won\u2019t be the only one out here getting ready this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we had, and if there had been a problem, I would have helped her take care of it,\u201d Jaden said flatly, meeting Simon\u2019s hostile glare with his own. \u201cA better question is why you came running out here after her. Lyra doesn\u2019t need some sad little cub nipping at her heels.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes flashed, narrowed, and Jaden felt the return of a bit of pleasure, though of an uglier sort. His blood was still pounding through his veins. He was hungry, overheated, and in desperate need of some sort of release. If that release came in the form of pounding the shit out of Simon again, so be it.</p><p>\u201cOh really? I know what she doesn\u2019t need. Some vamp who wants to take advantage while he\u2019s slumming it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Lyra snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in watching another one of these.\u201d She rounded on Simon. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to tell me why you came after me out here, then I\u2019ll go get the information elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away, leaving both Jaden and Simon scrambling to go after her. They didn\u2019t have time, however, for more than a couple of ugly looks at one another. Lyra walked too fast for more.</p><p>\u201cWait! You can\u2019t just leave, Lyra!\u201d Simon said.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a good reason for coming to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d Jaden shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re a stalker.\u201d</p><p>Simon flashed his fangs at Jaden. When Lyra kept going, Simon cursed softly. \u201cIt was the vamp. Reed picked up the scent about a half hour ago. He called your father, who got a few of the wolves out tracking. And he sent me to find you.\u201d He slid an accusatory glance at Jaden. \u201cWe never get vamps here. Not until you. So I\u2019m thinking you must have brought this one with you, one way or another.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSimon,\u201d Lyra said, her tone warning. Jaden held up his hand, however, meeting Simon\u2019s glare head-on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Whoever he was, he seemed to be here for me. We don\u2019t usually attack one another just for the hell of it, and he was set to kill if it hadn\u2019t been for Lyra.\u201d</p><p>Simon blinked, as though trying to process the fact that Jaden had agreed with him.</p> <p>\u201cWell... oh. Did you, ah, did you get a look at him? Someone you know?\u201d</p><p>Jaden recalled a split-second vision of fangs bared in a triumphant grin, eyes blazing dark blue. He shook his head. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get a very good look, but he was no one I know.\u201d Then he added blandly, \u201cContrary to what you seem to think, we don\u2019t actually all know one another.\u201d</p><p>Lyra, her arms wrapped around herself, pinned him with an equally intense look, though the concern in her eyes made it far easier for him to take.</p><p>\u201cWho would do this?\u201d</p><p>Jaden shrugged, suddenly uncomfortable with his decision to keep his Ptolemy problems to himself. Still, what good would talking about it do? The prospect of assassins from an ancient and powerful vampire dynasty showing up here to take him out would only get him run off that much more quickly. And he needed to be sure that was the case before making his own decisions about the safety of being here\u2014for him, and everyone else. He was no fan of werewolves, but he wasn\u2019t interested in getting a bunch of them killed on his account either.</p> <p>\u201cI ran a lot of errands back when I was a servant of the Ptolemy. Some of those errands could be classified as dirty work, but I had no choice. It\u2019s possible this is connected. But that could mean one of hundreds of things. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Lyra blew out a breath. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just great,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Whether this was intentional or not, you\u2019re going to get blamed for this,\u201d Simon warned him, his eyes cold. \u201cWe don\u2019t like vamps on our territory. One unwelcome visitor is enough. Two is going to get the pack up in arms, and you\u2019re going to hear about it if you\u2019ve got the balls to stay here. Our kind hasn\u2019t forgotten what yours is capable of, what they did to us. Dorien can\u2019t protect you from everything... or everyone.\u201d</p><p>Jaden gave him a small, humorless smile. \u201cNow that I know there\u2019s an issue, I can take perfectly good care of myself. You don\u2019t need to play the victim card with me either. Wolves don\u2019t have the corner on the market for subjugation. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to go back. Dad will know if someone\u2019s picked up the trail again.\u201d She looked at him more closely, and Jaden found himself wanting to open up, to tell everything to the woman who belonged to those fathomless, burning eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you have no idea who this could be?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly it was all too much. Even the open air became claustrophobic. He didn\u2019t want questions, didn\u2019t want to feel beholden to this woman who tied him up in knots. He wanted to sink his teeth into her, wanted to feed, to kiss and soothe and lose himself in her. And most of all, he wanted freedom from the Ptolemy, freedom to be able to live whatever sort of life he wanted without the threat of recapture or death hanging over his head. Impossible things.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is, but I\u2019ll have a look around. Tell Dorien I\u2019ll have a word with him about it when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes glittered in the dark. \u201cSure. Running off so soon?\u201d</p><p>Jaden didn\u2019t give a damn what Simon thought. He did, however, care what Lyra thought of him, though to feel that way was setting them both up for disappointment. She looked as vulnerable as he\u2019d ever seen her, watching him get ready to run away from her. He wondered if she already regretted the kiss. Did she think he\u2019d brought some plague of vampires to her pack\u2019s sanctuary?</p><p>If she did... was she right?</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back?\u201d she asked. Such a simple question. A simple, loaded question. She tried to sound unconcerned, but he could already see through the cracks he\u2019d made in her armor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before sunrise. I need to... take care of a few things. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he added, offering a small smile, hoping he could tease her back into a version of Lyra he knew how to deal with. He\u2019d started something that, for once, he had no idea how to finish.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I won\u2019t.\u201d Defensive. And a lie, but one he was glad for.</p> <p>Jaden gave Lyra one last, lingering look, graced Simon with a small, mocking bow. Then he did the only thing he knew to do, the only thing he had ever done when the heat had gotten to be too much. He shifted into a sleek black cat, the form he often felt freer in than his own human skin.</p><p>And he ran.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p><p>LYRA HAD HOPED to wake up feeling better.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d opened her eyes earlier this afternoon feeling like something someone scraped off the bottom of a shoe. Her dreams had been plagued with visions of herself and Jaden, back in the park. Except in her fantasies, they hadn\u2019t stopped at heated kisses. But no matter how he touched her, how he made her moan, some part of her had known it wasn\u2019t real. She\u2019d known it would be so much better if she would just go to him and\u2014</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Lyra muttered, glaring at the amber-colored bottle in front of her and ignoring all the music and pleasant chatter that surrounded her. Stupid damned vampire, she thought. Why couldn\u2019t he have just kept his hands\u2014and that amazing mouth of his\u2014to himself?</p><p>Of course, it might have helped if she hadn\u2019t been such a willing participant in his little cross-species experiment, testing the laws of attraction. But how could she spar with someone whose clothes she wanted to rip off?</p><p>Lyra trailed a finger down the condensation on the outside of the bottle, watching the water drip slowly onto the bar. At least she knew he\u2019d come back last night. She\u2019d checked. A couple times... or ten. When she\u2019d headed here around dinnertime, Jaden was asleep and peaceful and obnoxiously carefree in her pitch-black basement. She\u2019d never even heard him come in just before sunrise.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d been upstairs waiting or anything.</p><p>Lyra propped her elbows on the bar and sighed heavily. She knew she was wallowing, and she planned to enjoy it for a while before she had to figure out what to do. She took a small sip of the beer she\u2019d been nursing for the past half hour and managed to smile at Beth, the bartender, even though there was a nasty headache brewing at the periphery of her temples, beginning to throb with a distant but noticeably achy drumbeat.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe your father\u2019s letting him stay. And at your house,\u201d Simon said for what was possibly the hundredth time. His green hazel eyes were growing heavy lidded and bloodshot, and his wavy brown hair was standing up oddly in the places where he\u2019d run his fingers through. After years of being the sweet, adorable boy-next-door without an enemy in the world, Simon had finally found a proper nemesis in Jaden. And all he could seem to think about was going full metal werewolf on his ass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing, Simon,\u201d she muttered, which earned her a derisive snort. It bothered her to think all this overemotional posturing was on her behalf. This possessive/protective thing Simon had going on lately was both weird and unwelcome. She loved their friendship just the way it was. Why did he have to try to put kinks in it?</p><p>\u201cLike he\u2019s so special,\u201d Simon continued, choosing to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cHe won\u2019t seem so special when this place is overrun with bloodsuckers. Vampire ambassador, my ass. I don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sucked in a breath and scanned the area around them to see whether anyone was paying attention to her drunken friend. That a vampire had wandered onto their territory last night was now common knowledge\u2014word traveled fast. But that it had attacked Jaden was supposed to stay between the four of them. Dorien didn\u2019t want the pack unnecessarily on edge.</p><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t seem to bother him that his only daughter was about as on edge as it got at the moment.</p><p>\u201cVolume control, Simon,\u201d she growled softly, then assumed a more normal tone. \u201cI told you why he\u2019s here. The Lilim\u2019s leader is so new she doesn\u2019t have all the usual vamp/wolf baggage. She\u2019s interested in knowing more about us, and I guess wanted to make a good impression, so... Jaden\u2019s here checking us out.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her balefully. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smacked Simon in the stomach with the back of her hand, making him grunt. \u201cShut up, Simon. I told you, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to want to discuss it any more than she did, but she did wonder just how much he really suspected about last night.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. So what do we get out of this again? Besides \u2018not attacked by cat vamps offended that we killed their stupid ambassador\u2019? Because the good impression thing isn\u2019t really working out so far, and I can\u2019t see that any of us are getting much out of this.\u201d</p><p>Lyra shrugged and took a sip of her beer. \u201cHe\u2019s only been here a couple of days. Maybe things will turn around and we\u2019ll get an actual alliance. You never know.\u201d</p><p>It was complete BS, of course, but Lyra found herself wishing that part was true. The thought of added protection for her pack from such a powerful source had a lot of appeal. It always had, actually, for Alphas going way back before her time. The problem was the wolves\u2019 overtures toward the vampires had generally ended in bad blood and slaughter. Even if the Lilim\u2019s hand was extended, Lyra wasn\u2019t sure the members of her pack wouldn\u2019t just bite it off.</p><p>Simon rolled his eyes, unwittingly backing up her concerns.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. These vamps are just so different. They\u2019re probably scoping Silver Falls out for the Lilim\u2019s summer home or something. Maybe if we\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll let us stay and serve them drinks. Fan them with palms. The usual things they think they deserve. We\u2019re supposed to feel special because a dynasty is finally paying attention to us? They\u2019re either desperate or stupid.\u201d He paused. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little curious about which, but not enough to want the cat vamp to stick around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyra didn\u2019t bother to argue with him, watching his shoulders sag as he toyed with his glass. She hated having to lie to Simon about why Jaden was here. Just like she hated being at odds with him. They\u2019d been each other\u2019s support for a long time. She gave him an affectionate nudge, and when he looked at her through his reddened eyes, she was surprised to find them sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not yourself lately. Even before this mess with the Proving. And... everything.\u201d She decided mentioning Jaden by name would just make him shut down.</p><p>Simon lifted his eyebrows at her. He really was handsome, she thought. A little sloppy right this second, but really classically good looking. She\u2019d always wondered why another girl hadn\u2019t snatched him up. She felt more than a little guilt at the thought that she might have scared those theoretical girls away... or that he\u2019d simply been waiting for her.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou being determined to get yourself killed is kind of putting me out lately, Lyra. So there\u2019s that. And what do you mean I\u2019m not myself? I\u2019m not boring? Dependable? Always around because I have nothing better to do? That stuff never changes.\u201d</p><p>Lyra frowned at the edge in his voice. \u201cI meant friendly, fun, and charming, none of which you are being right now. Or recently.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long moment, as though trying to decide what to say. He didn\u2019t look hurt, at least. But this side of Simon was unfamiliar to her. It wasn\u2019t like him to be troubled and broody. She worried. Of course, lately, it felt like all she did was worry. She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Simon was getting in on the action. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Lyra. I know you want all this. But I just keep thinking... there\u2019s a lot more out there than Silver Falls.\u201d He looked away. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not the only one who gets tired of being pigeonholed.\u201d</p><p>It hurt to hear him so down. She\u2019d had no idea he was dissatisfied with pack life, and that hurt more... because he hadn\u2019t told her. Better late than never, she guessed. If she could only find the words to fix what ailed him.</p> <p>\u201cSimon,\u201d she said gently, \u201cyou\u2019re great. You\u2019re one of the most promising members of the pack guard, everyone says so. Not to mention you\u2019re one of the only people who\u2019s able to put up with me on a regular basis. You\u2019re like...\u201d She searched for a good comparison. \u201cLike the local knight in shining armor. Just werewolf style.\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth curved up, but his eyes were full of melancholy. \u201cFor who, exactly?\u201d With a deep breath, he got to his feet, swaying only slightly. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take a page out of the cat vamp\u2019s book and go get some air. I\u2019ll see you later, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>Her next response wasn\u2019t something she usually did. Physical affection just wasn\u2019t her thing, and she\u2019d never been one of those girls who couldn\u2019t let a friend go without some kind of gushy display. But before she could think better of it, Lyra rose and wrapped her arms around her friend. She felt like she was losing her grip on everything she cared about with no solution in sight, and something in her compelled her to reach out even though she knew damn well doing so would get the gossips going again.</p><p>She felt Simon stiffen, then relent for the briefest of moments as his arms went around her to give her a single, tight squeeze. Somewhere beside them, she heard Beth give an approving coo.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s changing,\u201d Lyra said unhappily, her head against Simon\u2019s broad chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cI guess things do.\u201d Then he disentangled himself and stepped back, leaving her just as surely as Jaden had last night. The difference was that she didn\u2019t even have Jaden to lose. Simon looked off to his left, toward the door to the bar, and frowned.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. And he called me a stalker.\u201d Simon gave her a meaningful look. \u201cSteer clear of him, if you know what\u2019s good for you, Lyra. Vamps are nothing but trouble. And that one\u2019s got more than his fair share. I\u2019m going to be watching him.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my job. I don\u2019t care how pretty he is, or how mysterious or whatever it is you see there. You\u2019d better start thinking with your head, or you\u2019re not going to get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Simon leveled a hard glare across the room, where a commotion had kicked up in the form of growling, muttering wolves rapidly clearing from the path of a newcomer to the bar. Then he turned and headed for the back door, leaving her to deal with the situation all on her own. Lyra\u2019s stomach sank as she looked around and saw every wolf in the place tense, bristle, their eyes lighting like lamps in the dim room. And of course, she knew exactly why.</p><p>She could smell him: vamp, feline, and utterly male. Of course, the difference between her and the rest of the wolves seemed to be that while his scent made them want to attack, she sort of wanted to find the source and... roll around in it.</p><p>Her heart picked up its pace as soon as she caught sight of his dark head. He held it high, ignoring the hostile glares, the low growls, and the not-so-quiet epithets as he strode into the room with the sort of preternatural grace no human, or wolf, could possess. Jaden seemed to take in everything and yet look at nothing, avoiding the direct eye contact many of her pack would have taken as a challenge. She couldn\u2019t seem to move, drinking in the sight of him hungrily. His lean form was all in black, and his eyes glowed their bright blue as they swept the room. Assessing threat, she supposed. A wise move, considering the thinly veiled hatred with which most of the wolves were watching him.</p><p>When those eyes settled on her, she knew immediately that he\u2019d seen her hugging Simon. He looked hot, bothered, and fixed on her with a raw possessiveness that knocked the breath right out of her. This was everything she\u2019d feared, everything she\u2019d sworn she didn\u2019t want even though it tempted her like nothing ever had.</p><p>Why him? she wondered. Why me?</p><p>Since bolting wasn\u2019t really an option, Lyra decided to take what control she could. She felt dozens of eyes on her, some curious, most suspicious, and a few outright hostile. The room had fallen strangely quiet, the only sounds coming from the jukebox and the electronic poker machine. Lyra shook her hair back behind her shoulders, straightened as though she hadn\u2019t a care in the world, and strolled as casually as she could to where Jaden was making his way toward her.</p> <p>Lyra thought he stuck out like a sore thumb, but in the most appealing sort of way. She gave him credit for guts, or at least hardheadedness, for showing up here. No matter how firm her father had been in his edict that the cat vamp shouldn\u2019t be touched, however, some of the less restrained (and drunker) members of the pack were going to forget themselves before too long.</p><p>She needed to get him out of here.</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d she said coolly by way of greeting as she made her way toward him, coming to a stop within a couple of feet.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he returned. She could sense the caution in him, despite the hungry way he was still looking at her. No big bad wolf could have done it better. Once more, he looked around at the pack members, now openly gawking at him. How many had ever even seen a vampire? she wondered. The Thorn was a closed society. One the vamps had ignored for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cYour father said that if I wanted to start meeting some of the pack, this is the place.\u201d</p><p>Lyra lifted her eyebrows as a wave of quiet laughter erupted around them.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. You could say that,\u201d she said. Gods, what was he doing here?</p><p>\u201cHey, vamp! You can turn into a kitty, right? Why don\u2019t you show us?\u201d</p><p>More laughter, louder now. Lyra recognized the voice of Dan Marshall, one of her father\u2019s buddies, and barely suppressed a groan. This could go south quickly if Jaden got defensive. Fortunately, he seemed cool\u2014so far. And she really needed to come up with an exit strategy that didn\u2019t look like she was getting too comfortable with him. Tightropes, she thought. Her life was walking them.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to shed in such a nice place,\u201d Jaden replied, looking directly at Dan with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cAnd I like the odds better if I buy you all a round instead. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Lyra held her breath, expecting the worst. But Dan simply laughed in his ragged whiskey voice. \u201cSure. We\u2019re not that easy to butter up, vamp... but buying drinks is a start I\u2019m fine with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect you would be. Drinks on me, then,\u201d Jaden said, provoking several hoots and howls from the peanut gallery that, Lyra found, were a great deal friendlier than she\u2019d expected just a few minutes ago. She let out the breath she\u2019d been holding as activity resumed all around them, maybe a little quieter than it had been but minus some of the tension.</p><p>Jaden leaned in close now that he had the chance of not being overheard. \u201cYou\u2019re late. I\u2019ve been up for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>She fought the urge to fidget as his breath fanned over her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who took off last night. I didn\u2019t even know if we were still on.\u201d</p><p>He backed off a little, seeming to realize that whispering in Lyra\u2019s ear for too long was not going to create a picture she would want. Instead, he spoke in a low voice that she doubted anyone would hear but her over the resumed conversations.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to watch me eat. Was I wrong?\u201d</p><p>The image in her head was immediate: Jaden, his arms around some attractive blonde, his teeth in her neck. She felt her claws bite into her palms when she closed her hands into fists. No, she realized. He wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, and you know it,\u201d Lyra said, keeping her voice as low as his. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess we do,\u201d he said. \u201cLater, though. Your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded. He didn\u2019t need to finish. She was well aware that her father was angry that last night had been a bust. He was focused on keeping his daughter alive. And Lyra knew she needed to focus on the important things too. Simon had been right about that: fixating on Jaden wasn\u2019t going to get her what she wanted. In fact, she could easily lose everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go give the bartender my credit card,\u201d Jaden said, looking a little glum as he watched Beth pull a bottle of what looked like expensive champagne from beneath the bar while two grinning wolves gave him a cheerful thumbs-up. \u201cAnd then we can go.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded and watched him stride away, trying not to be amused at the free-for-all beginning at the bar. Beth was busy filling some very large glasses with some sort of concoction Lyra had never seen before. Looked like tonight was going to be a party. At least no one could say wolves didn\u2019t know how to have a good time. And the slaps Jaden got on the back from a few of the braver members of the pack gave her a little glimmer of hope. Even if the first one caught Jaden off guard and nearly knocked him over.</p><p>Which was undoubtedly by design.</p> <p>As she watched him give that sardonic little smile to Beth, who looked suspiciously pink-cheeked, she found herself wishing, just a little, that things were different. Stupid, she knew, but true. It wasn\u2019t every guy who could walk into a den of werewolves and navigate it without a scratch.</p><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t out of the Inn yet. And the sight of a very large, very familiar wolf making a beeline for Jaden made her feel like sinking through the floor. Looked like this was the night for baptism by fire. Lyra walked as quickly as she could on her long legs to get between Jaden and the one pack member she\u2019d hoped he would never have to meet. She put her game face on before she got to them, knowing that to show any real interest in Jaden was to risk having him taken away from her as soon as Eric could manage it.</p><p>\u201cEric,\u201d she said smoothly when she reached the two of them, stepping casually (she hoped) in between. \u201cI see you\u2019re introducing yourself. Jaden, this is my cousin, Eric Black.\u201d</p><p>Jaden raised one slim brow and very deliberately looked Eric\u2019s hulking form over. Finally, he extended his hand. \u201cPleasure.\u201d</p><p>As expected, Eric ignored the proffered hand in favor of simple intimidation. He didn\u2019t crack even an artificial smile\u2014that wasn\u2019t his way. Tall and dark, with golden eyes like all the Blacks, he would have been handsome if he didn\u2019t always look like he was about to sentence someone to a painful execution.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re our new guest,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI heard there was a cat vamp in town, but I wasn\u2019t going to believe it until I saw you for myself.\u201d He looked Jaden over very deliberately. \u201cI forgot how small you vamps can be.\u201d</p><p>Jaden smiled blandly. \u201cYes. Tiny. It\u2019s a wonder you noticed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, you\u2019re staying well off the territory to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaden is here to learn about us,\u201d Lyra said very deliberately. \u201cNot to cause trouble. He\u2019s our guest, and the Alpha expects him to be treated that way.\u201d</p><p>Eric turned his bright gold gaze on her, and she saw the violence she\u2019d heard so much about lurking just below the surface.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already causing trouble. Everyone knows there was another vampire in town last night. Are you telling me that\u2019s a coincidence? Letting even one in is a mistake. First you get one, then another... then you\u2019re overrun. Like cockroaches. Those things live forever, too, seems like.\u201d</p> <p>Lyra looked around at the faces of her pack, watching them. Waiting to see if she would stand up to Eric or back down, to see whether she would defend the vampire to a fellow wolf.</p><p>\u201cI trust my father\u2019s judgment. If he accepts Jaden\u2019s presence, then so do I. So should we all. He\u2019s been a good Alpha.\u201d She looked around. \u201cChange can be difficult, but it isn\u2019t always bad.\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s expression hardened amid the assenting murmurs and reluctant nods. His smile was humorless. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll wait and see. Dorien is worthy of trust. But I doubt a vampire is, no matter how pretty his promises are.\u201d</p><p>He stalked away, leaving Lyra feeling shaken and unsure. She was very good at keeping those things to herself. But when she turned back to Jaden, he looked as though he could see everything she was feeling as plain as day.</p><p>Suddenly, everything about the Inn\u2014the people, the music, the noise\u2014was too much for her. The headache that had been threatening all day felt like it was coming in for a landing, and she wanted to be the hell out of here before she crumpled up into a ball. Her looking comfortable leaving with Jaden now seemed decidedly less important.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, and his lack of commentary told her that he did see how close to her breaking point she was. \u201cLead the way,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him again as she headed through the crowd, feeling him right behind her like a shadow. People moved out of her way, most offering friendly good-byes, a few goggling at Jaden as though he was some kind of sideshow freak. She heard him murmuring a few cordial good-byes of his own and wondered whether it would make any difference. It wouldn\u2019t if Eric, who already had a crowd around him at the bar, had his way. And no one would ultimately go against him, because despite everything, he was the strongest of them all.</p> <p>She pushed the door open and walked out into the night, trying to convince herself that she could do what was needed, that she had a real chance to claim her birthright. But when she tried to imagine the Proving, all she could see was Eric\u2019s broad form, easily twice her size, and his cold, unblinking glare.</p><p>For the first time, she didn\u2019t feel a single shred of confidence that she would prevail.</p><p>All she had was tattered hopes, an unwanted vampire, and dull despair.</p><p>Chapter ELEVEN</p><p>LYRA UNLOCKED her little pickup with her keychain, jerked open the driver\u2019s side door, and slid in. Jaden quickly got in on the passenger side. Once the doors slammed, they sat there silently for a moment in the dark. She\u2019d felt awkward in the bar, but at least there had been people around as a buffer. Now, it felt a lot more... fraught.</p><p>Lyra began to fumble with getting the key in the ignition, uncomfortably reminded of her first make-out session. The car, the dark, the tension...</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you drive here?\u201d she blurted out. It seemed better to fill the silence with words, even stupid words. She felt lousy enough. Uncomfortable silence wasn\u2019t going to fix anything. And since she knew what was coming, she really, really wanted to get it over with.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t need to drive. I think you\u2019re forgetting that you\u2019re not the only one who can get around pretty quickly on four feet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The silence returned with a vengeance. When she heard Jaden shift a little in his seat, it occurred to her that he was just as uncomfortable too. Lyra gritted her teeth, ready to plunge in. But as she opened her mouth, Jaden spoke.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t thank you,\u201d he said. \u201cFor saving my life last night.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to look at him, startled into silence. He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably what you did, you know. I\u2019m not saying I couldn\u2019t have managed to get out of it, but...\u201d he trailed off, looking slightly embarrassed. \u201cYeah, probably not. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. You\u2019re welcome,\u201d Lyra said, thrown off balance by the unexpected gratitude. In truth, she hadn\u2019t thought much about what had happened before they\u2019d ended up on the ground together. Only then did she realize she\u2019d taken Jaden\u2019s assertion that he didn\u2019t know who his attacker was at face value.</p><p>An odd thing, to put faith so easily in a vampire. But there was something about Jaden that made it easy. Probably too easy, she knew.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d she added with a nervous laugh. \u201cYou saved my butt from Mark, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Jaden said. He looked relieved, like this was a burden he\u2019d needed to get off his chest. Maybe he was like her, Lyra thought. She hated to be beholden to anyone. The idea that they might have that in common gave her an unexpected bit of pleasure. And that, she decided, was dangerous in her present mood. She felt weak right now, and far too inclined to share her burdens with anyone who seemed to care\u2014with him.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter getting a look at Eric, I think you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you. So we should swing by the house, you can change into something better suited to sweat in, and we can head out. Your father said you\u2019d know where to go.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sat for a moment in stunned silence. That was it? She knew he\u2019d said they would talk about it later, but... she didn\u2019t want to talk about it later. It had been festering since last night, and she wanted to talk about it now. Tired, frustrated, Lyra pushed the topic into confrontational waters in the hopes that dealing with it would clear her head a little.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look,\u201d she said, turning her head to look at Jaden. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure what happened last night, but before we go any further, I think we need to sort a couple of things out.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath and slicked his hair back with his hands. \u201cDoes it really need to get sorted out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d Lyra replied, gripping the steering wheel hard enough that she was sure her hands would leave imprints. \u201cIf you\u2019re really sticking around to teach me, this is going to have to stay professional. Whatever it was\u2014that thing last night\u2014it can\u2019t happen again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She was ashamed of the fact that she couldn\u2019t look him in the face when she said it, but it would have been too difficult to mean the words otherwise. Still, she could feel the heat of his eyes on her skin. What did he see in her? Even if she hadn\u2019t sworn off men, she didn\u2019t have anything to offer one right now. Especially not a bloodsucker.</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity,\u201d Jaden asked, his voice mild, \u201cis your main objection to sleeping with me that I\u2019m a vampire, or that you\u2019re an Alpha\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>She had to look at him then, because the question indicated he was losing his mind.</p><p>He looked perfectly sincere in his interest too. She wasn\u2019t sure whether to slap him for being an idiot, or to kiss him for the same exact reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she replied, astounded he\u2019d even asked. \u201cWhat kind of a question is that? You know very well our kinds don\u2019t... we don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know it doesn\u2019t happen. But that certainly doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt her mouth go dry and her face grow hot. How could he even act like there was a discussion to be had about this?</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen with us, Jaden. It would be... I mean... I would be an outcast if anyone found out! My father would disown me, and I\u2014I...\u201d She started to stammer, paused, and took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re just supposed to teach me to fight! Why do you have to go and make this more complicated than it already is?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move a muscle, watching her like an animal fixed on its prey. This new sensation for her, coming from him, was a lot more enjoyable than it should have been.</p><p>\u201cYou brought it up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t exactly push me away last night. I have a right to ask what you find so disgusting about it when it\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t object to me once I have my hands on you.\u201d His eyes began to glow, and it was a moment before Lyra realized that he was actually angry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that wolf, right? Simon. I saw you with your arms around each other.\u201d He shook his head, the anger gone as quickly as it had appeared. Jaden slumped into his seat and frowned at the dash, his voice dropping to a sullen mutter. \u201cForget it. You\u2019re better off with the wolf, I suppose. It won\u2019t happen again, okay? Let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, watching Jaden struggle openly with what she\u2019d been wrestling with privately soothed her ragged nerves. This wasn\u2019t some joke for him. And Lyra knew she wasn\u2019t appealing just because of her position, which could do him no good. He just... wanted her. And was stupidly jealous to boot.</p> <p>Lyra could only stare, wonderingly, as he sat brooding and looking like he wanted to kill someone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about this?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>He turned his head to give her a beleaguered look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t humiliate myself for fun, usually.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, hoping a rational response would emerge. When one didn\u2019t, she decided she needed a minute to think about it. Jaden, for the moment, was a captive audience. Lyra jammed her key into the ignition, turned the car on, and pulled out of the parking space without saying a word. She\u2019d left the radio on, and The Black Keys ground out a gritty, sexy, bluesy ode to attraction that did nothing to take Lyra\u2019s mind elsewhere.</p><p>She reached out to turn the volume down but didn\u2019t turn it off, which kept the current situation from feeling completely surreal.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get a few things straight. For one thing, I\u2019m not interested in Simon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been my best friend since we were kids. Not that it\u2019s any of your business, but thinking that is just... gross. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jaden\u2019s response was little more than a growl. \u201cDoes it matter what I think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she allowed, and felt his attention return to her full force. She had to concentrate hard on what she wanted to say so she could stay on the road. He was being honest. And considering what they would have done last night if Simon hadn\u2019t shown up, she supposed she owed him the same courtesy.</p><p>\u201cFor another thing, what if I did want you in my bed, Jaden? It\u2019s not like it would do either of us any good. I don\u2019t want a mate, and you couldn\u2019t be one to me anyway. Apart from the fact that my pack would hunt and kill you for touching me, the bond doesn\u2019t happen if one person isn\u2019t a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBond?\u201d</p><p>Oh gods, she didn\u2019t want to explain this. Lyra felt another rush of heat to her cheeks, but she pushed through it. She might as well get it all out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the mate bond. Happens when two wolves, ah... you know. It\u2019s unbreakable. Wolves mate for life. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a perfect system. You don\u2019t have to actually like the person you bond with.\u201d</p><p>She looked quickly at him and saw that he\u2019d figured out the whole truth of it. His mouth thinned with distaste.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cWelcome to my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been running. You don\u2019t have to agree to be mated to any of the wolves who want your hand. All it takes is being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d He wrinkled his nose and shook his head. \u201cWhere\u2019s the appeal in marrying a woman who\u2019s been forced to accept you? I don\u2019t understand wolves at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s just biology,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it either. It\u2019s one of the things that have kept female werewolves in permanent second-class status for so long, and a big part of why packs are so insulated. One big raid by another pack, and boom, all of your breeding females belong to your rivals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Lyra shrugged, nodded. \u201cIt is. That really used to happen, a long time ago, and it wiped out more than one pack. Not so much anymore. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t still a hazard of being born a girl. Especially if you\u2019re the Alpha\u2019s daughter and your hand comes with so many benefits.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be mulling this over. \u201cAnd how does this bond affect you? Couldn\u2019t you just ignore it? Walk away, if you tried hard enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh. Your lack of werewolf knowledge is showing,\u201d she replied with a small smile. \u201cWe get marks too. Around the upper arm. Only upon mating, and the marks of the pair match. You can\u2019t remove them, and it\u2019s easy to check. But worse, I think, is that the bond makes it difficult to be apart from one another. Or at least, that\u2019s what I hear. There\u2019s some kind of freaky emotional component that\u2019s almost telepathic. I don\u2019t know exactly how that works, and I don\u2019t want to know. They say death breaks it. But my dad has never gotten over my mom, and that was years ago.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about her mother and wished she hadn\u2019t brought her up. But Jaden asked the question she knew he would, and his tone, quiet and nonjudgmental, had her speaking before she could think better of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cShe was alone in the woods when she shouldn\u2019t have been, too far from home. And a lot of humans don\u2019t much care what they shoot as long as it might look good on their walls. I\u2014I don\u2019t remember much about that. I was just a toddler. And that\u2019s besides the matter,\u201d she said, ending that part of the discussion. He didn\u2019t need to know about all the tears she\u2019d shed for a mother who was never coming home. The hole in her life that had never closed. She doubted he would understand anyway.</p><p>\u201cThe point,\u201d she said more firmly, \u201cis that I just don\u2019t see what acting on this thing you and I seem to have between us does but muddy what I\u2019m trying to accomplish. Like I said\u2014I\u2019m not interested in having a man. Any man. Even if you weren\u2019t a vampire, that would be true. A mate would just be an excuse for the pack to brush me aside, and I need to do this, win this, on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I don\u2019t want a mate either, and learned a long time ago not to get too emotionally involved with mortals, I\u2019m not sure what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, amused at his matter-of-fact tone. \u201cSo you\u2019re advocating for meaningless sex, then. Oh. Well that makes a huge difference.\u201d</p><p>His answering smile was faint, and in the near dark of the car his perfect face was both beautiful and sad, like that of a fallen angel. \u201cMeaningless is the wrong word. Look, I\u2019ve been either enslaved or on the run for longer than anyone in your pack has been alive. Now that I\u2019m free, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t know what the hell I want anymore. But I\u2019ve been around long enough to know that sometimes it\u2019s fine just to enjoy something in the moment. That\u2019s not meaningless. That\u2019s just realistic. That\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>The statement was so unexpectedly honest that Lyra found herself touched by it, even if she didn\u2019t know exactly how to respond. She drove in silence while she gathered her muddled thoughts\u2014trying to sort out what she wanted, what she needed. Until Jaden had made his offer, she hadn\u2019t quite realized how appealing such a thing would sound. If there were truly no strings...</p><p>Her heartbeat picked up at the mere possibility of saying yes. But there were other considerations\u2014ones she would have to give a lot more thought to. And she had no intention of getting into those with him now when this was all still so fresh.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly what I was expecting, Jaden,\u201d she said as she made the turn down her street. \u201cNothing is this easy, or free. There has to be a catch.\u201d</p><p>A soft chuckle. \u201cSo suspicious. No, there\u2019s enough to worry about without there being a catch.\u201d</p><p>But his words reminded her of one very large potential issue. \u201cOh? What about the vampire from last night?\u201d</p><p>She could actually feel him shut down a little with the shift in the conversation, and it worried her. She knew there were plenty of things she didn\u2019t know about Jaden\u2014would probably never know. But she needed to be sure that his secrets weren\u2019t going to put her pack in danger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. That\u2019s nothing you, or your pack, need to worry about,\u201d he said in a clipped voice.</p><p>\u201cThen you know who it was?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, his voice turning cold. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find out. I have the resources to be able to, finally, and I plan to use them. If it turned into a problem, Lyra, I would go. Not without finding someone to replace me. I wouldn\u2019t abandon you like that, especially not after meeting your charming cousin. But I don\u2019t want you to worry about your pack. I was obviously the target. I\u2019ve made a lot of enemies over the years, so I expect I\u2019ll stay the target. Whoever it is knows that no one here will mourn me if I suddenly disappear. Or my head does. \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was more to it. She was sure of it. But she also didn\u2019t think he was lying in his assessment of the danger. It wouldn\u2019t fit with the man she was slowly coming to know. He had a sense of honor about him. Not one she had completely figured out yet, but it was there.</p><p>\u201cIs it one of the ones who put the scars on your back?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, and she knew she\u2019d gone further than she should have.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about them.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was obvious. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to. I\u2019m asking if it might be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not. But even if it is, it\u2019s no concern of yours.\u201d</p><p>Lyra recoiled a little at the coldness in his voice, something she hadn\u2019t heard since their very first meeting. She wondered again who had done that to him, what it meant. But that, it seemed, was off limits. He didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about the past. Which should have been fine.</p><p>Except that she wanted to know more about him, whether or not she ought to.</p> <p>The car lapsed into silence as she pulled into the driveway, comforted by the familiarity of the house, the cheery lights against the dark. She\u2019d had so many simpler, happier times here. It was a comfort, but it also made her sad. Everything was so complicated now... her feelings were complicated. She\u2019d known that the path she\u2019d started on would be a lonely one. But it surprised her how much Jaden\u2019s company made her crave the sort of connection she\u2019d long denied herself.</p><p>The sort of connection he seemed to be offering, albeit temporarily.</p><p>He was so quiet, Lyra had almost forgotten Jaden was there with her, until he spoke up with a new hesitance in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWill you give some thought to the rest of what I\u2019ve said?\u201d he asked as she pulled the keys from the ignition and put her hand on the door handle.</p><p>That was the big question, she supposed. And there would be no avoiding it, one way or another. Lyra took a deep breath, turning to look him in the eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably a bad idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t know. I guess I need some time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Jaden said softly, and she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen him look so serious despite the fact that he rarely smiled. \u201cMy offer stands for as long as I\u2019m here. Just let me know.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart, treacherous as ever, fluttered nervously in response.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said, and then, anxious to get her racing heart under control, changed the subject to something lighter. \u201cLet me get changed, and we\u2019ll head out to the fields on the west side of town on four legs. Less conspicuous.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help a small jab. \u201cAs long as you think you can keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cI\u2019m as anxious as you are. Your cousin may be lacking a personality, but he\u2019s made up for it in brawn. We\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>His grin was utterly wicked and full of sensuous promise... if she were brave enough to take him up on it. She would see.</p><p>The wolf padded silently through the underbrush, his massive paws barely making a sound as he headed for the falls. He\u2019d needed a run, badly. But even that had failed to ease his mind tonight... so he would try to find his peace at the falls and hunt some of the wild things that hid from him in the underbrush. In that, he felt a strange kinship to the town\u2019s unwelcome visitor. Both he and the vampires found comfort in blood.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been surprised to find Lyra playing bodyguard to the bloodsucker. She was prickly, but the sharp exterior hid her biggest weakness: a soft heart. He kept tabs on her. He knew full well where she ran off to on the occasions she decided to disappear. She\u2019d hung around vamps before, and why not? That\u2019s where the power was. Where it would always be. He could understand the attraction to power.</p><p>But Lyra was never going to have the wherewithal to gain any for herself, or for the pack. That alone made her unfit to be Alpha, more important even than the fact that she was just a woman. That kill would be sweet, the wolf thought as he moved in and out of shadow like a ghost.</p><p>He hoped he would have time to savor it. The Proving didn\u2019t worry him. He\u2019d have help if he needed it, which he wouldn\u2019t. The competition was pathetic, none more than Lyra.</p> <p>But her new vampire pet was going to be a problem. This Jaden was no transient no-name lowblood. His connections could screw up everything, and yet the wolf had been told nothing about him, had had no advance warning of last night\u2019s attempt to deal with him. How was he supposed to manage the situation if he was being cut out of the loop?</p><p>He\u2019d clawed his way in, and he\u2019d worked his ass off to line everything up. The pieces were all in place. And he\u2019d be damned if Lyra was going to screw it up at the last minute by making sad cow eyes at some freshly minted Lilim.</p><p>He would have killed the bitch already, if he\u2019d thought he could get away with it.</p><p>The wolf leaped over a fallen tree and kept his pace steady, letting the scents of the forest at night calm his frayed nerves. He had a lot on his plate these days\u2014more than anyone knew\u2014and on some nights, like tonight, keeping it all together proved almost overwhelming.</p><p>Just three weeks, he told himself. A little over three weeks, and I\u2019m set.</p><p>A shadow peeled off one of the trees up ahead, so quickly and silently that he didn\u2019t notice until he was almost on top of it. When he did see the shadow in his path, he jerked to a halt, too startled even to growl. There was an exasperated sigh as cool blue eyes gleamed at him in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cSituational awareness,\u201d said a soft, cultured voice with a posh English accent. \u201cLearn it, wolf. I could have killed you ten times over by now if I\u2019d felt like it.\u201d</p><p>The wolf shifted quickly into a human to stand in front of the slim, elegant silhouette that the vampire presented and tried to hide his shock that a Shade, any Shade, would want to talk to him after cutting him off so completely. He\u2019d met this one only once, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten the sharp tongue or the air of superiority. Maybe it was the cat vamp blood that made him so insufferable.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Damien?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf the Shades want to talk to me, there are safer ways to do it.\u201d</p><p>There was a derisive snort. \u201cI\u2019m in no danger here. You, on the other hand, are in a lot more if you don\u2019t watch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>But inside, cold tendrils of fear began to wrap around his heart. He\u2019d gone to the Shades because he\u2019d wanted to spread his wings a little, to learn how the truly powerful conducted their business... and how they destroyed one another. The short time he\u2019d spent with them had been very instructive.</p><p>And it had led to far greater things than a society of criminals.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you do. So let me begin by saying that the House of Shadows doesn\u2019t take kindly to apprentices who use us to find better positions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use anyone,\u201d he snapped, imagining the pleasure he would get out of wringing Damien Tremaine\u2019s neck and then popping his head right off his shoulders. Vampires were pricks, by and large, but Damien was in a class by himself. \u201cAnyway, what do you care if I made a useful contact? You let me go, remember? Drake said he didn\u2019t like my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Damien replied blandly. \u201cSince that style of yours involved a rather higher body count than what had been ordered. And there was that lowblood maid you left in pieces. In fact, that was the last straw, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He wished he didn\u2019t know what the vampire was talking about, but it was hard to forget. \u201cShe got in the way,\u201d he growled. \u201cI was just doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable. It was sloppy work, and the House of Shadows has a reputation for being quick, clean, and discreet. I don\u2019t know how many times Drake is going to have to beat his head against the wall with one of these grand ideas of his, but I warned him you weren\u2019t suited to be an apprentice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a wolf?\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou vamps are all alike. Think your shit doesn\u2019t stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s because you\u2019re an unreliable thug with sociopathic tendencies. You being a wolf is irritating, but not the issue. You were his first go at a wolf, but I doubt you\u2019ll be the last.\u201d A sigh. \u201cI understand the need to keep his fingers in a lot of pies, but your kind isn\u2019t really suited to our needs. Next it\u2019ll be a pixie or some damned thing.\u201d</p><p>The wolf\u2019s blood heated to a slow boil. He\u2019d thought long and hard before seeking out the famed House of Shadows, the guild of vampire assassins and thieves. And he\u2019d managed to get Alistair Drake, the Shade Master, to give him a shot at an apprenticeship. So it hadn\u2019t worked out... it had been worthwhile regardless. Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t gotten far enough in to be considered a liability to the Shades. They didn\u2019t tend to let those go.</p><p>He flexed his fists, claws extending and retracting, and willed himself to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cDid you come all the way out here just to tell me off?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cOr did you have something useful to offer?\u201d</p><p>Those blue eyes went ice cold, and the wolf actually felt uneasy. He hadn\u2019t worked with Damien. From what he\u2019d heard, the vamp had refused to. But he had to be a favorite of Drake\u2019s for a reason. And the Shades were a lot more cold-blooded than he\u2019d figured on. He doubted they\u2019d get in his way once he was Alpha, or at least not openly. Wasn\u2019t their style. But he wasn\u2019t Alpha yet.</p><p>\u201cI was sent to give you a message, from Drake. And he\u2019s a man who\u2019s been watching the dynasties for centuries, not to mention meddling in them for pay, so I suggest you heed his advice.\u201d</p><p>The wolf rolled his shoulders impatiently. He wanted his run, he wanted to get through this month, and more than anything, he desperately wanted never to have to interact with a Cait Sith or a Lilim ever again. At least not to speak. Hunting them down would be a pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSay what you have to, and then get out of here before I call out the guard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damien regarded him for a moment with something like pity in those cold eyes. Then he spoke, slowly and calmly, betraying no emotion at all.</p><p>\u201cDrake wanted to tell you that you should be careful who you trust. That friends among the dynasties are rarely what they seem, and that no one, particularly your new... associates... ever does anything unless they know they will have the advantage. An offer of power is usually just an offer to be someone\u2019s puppet... or a glorified slave. If you want your pack to survive intact, you\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>The wolf\u2019s laugh was a short, sharp bark. \u201cAre you joking? Maybe Drake is just concerned that the wolves are going to end up with more power and clout than his pissant little operation. And you know what? He\u2019s right. So you can tell him where to shove his advice. With my thanks, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Damien hissed out a breath, narrowing his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the response I told him he would get. Still, he wanted to try. I suppose he\u2019s sorry you didn\u2019t work out. There\u2019s always something to be said for dumb muscle and a willingness to eat the opposition.\u201d</p><p>The wolf smiled, deliberately showing his sharpened teeth. \u201cYou remember that you said that, cat. Remember it when your kind are all hiding in shadows, afraid of the big bad wolves. I know your scent, and I\u2019ll remember it when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Damien didn\u2019t look intimidated in the least, and that, more than anything else, infuriated him. He was so sick of his kind being counted out, looked down upon. Finally, he had been sought out by creatures that could change all that. And they\u2014she\u2014would have his undying loyalty, and that of his pack. Once they understood what was at stake, that was. Which would happen soon.</p><p>\u201cSo predictable,\u201d Damien said. \u201cSo full of yourself. When someone puts a bounty on your foolish, furry head, I\u2019ll be first in line to take the job. It won\u2019t be long. You\u2019re too stupid to last. I doubt you\u2019ll even live to see your people in chains. Pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worthless ball of fur, why don\u2019t we settle this now if you\u2019re so eager to try and take me out?\u201d</p> <p>Damien laughed softly, a mocking sound drifting through the quiet night. \u201cBecause I only kill for money. And there\u2019ll be quite a bit to make if I wait.\u201d</p><p>With a hoarse snarl, he leaped at Damien, his form shifting in midair to become that of an enormous, muscular wolf. Bloodlust hazed his vision along with his anger, welling up from a source that never seemed to run dry. He had been made to hunt, to kill. Why fight it? Why, when he dreamed of tearing into flesh with his claws and feasting as the wolves had long ago.</p><p>But when he hit the ground, slashing out with his front claws, there was nothing but air and the hard, unforgiving earth. The wolf gave a loud grunt as the air rushed from his lungs, then lay there for a moment, panting with helpless fury and confusion. Gone. How?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, he decided. When the time came to begin the hunt, Damien Tremaine was first on his list. The mark of the cat would be washed away in a sea of blood. And he would stand at the head of the first wolf pack in centuries that would be truly respected, truly feared, by the rest of the world of night.</p><p>Slowly, he got to his feet, already knowing what he needed to do. He was the future Alpha of the Pack of the Thorn. He wouldn\u2019t just be shunted aside, no matter what Damien said.</p><p>The thought soothed him, and he quickened his pace again, ready to run beneath the waning moon.</p> <p>To be free.</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>THE MAN WAS a sadist.</p><p>Lyra sat in her car, staring at the Shopway and wondering whether her legs would actually get her in and out of there. She hurt. Everywhere. In places she hadn\u2019t even been aware she had muscles. And tonight, after nearly a week of continuous torment, she and her aching muscles were going to go to that damn field and do it all again.</p><p>Another week of this and she\u2019d be dead. Or lurching around like Quasimodo.</p><p>Pretty sad, when he was only barely sparring with her yet. Then again, she was a wolf, which she kept trying to explain to him. Flipping through the air and slashing gracefully was not exactly her kind\u2019s stock in trade. Barrel rolling people and mauling them... that she could handle with her eyes closed.</p><p>Now she remembered why she\u2019d been a ballet dropout.</p><p>She took a moment to enjoy the way the light had turned reddish gold as the sun began its long descent behind the Shopway. Then she groaned when she remembered what that sky meant. Jaden would be awake in a couple of hours. And the house would still be devoid of fuel for her abused body. Maybe she could hide out here tonight, huddled in the junk food aisle, munching. He\u2019d never find her...</p> <p>A rap at the window made her jump and let out an embarrassing squeak. Fortunately, the face she saw when she turned her head was friendly, if amused, and very familiar. Still uncertain enough of her throbbing legs that she didn\u2019t want to get out of the car, Lyra rolled down the window.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gerry. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Gerry McFarlane grinned in at her, blue eyes twinkling. The stout, barrel-chested wolf was ostensibly the police chief in Silver Falls and in practice the head of the Thorn\u2019s guard. He was also one of her father\u2019s closest friends, and he never missed an opportunity to tease her.</p><p>Like now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually see you just sitting with your mind in outer space. I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cHiding from your hostessing duties, I presume?\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed ruefully. She\u2019d taken enough ribbing over having to entertain the Falls\u2019 newest visitor this week. The only good thing was that it provided her ample opportunity to demonstrate that she was most certainly not enamored of the handsome vampire in town. It was also a good way to try to convince herself of the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d she said with a wry smile. \u201cHe\u2019s all right, though, really. Nice... for a vamp.\u201d</p><p>That much, Lyra thought, was true, if odd. Being hot for him was one thing. Discovering she actually liked the guy was something else entirely. It warranted caution on her part, which was why she hadn\u2019t laid a finger on him since that very appealing offer.</p><p>Every time she got too close, she heard warning bells.</p><p>\u201cWell, he bought a little goodwill at the Inn the other night, I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d Gerry replied. \u201cAnd he\u2019s kept his fangs to himself. That\u2019s a start, even though I still can\u2019t figure out why his people would pick us out and try to make nice.\u201d</p><p>Lyra shrugged uncomfortably. That was one thing she hated about all of this\u2014the lying to people who were her friends. Three more weeks of this and she\u2019d be dying of guilt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re well respected among our kind,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cWhy not us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Gerry said, leaning companionably against the car as he settled in for a chat, \u201cwe\u2019ve bitched and moaned about being marginalized for long enough that actually getting some positive attention just feels odd. But who am I to question it, as long as the vamp behaves himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d Lyra reminded him. It bothered her to hear him referred to as a what and not a who. Gerry\u2019s brows lifted a little, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cRight. Jaden. Of course, your cousin isn\u2019t big on this whole idea.\u201d</p><p>Lyra angled her head to look up at Gerry. \u201cNo way. Really?\u201d Gerry chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, he\u2019s at least not crazy about this specific vampire,\u201d he qualified, and Lyra couldn\u2019t help a smirk. No, after the other night, she was sure Eric wasn\u2019t big on this specific vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending time with him. I\u2019ve never exchanged pleasantries with a vamp myself. What\u2019s your take on it?\u201d</p><p>Lyra flushed with pleasure. She might have known Gerry forever, and he was fond of picking her brains over things. But being asked about something so important when Eric, the presumptive heir, had already given his word from on high, felt... well, pretty good.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be a good idea to re-engage, myself,\u201d Lyra said slowly, considering her response as she gave it. In truth, it had been on her mind as well. Jaden might not have seriously offered an alignment with his dynasty, but it had occurred to her that if she herself extended a hand to Lily it might not be simply dismissed. Especially because Lily had been human not long ago and wasn\u2019t carrying all the vampire-werewolf baggage the rest of them were.</p><p>It might work. And for all the wolves like herself and Simon, who had yearned to be able to broaden their horizons outside of werewolf territory, it could be a godsend.</p><p>\u201cIt would have to be the right dynasty, though,\u201d Lyra continued. \u201cJaden\u2019s dynasty is so young that I think it provides the best opportunity for us. The wolves have no history with them. They\u2019re building something new, and we could be a part of that.\u201d When she saw the way Gerry was looking at her, she had to smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess that Eric\u2019s take on it is nothing like mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, you know your cousin. Tradition and upholding pack law. He says he doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019d want with us anyway, that the price might be too high. That would be my worry. We\u2019ve warred with them all. I\u2019d think that puts us at a disadvantage right off the bat, but...\u201d He trailed off, then shrugged. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see which of you gets to help make the decision, I guess. Whoever it is, I know Dorien will listen.\u201d</p><p>The casual compliment touched Lyra. Part of her wanted to hop out of the car and give Gerry a hug, just for speaking of her as an equal, and viable, candidate. It had never happened to her before. And she hadn\u2019t realized until just now how much such a simple thing would mean to her.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s a smart man, and a good Alpha,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will listen.\u201d</p><p>Gerry grinned and touched a finger to the tip of her nose, the affectionate gesture taking her back to being an adoring five-year-old. The memory of such a pleasant, simple time made her heart ache, just a little.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of him in you. I\u2019ve always said it. Only Dorien Black\u2019s daughter could have a vampire eating out of the palm of her hand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.

Maybe Jaden seemed deferential toward her out in public. She had no idea. Or maybe it was just too dark for people to see him making faces at her.</p> <p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she murmured, wondering exactly what people did see on the rare occasion she and Jaden had been together among the pack. Was she missing something?</p><p>Gerry started away, and she thought she might actually need to pull her aching self out of the car, but he stopped short just a few feet away and turned back.</p><p>\u201cHey, I do have a favor to ask of you, if you\u2019re up for it. And if you want an excuse to get away from your charge for an evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said quickly. Having an actual job lined up would be a lot better than admitting her muscles needed a night off. She was determined to keep up with Jaden. The worst thing it could do was kill her, and since death was already a strong possibility, she wasn\u2019t terribly worried.</p><p>But man, she would love to do something that didn\u2019t involve her trying to be Bruce Lee for the evening.</p> <p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s going to be very taxing for you. But it requires a certain... flair for diplomacy, let\u2019s say... that a lot of us are lacking, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got another werewolf nut you want me to get rid of.\u201d</p><p>Gerry\u2019s relieved smile was all the confirmation she needed. Lyra winced. This would be only marginally better than Jaden\u2019s brand of torture. Silver Falls was isolated, and the pack generally disciplined, but the same sense of danger that humans got about the place, the thing that prevented any of them from moving in, also sometimes attracted a different element. These types usually came armed with books on supernatural phenomena and video cameras, and often enjoyed skulking around in the woods after dark in the misguided belief they might surprise someone doing something paranormal.</p><p>They were annoying. They were also worrisome. If even the smallest bit of actual evidence got out, many more of these hunters would come. Fortunately, all that had ever emerged from here was the occasional wild story. Still, it was trouble no one wanted.</p><p>Getting rid of the overly curious was also a job no one wanted. Unfortunately, Lyra had been roped into it before, and she had a knack for the task. There were two ways to go about it: sweet talk, or scaring the person so badly they ended up right on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p><p>She excelled at both.</p> <p>\u201cI know someone recommended the Lost Dog Caf\u00e9 to him. That\u2019d be a good place to look... don\u2019t see where else he can sit around giving everyone the stink eye.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sighed. \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>Gerry chuckled. \u201cBlack leather fedora and a Supernatural T-shirt. Very inconspicuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Fabulous, another Indiana Jones of the Night. I\u2019ll take care of it. But only because I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, sweet pea. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I\u2019ll add it onto your tab. You currently owe me into infinity anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lyra watched Gerry saunter away, smiling despite herself. She supposed she was glad to have an excuse for a night off, even if it wasn\u2019t really a night off. Her father could entertain Jaden. Or he could wander off to... wherever Jaden wandered to when he needed to feed. He didn\u2019t say, and she didn\u2019t ask. But the thought of him with his teeth in some pretty young thing, his hands on her, made her smile evaporate all too quickly.</p><p>Yeah, maybe her father could entertain him.</p> <p>With a muttered epithet, Lyra opened the door and slid out of the car. She felt about as bad as she\u2019d expected. An actual injury would have healed long before now, but this pain wouldn\u2019t end without a full night to recover. And she\u2019d be damned if she would let Jaden see her hobbling around like an old woman. Better to get the kinks out now.</p><p>Grimacing, and lamenting what now passed for a night off, she got to her feet, locked the car, and marched stiffly toward the Shopway.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>JADEN PULLED HIS CORVETTE into the small parking lot behind the row of shops that contained the Lost Dog Caf\u00e9, muttering under his breath about difficult women and their indulgent fathers.</p><p>He\u2019d awakened looking forward to another evening of Lyra\u2019s undivided attention. He hated to admit it to himself, but that was one of his favorite things about instructing her. After all, there was much to like: she was an apt student, easy to teach and incredibly talented. Still, he mostly just liked having her to himself. For a vampire of his age and experience with women, that was sad.</p><p>Sadder still was how unhappy he\u2019d found himself when Dorien, happily ensconced in the kitchen with a beer and a battered paperback, informed him that Lyra would be out for the evening on \u201cpack business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack business my ass,\u201d Jaden grumbled, putting the car in park and killing the engine. A date, even a fake date with some idiotic werewolf hunter, was not business. Especially not when Dorien had gotten such a laugh over exactly how good Lyra was at running off unwanted visitors.</p><p>Actually, Jaden thought, remembering how charming she\u2019d been on their first couple of meetings, he could see that.</p><p>He got out of the car, worried for a moment over whether anyone would decide to open a door into it, then locked it and headed around the building. There was a nip in the air tonight\u2014the weather still couldn\u2019t quite decide to commit to being consistently pleasant. In the past week, the town had seen cold rain, wind, and then seventy-degree temperatures. It seemed to be working its way back to the latter, but the night wasn\u2019t without its bite.</p><p>His stomach rumbled at the thought, and he pushed it aside. Later. He would skip town for a bite later. Right now, he just wanted to see Lyra. And possibly throttle whoever this idiot human was, fake date or not.</p><p>He passed under a purposely shabby yellow sign featuring an abstract-looking dog. Jaden pushed open the door and walked into the caf\u00e9. He let his eyes sweep the room, absorbing the feel of the place. Velvet curtains framed the large windows looking out onto the sidewalk. The dimly lit interior was punctuated by the flickering lights of candles atop tall, spindly tables and the leather-upholstered booths that lined the walls. Pieces of art hung on the coffee-colored walls in bold colors, mostly Daliesque dreamscapes with the occasional martini bar painting thrown in. A husky male voice sang over a sax, the music piped through the speakers.</p><p>Though the caf\u00e9 was the opposite of the quaint, salty, charming Inn, it managed to be warm instead of pretentious. Jaden thought he might like to come check it out sometime when he could actually enjoy it.</p><p>Right now, however, all his attention was focused on the woman who sat with her back to him, and the loser in the black fedora who had drool just about leaking out of his mouth.</p><p>Lyra was wearing some sort of sweater that draped down in the back, exposing enough smooth, creamy skin and strong shoulder that Jaden found his own mouth watering. Her hair was tied back at the nape of her neck, left to coil downward in a long tail. She seemed casual, relaxed from the way she held herself. And as he watched, she tossed her head back and laughed. The sound was a loud, throaty roll that had his fangs lengthening, hunger for her beginning to rush through his system like wildfire.</p><p>He could smell her. He could damn near taste her. And if the fedora didn\u2019t stop looking at her like he wanted to take his own bite out of her, he was going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHell with this,\u201d Jaden growled, slapped what he hoped was a pleasant expression on his face, and headed for the table.</p><p>Fedora guy spotted him almost instantly. Jaden had to stop himself from smiling over the immediate wariness that came over the man\u2019s expression, inordinately pleased that he\u2019d managed to suck all the fun out of whatever joke he and Lyra had been sharing. Lyra turned to see what the problem was, the curiosity in her eyes turning quickly to some odd combination of irritation and pleasure the instant she saw him.</p><p>Considering that pleasure was definitely in there somewhere, he would take it.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Jaden purred, wondering whether she would play along. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>He saw one corner of her mouth twitch before she answered. The look in her eyes was very plainly I\u2019m going to get you for this.</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a nice... surprise.\u201d She turned her head to look at her companion, who was already looking suspiciously between them. Jaden thought he looked like the kind of guy who was considered decent looking now, but who had been hung by his underwear from lockers on a fairly regular basis in his youth. Lyra was a prize he didn\u2019t want to share.</p><p>\u201cBlake, this is Jaden. Jaden,\u201d she paused, and he caught a warning flash of humor on her face before she fired her opening shot. \u201cFinkleman. Jaden, this is my friend Blake Torrance.\u201d</p><p>Jaden slid her a fulminating glare from beneath his lashes when he went to shake the fedora wearer\u2019s hand. Her grin could have melted butter.</p><p>\u201cCharmed,\u201d Jaden said, giving Blake\u2019s hand a quick, firm shake and then quickly letting go. The man had sweaty palms. Jaden hated that.</p><p>\u201cDo you live in Silver Falls too?\u201d Blake asked. He seemed suspicious. But then, Jaden was fairly sure he practiced his pseudo-intimidating suspicious face in the mirror every morning. He doubted it helped much in his travels, but he probably thought it would heighten his credibility when he eventually got a ghost-hunting TV show.</p><p>This sort, in Jaden\u2019s experience, always wanted a TV show. Considerably more than they wanted to know the truth behind the supernatural phenomena they chased around.</p><p>\u201cRecent transplant,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>He caught Blake\u2019s eyes and pushed a thought at him: Ask me to stay for dinner.</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019m here on business. And some unexpected pleasure,\u201d Blake said, his eyes clouding for a moment before clearing again. He looked up at Jaden, seeming slightly puzzled. Jaden smiled indulgently and waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d Blake asked.</p><p>\u201cLove to, thanks,\u201d Jaden said, and slid into an empty chair before Lyra could protest. Instead, she shot him a narrow-eyed glare before turning her attention back to Blake.</p><p>\u201cSo you were telling me about the rumors that brought you here?\u201d she asked, and in a far sweeter voice than she\u2019d ever used on Jaden. \u201cBlake is a paranormal buff. He seems to think we\u2019ve got some kind of phenomena around here. I\u2019m just not sure what that would be, apart from the one time Billy Carmichael got so drunk he stripped and went running down Main Street in the middle of a snowstorm.\u201d</p><p>Jaden blinked. \u201cI\u2019m... not sorry I missed that.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a small smile. \u201cDon\u2019t blame you. It was emotionally scarring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Blake interjected, looking between them again with more than a hint of jealousy. \u201cThere are a lot more reported instances of supernatural occurrences around here than you two seem to think. Lycanthropy being the most common thread running through them. It\u2019s easy to dismiss and laugh at if you\u2019re not up on the research, but I assure you, this is no laughing matter.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so prissy and uptight that Jaden had to bite his tongue to keep from snickering. Then he made the mistake of catching Lyra\u2019s eye and realized she was having the exact same problem. Her lower lip quivered, and she bit it, very gently, before she pointedly looked away.</p><p>Jaden let his eyes linger on her profile a moment longer, wishing they were alone so he could run his own tongue and teeth over that entrancingly full lower lip of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to believe the two of you are ignorant of the stories about this place,\u201d Blake continued, sounding increasingly peevish at being ignored. \u201cThey\u2019ve been covered up pretty well, I\u2019ll say that, but the truth is out there for those of us willing to dig deep enough.\u201d</p> <p>Oh hell, there it was. Jaden managed to cover the laugh with a cough, but he doubted it was very convincing. Lyra grabbed her glass and took a long drink of water.</p><p>Taking a little pity on the man, Jaden turned his attention back to Blake. Yes, Jaden decided, he was pissed. His date had been ruined, and his life\u2019s passion was being laughed at. He might not be so mad if he\u2019d realized he was being laughed at by a vampire and a werewolf, respectively, but still. Jaden decided to make a little effort to be civil, since he now knew there was no way in hell Lyra was going anywhere else with this guy.</p><p>\u201cLook, Blake,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are a lot of unexplained things in the world. A lot of them, maybe most of them, are better left unexamined by the unwary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m plenty wary,\u201d Blake snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019m obviously onto something, because I\u2019ve never met anyone who liked playing vampire who chose to live in a normal town.\u201d</p><p>Jaden lifted his brows. \u201cYou think I... play vampire? That sounds like a pretty personal question, Blake. You\u2019ll have to at least buy me a drink for the answer.\u201d</p><p>Blake huffed out an angry little laugh. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cThis is going nowhere. I don\u2019t know why I asked you to stay... really... but if you\u2019re not going to help me, then I\u2019ve got other leads to follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d He was fumbling in his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNo, Blake, don\u2019t go. Jaden can leave, or you and I can find someplace else to sit and talk. This was supposed to be just the two of us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d</p><p>Turning his gift, his power for controlling humans, on was as intuitive as breathing. Jaden\u2019s voice turned gentle but commanding, smooth and utterly irresistible. Even Lyra turned toward him, her head slightly tilted in response to the change in his voice. But he\u2019d had his fun with the interloper\u2014it was time to help him on his way so he and Lyra could have the table to themselves.</p><p>Blake stilled and turned to look at Jaden, as Jaden had known he would. Humans really had no choice about succumbing to a thrall. And once their eyes met, when Jaden saw them go hazy and confused, he knew he had him just where he wanted him.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me, Blake?\u201d he asked, his voice as calm as if he were about to discuss the weather. Blake nodded, his action slow and dreamlike.</p><p>\u201cYes... master.\u201d</p> <p>He felt Lyra glaring at him, but he didn\u2019t want to break the connection, so he addressed her without looking.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I didn\u2019t mean to lay it on that thick. Don\u2019t call me master, Blake. I\u2019m just your friend. Your buddy Jaden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Jaden smirked despite his best efforts. \u201cHey, Blake. Listen, as your buddy, I have to tell you. You need to walk out of here, go get your things at the hotel, and leave town. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave town. Yeah,\u201d Blake murmured, swaying slightly on his feet where he stood. \u201cBut there are... lycans...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve been watching too much Underworld,\u201d Jaden replied, calm but firm. He never blinked, feeling the power in the hold he had over the man. It made him hungry, unfortunately... a good thrall was wasted if you didn\u2019t get a drink out of it... but wasted this one would be. He doubted the patrons of the Lost Dog would appreciate the sight of him getting a snack.</p><p>\u201cThere are no werewolves here. No vampires. This is, in fact, the most boring place on earth, and you\u2019ll remember it that way. Get a girlfriend. Get a life. For the love of all that is holy, get rid of the stupid hat. And you will never come back here again. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master Jaden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Jaden replied, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jaden Finkleman. My buddy.\u201d</p><p>Jaden sighed. \u201cBetter. Marginally. Go on now, Blake. Drinks were on me.\u201d</p><p>The ghost chaser glided off in a daze, bumping into a waitress as well as the door before he found his way out. Jaden turned to watch him go, amused. He hadn\u2019t done that in a while, really laid the suggestion on thick. Hopefully it would work. He was pretty sure it would in the short term at least.</p><p>Lyra was staring at him, and he couldn\u2019t read her expression at all. Finally, she said, \u201cIf he crashes his car, I will kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Jaden replied, \u201cthough you should be happy, because now that Blake the Flake has wandered away you\u2019ve got plenty of time to try doing just that tonight. You look amazing, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He was deliberately casual about it because he knew that if he went heavy on the flattery she would just blow him off. Being told she was beautiful seemed to make Lyra uncomfortable, for some reason. He liked making her a little uncomfortable.</p><p>True to form, her cheeks flushed prettily. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cUm, thanks.\u201d She hesitated a moment and then said, \u201cYou smell pretty good tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be that cologne you picked covered the cat smell,\u201d he teased. But he liked the compliment... a great deal. It was a small step toward him, but he would take it over the stalemate of the past week. He wanted her. He was going to keep wanting her.</p><p>He decided giving a few reminders didn\u2019t hurt, either, however subtle. Especially because she was gorgeous when she was flustered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hope you didn\u2019t mind that. You seemed like you might be a cologne guy. And I like to smell things that I like.\u201d She paused and shook her head. \u201cYou know what I mean. I\u2019m a sense of smell girl. Wolf thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso a cat thing, so I can appreciate that. And I do like it, so thanks.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a true smile this time. And as Jaden sat looking at her, at the candlelight flickering in her eyes, at the soft set of her mouth and the way the streaks in her hair glinted and shimmered, he felt a strange sensation in the center of his chest, a pulling from the seat of whatever he had for a soul. It drew him to Lyra, more powerfully than any blood had ever called him... though the scent of hers, dark and ripe and wild, enveloped him as he sat there, enchanted.</p><p>He had always known there was more than one way to hunger for a woman. He had just never expected to find himself hungry in all those ways for a single woman. It filled him with a bottomless longing, the sort he would never be able to assuage with a simple bite or even a night in her bed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what it would take.</p><p>All he knew was... somehow, he had to find out.</p><p>The softness remained in her expression as she looked at him, and Jaden felt himself holding his breath, waiting to see what this new shift in his mercurial student would bring. Most of their interaction had been work, with (mostly) good-natured insults that passed as banter. He sensed the same guardedness in her nature as he had in his own, so he understood. But Jaden wanted, more and more, to see what was behind the shield she carried. Only she could decide to let him, though.</p><p>\u201cThe thrall thing is a handy trick,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cYou could rule the world with that.\u201d</p><p>Jaden shrugged. \u201cI prefer just using it to get free stuff. And get the occasional power trip from being called master.\u201d He burst out laughing at the same time as she did. \u201cActually, the master thing is a new one. I think your new boyfriend has some deep-seated issues.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smacked him lightly on the arm. \u201cWhile the hat was just dead sexy, not my type. I think I\u2019d need to get into whips and chains, and I\u2019m just not going there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pig,\u201d she said, still grinning. \u201cAnd... thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jaden feigned incredulity. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re thanking me for helping you?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes back into her head. \u201cBite me. I might have complained if I was enjoying myself, but listening to the walking encyclopedia of weird got old after ten minutes, and he was so dead set on this place it was going to take me a while. So yes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The warmth between them lingered, invisible but palpable.</p><p>\u201cYou want to take a walk?\u201d she asked suddenly. \u201cI need to move. And it\u2019s finally not raining, so...\u201d</p><p>He tipped his chin down to look at her. \u201cTrying to skip out on practice?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression clouded with both guilt and irritation. Right then, he realized she didn\u2019t just want a night off... she probably needed a night off.</p><p>\u201cForget it. You\u2019ve been working your tail off. Tonight, a walk works for me.\u201d He knew this was the right decision when he saw the relief. Lyra was a stoic, but she must have been hurting a little more than he realized. He wished she would tell him what was going on in that beautiful head once in a while. Her absolute refusal to ask for help worried him, along with her stubborn self-reliance... even as he knew these qualities were some of what attracted him.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll go grab the waitress and take care of the bill, and we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden watched her stride away and sighed to himself, enjoying the lingering scent of her perfume. He didn\u2019t know where they were headed, the two of them. Nowhere fast, probably.</p><p>But he wanted, very much, to try and enjoy the ride.</p><p>It might have been chilly, but Lyra loved being out in the open air. She breathed in deeply, tipping her head back to look at the night sky. Some of the clouds had cleared off, allowing the bright pinpoints of stars to shine down unobstructed.</p><p>Jaden walked beside her in companionable silence. She got the feeling he was waiting for her to speak. That was one thing about him: he was happy to engage when provoked, but he didn\u2019t seem to need to just chatter for no apparent reason. She was used to being talked at\u2014whether it was because of her position in the pack or just because she looked like she might have answers, people tended to come to her with their problems, their concerns, their stories. No one, except maybe Simon, had ever been very interested in her own.</p><p>Now there was Jaden, waiting patiently for her to say something, or to say nothing, content in his own skin. It was... interesting.</p> <p>And incredibly attractive. But hadn\u2019t she decided she wasn\u2019t going to think about that anymore?</p><p>Yeah, right. For tonight, Lyra supposed she would blame her weakness on the scent of his cologne. That fragrance really did smell great on him. And for now, a convenient explanation like that suited her just fine.</p><p>They left the square behind, ambling down the familiar streets of her hometown. Lyra stole glances at Jaden occasionally, enjoying the fact that he seemed to appreciate the beauty of her place, if not necessarily the inhabitants. Even there, though, she\u2019d seen a change. People were getting used to seeing him. And the longer he went without freaking out and killing a bunch of wolves, the more comfortable her pack would probably become.</p><p>The two of them walked slowly over a little bridge that spanned Illoren Creek.</p><p>There were areas for pedestrians along the sides, and she stopped, leaning over to watch the water and enjoying the sound of it as it moved beneath.</p><p>She thought Jaden was watching the creek, too, but his words indicated he\u2019d been looking at her instead. She found she didn\u2019t mind.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing your necklace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one I brought back to you. I haven\u2019t seen you wear it since then.\u201d</p><p>Lyra picked up the moonstone pendant from where it dangled between her breasts and looked at it, rubbing her thumb over the smooth stone out of habit. She\u2019d once thought it brought her luck. Maybe it did, in its way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear it all the time,\u201d she said, lifting her eyes to meet Jaden\u2019s. The sight of him, watching her so intently and illuminated only by the faint glow of a streetlight farther back down the road, momentarily took her breath away. He was so perfectly suited to the night, she thought. So dark and beautiful. And having his undivided attention fixed on her, when he looked so very much like what he was, had lust unfurling like a dark and sensuous bloom deep in her belly.</p><p>Unsettled, she sought more words to fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m away, I wear the necklace for luck, and because it reminds me of home. When I\u2019m here, I usually just wear it if I\u2019m doing some kind of pack business to let people know not to bother me unless it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Jaden chuckled, then leaned against the railing beside her to look over. \u201cI\u2019m sure your Blake would be flattered to know he was deemed important by a pack of werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not mine, because I don\u2019t want him. It is important that we run people like him off, though. Some of them are more astute than is safe for us. We don\u2019t want that kind of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t.\u201d Jaden fell silent again, looking out into the distance. She let her gaze linger on his profile, allowing her eyes to caress what her fingers longed to. There was so much she didn\u2019t know about him, and he offered very little freely. But here, alone, she felt emboldened to pry a little more.</p> <p>\u201cSo how did you end up here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gave her a sideways look. \u201cI drove.\u201d</p><p>Lyra pursed her lips. \u201cHilarious. I didn\u2019t mean literally. I haven\u2019t ever talked much to vampires, except maybe Rogan back at that safe house where I met you. And I\u2019m pretty sure at least half of everything he said was complete bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Jaden chuckled. \u201cYou would be right about that. Ty knew him better than I did, but that was the impression I got too. Sneaky bastard, but charming enough when he wanted something. Damien took his head off that night, you know. Right before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>Lyra winced. \u201cWow. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Rogan had it coming from any number of directions. If it hadn\u2019t been Damien, it would have been someone else before too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Damien?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t remember anyone by that name at the safe house, though in fairness, that whole episode had been unnerving. Fleeing there had been a last resort.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Cait Sith, like I am, or was, before I joined the Lilim. Never belonged to the Ptolemy, though. He\u2019s with the House of Shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lyra replied, frowning. \u201cI heard a lot about them while I was in Chicago. They\u2019re some kind of assassin\u2019s guild or something, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d Jaden allowed. \u201cTangling with Shades is usually ill advised. Damien\u2019s very good at what he does. Which means he\u2019s a useful friend to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend?\u201d</p><p>Jaden gave her a half smile. \u201cWell. More to Ty than me. They were turned around the same time, and knew one another way back. But he and I tolerate one another, even though I doubt I\u2019ll ever really trust him.\u201d He paused, then looked away. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of things I\u2019m not proud of to survive, but living this long, having to make your way among the highbloods and the lowbloods and all the intrigue... it can kill some parts of you after a while. Your conscience. Your soul. Damien\u2019s missing a few pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d she asked quietly. Not to tease, but because she really wanted to know.</p><p>He seemed to consider this for a moment. Finally, he looked at her, his eyes glowing softly in the dark. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired, of course. Tired of running, tired of never having a real place to call home. But I\u2019m pretty sure all my pieces are intact.\u201d</p><p>Her mind raced directly into the gutter, and Lyra flushed. She was absolutely positive all his pieces were intact. Jaden read her face immediately and gave a low, warm laugh.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s what I like about you, Lyra. No putting on airs. You\u2019re very... earthy.\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to laugh. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d Her smile lingered after the laughter died away as they stood, heads turned toward one another. The connection between them felt natural and comfortable right now. Maybe because it was no longer based on simple attraction... there was more.</p><p>Maybe a lot more, if she had the nerve to explore it. Here in the comfortable darkness, it didn\u2019t seem nearly as unwise.</p><p>\u201cSo now you like me, huh?\u201d she asked, seeing no harm in flirting a little. What could happen? They were in public, sort of. She was safe enough. And the way he was watching her made her toes curl with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOf course I like you,\u201d he replied. \u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He surprised her by lifting his hand to tuck a stray curl behind her ear. His hand grazed her cheek lightly, and even that small amount of contact made her skin sizzle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, lust and like are two different things,\u201d Lyra said, hearing the slight quaver in her voice as she sought to hold back the instincts that rose so quickly to the surface whenever he touched her. So strange, that a cat would appeal so deeply to a wolf. But there it was. The wild thing in her wanted him just as badly as the rest of her did.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d Jaden asked. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Lyra. But I wouldn\u2019t be here if that\u2019s all there was to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Lyra laughed. \u201cYou like me for my ability to kick serious ass. Got it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but there was something soft in his expression that made her want to simply melt into him. No man had ever looked at her the way he did, she realized. She\u2019d been wanted, and she\u2019d had a few men enjoy her company. But never really both. Not like this.</p><p>This realization made her wish things were different. Because Jaden was special. She could accept that she felt that way, even though it would do her no good to admit it to him. It wouldn\u2019t change the way things had to be.</p><p>Yet she couldn\u2019t resist moving into him, watching his lashes lower in anticipation as he went very still, waiting. He allowed her to make the choice. He couldn\u2019t possibly know how much such a small thing meant to her. And it made it that much easier to lift her lips to his, pressing into the incredible softness of his mouth. Lyra felt him tremble, ever so slightly, and it was nearly her undoing.</p><p>Why did she always end up wanting the most impossible things?</p><p>She slid her arms around Jaden\u2019s neck, fitting herself against him. One of his hands curved around her waist, the other brushing over her hair to cup the back of her head. His mouth opened against hers, and she swept her tongue inside, deepening the kiss. Instead of climbing him, which a part of her always seemed inclined to do, Lyra held back, stroking the hair at the nape of Jaden\u2019s neck, savoring the taste of him, the feel of him. He was like nothing and no one she had ever known. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With great effort, she finally pulled away, though Lyra let her hands stay on him for a precious few more minutes. Part of her knew this was a slippery slope she was starting on. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong species\u2014wrong everything. Maybe Jaden was right. Maybe they should just enjoy the now.</p><p>But she\u2019d never been very good at living in the moment. She was always rushing headlong into a future that refused to let her shape it. Not that she would ever stop trying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sad,\u201d Jaden said, still only a breath away from her. It was so tempting to just give in, to let go with him. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p> <p>Lyra managed a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one allowed to be moody. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not you. You\u2019ve got an incredible mouth.\u201d</p><p>She saw the heat flare in his eyes, felt it spark between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to let you use it a little longer.\u201d</p><p>She had to muster everything she had to pull away, but that\u2019s what Lyra did, stepping back out of the protective circle of Jaden\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cMaybe another night,\u201d she said. Not tonight. Tonight was for considering whether to further complicate her life.</p> <p>He startled her when he gave her a quick, hard kiss that held more than a hint of possessiveness, then stepped back before she had a chance to react.</p><p>\u201cI said I would leave it to you, Lyra,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you should remember that I\u2019m not made of stone. Touch me like that again, and I won\u2019t let you walk away so easily.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath, then nodded. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she said. And she was suddenly glad he couldn\u2019t get into her head, couldn\u2019t know how hard it was for her to walk away this time. Testing herself, testing him, was at an end. She was going to have Jaden, because at some point, she wasn\u2019t going to be able to help herself.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hot stuff,\u201d Lyra said, hoping to lighten the cloud of seriousness that had settled over them, as though whatever next move they made was going to be important no matter how she fought it. \u201cYou got your good-night kiss. Walk me home, and I might let you hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I resist?\u201d he asked in a tone so full of dark promise it made her shiver. But he fell silent again as they moved off the bridge, walking back toward the house where a spontaneous tryst was, thankfully, impossible. But Lyra drew in a sharp breath, then turned her head with an amused smile when Jaden caught her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cNo welching,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So Lyra left her fingers threaded through his, wishing it didn\u2019t feel quite so right, and headed for home.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>AGAIN.\u201d</p><p>Jaden tried to keep his amusement from showing as he watched Lyra hunch over panting, glaring at him from a few feet away. Her forehead was beaded with sweat, and a few curls had escaped from her ponytail to form a wild halo around her head.</p><p>Unlike her, he wasn\u2019t winded at all. But then, evading her attacks was an easier job than she had trying to launch them. Not that telling her that would do much to assuage her seething temper. She wanted to take him down. He planned to make her earn that right.</p><p>Channeling his sexual frustration into training Lyra had proven incredibly useful when it came to his focus, even if she didn\u2019t seem to appreciate it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, again?\u201d she snapped, straightening and wiping her forehead with the back of her arm. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to do that move like ten times now, and all you do is step away! I don\u2019t think you showed me right. That, or you\u2019re just making crap up to watch me fall on my ass over and over.\u201d</p><p>That was an entertaining bonus, but he didn\u2019t plan on telling her that. He shouldn\u2019t enjoy watching her get mad, but Lyra\u2019s reactions to things were unfailingly honest. And when peppered with one of her profanity-laced tirades, they were irresistible.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not making anything up. And you\u2019re getting it. You just need to keep working at it,\u201d he said, keeping his voice cool. She was coming along nicely. But if she didn\u2019t learn to control that temper of hers, none of this would be worth anything. He had a sneaking suspicion she was grappling with just as much physical frustration as he was, which likely wasn\u2019t helping matters.</p><p>Something had changed between them that night on the bridge. The way she\u2019d kissed him had been... unexpected, and as honest a thing as he\u2019d experienced in a very long time. Their interactions had become warmer since then, more open, even as her training had become a lot more fraught. He thought that probably the reason was because the wolf in her was so close to the surface during these sessions. The animal in her was all instinct and feeling\u2014and it wanted him. He knew the feeling, Jaden thought darkly.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to beg, damn it. That kiss had been three nights ago, and he\u2019d behaved. Though knowing the itch was getting to her was kind of satisfying, in a nasty sort of way.</p><p>He saw Lyra\u2019s eyes flash hot gold, and his body began to respond accordingly. Jaden thought frantically of images to halt his body\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Ice cubes... Antarctica... Dorien in a dress...</p><p>The last one worked\u2014sort of.</p><p>\u201cKeep working at it, keep working at it,\u201d Lyra mimicked in a sing-song voice. \u201cIs that all you can say? I could have gotten a parrot and gotten as much help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent that,\u201d Jaden said smoothly. \u201cI have a much nicer voice than a parrot.\u201d</p><p>Lyra bared her teeth at him instead of laughing. \u201cOh, you think this is funny, huh? Watching me flail around while you just stand there directing. I\u2019m not going to beat Eric like this, unless I can make him die laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to adjust your way of thinking about the movement,\u201d Jaden said, trying to stay patient while she railed at him. The woman herself had no patience, not that he was surprised. \u201cLess wolf, more cat. Concentrate!\u201d</p><p>Lyra threw back her head and let out something that sounded like a roar.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do we have to go over this? I am not a cat! I\u2019m a wolf! I can\u2019t change that, so make adjustments!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make the adjustments, if you really want to learn,\u201d Jaden replied, hearing the heat enter his own voice. \u201cNot everything revolves around you. Not everything can be tailored to you. I wasn\u2019t under the impression you were the sort of woman who needed coddling. You learn the right way, or you don\u2019t learn at all. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>He could handle Lyra\u2019s anger for quite a while, since he realized a lot of it was self-directed despite what came out of her mouth. But when it started to really spill over onto him, he quit being so tolerant.</p><p>True to form, she put a hand on one hip and glared at him. He knew the look\u2014insult time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re acting like a spoiled child. If this were easy, you wouldn\u2019t need me at all,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should do more than just stand there if you want me to learn the right way, O Exalted Master of Kitty Fu,\u201d Lyra growled, beginning to circle him slowly. There was no light but the stars and the moon, still bright though past its fullness, but with his hunter\u2019s eyes Jaden could see Lyra as clear as day. She stood out to him against the dark backdrop of towering pines and maples, looking like some ancient goddess of bounty with the tall grass and wildflowers brushing against her legs. Her eyes glowed like embers.</p><p>All around was silence, broken only by chirping crickets and the occasional call of an owl. It was a perfect night, a perfect spot here in a hidden field long left for the woods to reclaim.</p><p>It was also an excellent place to fight, if one was so inclined. And Lyra certainly seemed to be. Jaden decided battle was as good an outlet as any.</p><p>\u201cI might move more,\u201d he said in a voice both soft and deadly, \u201cif I was in any danger of actually being taken down by you. As it is, this is almost...\u201d he trailed off, watching her eyes narrow, enjoying her anticipation of his insult.</p><p>\u201cRelaxing,\u201d he finally finished, and all the raw nerves Lyra seemed to be in possession of seemed to burst into flame at once.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d She gave a feral snarl and lunged for him. And because he was a masochistic bastard, he didn\u2019t even try to get out of her way. If this was what she needed, for tonight, they\u2019d do it her way. Jaden caught her against him, grunting at the force with which she\u2019d launched herself. He stumbled backward, and they fell to the ground together. They rolled as soon as they hit, a frenzy of claws and snapping teeth, each trying to gain the upper hand. Lyra made it a lot harder than he\u2019d anticipated. But then, he might have expected it if he hadn\u2019t been so busy trying to keep his hands off of her up until now.</p><p>Her strength was incredible. Heat pumped off her in waves, heating his cool skin. They grappled together, hands hooked into claws, teeth bared. Jaden wanted to go easy on her. He was no sexist, but a certain sense of chivalry had never left him and he disliked having to hurt a woman. However, Lyra wouldn\u2019t let him give an inch. Her snapping teeth, snarling, and attempts at kneeing him in some very delicate places made it impossible to let down his guard.</p><p>\u201cDamn it Lyra,\u201d he panted, rolling her beneath him only to have her flip him once again and snap her teeth together inches from his nose. \u201cI\u2019m not the enemy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d she growled, then gave an outraged shriek as Jaden finally pinned her beneath him, her arms over her head. Lyra thrashed from side to side, and Jaden could only stare at the display of raw, powerful fury. She was less woman than animal in this moment, and he knew that he hadn\u2019t truly appreciated what Lyra was, what her powers meant, until right now.</p><p>He had her\u2014but only barely.</p><p>\u201cCalm down! You\u2019ve got to get it under control,\u201d he ordered her, but all Lyra did was writhe and buck beneath him. He knew it wasn\u2019t her goal, but despite his own anger, and despite the blood pumping hot and fast in his veins\u2014or the combination\u2014Lyra\u2019s display had quite the opposite effect of her intention. And having her captive beneath him only compounded the problem. All he could think of was the dreams he\u2019d had of her, bare skin like silk beneath his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flustered, and pushed nearly to his limit, he tried to instruct instead of giving in.</p><p>\u201cYou should try shifting back and forth during the fight,\u201d he panted, slamming her hands back down to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked through gritted teeth, which he noted had become awfully sharp.</p> <p>He growled as she nearly threw him off again. \u201cI mean be a wolf, be a human, be a wolf... mix it up, it throws off your enemies.\u201d</p><p>She stopped thrashing all at once. The sudden stillness was disconcerting, and all he could hear was the sound of labored breathing. Hers. His. Lyra\u2019s eyes blazed up at him, the brightest things in the darkness.</p><p>She was too tempting... irresistible. Their eyes locked, and he began to lower his mouth to hers, his eyes slipping shut.</p><p>He should have known that\u2019s when she would strike. The form beneath him changed shape in an instant, flesh becoming fur, snout in place of inviting lips. In the split second he was able to focus on them, her teeth were bared in what looked like an evil grin. He lost his grip and his balance at the same time, finding himself rolled and pinned by large paws before he could correct himself. His defensive instincts kicked in, overriding emotion.</p><p>Jaden slid into his cat form like water, his change in size making it easier to flip and scramble from beneath Lyra. He was the size of a wildcat, large enough to be intimidating, but smaller than a full-grown wolf. She snarled when she realized what had happened, but she was already behind him as he raced into the tall grass of the field, vanishing swift and silent into the dark.</p> <p>She had been on hunts before, but never one as exhilarating as this.</p><p>Lyra raced through the field, the grass brushing against her legs, her flanks. Her heart pumped steadily in her chest as she put on speed, chasing the whispers in the grass just ahead where Jaden thought he would escape her. She could smell him, the seductive musk of man and vampire and cat all entwined.</p><p>Jaden would never know the effect that scent had on her, especially in her wolf form where all her senses were intensified. But he was about to discover that running from her was an excellent way to lose, and quickly.</p><p>Jaden was fast. She would give him that. He was also going to be responsible for his own downfall, considering he was the one who\u2019d told her to shape-shift.</p><p>She could hear him, sense him, racing just ahead of her, darting back and forth through the field and trying to get far enough ahead to lose her. Wasn\u2019t going to happen, Lyra thought, so in tune with his movement that for a moment it felt almost like she and Jaden were extensions of the same creature. She was so close to him... almost there...</p><p>He darted to the side, then bunched his muscles to spring away. Lyra leaped at the same time, and with barely a thought shifted again in midair, stretching out her arms to grasp handfuls of sleek black fur. Beneath her fingers, Jaden changed, too, and this time when she hit the ground with him to roll in the soft grass anger was hopelessly tangled with lust. Lyra realized she\u2019d pushed it too far tonight. Time to either kiss or kill, and the choice, once made, was an overwhelming relief.</p> <p>Though she did slam him to the ground, just for fun.</p><p>His eyes were wide and startled, and a little admiring. \u201cWell done,\u201d he said slightly short of breath. \u201cYou should always do what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lyra growled, grabbing fistfuls of his shirt and dragging her mouth to his for a kiss that was at least half wild.</p><p>One of her last rational thoughts was how good it felt to get her hands on him, to feel all his tightly coiled strength thrumming beneath her fingers. Then she couldn\u2019t think at all as their bodies came together, her curves molding instantly against Jaden\u2019s hard, lean form. Lyra slid her arms around him as he rose against her, letting her fingers finally slide up into all that dark, shining hair. His scent, masculine, appealing, and, oddly, deliciously other, swamped her. She crushed her mouth against his, sliding against him, into him, until she felt herself being drawn down into some dark and blissful heaven.</p><p>Seeing Jaden\u2019s hunger for her was one thing. Tasting it was something very different.</p><p>Lyra gasped against Jaden\u2019s mouth as his tongue swept inside, coaxing her own into a wild and primal rhythm. His hands were in her hair, tugging it so that it tumbled down her back. She only dimly realized that while she might have initiated this, he had quickly taken control. Jaden rolled her beneath him, effectively capturing her. This time, she allowed it.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s fingers hooked into claws and dug into his shoulders. His kisses grew deeper, his mouth more insistent. She could feel the prick of his fangs against her tongue, and it only stoked the heat growing inside of her. His hands slid over her body as though he couldn\u2019t get enough of her, coasting over her back, her breasts, his touch just light enough to have her writhing against him, demanding more.</p><p>Still, she could feel him holding back, and the wolf now snapping at the end of its own tether would have none of it. Lyra growled softly, beginning to play rough. She nipped at Jaden\u2019s lower lip, just hard enough to draw blood. She heard his soft hiss, knew it had excited him when he kissed her again, hard. She drew his lip into her mouth to suckle it. In response, Jaden gripped her hips, fingers digging in, and pressed into her.</p> <p>Lyra moaned thickly in the back of her throat at the feel of him, hard where she was hot and throbbing. She arched into him, wrapping her legs around his waist, opening for him. Reality, sanity, everything slipped away. All she knew was that she wanted the man driving her mad with his mouth, his hands. Hot. Hard. Now.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he breathed, her name like a prayer on his lips. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She had waited, unsure, wondering whether there would be a right time for this. But she knew it was now.</p><p>They tore at each other\u2019s clothing, grasping and pulling until there was nothing but skin on skin, the heat between them threatening to set fire to the grass around them. His mouth seemed to be everywhere at once: her mouth, her neck, and then lower to suckle the tight buds of her nipples.</p><p>Lyra gave a hoarse cry. The sensation was exquisite when he trailed his hot tongue over her chest, kindling a delicious burn at her core. Then his mouth was on hers again, demanding and yet somehow soft enough that she sank into every kiss, never wanting to surface. He broke the kiss unexpectedly and rose above her in the darkness, bracing himself on his hands. His eyes were like blue fire. Lyra felt her breath catch in her throat. With only the night sky and the stars behind him, his pale skin shone like alabaster. He looked more god than man, unspeakably beautiful. Her hands trailed down his chest while her heart pounded within her own. Jaden\u2019s eyes slipped shut when she stroked him, and he made a sound that was half moan, half purr.</p><p>Lyra let out a shuddering breath. Gods, she wanted him so badly, it frightened her. But she couldn\u2019t turn away from him, not now. She reached between them and took him in her hand, stroking the throbbing length of him. Jaden\u2019s head dropped forward, and his hair hid his face from view. But his hips moved in time with her increasingly bold strokes, and his breathing was as ragged as her own. Finally, he reached down to pull her hand away, and he raised his head to look at her.</p><p>The raw need she saw written there sent shock waves of pleasure rippling through her.</p><p>\u201cMuch more of that and we\u2019ll be finished before we start,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cSlower,\u201d he continued, lowering himself over her, his chest brushing her skin. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for months. I damn well plan to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cMon\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her question, and the thoughts that went with it, were swept away on another rising wave of desire when his fingers slipped inside her and began a slow, deliberate rhythm that made all thoughts vanish. She tightened around his fingers, grinding against his hand, wanting something she no longer knew how to articulate.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. Her entire being felt as though it was lifting, rising toward some shimmering climax just beyond reach. He played her body masterfully, those eyes missing nothing as he coaxed broken moans and gasps from her lips.</p><p>When he withdrew his hand and settled himself between her legs, Lyra knew she should speak up, divulge the secret she\u2019d kept from him, one of the many things that had held her back. But his mouth claimed hers again in a long, drugging kiss, his tongue mimicking what his hips were doing with every press of the hard tip of his erection against her flesh. It was bliss. She didn\u2019t want to think, she just wanted to feel.</p><p>Then Jaden entered her in a single thrust, tearing through her maidenhead with a sharp burst of pain that drew a startled cry from Lyra. The pain was bright, intense\u2014and then gone, the first clue their joining would not be usual in any way. She caught a split-second look at Jaden\u2019s wide eyes before the first orgasm shot through her like white hot lightning. Her body arched sharply upward, her mouth opening in a silent scream. The initial pain of penetration vanished in the face of pleasure so intense she could do nothing but give herself over to it. Lyra\u2019s legs locked around Jaden\u2019s waist, and she squeezed as the first wave crested, then began to ebb.</p><p>The instinct to move was primal, irresistible. Lyra opened her eyes, wrapped in a sensual haze that was like nothing she\u2019d ever imagined could be possible. Jaden looked horrified. Fortunately, the bliss made it hard to care.</p><p>\u201cLyra, I\u2014I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t know you were a\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he stammered. She heard his words, registered his concern. But more important was the flush suffusing his pale skin, the way she could still feel him hard and pulsing deep inside her. He thought he had done something wrong.</p><p>But he was everything right.</p><p>The shimmering haze that Lyra felt enveloping her only seemed to thicken. All she could see, feel, want was the man pressed against her, inside her. All her worries and misgivings fell away, replaced by a certainty that Jaden was right. The one. The only one. And she was so close to making him hers. To being his.</p><p>No! You don\u2019t want this, don\u2019t want to belong to anyone! Whatever is going on, you can\u2019t undo it once it\u2019s done, STOP!</p><p>But the warning bells sounding in the back of her mind were distant and easy to ignore. She slid her hands down Jaden\u2019s back, feeling him shiver at her touch, and brought them to his hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she said softly, her voice breathy and unrecognizable to her own ears. \u201cPlease. What\u2019s done is done. I want this.\u201d</p><p>And she did, so much that in that moment it seemed to be all there was, all that mattered. Relief surged through her when she saw Jaden relax, desire replacing the fear now fading from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lyra nodded. \u201cI want this,\u201d she repeated, lifting her hips into him to make her point. The sensation had her head falling back, her eyes closing. Her breath escaped on a sigh.</p><p>So he began to move in her, slower thrusts at first, then stronger as the sparks between them once again lit and quickly turned to flames. The pace quickened, intensified, punctuated by Jaden\u2019s guttural moans as Lyra drove him beyond his control. She could feel everything inside of her gathering again, readying for a burst far greater than the one she\u2019d only just experienced. Her desire coiled within, tighter, ever tighter. She opened her eyes again when she was close to the edge, gripping Jaden\u2019s hips tightly in her hands as she urged him on. When their eyes locked, his full of more passion than she\u2019d ever imagined he might possess, Lyra felt something open up inside, unfurling like a night-blooming flower and stretching toward him as though he were the life-giving moon. He began to shudder, his own climax upon him, and with one small gesture made all that had built inside of Lyra break loose.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through hers to hold her hand.</p><p>When the dam burst this time, Lyra heard herself cry out as though from far away. Her body slammed upward, stiffening against him, tightening around him like a fist. A sensation almost too intense to be called something as simple as pleasure swept her away on dark and beautiful currents. Emotions she had never experienced, things that she could name but had never known, washed over her in wave after wave while he pulsed and throbbed within her.</p><p>She heard him cry out her name as he poured himself into her, and she did as instinct demanded. Without thought, without anything but feeling, Lyra raised up.</p> <p>And sank her teeth into his neck.</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>HE FELT AS THOUGH he had been run over by a semi. Several times. And then it had backed over him for good measure.</p><p>Fortunately, Jaden was far too happy to care.</p><p>Actually, happy wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, Jaden thought as he lay in the tall grass, his arms around the most unusual woman fate might have picked for him. Euphoric, maybe. Blissed out of his mind, even.</p><p>Words didn\u2019t matter. If that was the last time he ever had sex in his life, he knew he would die a happy man, even centuries from now.</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Lyra said, the sound vibrating against his throat where she\u2019d tucked her head. Her lips were still against his skin, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, he knew he would get worked up all over again. The certainty he felt about this amazed him, since by rights he shouldn\u2019t even be able to move.</p><p>Actually, whether he really could yet was debatable. His limbs felt like Jell-o. In a good way.</p><p>As a test, he stroked one hand along Lyra\u2019s back, over her silken curls, across warm skin, and down to cup her backside. Jaden gave a lazy smile. Yes, he could move.</p><p>From the position of the stars, Jaden thought it must be somewhere around two in the morning. Not even close to sunrise. Which was lovely, because he was perfectly awake and very content to lay here with Lyra for as long as possible. She was soft and warm, and smelled fantastic. And she was finally his.</p><p>For now, whispered a treacherous voice in the back of his mind, and he pushed it away quickly. He was great at spoiling his better moments with worry\u2014this would not be one of those. Still, he pulled her just a little closer, resting his chin on top of her head. How long had it been since he\u2019d held a woman like this? Ages. But he had never come anywhere near what he\u2019d experienced tonight with anyone. He wondered if it was because she was a werewolf... or because she was simply Lyra.</p><p>She sighed, her breath warming his neck. \u201cI l\u2014\u201d she started, then paused abruptly. \u201cI like lying here with you,\u201d she said quietly. For whatever reason, the muscles in her back tensed slightly, and Jaden began rubbing that area in gentle circles. Slowly, he felt her relax back into him, though perhaps a little more stiffly than before.</p><p>\u201cI like lying here with you too,\u201d he replied. After a moment of consideration, he added, \u201cYou\u2019re not... hurt, or anything, are you? If I\u2019d known, I would have tried to be a little gentler.\u201d</p><p>He wondered whether that was the source of her sudden tension. She hadn\u2019t so much as hinted she was a virgin, and she certainly didn\u2019t kiss like any virgin he\u2019d ever known. But the evidence had been a little hard to ignore. He hoped she didn\u2019t feel strange about their union. Jaden was honored that she\u2019d chosen him... more than he knew how to express. Though it shouldn\u2019t matter to him, and though he knew the sentiment was archaic at best, knowing that he had been the only man to possess her that way thrilled him in some deep and buried part of his soul.</p> <p>Of all the men she could have had, and with her beauty he knew there were many, she had chosen him. The simple truth of that filled him with wonder.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Lyra said, and he could hear the smile in her voice when she added, \u201cAnd no you wouldn\u2019t have. Which is also fine. It hasn\u2019t been a conscious choice or anything. I guess I\u2019m just picky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have interesting taste,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He heard her amused exhalation. But she shifted in his arms, drawing away from him to rise to a sitting position, her arms curled around herself. The loss of her warmth made him shiver a little in the cool night air. Suddenly unsure of himself, Jaden lifted a hand to place it gently on her back.</p><p>\u201cLyra? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Nothing,\u201d she said, turning her head to regard him. She offered a small smile, but Jaden felt the change in her as deeply as if she\u2019d simply stood up and walked away. One minute she\u2019d been very much with him. The next, she\u2019d retreated into herself, effectively shutting him out.</p><p>Frustrated at this sudden shift between them, Jaden rose to sit beside her, his body curved into hers. He leaned over to kiss her shoulder, letting his lips linger, enjoying her warmth. He felt her slight shiver, and he was relieved to find she wasn\u2019t unaffected by what they\u2019d shared.</p><p>\u201cWe should go back,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for consorting with vampires,\u201d Jaden teased her. \u201cStay with me. It\u2019s a beautiful night. We\u2019re naked in a field. Enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>That, at least, got half a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve done plenty of enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen a little more won\u2019t hurt. I spent long enough fantasizing about this. It\u2019s cruel to cut the reality short. I\u2019ll be emotionally scarred.\u201d</p><p>Lyra\u2019s smile was warmer this time, though he still felt as though she had decided to distance herself from him in a way that she hadn\u2019t during their lovemaking. She was a difficult woman, he reminded himself. And he wouldn\u2019t be half as fascinated by her if she wasn\u2019t. Still, he wished he knew why her guard had gone back up so quickly.</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you... not like it?\u201d He hated how vulnerable he sounded, how pathetic. But he hoped she had enjoyed it even half as much as he had. He was a bit rusty. Perhaps that was it...</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Lyra said, with a brook-no-refusals tone in her voice that settled him instantly. \u201cYou were amazing. I didn\u2019t\u2014I never thought\u2014\u201d She shook her head, then laughed softly. \u201cThere aren\u2019t words, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, Jaden shifted, lifting his hand to stroke her cheek, then down her arm. He worried she would bolt if he moved too quickly, and he so badly wanted her to stay with him, stay here. To make what was left of the night last, in case this chance never came again. Jaden felt her respond to his touch, saw her resolve weakening. He decided to press the advantage and claimed her mouth in a soft, lingering, and very thorough kiss.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s need rose so quickly it seemed to burn right through him, a blast of heat that sparked every dark desire he\u2019d ever had. His arms went around her, and he felt the pinpricks of her claws in his shoulders. Gods, he hoped she bit him again... that had been one of the most singularly erotic experiences of his life. And this time, he planned to return the favor.</p><p>Lyra abruptly broke the kiss with a sharp gasp, pushing herself back with such force that she kicked up a cloud of pollen from the ground.</p><p>\u201cLyra? What is it, love, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide, frightened. He\u2019d never seen that look of pure terror on her face before and had no idea what had put it there. For a long moment, she stared at him as though she\u2019d never seen him before, but then her look quickly faded into worry and confusion\u2014simpler things to deal with, and far less concerning. Still, what had happened?</p><p>\u201cDo you...\u201d Lyra began, her voice shaking. She stopped, took a breath, then pressed on. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel... funny... do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any funnier than I would normally feel lying around naked outside,\u201d Jaden replied, frowning a little. \u201cLyra, what on earth is wrong? Are you hurt?\u201d Even in the darkness, she looked a little pale, he thought.</p><p>She surprised him when she dropped her eyes, confirming to him that something more was bothering her. But her refusal to tell him what it was wasn\u2019t surprising at all. Just frustrating, and something he\u2019d hoped they\u2019d now gotten past.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m getting sick. I think I\u2019m just tired, honestly. Between the training and... after... it was quite a night. I just feel kind of off all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an incredible night. But if you feel like you should rest, then you should,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford you getting sick right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d Something in the way she said it lingered with him, and not in a pleasant way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyra got tentatively to her feet and began to collect the scattered bits of clothing strewn on the ground. At least she wasn\u2019t angry, Jaden thought. The boxer briefs that hit him in the head were a testament to that. And stepping away from him seemed to have restored a portion of Lyra\u2019s usual spirit.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed, hot stuff. If I bring you back naked we\u2019ll give my father a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Jaden forced a chuckle and got to his own feet. He began to dress, but the meaning behind Lyra\u2019s words hit him harder than he might have imagined. It was a reminder, and not too subtle, that however much they enjoyed each other, an actual relationship was impossible. Forbidden, if not explicitly by his kind, then very much so by hers. He hadn\u2019t thought he would care. In fact, he\u2019d convinced himself otherwise\u2014before.</p> <p>Now, though, having touched her, tasted her, Jaden was having a hard time imagining just walking away. She was... important to him.</p><p>He knew it was a problem.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t know what the hell to do about it.</p><p>The hair on his neck prickled an instant before the familiar scent hit him. It was only then, too late, that he realized the night had gone dead silent around them. Jaden\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said, a hoarse and urgent whisper.</p> <p>She whirled around, eyes alight, body suddenly tense. Her gaze connected with his, and he felt something pass between them, a brilliant flash of understanding that was both bizarre and completely unexpected. He\u2019s told her... something. But how? What had she just picked up from him?</p><p>There was no time to dwell on it, though. Four shadowy figures appeared around them, seeming to have pulled away from the fabric of the night itself. Jaden moved to Lyra, trying to shield her from what he knew was coming.</p><p>And Lyra, true to form, very deftly moved to his side.</p><p>\u201cJaden. Long time no see.\u201d</p><p>That voice was unpleasantly familiar. He recognized it quickly as LaSalle, one of the Ptolemy court\u2019s hangers-on. He\u2019d always been looking for ways to curry favor with Arsin\u00f6e. It seemed he\u2019d found a new one.</p><p>\u201cI would have preferred it had been longer,\u201d Jaden said.</p> <p>He heard a soft chuckle. LaSalle stepped forward, and Jaden\u2019s eyes, so well adjusted to the darkness, skimmed a face he had hoped never to see again. A quick glance at the other three was much the same story. Vampires he recognized, who would never mean him and his kind anything but harm. He and Lyra were far too exposed out here. He should have known better after the other night. But he hadn\u2019t wanted to believe these adversaries would be so bold... not here, of all places.</p><p>\u201cYou know the song. You can\u2019t always get what you want. And for you, in particular, there\u2019s a nice reward to be had.\u201d LaSalle\u2019s eyes, shrewd and cold, gleaming a dark green, flickered over Lyra. \u201cAn interesting place to hide. And even more interesting company you\u2019ve decided to keep. Stooping a little low, even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the company he used to keep, you can color me just as unimpressed,\u201d Lyra growled beside him. Jaden\u2019s heart sank, even as LaSalle\u2019s lip curled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry for that, bitch. This cat is the property of the Ptolemy dynasty. There\u2019s a big reward on his head for his return... and a slightly smaller reward for just returning his head. If you force me into the latter, I\u2019m bringing yours along as a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThis is my pack\u2019s territory. Once they find out you\u2019ve been here, you\u2019ll be hunted down. And we don\u2019t take prisoners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Alpha\u2019s daughter,\u201d Jaden said, torn between admiring Lyra\u2019s bravado and wishing that for once she would step back and not come off as quite so sure she could destroy every enemy. \u201cKilling her would be a bad move.\u201d</p><p>LaSalle snorted. \u201cLike we give a damn what a bunch of wolves thinks. You think we\u2019re afraid of your kind, chere?\u201d he asked Lyra. \u201cThe wolves only live because we let them. Now step away from the cat, or share what he has coming to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, go home. I\u2019ll deal with this,\u201d Jaden growled, his claws already curling from his fingertips. This was his fight, and Lyra didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt because of it. These were no lazy courtiers. These were the sort of vampires who enjoyed hunting and killing his kind, and others, for sport. But he wouldn\u2019t be taken without a fight, and there was no way he was going back to Arsin\u00f6e alive.</p> <p>Naturally, Lyra did the opposite of what he wished.</p><p>\u201cThe hell with that,\u201d she said, glaring at LaSalle. \u201cThis place belongs to the Pack of the Thorn. And Jaden is under our protection.\u201d</p><p>Jaden winced, knowing how that would sound, and LaSalle burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he asked, barely able to catch his breath when he could finally speak. \u201cThe cat needs a bunch of mongrels to protect him, eh? My. How far the mighty have fallen, Jaden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am also under the protection of the Lilim,\u201d Jaden said, curling his lip. He pulled aside the collar of his shirt to bare the mark. \u201cLily is well aware that the Ptolemy have taken some of the Cait Sith who have come to us. Move against me, and you\u2019ll have the full wrath of the dynasty upon you. Our leader is not afraid of Arsin\u00f6e... or war.\u201d</p><p>He hoped it didn\u2019t come to that, though. Lily wasn\u2019t ready for what the Ptolemy could rain down upon her, even in their weakened state. And the Council would always side with what they knew. She would find little help there.</p><p>LaSalle glared at Jaden\u2019s mark, his eyes flashing bright red for an instant before he turned his head and spat on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThe Lilim are no dynasty. They\u2019re an aberration, and they need to be stamped out. The Ptolemy do not recognize you as legitimate, cat. And the war you seek will come soon enough. Until then, Arsin\u00f6e has us find and return her property. You, especially, she would like to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Jaden said softly, trying not to sound like he was pleading even though he was. \u201cYou need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You need my help.\u201d</p><p>He knew there would be no budging her, so he offered all the advice he could muster as the four Ptolemy began to look at one another and shuffle on their feet, getting ready to pounce.</p><p>\u201cGo for the kill as soon as you get a clear shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re fast.\u201d</p><p>LaSalle reached into a pocket and withdrew what looked like a length of thick silver chain. He grinned and dangled it in front of Jaden, whose blood went cold. He remembered the collars. All too well.</p><p>\u201cI found your old collar, Jaden. I\u2019ve brought it as a present.\u201d</p><p>Memories stirred in the depths of his mind, things he would rather keep buried: the burn of the enchanted metal around his neck, being forced into his cat form with no hope of returning to the human one until his punishment was ended and the collar removed; the kicks and food and objects hurled at him while he was forced to belly-crawl across the floor; the vicious, mindless laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snarled, knowing his fury was exactly what LaSalle wanted but unable to control it. Jaden leaped at him, knocking the collar out of the other vampire\u2019s hand but missing the man himself, who stepped easily out of the way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that,\u201d LaSalle taunted him. \u201cOr have you lost your touch?\u201d Jaden couldn\u2019t miss the eagerness written all over the vampire\u2019s face. He wanted his kill. And so, Jaden discovered, did he. A small compensation for all the wrongs the Ptolemy had done, and were still doing, to his kind.</p><p>Jaden leaped again, this time catching LaSalle\u2019s arm as he tried to flicker out of the way. He heard his own furious roar, almost as if it were coming from someone else. And dimly, somewhere behind him, he heard Lyra\u2019s fierce shout, a scream of anger that quickly shifted into a howl.</p><p>He hoped to the gods she remembered what he\u2019d been teaching her.</p><p>The frenzy as all four Ptolemy came at them was quick and brutal. The night turned bloody as claws tore into flesh; claws slashed and blows strong enough to send a mortal flying pummeled Jaden. He fought as a man, as a cat, hoping to gain some sort of upper hand. But the fight was difficult when he was so outnumbered, though he caught glimpses of Lyra fighting like hell.</p><p>She was holding her own, though thin rivulets of blood streamed down one side of her face as she fought a creature who was making it as hard as he could to land a hit. Fear and anger coiled inside Jaden, a toxic combination that had him striking out and opening up one Ptolemy\u2019s throat, the vampire\u2019s grin freezing as blood sprayed Jaden\u2019s face and chest. A furious snarl sounded behind him, and Jaden spun to see LaSalle leaping into the air, his moves so lightning fast he was little more than a flicker. Speed was the gift of the Ptolemy and the curse of their enemies.</p><p>LaSalle caught Jaden\u2019s eye and smiled. Then he vanished into a blur as he streamed right at Lyra.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jaden shouted, knocking another Ptolemy to the ground as if he weighed nothing at all. He knew what was coming, knew he wouldn\u2019t reach her in time. Time seemed to slow to a crawl and he lunged toward Lyra, who was fending off a vampire just a few feet from him. He saw every tiny nuance of her movement as she looked to her left, the slight widening of her eyes when she realized what was coming for her.</p><p>Then, to his amazement, he watched LaSalle slam to the ground and roll as Lyra sprang from the balls of her feet, graceful as an acrobat, and back-flipped out of reach. Jaden had to shake off his surprise quickly, seizing the opportunity to jump onto LaSalle while he was down. Jaden\u2019s hands were around the vampire\u2019s throat in an instant, squeezing, his claws digging in. Fury that came from one of the darkest places in his soul, a place that they had created, quickly pulsed through his entire system.</p><p>LaSalle looked up at him, his eyes bright and gleaming and full of shock. It was clear he had not expected this turn of events. Behind them, Jaden heard Lyra engage the remaining two Ptolemy again, and he knew he had to be quick. They would not flag simply because their leader was down.</p><p>\u201cShe,\u201d gurgled LaSalle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jaden sneered, baring his fangs. \u201cShe can outfight you, because I taught her to. I\u2019m never going back, LaSalle. And neither are you.\u201d</p><p>Without his knife, the decapitation was quick but gruesome. Necessary, though, to end any vampire. Later, he would burn the body if he had time. A strange sound behind him slowly penetrated the bloody haze in which he was ensconced, crouching over LaSalle\u2019s body and drinking in shallow little sips of air. The rage was as dark as anything he\u2019d ever experienced, fueled as it was by the memories of his torment. The scars on his back burned as if fresh.</p><p>Lyra. I have to help Lyra. This isn\u2019t finished.</p> <p>Jaden rose and turned, and was greeted by an unexpected sight. Lyra stood over the corpses of the other Ptolemy, a bloodied dagger in her hand. She was a little battered, but there was something incredibly triumphant about her, like a pagan goddess of war. The oddity of her even having a dagger was quickly explained when he realized that they were no longer alone. A small group of werewolves had joined them, Simon and Dorien among them.</p><p>All the wolves were looking at him.</p><p>Jaden said nothing, simply walked to Lyra and held out his hand. She placed the dagger in it without a single question, and he turned to finish severing the head of the Ptolemy whose throat he had torn out, just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cThe bodies should be burned,\u201d he said flatly as he returned, handing the dagger to Dorien. The fury receded, leaving an odd numbness in its place. It was hard to fathom that a short time ago, he\u2019d been as happy as he could remember being. The Ptolemy had managed to spoil even that. It seemed they were destined to ruin everything good in Jaden\u2019s life no matter what he did.</p><p>\u201cWe know. We\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Dorien said. He was as somber as Jaden had seen the man, and he wondered, dully, if the wolves would use the attack as an excuse to run him off. He would have to let them. Right now, he had no fight left in him. But when one of the other wolves spoke, a shorter, barrel-chested man who looked as though he\u2019d seen plenty of fights, his words were far from anything Jaden expected.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t run. You defended Lyra,\u201d he said. The man had the audacity to sound surprised. Jaden wanted to snap, but he managed to hold back. That was the anger still in his system, not what was called for now.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cBut she did a hell of a job defending herself.\u201d</p><p>He saw the smile, small but unmistakable, that curved her lips. It went a long way toward calming what remained of his rage. The rest vanished the moment the wolf who had addressed him stepped forward with his hand extended. It took Jaden a moment to register the expression the man wore, since it was one he saw so rarely.</p><p>Gratitude.</p><p>Jaden, dumbfounded for one of the few times in his long life, accepted the hand being offered and shook it.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about you. You defended a fellow wolf, and our home. For that, you have my thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Jaden stammered, even more shocked when the other wolves came forward to repeat the gesture. Simon was the last in line, and he gave a curt nod before shaking hands too.</p><p>\u201cI told Lyra I\u2019d be watching you. Looks like not all vampires are without honor. From now on, as far as we\u2019re concerned, you\u2019re welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Jaden looked around at each of their faces, seeing the simple truth echoed over and over again. He had shed blood for them. He had acted in defense of Lyra, and of their home. So they, in turn, had decided to accept him. Jaden couldn\u2019t help but feel the weight of the honor. These wolves must think poorly of his kind indeed to assume he would leave Lyra to the mercy of these vampire killers.</p><p>But since plenty of vampires were much like these Ptolemy, he supposed he couldn\u2019t blame Simon and the others for the bad impression.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were they doing here?\u201d Dorien wondered aloud, prodding one of them with his toe. \u201cAll these years, we\u2019ve barely seen a one of your kind. Now we\u2019re some kind of tourist attraction.\u201d</p><p>Lyra caught his eye, gave a barely perceptible shake of her head. She was right\u2014it might not go over as well if they knew he was the one who had drawn the Ptolemy here, however unwittingly. Still, he thought it was odd the intruders had found him deep in werewolf country, of all places. Had he been followed from Tipton? That prospect didn\u2019t seem likely, and he\u2019d been careful.</p><p>A puzzle, and one he needed to sort out. Putting innocents in danger because the Ptolemy refused to give up their claim on an entire bloodline was unacceptable to him. Just as lying about the danger was no longer acceptable, no matter whether the truth hurt him or not.</p><p>\u201cThey were here because of me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI was a slave of their queen for a very long time. She hasn\u2019t quite gotten over the fact that I, and my blood brothers and sisters, are no longer under her purview.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill there be more of them, do you think?\u201d Simon asked, his expression unreadable.</p><p>Jaden shrugged. \u201cNot sure. This lot won\u2019t be reporting back, at least. Beyond that, I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d He looked at Dorien. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I seem to have brought them here. I had no idea I was being tracked.\u201d</p><p>Dorien looked at his colleagues and grunted. \u201cNot worried. A few stragglers here and there is just good practice for my men. Not often we get to rip into actual vamps. These don\u2019t seem to have caused much trouble, even with you outnumbered.\u201d He paused, looked at his daughter who seemed no worse for wear despite the blood. Then he shook his head wonderingly.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d tell a wolf and a vamp that they make a good team, but you two are going to prove me wrong. This is some carnage. And I mean that in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding,\u201d the stocky one said, dropping a wink at Lyra. \u201cI may have to conscript the both of you into the guard. That\u2019d cause a stir!\u201d</p><p>You have no idea, Jaden thought. He caught Lyra\u2019s eye, hoping to see a smile. But instead, she looked troubled and turned her head away. Still, Jaden gave a short laugh as the men chuckled. He suddenly realized that nothing about them was what he had expected. He was used to subversion, secrecy, and vampires who were more interested in covering their own asses than being heroes, though his experience being mainly with the Ptolemy had a lot to do with that, he supposed. The philosophy, the attitude of these wolves was... different.</p><p>They might be as rough as they\u2019d been painted among vampires. But that was not all they were. Of course, expecting them to bless the romantic pairing of a wolf and a vampire was probably a bridge too far. Probably.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cCome on. We\u2019ll light these bastards up and then all go back to my house for a drink,\u201d Dorien said. There were nods of agreement as Dorien retrieved a lighter from his pocket. \u201cI want to hear the story from the two of you, and no leaving out any of the gore. This should be a good one.\u201d</p><p>The barrel-chested one grinned at Jaden. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a dry evening for you, Jaden, unless you can stomach a beer. I might be impressed, but I\u2019m still not volunteering to open a vein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage with a beer,\u201d Jaden said with a smile, feeling off-balance, but in a surprisingly pleasant way.</p><p>Lyra sidled up beside him as the burning began, the vampire corpses vanishing seconds after they were lit. The flames danced in her troubled eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d she said. \u201cKill a few Ptolemy and you\u2019re golden.\u201d She sounded more weary than happy, which surprised him. Jaden thought she\u2019d be pleased that they\u2019d done so well. And from what he had been able to see, her technique was excellent. If she kept that kind of focus, she would already be a surprise that most werewolves wouldn\u2019t see coming. For Eric, it would take more, simply because of his size and particular fixation on killing her, but Jaden was encouraged. Taking down Ptolemy was no small thing.</p><p>Here she stood, however, looking defeated. He wondered if he would ever understand her.</p><p>\u201cIf only everything in life were so easy,\u201d he said. She knew what he meant, and he saw any sign of emotion in her eyes quickly shuttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed. You fought well,\u201d he added, low enough that only she could hear it. \u201cThey know it too,\u201d he added, jerking his head toward the other wolves.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s... that\u2019s good, I\u2019m glad.\u201d She sounded anything but, but Jaden hardly knew how to respond. Something was wrong, that much was obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to join everyone, right? Stay up and share our tale of bloody derring-do?\u201d</p><p>It was no surprise when Lyra shook her head no. He took a deep breath, frustrated by his inability to see what was truly wrong. Mind-reading mortals was often annoying, but the gift would have come in handy here among the wolves.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lyra, don\u2019t be a hero. If you\u2019re sick or hurt, we need to get you to a doctor. Your pack must have one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m neither. I swear,\u201d she said firmly. Then she seemed to deflate a little, slumping as though all the fight had gone out of her. \u201cI think I just need some sleep. I don\u2019t... I really just don\u2019t feel well.\u201d She put a hand to her head and closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back. You have fun with the boys. You\u2019ve earned it. I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve decided to like you, though. I really am.\u201d She looked so tired, and so uncharacteristically defeated, that Jaden barely restrained himself from putting his arms around her.</p><p>Instead, he had to stand there and watch her walk away, knowing it wouldn\u2019t be the last time.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>THE END of the night was bad.</p><p>Morning was worse.</p><p>Lyra stood beneath the spray, feeling more like a ghost than a werewolf. Last night had been a rough one, a swing from one extreme to the other. Today, she felt colorless, washed out. It shouldn\u2019t be that way. She and Jaden had had mind-blowing, earth-shattering sex! Awesome! Her father and the higher-ups of the pack guard thought she and Jaden made a great team, and had actually acknowledged that she\u2019d kicked some vampire ass! Super-duper! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And yet somehow, she felt as though she was stuck in the pit staring up at the pendulum as its gleaming blade swung lower... and lower...</p><p>Lyra poured vanilla citrus soap on her bath puff and lathered up, barely paying attention to what she was doing. She decided that wallowing for a little longer was therapeutic. Lyra\u2019s lips lifted in a cynical half smile. Usually it was Jaden\u2019s job to brood, not hers.</p><p>Jaden. There was no residual soreness from last night, nothing but the memory of his hands on her body, the way he had almost worshipped her as he\u2019d made love to her. She sighed, glad to at least have those memories as one hell of a distraction from her horrible mood. If there were such a thing as perfection, joining with him had come very close. Imagining the act hadn\u2019t done the reality justice at all. She only wished the night had ended better. Like, without a vampire ambush.</p> <p>Of course, even if the Ptolemy hadn\u2019t shown up, she\u2019d been rattled. The lovemaking had been almost too intense, solidifying a connection with Jaden that was far more potent than anything she\u2019d expected to feel. Moving inside her, Jaden had seemed more like an extension of herself than a separate being. Even the aftermath had been charged, hazy and full of jumbled thoughts and feelings that all boiled down to the same impossible thing.</p><p>She was falling in love with him.</p><p>Worse, she\u2019d almost said so.</p><p>She\u2019d realized it as they lay there afterward, feeling the rhythm their heartbeats made together. She\u2019d been too euphoric, too content to fight it any longer. And as she\u2019d thought it, there the words had been, right on the tip of her tongue, along with the deep certainty that she should always be near him, that she never wanted to be anywhere she couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>Unfortunately, along with that had come another feeling, an unfamiliar sense that she belonged to him. Lyra grimaced at the thought. Ownership was a lot of what wolf matehood was all about, one of the reasons she had every intention of avoiding it. If she could feel like this from sleeping with a guy she couldn\u2019t actually bond with, how much worse must it be between wolves? No one was ever going to possess her. The best solution would be to never fall in love at all, she knew. So she would just have to deal with this, try to stop the slide before she was in way over her head.</p> <p>Of course, that was presuming she wasn\u2019t already. But she had to believe she could make it stop, push back whatever this was turning into. Because not doing so would throw everything she wanted in doubt.</p><p>Lyra rinsed the soap off, brushing her hands over her skin to get rid of the last of the suds. She was barely paying attention, lost in her own thoughts. As she passed the puff over her arm, however, something registered as different. Lyra nearly managed to ignore it, through the distant warning bells going off in the back of her mind. But her eyes were drawn back, much against her better judgment. There, faint but unmistakable, she saw the intricate band encircling her right arm at mid-bicep.</p><p>The bath puff fell to the floor unnoticed. She stared. Tentatively, as though touching it might burn her, she raised her left hand and rubbed at the new mark with a finger. First lightly, then harder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, her skin turning red as she scrubbed roughly. \u201cNo, seriously, come on, no.\u201d</p><p>But no amount of begging removed it, and after a few minutes of fruitless effort, Lyra simply stood there under the running water staring at what she had done. What they had done.</p><p>It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s NOT.</p> <p>The numbness vanished quickly, replaced by an intense pressure in her chest that seemed to build and build, until it felt as though she might suffocate. Tiny starbursts appeared in front of her eyes, and Lyra knew she was going to pass out if she didn\u2019t sit down and get a hold of herself. Bracing herself against the wall, she turned off the water and slowly sank to the floor of the tub, wrapping her arms around her legs.</p><p>Cats. She had cats wrapped around her arm. Stretching forward, lolling on their backs, each connected to the other by catching the tail. Cute, apart from the bared fangs of some and the fierce eyes of others. Not housecats. Cats like Jaden.</p><p>Anyone who saw this would know what had happened in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she said in a soft moan, and she hiccupped back the tears that wanted to come. She did not cry. Not ever. And certainly not about damn fool things she\u2019d done to herself, even if they ruined... everything.</p><p>Had she really thought she wasn\u2019t in over her head? Somehow, she\u2019d bonded with Jaden.</p><p>With a vampire.</p><p>She sat there, stunned, for minutes that could have been hours. Finally, Lyra forced herself to go through the motions, standing up and toweling off. Her eyes, gazing back at her from the mirror, were dull with shock. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible. But then... perhaps no one had ever been stupid enough to test the theory that wolves and vampires were incompatible. Until now, that was.</p><p>Did he have one too? Or would it just be her, bearing a singular mark as punishment for foolishly giving in to taking something she couldn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, truly have?</p> <p>She touched the band on her skin again, lighter than most marks of bonding she had seen but still very much there. Even as she did, the memory of Jaden filled her mind\u2014the look in his eyes when he moved inside her, the way he touched her, as though she were some fragile, precious thing. His smiles, rare and beautiful and just for her. The longing that flooded her nearly took her back to her knees.</p><p>One of the few choices she\u2019d had, now taken away forever. A forbidden mate.</p><p>What the hell was she supposed to do now?</p><p>A treacherous tear slipped down one cheek, and for once, Lyra gave over to the impulse.</p><p>She leaned against the counter and wept.</p><p>Once she\u2019d collected herself, Lyra put on a little bit of concealer, sucked it up, and did what always got her through in the past: kept moving.</p><p>She hopped in her little pickup, peeled out of the driveway, and drove straight for the one place that might help her. She was at the Larison Silver Memorial Library in five minutes, and headed down into the basement in another five, her boot heels clicking and echoing on the wooden stairs. This was the part of the library that was only open to a certain subset of the public. The stairs themselves were hidden, and the basement musty enough to be a deterrent to anyone with a decent nose. But Lyra had an excellent nose, and she still pressed on.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she hadn\u2019t thought of it before. If there was an answer to her problem, it was here, in the Thorn Histories.</p><p>Teresa McFarlane sat at a scarred old desk at the foot of the stairs, utterly absorbed in what looked like a torrid novel. Lyra slowed to look at the cover, her curiosity piqued.</p><p>\u201cHey Teresa. How\u2019s the m\u00e9nage?\u201d</p><p>Teresa, a plump and pretty woman in her early fifties who looked as though the word m\u00e9nage might send her into palpitations, looked up, startled. When she spotted Lyra, however, her quick grin said it all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just getting good. And I can\u2019t decide whether I want Rafe to end up with the sexy biker boy who\u2019s been worshipping him from afar, or the beautiful seductress who keeps coming between them. Literally.\u201d</p><p>Lyra burst out laughing, glad to find she was still capable of such a reaction. She could always count on Teresa, who was the opposite of what she used to think a Keeper of the Histories should be, to lighten the mood. She was also pretty sure that Teresa had taken the job because it gave her hours every day to read without interruption. And some of the Keeper\u2019s favorite subjects had introduced Lyra to a whole new literary world.</p><p>A multiple-partnered, very unclothed literary world. She wondered sometimes what Gerry thought of his wife\u2019s active imagination and then decided he probably wasn\u2019t complaining. Some of that stuff could just about set the pages on fire.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t have to pick,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping,\u201d Teresa said, sliding off her reading glasses to look at Lyra. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, honey? What can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, interested in bonding,\u201d Lyra said. She\u2019d tried to come up with a way to beat around the bush, but there simply wasn\u2019t one. Fortunately, Teresa preferred blunt, and Lyra doubted there would be too many questions if she played this right.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d Teresa said with a dramatic sigh, fanning herself. \u201cSo what\u2019s the occasion? You finally find a wolf who can handle you? Or just one you want to handle?\u201d She wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s smile felt slightly more pasted on. Of course Teresa assumed she\u2019d be looking for a nice wolf. Why not? Anything else for a woman in her position wasn\u2019t done. Unless it was, and you wound up wearing a cat tattoo...</p><p>\u201cSadly no,\u201d Lyra replied. \u201cI was actually wondering about, ah, interspecies bonding. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>Teresa\u2019s eyebrows lifted so high they nearly shot past her hairline. \u201cInterspecies? You mean like human and werewolf? I\u2019ve got quite a bit on that. Honey, tell me you didn\u2019t meet a human. It would break your father\u2019s heart.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cIt would make your aunt\u2019s day, though. I swear that woman\u2019s the biggest tightass in three counties.\u201d</p><p>Lyra blew out a breath, exasperated and amused all at the same time. \u201cNo, honestly, Teresa, this isn\u2019t for me. You know we\u2019ve got the vamp staying with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Couldn\u2019t miss him,\u201d she replied. \u201cGot that dangerous bad boy thing going on. It\u2019s a shame he smells like cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been stuck kind of squiring him around, and he\u2019s insistent that vampires and werewolves used to hook up. Like, actually bond. I bet him fifty bucks he\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t know how to prove it. I figured you would.\u201d</p><p>Teresa relaxed immediately, and the relief nearly took Lyra down. She bought it. Of course she would. Why else could she want to know such a crazy thing? She was a vamp hater just like everyone else here, after all, a nice Alpha\u2019s girl. Right?</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cGood one, honey. And I\u2019d love to see you fleece the vamp, but I\u2019m afraid he actually has a point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d Lyra asked, trying to ignore the adrenaline now coursing through her blood. \u201cNo way. That\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. They can be pretty enough.\u201d Teresa chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s the rest of them that\u2019s the problem, personality especially.\u201d She stood, stretching a little. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you. At least then you\u2019ll know where to look it up the next time you decide to fleece somebody else with that bet.\u201d</p><p>Teresa led her into the interior of the Room of Histories, a dimly lit cave of a place filled with tall bookshelves that were stuffed with enormous, parchment-filled tomes. They were meticulously organized, and Lyra had come to learn, over the years, that Teresa\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge encompassed the contents of every single volume of the pack\u2019s history. It had saved her butt on a school paper a time or two.</p> <p>She hoped that knowledge would do the same now.</p><p>They headed down the third row, which contained tomes that were quite old. The bindings, though kept oiled, were dull, and the parchment within had grown stiff and brittle over the years. Only Teresa was allowed to touch these, Lyra knew. It would be too detrimental to the tomes to allow any other hands on them. They stopped in the middle of the row, and Teresa scanned the shelves, murmuring to herself. After a few seconds, she selected a book, more ragged than some, that looked singed as if from a fire on the lower right corner.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d she said. \u201cFourteen ninety-five. Not a happy year, as you might guess from the burn marks. Our camp was burned, half the pack was slaughtered when we were blamed for an outbreak of plague, and the Thorn was introduced to the concept of vampire-werewolf mating.\u201d She set the tome down on one of the long, low reading tables set in the wide middle row and opened to a place about three-quarters of the way through. Her hands, small and quick, turned pages with infinite care. Lyra watched, fascinated. She\u2019d always loved to watch Teresa work, even though she knew that, in her own hands, this job would be a disaster. She could just see herself accidentally crunching up page after page...</p><p>\u201cSo... how did it go?\u201d Lyra asked, moving beside Teresa to scan the pages of flowing script. The wolves, unlike nobility at the time, had always written in the vernacular, and Lyra could read the writing well enough, even if many of the words and wording were odd.</p><p>Teresa shot her an arch look. \u201cAbout as well as you\u2019d expect, since it\u2019s still forbidden. This was the root of it, here. A she-wolf of the Thorn, Elizabeth Thatcher, got involved with a vamp from the Rakshasa. Those were lion-shifters, actually,\u201d she said, considering. \u201cThink I heard they\u2019d been hunted to extinction by some dynasty or other, but who knows? And they think we\u2019re violent. Anyway, they went off together, tripped the night fantastic, and discovered that you can, indeed, hitch a wolf and a vamp together. There\u2019s a little poem about it here, see?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cAlways had wolves who enjoyed writing in verse back then.\u201d</p> <p>Lyra leaned in to read the section that Teresa tapped with her finger.</p><p>\u201cWhen werewolf\u2019s bite the vampire takes,\u201d she murmured, eyes skimming the short passage. It was a short rhyme, rather pretty... and immensely informative. At least now she understood why she had only a faint mark and Jaden, at least as far as she knew, had none. They hadn\u2019t finished the ritual. And if she had anything to say about it they weren\u2019t going to... though the words describing the simple process of attaching to a vampire forever caused a strange fluttering in her stomach, and what felt like fireworks shimmering their way through her blood.</p><p>It was possible. The pairing had been done.</p><p>It could be done again, if it was allowed. Which of course it wasn\u2019t. In fact, not allowed was a kind way to put it. But... but...</p><p>Her mind spun as she tried to absorb it. She wasn\u2019t the first! There had been others like her, falling into the arms of a vampire, only to find\u2014</p><p>\u201cShame what happened. The vamp had drained ten wolves before they caught him, and then they took him and his mate and...\u201d She trailed off, made a face, and closed the book.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Teresa said. \u201cThey also never spared the gory details. And on that note, I think I need to get back to my m\u00e9nage. My brain needs cleaning. What was it with medieval times and metal spikes?\u201d</p><p>Lyra blanched, trying not to imagine what had been done to the ill-fated lovers. \u201cYeah. My question\u2019s answered. I do not want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Teresa said with a gentle smile. Uh-oh, Lyra thought. She knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Gerry and I have been talking a lot about you lately. And I don\u2019t mean to poke at you, Lyra, but... are you sure you want to go through with the Proving, honey? I know you and your cousin don\u2019t get along, but I was saying to Gerry, my cousin is in the Pack of the Shadowed Path, and her son would be perfect for you... a born leader, I always said, and what a match you\u2019d make, running the Thorn!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m backing away slowly, Lyra thought, trying not to give Teresa her patented Death Glare. She knew the woman meant well. She really did. But one more of these conversations and her head was going to burst into flames. Probably while she was shouting, \u201cActually, I\u2019ve already got a mate, kinda sorta! He\u2019s a vampire! Talk about leadership qualities, right?\u201d</p><p>Instead, she managed a smile as she headed for the stairs as quickly as she could walking backward. She found it funny, in a sick sort of way, when she realized that all of Jaden\u2019s instruction had helped her in that department.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Teresa, but I\u2019ve got to go. Thanks for the help, even if I\u2019m still out fifty bucks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. You just let me know if you change your mind,\u201d Teresa called, heading back to her desk and the smoking-hot book.</p> <p>Not likely, Lyra thought. But along with the continuing fear that her mark would be seen, she felt some measure of relief. This was only a half mark, really, another burden she could, and would, bear alone. All was not lost as long as she kept her hands to herself the rest of the time Jaden was there. More importantly, as long as he kept his teeth to himself.</p><p>She only wished she didn\u2019t feel regret... not from having been with Jaden, but because she had tasted something with him she would never forget, and would never be able to have again.</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>OKAY, NORMALLY I wouldn\u2019t ask, but... is everything okay? I mean, as okay as it gets for a vampire. I\u2019m not sure what your baseline is, but you just seem... off.\u201d</p><p>Jaden turned his head from watching a raucous game of what looked like full-body contact pool to look at his unlikely companion. He was glad for the invitation, if surprised. Lyra had begged off training with him tonight. He\u2019d found it hard to argue\u2014she didn\u2019t look well at all. Her eyes, especially, had seemed glassy and almost haunted. She\u2019d pleaded a headache.</p><p>But from the way she\u2019d shied from his touch, he wondered. He could deal with almost anything it might be, unless she\u2019d decided that touching him had been a mistake. Because rather than slaking his thirst for her, being with Lyra had increased it a thousand-fold. The prickly she-wolf had gotten under his skin, inside his head. Whatever she had done to him, he wanted more.</p><p>He forced himself to focus on the man speaking to him, instead of the ghost of the woman prowling restlessly through his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried because I\u2019m pale, are you? We\u2019ve been over this. The pale skin is not a bug, it\u2019s a feature.\u201d</p><p>Simon Dale snorted softly and dug into the basket of fries that graced the middle of the small, battered table they were sharing. He dipped a fry in the bowl of gravy that had come with the appetizer, then popped it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, though I don\u2019t know why more vamps aren\u2019t into self-tanner. You\u2019d be less obvious. No, I\u2019m just asking because despite your triumphant ripping up of those Ptolemy last night, Lyra\u2019s been weird all day and now there\u2019s you with the moody. Well,\u201d he smirked, \u201cI mean, I think you\u2019re moodier than usual. It\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d</p><p>Jaden\u2019s tone was acid. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>Simon grinned. \u201cI\u2019m here all week.\u201d</p><p>Jaden still hadn\u2019t figured out what this invitation was about. Simon Dale was hard not to like. He was a little like an overgrown puppy: amusing, slightly rude, and prone to eating everything in sight. He had also been the first member of the pack to actively seek out Jaden\u2019s company, which made Jaden inclined to like him just on general principle. But still, the offer of a drink tonight was undoubtedly about more than friendly conversation. For the moment, however, he played along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moody, I\u2019m a vampire. And as for Lyra, I don\u2019t know. When I left, she was locked away nursing a headache. If you mean something beyond that, you should probably ask her.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI would, if I thought I\u2019d get a straight answer. She hasn\u2019t wanted to talk to me about much of anything since you showed up, no offense.\u201d He contemplatively swirled another fry in the gravy. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have pushed it when her father tried to get her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Jaden gagged on the small sip of beer he\u2019d just taken, then started coughing. Simon\u2019s lips twisted into a cynical smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was basically her reaction too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s voice sounded strained and slightly hoarse when he finally got his power of speech back. \u201cYou were supposed to get married?\u201d</p><p>Simon shrugged. \u201cIt was more of a suggestion. A strong suggestion. You\u2019ve seen Dorien when he wants something. If Lyra wasn\u2019t just as stubborn as he is, I\u2019d be wearing a ring by now, barely knowing what hit me.\u201d</p><p>Jaden sat watching Simon\u2019s hangdog expression, and he wondered just how unhappy the wolf would have been about that. Something curdled and unpleasant settled into the pit of his stomach. He tried to remind himself that wolves\u2019 ways were much different from vampires\u2019, that Lyra was likely to end up with some wolf or other eventually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since he now knew he was sitting across from one of the prime candidates, that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure how you win over a woman like Lyra,\u201d Jaden said. His guard was up immediately. If this was about fishing for information on the direction of Lyra\u2019s affections, he wanted no part of it. Simon\u2019s laughter did little to ease his tension.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. But even if I knew, trust me, it would never have worked anyway. Lyra and I... it\u2019s just never been like that. I mean, I thought about it back when we were teenagers. I\u2019m not blind, and I\u2019m not stupid. But it wouldn\u2019t have worked out. We\u2019re good as friends. More than that, not so much.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden managed to relax a little at that, though the words sounded so rehearsed that he wondered how many times Simon had repeated them to himself, trying to become convinced they were true. Of Lyra\u2019s disinterest Jaden had no doubt. But Simon struck him as a little too protective, and a little too interested, for a guy who wanted to be a platonic friend. Still, Jaden didn\u2019t plan to argue Simon out of his stated position. It worked just fine for him.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ve stayed friends,\u201d Jaden said. He had no idea how Simon had managed all these years. He would never have been able to spend so much time with Lyra without touching her. He hadn\u2019t even two nights here without his hands on her. More would probably have driven him permanently insane.</p><p>Simon considered while he ate another fry. \u201cI would have married her, though, don\u2019t get me wrong. Dorien\u2019s my Alpha, so going against him is usually a bad idea. And Lyra and I go way back. Friendship isn\u2019t such a bad place to start, you know? But we wouldn\u2019t have made each other happy in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Jaden asked, genuinely curious. On the surface, if he put his own feelings aside, Simon would seem to be a good fit.</p><p>\u201cShe wants all of this,\u201d Simon said, gesturing around him with a small half smile. \u201cLyra was born to lead the Thorn. She loves it. She loves the people, the place, everything about being a werewolf except for some of the, uh, gender-specific issues.\u201d He eyed Jaden. \u201cShe might have mentioned those. Or not.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI heard about that. Elsewhere.\u201d Simon looked relieved to not have to go into them.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, she wants it, and maybe she\u2019d change a few things here and there, but she loves it for what it is\u2014a scrubby wolf pack in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it here?\u201d Jaden asked. It seemed a rather harsh assessment. Most of the wolves seemed perfectly content in their little forest oasis. They came and went during the day, working here or in other surrounding towns, then returning to be among their own. There was a rhythm and a flow to life here that Jaden found comforting after so many years of upheaval. But he knew very well that some would find it stifling... especially a young wolf like this who had never been out in the world.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Simon said, running a hand through his hair. \u201cYes... and no. When you\u2019re born into this, you don\u2019t get a lot of choices, you know? Most of us just grew up here. We\u2019re expected to stay here. And it\u2019s great if you want it! But it\u2019s always the same. Nothing ever changes. And I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaden found himself offering a sympathetic smile. \u201cBelieve it or not, I know exactly how you feel.\u201d Simon had unwittingly just described Jaden\u2019s mortal life. He could look back on those emotions now and see them as what they were: the natural growing pains of a young man who wanted to make his own way in a place where he was expected to do things the way they had always been done.</p><p>Jaden certainly had managed to escape all that in a big way. Though even in that, he\u2019d never really had a choice. He\u2019d just been jerked from one predetermined path to another with no warning. And there had been no going back.</p> <p>Simon smiled, tipped his beer in Jaden\u2019s direction. \u201cThought you might. You\u2019ve got that long-wandering look about you. How\u2019d it turn out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, wandering?\u201d Jaden asked. Simon nodded, and Jaden searched for an appropriate answer. It wasn\u2019t a question he got much. Or ever.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d have to let you know when I\u2019m done wandering,\u201d he finally said, and Simon chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I\u2019d like to know, though.\u201d His face fell a little. \u201cThe only wandering I\u2019ll be doing is vicarious. I\u2019m on my way up in the pack guard. Maybe if I get a scar or two I\u2019ll find a woman. Could be worse.\u201d</p><p>It surprised Jaden to see his mortal self reflected so strongly back at him tonight from a werewolf. He understood, more than he could express. And that understanding made him want to help if he could. He was tired of wandering, himself. But most people didn\u2019t have an eternity in which to do it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can come out to Massachusetts once I go. I can convene a vampire forum on how to bag hot women, just for you.\u201d</p><p>Simon grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea. If you\u2019re serious, I\u2019ll see. We don\u2019t usually get too far outside the territory, but Dorien seems to like you, so... we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He looked intrigued by the possibility, at least, and that was something. Jaden found it nice to be in a position to offer help to someone else for a change. With that done, though, he wanted to get on with this. Simon wanted something. And even though he doubted she would appreciate it, he wanted to get back and check on Lyra. The look of her this evening nagged at him, worried him.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. What\u2019s this really about, Simon?\u201d</p><p>He saw the truth, which Simon had managed to dance around for an hour now, in the way the wolf dropped his eyes. Jaden\u2019s instincts had been right: this was not purely a social exercise.</p><p>\u201cUm. Good food and beer? New friendships?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again. I appreciate the effort, but I have things to do. Thanks, though,\u201d Jaden added, and meant it. \u201cI know the only reason I\u2019m not in pieces by now is because of Dorien, but you\u2019ve been convincingly friendly. My usual reception isn\u2019t half as pleasant.\u201d</p><p>Simon glanced over at a table of six wolves who had been busy glaring at Jaden ever since they\u2019d come in. He looked unimpressed and turned back to Jaden.</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re doing pretty well for our first vamp in, well, ever. You\u2019ve won over a few. Honor counts for a lot around here, and last night showed you have some. Word spreads quickly. Those guys over there are buddies of Eric\u2019s, though, so you can forget that. They hate anyone Lyra likes, and she seems to like you. Which I guess brings me to my point... because believe it or not, I\u2019ve enjoyed this too. You\u2019re a lot more likable than I\u2019d figured on.\u201d</p><p>Jaden smiled faintly. \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m not going to like what\u2019s coming next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it. You just need to listen to it,\u201d Simon said, his own expression suddenly deadly serious and his voice dropping low enough that anyone else in the bar would have a hard time hearing.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d No, he was most definitely not going to like this, Jaden thought. And he wasn\u2019t disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you this for Lyra because she won\u2019t listen to me and you seem like a cautious sort of guy. That\u2019s good, because you need to be careful, Jaden.\u201d</p><p>His back was up immediately. \u201cIn what sense am I not being careful, Simon?\u201d</p><p>Simon looked mildly exasperated. \u201cThis isn\u2019t to get in Lyra\u2019s good graces, Jaden. She and I are... it\u2019s just not happening. I meant what I said. But there\u2019s been some talk. Just gossip, mostly. People around here don\u2019t have anything better to do. But some of it has some basis. I mean, what exactly were you two up to last night, out so far by yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were... walking,\u201d Jaden said lamely. Simon just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, I think you know how believable that is. And the night I chased the vamp out to Grant Park? You and Lyra alone, once again. I know you were wounded and all, but at first, it looked like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jaden said quickly. This was rapidly turning into an interrogation, and he didn\u2019t want to answer these questions. Especially not from Lyra\u2019s best friend. Apart from the danger involved, it was also the very definition of \u201cawkward.\u201d</p><p>Simon looked skeptical, but he let it go. \u201cWell, whatever it actually is, I can tell you how it looks, and it isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to fly around here. So I\u2019m telling you, if you give a damn at all what happens to her, you should cool it with the alone time and the long moonlit walks, okay? Eric\u2019s got people watching you two. If he keeps looking, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll find enough to take Lyra down without ever laying a finger on her.\u201d</p><p>Watched. That knocked the wind out of him for a second. He should have figured. But he\u2019d been too wrapped up in Lyra, too focused on the outside threat of the Ptolemy searching for him to consider that Eric might be seeking to use Lyra\u2019s association with him to his advantage. Of course Eric would use it if he got a chance.</p><p>Just how he would use it, of course, was something he hadn\u2019t been quite clear on.</p><p>\u201cSo... if he did find something, some supposed evidence that Lyra and I had been, ah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooking up?\u201d Simon was half jesting, but there was something in his expression that warned Jaden away from saying anything more specific that might confirm the truth.</p><p>Simon steepled his hands beneath his chin and blew out a breath, seeming to search for the right words.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand something, Jaden. Lyra wants Alpha. Maybe her getting it is a long shot, but she\u2019s tough. It\u2019s a real shot. More, it\u2019s what she has always wanted, ever since she was a little kid beating up the boys at the park. If it comes out that you two are more than friends, it kills all of that for her, even just having a chance to lead. Life as she knows it would be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be a little more specific?\u201d Jaden asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cPermanent exile. The pack would formally disown her. Everything and everyone she\u2019s known would be taken from her, and if she ever showed her face on our territory again, she would be killed. No other pack would have her either. She would be what we call a ghost wolf. A shadow of what she was... and could have been.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The truth of what Lyra had risked by giving herself to him finally hit Jaden in full. And it landed like a ton of bricks.</p><p>No wonder she\u2019d disappeared on him tonight. No matter how much she\u2019d wanted him, acting on it had probably made her think a lot about the Pandora\u2019s box she\u2019d opened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little harsh?\u201d he managed.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think,\u201d Simon replied. \u201cVampires were our enemies for centuries. Things have been quiet for a long time, and what with you coming here, it makes me think that our interactions with vampires could be on their way to changing too. But allowing our kind to mate with yours? There could be no children, I don\u2019t think, and even if there could, what do you even do with half-breed monsters like that? Whole bloodlines could end that way. And there would always be the worries about vamps just taking over outright. The rules are going to stand, Jaden, now and for a long time, I think.\u201d</p><p>He paused, took a drink, and looked pointedly right into Jaden\u2019s eyes. It surprised him\u2014the wolf saw a great deal more than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cSorry to be the bearer of bad news. But I see the way you look at her. I\u2019m not the only one. And you needed to know.\u201d</p><p>Jaden exhaled. He must have been holding out a little hope after all because this was definitely what it felt like to have that sort of hope kicked out of you.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone wants more? What if she wanted more than the rules allowed for?\u201d</p> <p>Simon simply raised one brow and shook his head. \u201cLyra understands how it works, believe me. Nobody gets everything they want. Not here or anywhere else. That can\u2019t be news to you.\u201d</p><p>No, it sure as hell isn\u2019t. Jaden passed over his beer bottle for the glass of water that sat beside it, enjoying the cool sensation as it ran down his throat. He was dimly aware of the fact that he was parched, thirsty for something more substantial. Something dark and rich, and forbidden in this place.</p><p>The entire room suddenly felt far too small, the scent of wolves going from tolerable to oppressive in an instant. If he\u2019d been under any illusions that Lyra would ever entertain being more than just a temporary lover, they had since vanished like so much smoke.</p><p>Yet when she sauntered into the bar, looking larger than life and impossibly gorgeous, every sense honed in on her until she was the only thing in his universe. When her eyes connected with his, it was as though someone had shot several thousand volts of electricity through his system. His mouth watered. His fangs lengthened and sharpened, a natural response to his most basic instincts where she was concerned.</p><p>No caution. Only need.</p><p>Simon\u2019s words only barely penetrated his Lyra-induced haze. \u201cAlone together too often... need to listen to me before you do something stupid...\u201d</p> <p>Jaden would have warned him, if he\u2019d been able to speak. As it was, she\u2019d nearly reached the table by the time Simon realized they had company. To her credit, the only indication she gave that she\u2019d heard anything was the single, reproachful look she gave Simon before turning all her attention on Jaden.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see the way Simon flushed and looked away, but Jaden did. The poor sod\u2019s in love with her and he doesn\u2019t even know it. Jaden couldn\u2019t conjure up much sympathy though. At least Simon had a shot. He was, after all, the correct species. But Jaden\u2019s problems loomed larger at the moment.</p><p>Like how to throttle back on his feelings for Lyra, which seemed to have taken root in deep, fertile, and delusional soil.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. She still looked too pale, with dark circles shaded under her eyes that shouldn\u2019t have been there... that he very much wished he hadn\u2019t put there. But she also looked like she had pulled herself together, which was something Jaden was beginning to find he could count on with Lyra. Even when she was down, she wasn\u2019t out. Not for long.</p><p>It was a strength he could appreciate.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he replied, wondering what had brought her after him.</p><p>\u201cMy father wants you back at the house. Something about your Jedi mind trick. I told him he can\u2019t learn to do it, but...\u201d She trailed off, shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s the boss, and I guess he wants entertaining. Can you come?\u201d</p><p>Jaden realized this was the first time she\u2019d asked him something instead of issuing a direct order. Whether or not the motives were sincere, he liked it.</p> <p>\u201cSure, I think we\u2019re about done here.\u201d And he was glad, after watching Simon go all lovesick... not that he was entirely unfamiliar with the sensation where Lyra was concerned. Still, it was as he\u2019d figured. \u201cWe\u2019re better as friends\u201d sounded all great and selfless, but wasn\u2019t holding up when faced with the woman herself.</p><p>Too bad for you, Simon. At least for now, the woman is taken.</p><p>The thought, hot and possessive, came out of nowhere. And ill-advised or not, Jaden knew it was true enough.</p><p>He stood and let his eyes roam the length of her, from the tall boots and tight jeans to the long fitted T-shirt that made him want to build a shrine to whoever had first thought of adding Lycra to cotton. Her hair was partially tamed, pulled back in a ponytail and yet still managing to explode in wild curls.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d Jaden said, before inclining his head toward Simon. \u201cThanks for the drink, Simon. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Hey, Lyra. I got optimistic and bought us concert tickets for after the Proving. Hard Reign. You in?\u201d</p><p>He seemed ridiculously hopeful, but Lyra seemed to tighten up, her shoulders going rigid. Jaden had never seen her deal with another wolf as a superior dealing with an inferior, but it was fascinating. And gratifying, on some level. He wasn\u2019t exactly a paragon of manners, but he understood when he was being deliberately excluded. Simon was trying to add a lesson onto his lecture: I\u2019ll be here, and with her, long after you\u2019re gone.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t like Simon much after all. And Lyra, at least right now, seemed to share the sentiment.</p><p>She stared down her nose, looking Simon dead in the eye. Jaden was surprised to see the flash of warning in Simon\u2019s eyes, surprised it took him so long to stand down. But in the end, he did, slowly dropping his head so that the back of his neck was bared to Lyra. It was a reluctant sign of submission.</p><p>\u201cYou think that fixes this?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you even understand why I\u2019m upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand plenty,\u201d Simon said, lifting his eyes to hers. \u201cMore than you these days, seems like.\u201d He stood, pulling his jacket from the back of the chair. He nodded at Jaden.</p><p>\u201cGood seeing you. Remember what I said. And for Fenrir\u2019s sake, watch it.\u201d</p><p>Simon left, Lyra watching him head out the door with barely another look at her. Her face fell into much sadder lines once he was gone. She was the only one Jaden currently felt sorry for.</p><p>Deliver me from lovesick werewolves, unless they happen to be pining over me. Jaden followed Lyra outside.</p><p>The night was fragrant with the green scent of spring. Frogs sang somewhere nearby, making the silence between them marginally less oppressive. After they\u2019d gone a few steps, with Simon nowhere to be seen, she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind about tonight,\u201d she said, her chin up but not quite able to hold his gaze. \u201cI want to train, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cI just had a crash course in a particular section of The Rules According to Werewolves.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look the least bit surprised, merely resigned.</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d she said, glaring into the night. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into him, but I knew he was up to something tonight when I heard he\u2019d invited you out. I\u2019m sorry. He means well, but it doesn\u2019t always translate.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNot even to me. But maybe it\u2019s best. More believable when it\u2019s not me stammering about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret it, then,\u201d he said quietly. Her lack of response, the way her cheeks colored, was answer enough, though her eventual answer was a little less definite.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to that is more complicated than you\u2019d ever understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d Jaden offered, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI just want to get back to what we\u2019re supposed to be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened, all of this... it\u2019s too much. I thought I could handle the whole \u2018in the moment\u2019 thing you talked about, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not built that way.\u201d</p><p>He could accept that. He could respect that. Even if he didn\u2019t like it a damn bit.</p><p>\u201cThen just promise me something, all right? I felt like we were at least getting to be friends, before... well, before. If nothing else, I\u2019d like to pick up where we left off with that.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smiled, but it looked sad and wistful in the darkness. \u201cI\u2019d like that too,\u201d she replied. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>They shook on it, but even now, Jaden felt the hot snap of connection as soon as their skin touched. He didn\u2019t fully understand it, but nothing would ever make him stop wanting to explore it. And though she managed to shutter her expression quickly, he saw from the way her eyes went to burning embers that Lyra felt it too.</p><p>Even if she wanted\u2014even if she needed\u2014to deny it existed.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>JADEN DIDN\u2019T HAVE much to offer as a token of goodwill. He wanted Lyra to be comfortable with him again, and he wanted to try to get back on some kind of even footing, to repair whatever had been broken. He\u2019d spent a full week now trying every rusty tool in his limited arsenal to fix things between them, from charm to humor to a simple willingness to let Lyra set the parameters of their faltering relationship.</p><p>In the end, he only had his fallback position, which was better than nothing.</p><p>He cooked.</p><p>Fragrant steam rose from the soup he\u2019d thrown together. He stirred the pot, tossed in a pinch of salt or another herb, and then stirred some more. A cutting board on the counter sat covered in the remains of carrots, potatoes, celery, garlic, and a few onions. At his elbow rested a glass of B positive he had pilfered from the county hospital last night. The rest of the bag was staying cool and, he hoped, inconspicuous behind Dorien\u2019s beer in the garage fridge. Jaden took a sip of the blood, put down the glass, and then sipped from the ladle he dipped into the kettle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The end product might not be as satisfying as the B positive, and he might not technically need solid food anymore, but Jaden knew he would never stop enjoying all the flavors he\u2019d grown up with. His mother had often made something similar when he was a child. He hoped it set Lyra, and himself, at ease.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m going to run out and grab some burgers. Do you need\u2014oh. Oh. You cook?\u201d</p><p>Lyra.</p> <p>He felt her presence in the room as though someone had flipped a light switch on inside him. Jaden paused in stirring the soup, an odd tingling sensation suffusing him from head to toe. It wasn\u2019t the return to even footing he\u2019d hoped for, but he seemed to need this feeling like he needed the air he breathed.</p><p>She stood just inside the archway leading into the kitchen, looking around at the scattered remnants of his soup-making extravaganza. He drank in the sight of her as though it had been years, not hours, since he last saw her. She looked as beautiful as she always did, but with a return of the caution he\u2019d seen in her when they first met.</p><p>Patience, he reminded himself. He didn\u2019t know why it was so important to him that she relax around him, but it was.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stand there,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in and sit. The soup will be ready in a minute. I\u2019d rather it had simmered all day, but this is as good as it gets for spur of the moment.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to startle a little, like she\u2019d forgotten she wasn\u2019t alone. Then her eyes met his, and he felt that bright burst of connection. A silent song that insisted this she-wolf, and no other woman, was for him. He didn\u2019t see how it could be, but there it was.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know vampires cooked,\u201d she said. She seemed a little dazed as she watched him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man of many talents,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I mean, you actually cooked,\u201d Lyra said, moving into the room. She bypassed the table, however, and came to stand beside him, peering into the pot. Then she looked up at him, her expression one of wonderment. He suddenly felt incredibly self-conscious. Maybe it had been the wrong thing... it had been a long time since he\u2019d had to think about such things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just soup,\u201d he said.</p><p>Instead of answering him, she leaned over and inhaled deeply, closing her eyes with an expression of bliss that tugged at him.</p><p>\u201cNobody cooks for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis house is like the land of processed food products. Dad and I have been eating out of boxes and cans for years, except for maybe burgers. And eggs.\u201d She paused, then smiled. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the sweetest thing. Just\u2014thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Her grin was so genuine, and so infectious, he found himself returning it. Before he could think better of it, he reached up and moved a stray curl out of her face, running his thumb over her cheek. She was very still, closing her eyes for just a moment in what he hoped was pleasure. At least she didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>Whatever gulf had opened between them, he badly wanted to bridge the gap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He had to force himself to stop there, to stop from gathering her in his arms. Knowing she would back away from his advances was hell, even when he could feel that she was as drawn to him as he was to her. Understanding the rejection didn\u2019t make it feel any better. And as he\u2019d expected, she opened her eyes, blinked as though trying to wake herself up, and moved back out of reach. Deliberately, he turned and ladled some of the soup into a bowl for her, found her a spoon. She accepted both, took them over to the table, and began to eat while Jaden went back to the stove to clean up. He worked quickly, efficiently, and gave her the time to decide where and whether to begin.</p><p>Finally, she spoke.</p><p>\u201cThis is fantastic soup,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. I had no idea vampires bothered to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one does, at least. I enjoy it,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cI always have. I don\u2019t get a lot of dinner guests, I guess, but it helps me clear my mind. I\u2019m glad you like it. My mum used to do something like it. Speaking of, where\u2019s the amazing Dorien Black? I haven\u2019t seen him since I got up.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and looked at him intently for a moment, her spoon perched in midair halfway to her mouth. He wondered what had caused her sudden pause.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s poker night. I will guarantee he\u2019ll inhale the leftovers, though,\u201d she said, not sounding particularly unhappy that he wasn\u2019t there. Good. Neither was he.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never mentioned your parents before. I almost forgot you had them,\u201d Lyra said, and then he understood what had caught her interest.</p><p>Jaden lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t hatch out of an egg. Of course I had parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they like?\u201d</p><p>Jaden hesitated. It wasn\u2019t something he talked about. His past was his own... and really, most of his acquaintances didn\u2019t give a damn anyway. Having something important to him disregarded and mocked, as had often happened in his days as a fledgling, tended to make a man keep things close to the vest. But if it kept her here, looking at him like this, then he would try. For her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you\u2019re that interested. I grew up on a farm,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Somerset. We were respectable, though not enormously wealthy. The land was ours, and Father made sure his sons learned to work it, along with the rest of our education. Father was an eminently sensible man. Used to drive me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrison,\u201d Lyra said, a smile touching her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s your last name. I wondered.\u201d</p><p>Jaden executed a small bow. \u201cAnd my first. You\u2019re speaking to James Dennis Harrison III, English farmer turned creature of the night. Biter of necks, herder of cattle, cooker of soups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention trainer of werewolves,\u201d Lyra added.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Not only am I talented, my titles are many and varied,\u201d Jaden said, turning to wipe down the counter. He\u2019d been wrong. Lyra made it easy to talk about... natural. And he couldn\u2019t help but be flattered that she was interested. A vampire wouldn\u2019t have been. For most of his own kind, family and mortal life was very, very old news, and unworthy of conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou leave one life behind and take on another. It seemed appropriate to leave the name as well. Especially since, for a long time, my father wasn\u2019t very pleased to be sharing it with me.\u201d He tossed the towel on the counter, then went about throwing the vegetable scraps into the garbage as he worked... and remembered.</p><p>Love could surmount many things, but becoming a creature of the night was a hard one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He was upset, then, when you turned,\u201d Lyra said. She sounded hesitant, but he didn\u2019t want her to be. That old wound had long since healed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, turning to look at her. \u201cHe came around, eventually. It was hard for him on quite a few levels. I was the oldest son, after all. I was supposed to follow in his footsteps. Sort of threw a wrench in things, my becoming an immortal bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>Her ensuing smile, always a little bit wicked, was something he didn\u2019t want to lose for the time he had left with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d Lyra asked, her interest apparently piqued. \u201cWas she okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted, \u201cnot really. But she never stopped pestering me to come home.\u201d He smiled at the memory. \u201cAlways talked about fixing up a room in the cellar and keeping a few extra cows on hand so I could be, as she put it, a respectable vampire. She didn\u2019t like the idea of me biting people. It offended her sensibilities. I think she decided she\u2019d raised me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved them,\u201d Lyra said, stirring her soup while she listened to him. He was surprised that she sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. Very much. Not all of us had bad beginnings, you know. I just picked the wrong night to visit the tavern. A pretty barmaid wants to get friendly in the stables, you think you\u2019ve hit the jackpot, and then, poof, life as you know it is over and you\u2019ve got to find a new way. Before that, it was all very... normal. I would have had a good life. Inherited the farm, married some lovely country lass, had nine or ten children. Not so bad.\u201d</p><p>And that, Jaden realized as the words left his mouth, was the wound that remained, even after two hundred years. He had wanted all that. He still wanted all that. And there wasn\u2019t a damned thing on earth that could give it to him. For all the darkness and danger in his past, not to mention his present, he had very simple desires. Sadly, his life hadn\u2019t been simple in a very long time.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds nice, actually. I think normal\u2019s probably good, if you can get it.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cNot that I would know much about it. I was born a werewolf. Not exactly a normal beginning. It was happy for a while, though,\u201d she said. \u201cThen my mom died. Not quite as happy, but we managed.\u201d</p><p>Jaden nodded. \u201cHunters, you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went out for a run one night and never came home. They found her body the next day. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous going out by yourself. But she did her own thing. The people who knew her still laugh about how stubborn she was.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cImagine that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, shocking, right? Obviously I was adopted.\u201d Lyra smiled, seeming to enjoy the comparison.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I was pretty young. Three. So I don\u2019t remember much about it. Afterward it was just my father, and he was always there. Even when I didn\u2019t want him to be, so I guess he was doing his job.\u201d She shrugged, her smile fading. \u201cSometimes I wished he would remarry. I would have liked it, I think, if she\u2019d been the right kind of person. But he never got over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided you didn\u2019t much want a mate to worry over,\u201d he guessed, and saw immediately that he\u2019d hit the mark. She flushed lightly, then began poking at her soup, stabbing so hard he wondered if she would crack the bowl.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that. Exactly. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I definitely can\u2019t take one before we settle on a Second. And then after, well... I\u2019ll be busy, hopefully. I won\u2019t have time for any of that. Anyway, I can take care of myself better than anyone else could.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou might be able to, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should have to,\u201d Jaden pointed out. \u201cYou might like having someone around to care for you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took another bite of soup and propped her head on her fist, watching him. \u201cIs that how the vamps do it?\u201d she asked. \u201cHook up and then stay eternally mushy over each other? Because I know enough wolf couples who can barely stand one another, not that it...\u201d She trailed off, her thoughts seeming to vanish into the ether for a moment before she came back.</p><p>\u201cNot that it matters with the bond,\u201d she finished quietly.</p> <p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cActually, a lot of vampires don\u2019t bother. Eternity is a very long time to spend with one person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lyra said, and he wished he could take the answer back, truthful though it was.</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t have to worry about that. I get one lifetime, that\u2019s it.\u201d Her smile was weak, though, and he wondered if they were having similar thoughts.</p><p>Yes, she did have only one lifetime. And he would be walking the world, looking and feeling much the same, when Lyra Black was nothing but dust. Even without all the other roadblocks they\u2019d had put up between them, that one would be tough to surmount. Tough, but not impossible.</p><p>But it was a moot point, and Lyra knew it. Even if she should change her mind someday, Jaden knew he wouldn\u2019t make the short list. Or any kind of list.</p> <p>She stood, picked up her now empty bowl, and took it to the sink to rinse it out, near enough for him to touch. She couldn\u2019t quite lift her eyes to his when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some stuff to do. I\u2019ll catch you back here in a couple of hours? The night is young and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said, trying to sound as casual as he could, though he knew he would think of nothing else until she returned.</p><p>\u201cAnd thanks again for the soup. Really,\u201d she said, this time looking right at him. \u201cIt hit the spot. And besides that, it was... sweet.\u201d</p><p>That last word made him laugh, though not at her. \u201cNot an adjective usually applied to me, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile, slightly puzzled, touched her lips at his words. \u201cYou should. Have it applied to you, I mean. I know it\u2019s none of my business, but whoever hurt you, those other vampires I guess, must be the most worthless bunch of bloodsuckers going. They\u2019re probably ones we used to war with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think your pack has warred with just about everyone,\u201d Jaden said, unexpectedly touched. \u201cBut thank you. And as to the other,\u201d he lifted one shoulder, nonchalant, \u201cthey\u2019ll get theirs eventually, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if and when it does, I would love to get in on that action.\u201d Lyra said. She started to walk away, paused, and then turned to look at him. \u201cSo... we\u2019re good, right?\u201d she asked, and he couldn\u2019t ignore what she meant. She wanted to know if he was ready to forget what had happened and move ahead.</p><p>Since the answer \u201cNo, but I\u2019m going to try, eventually,\u201d wouldn\u2019t be acceptable, he told her what she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d Jaden agreed. But as she graced him with one last smile and headed out the door, he couldn\u2019t help imagining what it might be like to share a life with her, short though hers would seem in comparison to his own. She was a warrior of a she-wolf, brazen and bold, but unexpectedly na\u00efve and charming at times. He would love to show her the world she had tasted so little of, to show her there was more than just duty to the pack.</p><p>Pipe dreams, Jaden thought as he tossed the ladle into the sink, where it landed with an irritated little clank.</p><p>Just then the phone started to ring. At first he ignored it, assuming whoever it was would leave a message for Dorien. Instead, when the answering machine picked up, he heard a voice no one in this town would recognize but him.</p><p>\u201cJaden, I know you\u2019re in there. Pick up. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>With a final, resentful look at the pot of dinner that had accomplished everything he\u2019d hoped and nothing he\u2019d wanted all at the same time, Jaden lifted the phone to his ear.</p> <p>He was certain some fresh hell awaited him. Just what sort was all that remained to be seen.</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>LILTING HARP MUSIC drifted through the dimly lit little store on the square called Moon Magic. Crystals hung from the ceiling, their facets glinting as they turned lazily on long bits of clear floss. A woman sat behind a long glass counter, her nose firmly planted in a battered paperback. He caught a glimpse of a blond ponytail and a pair of cat\u2019s eye glasses when she gave him a half wave that indicated she had no interest in bothering him if he didn\u2019t bother her.</p><p>Suited him just fine, considering who he was meeting.</p><p>Jaden wandered to the baskets of tumbled stones and plucked up a large chunk of tiger\u2019s eye, rubbing it in his fingers while he looked around, wondering what sort of trouble Damien Tremaine was so intent on bringing him.</p><p>A small stand of necklaces caught his eye, the polished stones in the pendants gleaming in the soft light. He walked to them, wondering whether Lyra might like one of them, and whether she would accept it or wrap it around his neck. No doubt she would think such a gift would violate the terms of their latest truce. Not that it stopped him from considering the purchase anyway.</p><p>Lost in thought, Jaden barely registered the sound of the small silver bell above the door announcing another customer. Only the voice, speaking almost directly in his ear, brought him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think any of those are your style.\u201d</p><p>Jaden looked up with a jerk and found himself confronted with a familiar, and generally unwelcome, countenance.</p><p>\u201cDamien,\u201d he said. \u201cThere you are.\u201d He looked around, saw that it was just the two of them in the store apart from the still disinterested clerk. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself killed just wandering around here like this, you know. They\u2019re going to smell you!\u201d</p><p>Damien smirked, and Jaden wondered whether there was much more to him than the aristocratic brat he projected. Generally, he thought not, but he put up with the mouthy Shade because Ty seemed to like him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Cait Sith standing beside another Cait Sith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilim, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Damien rolled his eyes. \u201cWe both have that cat smell thing going on, and you seem to have inoculated the general populace somehow. Nobody\u2019s going to bother us for the amount of time I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, why are you here?\u201d Jaden asked, eyes narrowing. \u201cYou usually bring trouble with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I participate in trouble, I don\u2019t bring it. Usually,\u201d Damien replied. \u201cThis is a special case, though. I am announcing the approach of trouble so that you can get out of here before it shows up to skin you.\u201d He glanced around critically. \u201cOf all the things you could have gotten yourself tangled up in, Jaden, I don\u2019t know why you picked this one. When Ty told me you were here I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Wish I\u2019d known, or I could have gotten you out sooner. I was here not long ago.\u201d</p><p>That, more than anything else he\u2019d said, piqued Jaden\u2019s interest.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShade business. And at this point, it\u2019s irrelevant. You need to skip town.\u201d Damien lowered his voice further and leaned in. \u201cThe borders of the territory are crawling with Ptolemy. Getting back in was no picnic, but I can get you out. Whatever you think you\u2019re doing here, this place is a lost cause. When the Proving happens, the Thorn is going to fall, and hard.\u201d</p><p>Jaden could only stare blankly at Damien for a moment. \u201cPtolemy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Damien\u2019s lips thinned with irritation. \u201cYes, genius, Ptolemy! Here! All the way around the territory! Do you want me to draw you a picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jaden murmured, trying to wrap his head around what this meant. \u201cBut... I was attacked by a single vamp one of the first nights I was here. Moved like a Ptolemy, though I wasn\u2019t sure if it was one of yours, some lowblood with an ankh in his mark, you know?\u201d</p><p>Damien looked irritated. \u201cYou really think we\u2019re still taking contracts on you, Jaden? That\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>Jaden regarded him coolly. \u201cTell me you wouldn\u2019t do it for the right price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Damien said flatly. \u201cThough you\u2019re making me want to reconsider that decision. What else? I can see there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple nights ago. Four Ptolemy. Lyra and I managed to take them out. I assumed at that point that I\u2019d been followed from Tipton. But they didn\u2019t make it back, so...\u201d</p><p>Damien gave a small but perfectly audible groan. \u201cOverly simplistic, Jaden. You\u2019d think your luck thus far would have taught you that. This isn\u2019t about you, per se, though the queen following you here with an army is almost believable. From what I hear, Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s rants about you, Ty, and the Lilim in general are rather gloriously unhinged. You might have wanted to play it a bit more low key with that patrol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to do when you\u2019ve got four vampires determined to either get you in a restraint collar or take your head off altogether.\u201d</p><p>One corner of Damien\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, we should go someplace else to talk about this,\u201d Jaden said, realizing all at once how exposed they were for such a conversation. If the clerk was listening to this...</p><p>Damien waved the comment away and jerked his head toward the blonde, who was now bobbing her head in time to silent music. Only then did Jaden notice the earbuds.</p><p>\u201cThe teenaged wannabe Wiccan isn\u2019t interested, trust me. Look, Jaden, I don\u2019t know what more to say about it, apart from \u2018take off while you can.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jaden thought of Lyra, and of the wolves who had come so far in accepting him among them. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on. And I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d</p><p>Damien lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOh? You think I\u2019d take a contract on you, but you\u2019re going to believe me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of other options right now,\u201d Jaden replied, and saw Damien\u2019s blue eyes flash.</p><p>\u201cFlattering. But honest. All right. Think about it, Jaden. Think back on the lazy, scheming Ptolemy as they were when you served them, most wanting to be waited on hand and foot all the time because damn it, they deserved it. Now imagine all the servants\u2019 chambers, the cages, the dungeons, empty, with nothing but sad piles of empty collars to remind the highblood pricks of how marvelous they once had it. What good is being one of the glorious Ptolemy if you don\u2019t have anyone to kick around? They\u2019re still persona non grata with the Council, and the other dynasties are steering very clear at the moment. Won\u2019t last forever, but it could be a few centuries before people get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s humiliated. We knew that. It\u2019s why she\u2019d been picking off some of the Cait Sith who come into Tipton to join the Lilim. I assumed she was trying to rebuild a little of what she\u2019d lost in the slave labor department.\u201d</p> <p>Damien shook his head. \u201cNo. Arsin\u00f6e is never going to get all of you back, and she knows it, her little revenge hunts aside. She\u2019s killing most of the cats she catches anyway.\u201d He paused, winced. \u201cIn some creative ways, too, from what I understand. I think it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s looking for new blood. And with the rest of our kind, lowblood and highblood alike, casting a wary eye on them, what is a despot in need for cheap muscle to do?\u201d</p><p>Jaden watched Damien for some sign that he was joking, or going somewhere other than the obvious with this, but he could see none. \u201cWolves? They\u2019re seriously going to start on the wolves?\u201d</p><p>Damien shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure she would have thought of it herself. She hates wolves as much as anyone, at least in theory. Who sees them anymore? But that\u2019s the problem. The packs have been flying under the radar for a long time, Jaden. They\u2019ve rebuilt since we used to fight them so long ago. Look around. They\u2019re more disciplined, stronger. Brighter, shockingly. A force to be reckoned with, too, if they pulled together a bit more. If you think about it, it was only a matter of time before a wolf with a little power and a big inferiority complex headed in our direction.\u201d</p><p>Jaden made a disgusted noise. \u201cOur? This is why you were here a couple of weeks ago. What, is one of the Thorn working for you?\u201d</p><p>Bloody Shades, he thought. They seemed to have their fingers everywhere, and they never caused anything but problems. Damien, as usual, looked unperturbed.</p> <p>\u201cOne came to us. Drake was intrigued, naturally. Can\u2019t beat a wolf for raw muscle. But the apprenticeship didn\u2019t work out. I tried to warn him that any wolf who would come to us probably liked killing a little too much. We require finesse, you know. Anyway, didn\u2019t last. But he did a job that brought him some attention from the Ptolemy, and it got someone thinking. Unfortunately. And the packs are so loosely knit, not to mention none of them like one another all that much, that it isn\u2019t like anyone will rush to the Thorn\u2019s defense when they vanish and the Ptolemy suddenly have a bunch of pet wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll just swoop in and, what, round them up?\u201d Jaden asked, feeling slightly ill at the thought. All he had been through with the Ptolemy for so many years... no one else should have to experience that.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Damien said. \u201cArsin\u00f6e operates with charm before force, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d prefer a period of buttering them up to inspire loyalty before she really has to crack down on these new... pets. Something is in the works, though. With the number of Ptolemy just beyond the borders of Thorn territory, that\u2019s obvious. Beyond that, the Shades, unfortunately, are in the dark as much as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sold them out?\u201d Jaden asked. But the moment he asked the question, he knew. It had to be Eric Black.</p><p>Damien pinned Jaden with a cool stare. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re very interested in these wolves, Jaden. It\u2019s disturbing. Now do you really need more information to get you to go? This is a death trap. I didn\u2019t think you liked those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Ty about this? The Dracul?\u201d</p> <p>Damien hissed out an irritable little breath through his nose. \u201cYes and yes. Both instructed me to come and get your ass out of here before all hell breaks loose. And by the way, Ty also mentioned that if you ever turned off your phone for two weeks again, he was going to shove it up a certain orifice from which it would be difficult to extract.\u201d His expression quickly went from irritated to confused. \u201cAnd just out of curiosity, what are you still doing here, Jaden? I heard something about a she-wolf and a necklace, but this isn\u2019t exactly a vacation spot...\u201d He trailed off, and Jaden remained silent, but something in his expression must have given him away. Damien wrinkled up his nose as though he\u2019d smelled something foul.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of\u2014you know what? I don\u2019t want to know. Really? I just\u2014really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jaden snapped.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019d rather not discuss it. The thought of the wolf stink alone...\u201d Damien shuddered. \u201cWhoever she is, forget her. You aren\u2019t going to want to be here when the queen arrives to start buttering up the befurred masses. She\u2019ll take her time, I imagine, but it\u2019ll all end the same. And I\u2019m sure your presence will not be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Jaden said flatly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Dorien, the Alpha, what\u2019s going on. This can all be taken care of before anything actually happens.\u201d</p><p>Damien stared at Jaden as though he thought he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to believe some vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he will. He likes me. And I work for him... after a fashion.\u201d Jaden explained the situation as quickly as he could to Damien, whose expressions ranged from disbelief to disgust. When he\u2019d finished, the Shade simply stared at him for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve completely lost it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, because I\u2019m doing something decent for a change?\u201d Jaden asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Damien replied, glowering. \u201cBecause getting involved with wolf politics is madness. Even a worse idea than getting involved in dynasty politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do for a living,\u201d Jaden pointed out, his blood starting to simmer.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m an expert at meddling, and I\u2019m paid very well for the trouble. I wouldn\u2019t touch this mess with a ten-foot pole, though. Does Ty know that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy isn\u2019t my keeper,\u201d Jaden shot back. \u201cNo one is. If you want to run off and tattle, Damien, go right ahead. I\u2019ve got things I need to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cOh? In a hurry to get yourself killed, I guess. If one side doesn\u2019t destroy you, the other one will, Jaden. These wolves are hardly worth your time. They\u2019re all miserable beasts, one\u2019s the same as another... pretty twist of tail or not.\u201d</p><p>Jaden\u2019s hand shot out, fisted in Damien\u2019s shirt, and he had him dangling above the ground in seconds. Damien looked more irritated than intimidated.</p><p>\u201cOh, this helps. You\u2019re welcome for the information. Jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jaden gritted out. \u201cReally. Now stay out of my way.\u201d He let go, turned on one heel, and was out the door before Damien hit the ground. Damien watched him go, an expression that was a mixture of pity and amusement on his handsome face. He looked sharply at the clerk, ascertained that she was still oblivious, and pulled out his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cTy? Damien. Yes, I found him. No... no.\u201d He looked toward the door, where Jaden had just slammed out into the night thinking he was going to save the day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, naturally. And if you want him, you\u2019re going to have to come down here and haul his ass home yourself. I\u2019ve done my good deed for the decade.\u201d He ended the call, then cocked his head at the start of a strange sound outside. Then he closed his eyes with a resigned sigh when he realized the source of the racket.</p><p>The distant but unmistakable sound of a full-blown werewolf fight. And he\u2019d bet money it had something to do with Jaden.</p><p>The poor bastard should never have killed that patrol, Damien thought. Should never have presumed to come here in the first place.</p><p>Whether Jaden liked it or not, the end of the Pack of the Thorn had already begun.</p><p>\u201cI need a bloody vacation,\u201d Damien growled, and vanished out the back of the store and into the night.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY</p><p>JADEN DUCKED out the door of the shop and headed down the street, his body on autopilot, instinctively heading in the right direction while his mind whirled with the information he\u2019d just been given. He needed to get to Dorien, and to Lyra, before Eric and the Ptolemy could do anything. Hopefully nothing was planned until after the Proving, but he could take no chances.</p><p>He strode down the sidewalk, so focused he didn\u2019t notice the men walking straight toward him until it was far too late to do anything but try and absorb the blow.</p><p>A huge, thick male body slammed into him, the force sending Jaden stumbling to the side as he tried to stay on his feet. Not often taken by surprise, it took him precious seconds to figure out what was even going on. By the time he got his bearings, two other wolves had gotten him by the arms.</p><p>One of the first rules of combat with a wolf had always been don\u2019t ever let them get a hold of you. But it was far too late for that now. Grips like iron vices encircled his upper arms. Immediately he began to thrash, hiss, and spit, but it did no good. He was being dragged backward, toward the green at the center of the square. He could hear a deep voice bellowing.</p><p>\u201cWolves! Wolves!\u201d</p><p>Howls began to rise around him. Jaden tried to shift into a cat, but they had him sequestered too well. He dangled helplessly for a moment, his legs caught just as effectively by his captors as his arms had been, before giving up and shifting back. Finally, the men dragging him stopped, and he heard a soft laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was no surprise to look up into the face of Eric Black.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Jaden asked. He could see wolves gathering all around him, running on four legs and then switching to two as they came together to see why the cry had been raised. There was curious murmuring that ran through the crowd, an electric sound. They all knew something big was coming, but no one knew what.</p><p>Least of all Jaden.</p> <p>\u201cEric,\u201d he growled when the man didn\u2019t answer him. This time, the large wolf looked at him, a threatening gleam in his eye.</p><p>Dimly, he heard a voice calling his name.</p><p>\u201cJaden. Jaden? Jaden!\u201d</p><p>The click of boot heels resonated on the concrete, and there was Lyra running toward him. Her eyes were wide, and Jaden realized he\u2019d never really seen her look frightened before. The fact that her fear was on his behalf didn\u2019t give him much confidence in what was unfolding.</p><p>He caught the way Eric looked at her, and alarms sounded in his head.</p> <p>\u201cLyra, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab her,\u201d Eric said. Seeing a couple of Eric\u2019s thugs put their hands on her was worse, somehow, than being caught himself. Lyra was more stoic about the current situation than he had been, likely because she knew these people, but her fury was evident. She held herself as regally as a queen.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me. I demand to know the meaning of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to,\u201d Eric said flatly. \u201cWhere the hell is Dorien. On his way? Good. He\u2019ll hear me.\u201d His voice rose again.</p><p>\u201cWolves of the Thorn,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe gather tonight to decide the fate of one of our daughters!\u201d</p><p>Lyra knew what was happening a split second before Jaden did. He saw the realization dawn, all the color drain from her face. This sudden turn of events could mean only one thing, he realized. And the knowledge was accompanied by a sinking feeling deep in the pit of his stomach.</p> <p>Eric knew. Somehow, he knew that he and Lyra had been together. And he was going to cast her out, just as Simon had warned him. How he\u2019d found proof, Jaden didn\u2019t know. But he must have, somehow. His shoulders sagged.</p><p>These bloody wolves were all far too interested in one another\u2019s business.</p><p>Dorien shouted as he approached, then burst through the front of the large circle that had gathered in the square, surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this? Eric, damn it, this time you\u2019ve gone too far! Get your hands off my daughter, now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lyra who\u2019s finally gone too far. She\u2019s bonded with this filthy bloodsucker, and she still thinks she should lead the pack!\u201d</p><p>The crowd went into an uproar, but all Jaden could see was Lyra. That single word spoke volumes, slammed into him with all it might mean. Her beautiful face, usually so full of light, told the truth. Bonded, he thought. How could he not have known? Suddenly everything, her odd behavior after their lovemaking, her cautious reengagement with him, made sense. But why hadn\u2019t she just told him?</p><p>He supposed he was living the answer to the second question right now. Still, something so important... he wished she had trusted him with it. Bonded. But what exactly did that mean, when he\u2019d seen no marks on his own body... how did she know?</p><p>More important, how did she feel?</p> <p>Her eyes met his for a single instant, and he felt her pain slice through him like the edge of a knife. And he knew\u2014she might feel for him, but this, all of this, was not what she had wanted. How could it be? Yet some part of him had hoped that after all this time, he might actually be someone\u2019s first choice.</p><p>A fool\u2019s wish.</p><p>At first, Dorien was incredulous. He barely glanced at Lyra and Jaden, instead striding up to growl, red faced, at his nephew. His voice was quieter, but Jaden, and he imagined most of the other wolves here, could hear him perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better have some damned good proof to back up what you\u2019re accusing her of, boy. This is my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eric said flatly. \u201cAnd I do, Uncle. Have a look.\u201d His voice raised. \u201cEveryone look at what your would-be Alpha has been doing!\u201d</p><p>Jaden was disgusted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just brand her with a scarlet A, you pig? You say you don\u2019t want to be seen as savages? What the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>Eric rounded on him as he stepped to Lyra. \u201cShut up,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no right to speak here, just like you had no right to touch her. You disrespect my pack, our traditions, our laws, everything with what you\u2019ve done. You think I\u2019m happy to lose my cousin to this? It\u2019s a blight on our line!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jaden growled, \u201cI think you must be dancing with joy on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink what you will,\u201d Eric sneered. \u201cI have no use for vampires. Our kinds don\u2019t mix. And now this.\u201d</p><p>He reached for Lyra. She didn\u2019t struggle but merely stood there, a mixture of defiance and resignation, while Eric extended his claws and tore through the sleeve of her shirt. Gasps rose from the crowd as the fabric fell away and revealed a delicate band, lighter than ink but too dark to be imagined, encircling her arm.</p><p>The mark was like nothing Jaden had seen before, and he strained forward, trying to get a better look at the band. But he was quickly jerked back, and he whipped his head around to glare at his captors.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Dorien\u2019s voice, now strained, drew his attention back to the scene unfolding before him. The Alpha stood in front of his daughter, disappointment etched so deeply into his face that Jaden imagined some of the lines would stay permanently. And Lyra, who he had once thought would spit in the face of anyone who crossed her, could barely meet his eyes.</p><p>She was losing everything. Because of him. Something deep within his chest constricted and began to ache.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t punish her,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cBlame me. She didn\u2019t know. Neither of us knew.\u201d</p><p>A little of the fire flared in her eyes as she lifted her head to look first at him, then at Dorien.</p><p>\u201cI take the blame for my actions. What\u2019s done is done. I have nothing to say in my defense. Just...\u201d She trailed off, her voice softening. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him. Do what you like with me, but don\u2019t hurt him. His intentions were... his heart was... in the right place. He didn\u2019t understand. I did. Blame me.\u201d</p><p>Eric crossed his arms over his chest. To Jaden he looked like some tribal chieftain, and he knew he had not truly appreciated what an ancient and closed society the wolf pack could be until now. This all had the feel of a ritual that had been played out many times before, whenever a wolf ran afoul of the pack. A casting out.</p><p>And from the heartbroken look on Dorien\u2019s face, Jaden knew the man would do nothing to stop it. Whether he couldn\u2019t, or just wouldn\u2019t, was irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Dorien said quietly. \u201cI knew there was something, but you were so close. You know there\u2019s nothing I can do. Why?\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head up to look into Dorien\u2019s face, and Jaden saw a single tear slide down her cheek. Jaden held his breath, barely realizing that he was, waiting to hear what she would say. But he knew that what he hoped, what he needed, to hear was something that might never fall from her lips. And certainly not here, in full sight of her pack.</p><p>Even as they cast her out.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cIt comes to the same thing. I\u2019m sorry, Dad. We didn\u2019t mean for it to go so far.\u201d</p><p>Dorien shook his head as cries began to rise from the pack, demands for justice to be meted out on both Jaden and Lyra. Not all the wolves, though, Jaden saw, looking around. Not even most. He saw everything from sympathy to sorrow to shock reflected back at him in the glowing eyes of the pack. Lyra was well loved. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised him. But none of them would go against the laws they had always lived by, the laws that had protected them from destruction more than once. He was just an interloper, a thief.</p><p>A vampire.</p><p>He caught sight of Gerry, the leader of the pack guard who had been kind to him fairly quickly. The man shook his head sadly as their eyes met, and then turned away. Suddenly, Jaden realized Simon was nowhere to be seen. He had known, Jaden thought. He\u2019d warned him. But it had already been too late.</p><p>All eyes were on Dorien as he approached Jaden. He didn\u2019t struggle, knowing it was better to face whatever the Alpha was going to dish out without fear. Inside, however, nerves jangled. He had no idea what to expect.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you,\u201d Dorien said. Jaden could hear the storm beneath the calm surface of the Alpha\u2019s voice. \u201cYou were supposed to help save her. And now I\u2019ve lost her forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with her,\u201d Jaden said. He felt Lyra\u2019s shocked gaze on his face, but he couldn\u2019t look away from Dorien. If he had to be subjected to this, if she did, he would say his piece.</p><p>He saw surprise, anger. \u201cLove doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jaden said, his voice carrying over the crowd. \u201cShe\u2019s waited her entire life to be seen for who she is, instead of just a token of power. She was brave enough to reach for what she wanted, and open minded enough to see me as a man instead of just a bloodsucker. She is exactly the sort of woman your pack should be holding up as an example. This isn\u2019t the damned Dark Ages anymore, Dorien. Those battles are over. The rest of the world has moved on, and yet here we are. You\u2019re going to give up your daughter, make her a pariah, for accidentally bonding with a man who loves her. Who would support her, and this pack. I would accept you, even though you\u2019re not my kind. You\u2019re really going to disown your only child because you refuse to accept me?\u201d</p><p>Eric curled his lip in disgust. \u201cWe have laws for a reason, vampire. We had chaos once, and it almost destroyed us. The Thorn is moving forward. Letting in the vampires jeopardizes all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you talking to the Ptolemy?\u201d Jaden asked, and saw Eric\u2019s face darken with fury.</p><p>\u201cThe Ptolemy? This is the dynasty that\u2019s been hunting you here? Why would I have anything to do with them? One vampire is the same as another. I wish they\u2019d gotten you. It would have saved us all of this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could have saved yourselves all of this anyway, if you\u2019d open your eyes. I know you\u2019ve had contact with the Ptolemy, with Queen Arsin\u00f6e. With the House of Shadows. You\u2019d align with them and still throw Lyra out for touching me. How does that make any sense? The queen will destroy you a lot more effectively than I ever could!\u201d</p><p>Eric walked up to him, bared his teeth, and slashed him across the face with his claws. The pain was sharp, but brief, as his head rocked to the side. He heard Lyra\u2019s furious cry.</p><p>\u201cEric, don\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>Jaden saw the blood spatter the ground, but he could already feel the flesh knitting together.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t accuse me, vampire,\u201d Eric growled. \u201cAll your wishing I would destroy my pack that way won\u2019t make it true.\u201d He shot a heated look at his cousin. \u201cSome of us actually care about preserving what we have, instead of trying to change everything.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, and Jaden was left to glare after him. Unlike the mark on Lyra\u2019s arm, there was no proof that Eric was in league with the Ptolemy except for the word of a Shade, another vampire who had doubtless skipped town at the first sign of trouble. Maybe there was more they could do, if the Thorn would even allow his kind to help. But he and Lyra would have to deal with the problem at hand first. And he could see already that for Lyra, this would be nothing less than devastating.</p><p>He would get her out of this. And then he would do what he needed to make her see that even if he wasn\u2019t the future she\u2019d wanted, he could provide her with far more care than she would ever have gotten from any wolf.</p><p>\u201cDorien, don\u2019t do this to her,\u201d Jaden said, a final effort to convince the man even though he could see the time for convincing had long passed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the Alpha,\u201d Dorien said with a shake of his head. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be changed. No matter how much I wish they could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re nothing but a fool, after all,\u201d Jaden snapped, finally understanding what Lyra had been up against her entire life. Even if she hadn\u2019t bonded with him, someone would have found a way to stop her at the Proving. She\u2019d never had a chance. He credited Dorien for trying something unconventional instead of forcing her to bend, but Jaden doubted the man would ever buck the system again. No change would come here without a violent upheaval, and he hated to imagine what that would be.</p><p>Dorien didn\u2019t lash out at the retort. He seemed as though he\u2019d barely heard it, moving in a daze to stand beside his nephew. The heir apparent.</p><p>\u201cWolves of the Thorn! Choose the fate of my\u2014\u201d His voice faltered for a moment, and Jaden thought he might stop and reconsider, despite everything. But after a deep breath, the Alpha pressed on.</p><p>\u201cChoose the fate of my daughter!\u201d</p><p>Silence ensued for several seconds, and Jaden felt a glimmer of hope that a handful of the bravest would take up her cause, would demand she be allowed to stay. But then the chant started, low and soft, like the rhythmic beating of a drum.</p> <p>Lyra looked at the ground, then lifted her head to hold it up, a final act of defiance as she was cast away.</p><p>Ghost wolf... ghost wolf... ghost wolf... ghost wolf...</p><p>The chanting rose, crested like a wave, echoing into the night sky like some dark song. When Dorien raised his hands, it died away. He nodded to the wolves holding her, and they released her, stepping back. Pain echoed through every word Dorien spoke.</p><p>\u201cLyra Black. You are cast out of the Pack of the Thorn as of this night, cast out of our pack, our territory, our world, never to rejoin our kind. You are a ghost to us, a wolf only in the form you take, not in the life you\u2019ve chosen to lead. And you are no longer my child.\u201d</p><p>Jaden heard Lyra\u2019s sharp intake of breath, as though she\u2019d been slapped.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she said softly, pleading. But Dorien turned away. And the anguish Lyra felt tore through Jaden as though it were his own, screaming out of the night and nearly taking him to his knees. The shock of Dorien\u2019s decision made him stumble, and he found himself jerked upward by the men who still held him.</p><p>Eric looked on approvingly, though Jaden supposed he couldn\u2019t say the wolf looked pleased. He\u2019d expected more gloating... but maybe that would be saved for later, when he could laugh with his cronies about how easily he\u2019d won after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the vampire?\u201d he asked Dorien quietly. \u201cShall I kill him, or would you like to?\u201d</p> <p>Dorien shook his head. \u201cLet him go. He defended the pack once, despite everything.\u201d He looked directly at Jaden, his eyes burning with emotions Jaden didn\u2019t even want to guess at. \u201cConsider this a debt repaid, Jaden of the Lilim.\u201d He stepped closer, leaning down to speak directly in Jaden\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cTake care of her, damn you. It\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d</p><p>Then Dorien rose, motioned to the wolves behind Jaden, and Jaden found himself released. Lyra stood alone, looking around as though she didn\u2019t quite know where she was. He hesitated, but finally he went to her. What point was there in hiding it now? She would need someone. Whether she liked it or not, she would need him.</p><p>He took her hand, and she didn\u2019t resist. But it felt cold and lifeless in his.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Dorien said, and turned away. He began to walk, and didn\u2019t stop, pushing through the crowd so that it swallowed him up and he vanished from view. The fact that he couldn\u2019t watch his daughter go said something. But it would have said more if he hadn\u2019t let it happen at all.</p><p>Lyra looked at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. Her voice was so soft as to be barely audible.</p><p>\u201cHelp me do this,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. He would walk through fire for her if she asked. One day, maybe she would see that.</p><p>The crowd before them parted, clearing a path out of the square. Jaden tugged at Lyra\u2019s hand and got her to start moving. You can do this, he willed her silently. You can do this. Just a few steps more. He didn\u2019t know whether she could sense any of his thoughts, as his kind could do while in their feline forms. But she did come with him, putting one foot in front of the other.</p><p>The wolves were silent as the outcasts passed by, and as they passed, each wolf turned his back. The powerful symbolism affected Jaden in no small measure. This truly was meant to be the end for her. He hoped he could be enough to get her through the aftermath. No matter how strong she was, this wound would take time to heal, if it ever did.</p><p>They finally passed the edge of the crowd and continued down the deserted street toward the house that was no longer Lyra\u2019s. Jaden wanted to retrieve his car and get out of town as quickly as possible, partly because when he looked over at Lyra, what he saw worried him deeply. She was obviously in shock. She looked as white as a ghost, and her eyes bore a glassy cast. He had never seen her anything but strong. This was not a Lyra he was quite sure what to do with\u2014she had never accepted his comfort, had never needed it. But she clung to his hand as though it was the only thing keeping her afloat.</p><p>He would take her to Tipton, and to Lily, Jaden decided. After that, they both could decide what to do next.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, urging her to move more quickly. \u201cWe need to get to my car and get out of here.\u201d He was suddenly uneasy. They were being watched. He could feel the eyes on them, and seconds later, he picked up the scent.</p><p>It seemed they\u2019d be leaving Silver Falls in a bigger hurry than he\u2019d thought. And he could guess very well who had provided them with an escort like this.</p><p>Don\u2019t accuse you my ass, Eric Black.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>The urgency in his voice seemed to snap her out of her fog, at least enough to move. They dashed forward, Jaden shifting smoothly into his faster form. Lyra must have done the same, because seconds later he had a sleek wolf running alongside him. They headed down a side street, and Jaden knew they were being pursued. He pushed his body to the limit, faster and faster, until his feet barely seemed to be touching the ground. There was the sound of vicious laughter behind them, close. Still, he and Lyra managed to stay just ahead, winding down streets and dashing through yards until they reached her street. He could see his \u2019Vette shining beneath the streetlight. They were so close\u2014</p><p>He realized all at once that Lyra was no longer at his side. Jaden skidded to a halt, spun around, and saw that Lyra had decided to confront their pursuers on her own. She stood, splay-legged, in the middle of the empty street, hackles raised, growling low in her throat at a small group of beautiful, pale-skinned Ptolemy women emerging from the darkness. One, a beautiful blond courtier Jaden remembered lusting over for a time several years ago, strolled to the front of the group, hips swaying. Her smile was cruel.</p><p>\u201cOh, leaving so soon? Come here, doggie. Let\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>Jaden ran to place himself in front of Lyra and shifted into a man again. He could see they all recognized him, not that it would make any difference in their fun. The blonde hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d she sneered. The others took up the chant, spitting the word at him.</p><p>He could feel Lyra standing behind him, but he stayed where he was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a she-wolf,\u201d one of the others snickered. \u201cInteresting company you\u2019re keeping these days, Jaden.\u201d She looked at her blond companion. \u201cRemember how he used to stare at us? Such a pretty cat. Shame he\u2019s got dirty blood. I almost feel bad, seeing what he\u2019s been reduced to.\u201d</p><p>The blonde\u2014Jaden remembered her name as Carissa\u2014shrugged. \u201cKill the wolf. Arsin\u00f6e wants Jaden. There are many of us here,\u201d she said, turning her attention back to Jaden with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood for this,\u201d Lyra said, her voice hard. \u201cTurn around and leave, or lose your heads. Jaden and I are out of here either way.\u201d</p><p>Amazed, Jaden watched Lyra stride past him to face Carissa head-on. The vampire was too stunned by the she-wolf\u2019s audacity to move right away, which he supposed Lyra had counted on. By the time Carissa thought to react, it was too late. Lyra had her by the throat. The tips of her claws dug into tender flesh, and if Carissa\u2019s wide eyes and lack of breathing were any indication, Lyra had a hell of a grip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyra bared her teeth and looked at the others. \u201cLeave us or her head comes off. Then yours.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised to see the uneasy glances exchanged before the lot of them slinked off back into the darkness. These were no hardened hunters, just courtiers in town for some fun. He was sure they\u2019d decide not to mention this unpleasant incident to anyone else and find a different way to amuse themselves. Once they were gone, Lyra hurled Carissa to the ground where the vampire collapsed, gagging. She would heal soon enough, though, and from the look in her eyes she wouldn\u2019t slink away quite so easily.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cIn the car. Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Lyra said. There was a deadness in her eyes that chilled Jaden to the bone. In this state of mind, he felt sure she would have gladly leaped into a sea of Ptolemy, fighting tooth and claw until she was overwhelmed. He recognized the symptoms\u2014he\u2019d been there before. Right now, she didn\u2019t care about anything, least of all herself. But she couldn\u2019t stay numb forever. And he wanted to be well out of here when she started to fall apart.</p><p>Jaden pulled the keys from his pocket, and they got quickly into the Corvette. As soon as they were inside, he locked the doors. A quick glance at the street showed him that Carissa had already vanished. He doubted she\u2019d gone far, though. All the more reason to burn rubber out of here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d he told her as the engine growled to life, as much to convince himself as to convince her. Lyra didn\u2019t look at him, just stared straight ahead, expressionless.</p><p>\u201cJust drive,\u201d she said.</p><p>So he did, pushing the pedal to the floor and roaring off into the night.</p> <p>Chapter TWENTY-ONE</p><p>BY THE TIME they made it to Tipton the next night, Lyra was fighting to maintain the eerie calm that had stolen over her after her father had turned his back on her. She knew Jaden was worried, but she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Talking about it would make it that much more real. So she had spent most of the two nights of their trip sitting quietly in the car, or pretending to sleep so he would leave her alone.</p><p>She wished she could really sleep, but that had proven elusive. Every time she lay down, the entire terrible scene played over and over in her head on an endless loop. While Jaden had slept the day away in their hotel room, she\u2019d taken his cell phone down to the lounge and tried to call her house, over and over again.</p><p>No answer. Just her father\u2019s gruff and grumbly voice on the answering machine. Eventually, she\u2019d realized she was just calling back to hear his message and stopped. She tried Simon, both on his cell and his house phone, but got no answer there either. It was as though they had dropped off the face of the earth.</p><p>Or she had.</p><p>So she\u2019d eaten some fruit from the continental breakfast, which she hadn\u2019t really wanted and had barely tasted. And then she\u2019d gone back up to the room, and while Jaden slept peacefully on one of the two beds, she\u2019d curled into him to take what comfort she could. By the time he\u2019d awakened, she was back on her own bed. He\u2019d seemed a little puzzled\u2014Lyra wondered whether he sensed that she\u2019d essentially stolen comfort from him. In truth, she had no idea how to ask for it when he was awake.</p> <p>Jaden had humbled her with the words he\u2019d spoken in front of her pack. She was grateful, too, that he didn\u2019t seem to expect her to return them\u2014the words or the sentiment. She didn\u2019t know how she felt, or how she would feel once the full import of what had happened sunk in. She didn\u2019t even know if the bond mark she wore on her arm would matter to her anymore, because right now, she couldn\u2019t seem to feel much of anything but an ache that echoed all the way down to her soul.</p><p>After a lifetime spent pushing against boundaries that often refused to give, she was finally, completely, free to do what she liked. But with her entire life, all her dreams, crumbled around her, Lyra no longer knew what she wanted.</p><p>Tipton was quiet when they arrived at the Bonner Mansion, which was now the seat of the Lilim. The town had seemed sleepy at the best of times, from what Lyra remembered of her trip there, but on a Tuesday night around midnight, there was only the occasional car on otherwise empty streets. Jaden pulled around into the little parking lot beside the house, which Lyra had learned had functioned as the county historical society for quite a few years prior.</p><p>Jaden turned off the engine and sat quietly for a moment, waiting, she supposed, for her to show some sign that she was coming out of the wraithlike state she\u2019d been in since her expulsion from the Thorn last night. Lyra tried to meet his gaze, but she had to look away. He saw too much. Her defenses were low, and she could no longer be sure what would come tumbling out. The worry, stress, and little sleep had taken their toll. She was in the same clothes she\u2019d left Silver Falls in, rumpled and weary. Her eyes felt dry and irritated. Her hair was clean, thanks to the hotel\u2019s complimentary toiletries, but it was pulled into a careless bun.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she looked like, though she doubted it was good.</p><p>At this point, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cLily and Ty are good people,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cThey won\u2019t ask too many questions, and they won\u2019t be offended if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to answer. But... pretty soon you should start talking to someone, Lyra. Even if it isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Then a sliver of terror managed to penetrate her little cocoon. Would he expect her to stay with him? If she stayed with him, he was going to see her break. She was supposed to be strong, independent. If he offered his shoulder, she might have to take it. Then he might see that she really was just as weak as her kind had judged her to be.</p> <p>But alone... being alone actually scared her worse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, Lyra. At least at first. I can sleep on the floor if you want, it doesn\u2019t matter. But I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>She was torn between relief and annoyance at having the decision made for her. She didn\u2019t really want to be alone right now... but she also didn\u2019t want to be told what to do. Confused, exhausted, she focused her ire on Jaden.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my boss. Don\u2019t push me around like one,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Jaden glowered back at her. \u201cI promised I would take care of you, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. You do need some care, Lyra, even if you don\u2019t think so. Last night was a hell of a night for both of us, so quit being a stubborn ass about it and just... accept it, okay?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shoved a hand through his hair, and Lyra felt the guilt creeping in. He\u2019d been wonderfully accommodating. And she\u2019d been either catatonic or prickly. It wouldn\u2019t kill her to be gracious, she thought. None of this was his fault, unless she counted his being too appealing as a mark against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... sorry. I\u2019ll stay with you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She knew she sounded stiff, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She thought she might actually sleep, at least, because her body was finally going to give her no other choice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting us.\u201d</p><p>Lyra was glad about that. She just wasn\u2019t sure what to expect herself. She slid out of the car and walked beside Jaden to the house, a beautiful old Victorian. Lights glowed cheerfully in the windows, melting away just a little of the ice that seemed to have frozen into a hard ball right at the center of her. With that melting came a wave of yearning for home. That was something she knew she was going to have to learn to deal with. Jaden slowed, and she could feel him looking at her. Her feelings must be written all over her face.</p><p>\u201cLyra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him. She just wasn\u2019t ready to see what might be in his eyes.</p><p>He hesitated. Then gave up... for now.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>The heavy front door swung open as soon as they got halfway up the steps, and a woman Lyra remembered very well came rushing out to throw her arms around Jaden. Lyra watched him accept the embrace and felt an unexpected twinge of jealousy. She was well aware of who this was, and Jaden had said enough that Lyra knew she was married. But still... didn\u2019t she have her own man to paw at?</p><p>Lyra looked the leader of the Lilim over while she waited for her to stop fussing over Jaden. Lily MacGillivray had been a beautiful woman when Lyra had met her months ago. The change in her, though, was remarkable. She\u2019d gone from beautiful to drop-dead gorgeous. And the tall, dark vampire lingering in the doorway with the intense expression... she remembered him, too, and he was almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as good looking as Jaden.</p><p>Lily and Ty were definitely vampires, with all that untouchable perfection. But at least they seemed friendly. Well, Lily did. And after a moment, Lily turned her oceanic blue gaze on her. The sympathy Lyra saw reflected back at her was almost too much for her to deal with. Pain, bright and sharp, sliced neatly through her haze.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Lily said, striding forward to stand before her. She stood probably a head shorter than Lyra, but still managed to convey a sort of regal grace. She wasn\u2019t exactly imposing, though. No one who wore her emotions on her face so unabashedly could ever be imposing. In this case, Lyra counted that as a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you remember me, but I\u2019m Lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Lyra replied, and then offered what she knew was only a small, weary smile. \u201cThanks for having me. Congrats on the whole dynasty thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lily replied, her answering smile full of warmth. \u201cAnd you\u2019re more than welcome. Anything you need, I want you to let me know, okay? I know what it\u2019s like to have your life turned upside down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d Lyra replied, looking up at the impressive fa\u00e7ade of the house again.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, please,\u201d Lily said, laying a hand lightly on Lyra\u2019s back and guiding her inside. Lyra allowed it, glad to have someone pilot her body around for a little while since her mind kept trying to check out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled in. I\u2019ll show you where your room is, and then you\u2019re welcome to rest or join us. Whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. And don\u2019t worry that you won\u2019t be treated well. I\u2019ve got no problem with werewolves, and my people aren\u2019t going to either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d the man in the doorway said, \u201cshe read everyone the riot act. If anyone had a problem before, they\u2019ll be keeping it to themselves now. Lily\u2019s got a mouth on her when she feels like using it.\u201d</p><p>His silver eyes glinted with humor, and an obvious love for his wife. Lyra had to admit, Lily and Ty made a striking couple. As she passed him, he nodded at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ty MacGillivray. I remember you too. I\u2019m sorry your troubles have followed you so long,\u201d he said, his voice touched with a lovely, lilting brogue.</p> <p>Great, more kindness, Lyra thought. Her eyes watered threateningly. Fueled by her fatigue, no doubt. Still, she managed a smile as she walked into a beautiful, high-ceilinged entranceway with a wide staircase directly ahead. Lily started toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be staying up here,\u201d she began, but Jaden\u2019s voice, rough from the trip and his own stress, cut in.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, she\u2019s staying with me. I\u2019ll take her up to my room.\u201d</p><p>Lily narrowed her eyes and turned around to address him. She kept her voice reasonable, but Lyra could hear the irritation beneath.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I told you that Lyra can make her own decisions on that. I\u2019ll give her a room. If she wants to stay with you later on, that\u2019s up to her. She\u2019s a big girl, Jaden.\u201d</p> <p>It was interesting to hear herself argued over, but all Lyra really wanted was to get upstairs and fall into bed. She must have looked it, too, because no one argued with her when she spoke up.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Lily, but I\u2019d just as soon room with Jaden. I need to get some sleep. And anyway,\u201d she muttered, embarrassed by Jaden\u2019s obvious pleasure at her decision, \u201cI\u2019ll never hear the end of it if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That was as close as she was going to come to saying she needed him near her right now, in case she started to fall apart and she couldn\u2019t put herself back together. It would be a lot better than simply crumpling up in front of Lily and whoever else lived here.</p><p>Lily\u2019s expression was kind when she looked between Lyra and Jaden. She nodded. \u201cOkay. I understand completely. Jaden can get you settled. Obviously I\u2019d like to hear about what\u2019s going on, and maybe talk about what you want moving forward, but that can happen whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded, grateful that Jaden had pegged Lily and Ty correctly\u2014they wouldn\u2019t press her. At least not tonight.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll be turning in, actually. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I\u2019ve barely slept. But wake me up if, you know, anyone comes looking for me.\u201d</p> <p>She knew how pathetic it sounded, but she couldn\u2019t give up on the faint hope that her father would change his mind, that the pack could be swayed. That she could somehow go home.</p><p>\u201cWe absolutely will,\u201d Lily said. Lyra took some solace in the woman\u2019s calm strength, which seemed like a beacon in the miserable storm her life had become.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you where you\u2019ll be staying,\u201d Jaden said, slipping his arm around her waist. Lyra let him, mainly because her legs had gone wobbly and weak, and she wanted to make sure she actually made it up the stairs. She didn\u2019t want to lean on him\u2014but it was hard not to when her body refused to have it any other way.</p><p>Lily watched the two of them go up, and Ty came to stand beside her as they vanished around the corner and onto the second floor. Jaden\u2019s room was on the third level, where he preferred it, so Lyra would be well tucked away from the curious eyes of the rest of the Lilim and Cait Sith if she wished to be.</p><p>Ty looked in the direction they had gone, and moved behind his wife to wrap his arms around her. She leaned back into him, comforted by his strength. He rested his chin on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a good heart, Lily.\u201d</p><p>She gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to understand the way your world operates, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur world,\u201d Ty said gently. \u201cAnd the wolves are, in some ways, even more rigid than our kind. Some of that is the vampires\u2019 fault. And some of it just is. We\u2019re changing. Maybe they will too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have a big, unpleasant change coming if Damien was telling the truth.\u201d Lily shook her head. \u201cThe Ptolemy are like a vampire wrecking crew. They destroy everything they touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t destroy us. Their time is coming, Lily. They\u2019ll meddle in one thing too many, and it\u2019ll bite Arsin\u00f6e right in the ass. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. She didn\u2019t stay down for long the last time. And with a pack of wolves at her disposal, she could make a lot of trouble. It doesn\u2019t help that the Council is afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>Ty rubbed his chin against her hair. \u201cShe\u2019s very old, very clever, and very powerful. But she\u2019s afraid of you, my lovely Lily. So we continue to build, and we wait for the right time to stop her permanently. The rest will stand with us, when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. For now, I just want to be of some help to poor Lyra. She\u2019s lost everything,\u201d Lily said. She knew how it felt to be alone all too well. But it hadn\u2019t been quite as blood-soaked as Lyra\u2019s separation from her pack. Her human best friend hadn\u2019t deserted her, though Bay was still getting used to hanging around with a bunch of vampires. And she had Ty, one of the greatest gifts of her life, greater, even than the gifts her blood had given her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Ty said. \u201cJaden seems to want to be something to her, that\u2019s certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see him attached to someone,\u201d Lily admitted. She\u2019d seen the way Jaden looked at Lyra. His heart was right in his eyes. \u201cBut a vampire and a werewolf... it seems like that comes built in with a whole lot of issues. And that\u2019s even before her specific baggage, which is probably considerable.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected him to choose someone without issues. Jaden never does anything the easy way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess you weren\u2019t kidding about that,\u201d Lily said, though she didn\u2019t see much humor in it. She loved Jaden like family. And she knew firsthand that even impossible problems could sometimes be gotten around. But this... she just wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cJaden will be down before long,\u201d Ty said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Lily nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait in the kitchen. Jaden\u2019s most comfortable in there.\u201d She gave his hand an affectionate squeeze, and the two of them headed to the back of the house.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-TWO</p><p>THE DAYS immediately following her expulsion from the Thorn were a blur.</p><p>Lyra woke and slept, ate little and moved even less. Her pack, her father, had declared her a ghost wolf, and that\u2019s exactly how she felt. She had no interest in anything. She didn\u2019t want to die, but she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to go about living, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any energy in her reserves to figure out a solution.</p><p>Jaden watched her like a hawk, the concern etched ever deeper onto his preternaturally beautiful face. At first she found it as frustrating as she did reassuring. It wasn\u2019t simply that she could see his worry... she could feel it whenever he was near, flowing from him and into her, upsetting the comfortable cocoon of numbness she had settled herself inside. What did he want from her? Didn\u2019t he see she needed space even if she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted it? And yet he was always there, waiting with his steady, reassuring silence. He pushed food at her and made sure she ate enough to keep going, prodded her with suggestions to get up, to bathe, to re-engage.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been ready for those things. But that didn\u2019t stop him from trying.</p><p>She watched sunrises and sunsets, wandered like a wraith through the mansion when the sun shone and stayed curled in the secluded cave of Jaden\u2019s room at night. She didn\u2019t want to see anyone. They might want to talk about what came next.</p><p>And for a woman who had lived her entire life with a single goal in mind, those conversations frightened her most of all.</p><p>She\u2019d known, however, that the fugue state she was in couldn\u2019t last. And finally, after six days of wallowing in the depths of herself, she surfaced.</p><p>She awoke not knowing what time it was, her eyes opening in the darkness that she\u2019d made sure was no indication of what time of day it was outside. Lyra blinked, then gently lifted her hands to rub the sleep from her eyes. Something was different.</p><p>She could feel again.</p><p>Lyra breathed in deeply, as though she was awakening from a long and unpleasant dream. She felt... grimy. And wrung out. But sadly, that was an improvement. Slowly, she raised herself to a sitting position in the midst of the tangle of covers she\u2019d spent many of the last days burrowed in. As her eyes adjusted to the dark room, she could see the Spartan trappings she\u2019d become accustomed to: the long, low dresser, the simple nightstand and lamp, the battered and ancient chest that squatted at the foot of the massive four-poster bed that had been her nest.</p><p>Then she looked down and saw the figure on the floor. He slept, perfectly still, on a featherbed that had been dragged in here by a couple of nervous-looking vampires. She had some vague memory of gazing blearily at them from beneath the covers while they worked. His slim figure was curled into a loose fetal position, one arm tucked beneath the shaggy head and the other pressed against his chest. In the silence, Lyra could hear the soft and steady sound of his breathing, occasionally punctuated by a light snore.</p><p>Jaden.</p><p>Feelings she had buried rushed back to the surface all at once with a painful swiftness, but for once, she welcomed them. Images flickered through her memory, of being watched, cared for, looked after. Loved.</p><p>He loved her. Even when she had done nothing to encourage it, or to reward him, he\u2019d stayed by her side. And what she felt in return, flooding her until it felt as though she might burst with it, was both painful and beautiful. In all this darkness, she would never have expected that he would have been her light. Yet here they were.</p><p>She steeled herself and sat up, slowly swinging her legs over the side of the bed. Her body felt odd, rusty from disuse. She lowered her feet to the plush Oriental rug that covered the floor and then stood, swaying unsteadily in the darkness. Nothing stirred. Lyra decided that no matter what hour of day it was, she had enough time to at least get a head start on her plans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had mourned enough. And Lyra found a piece of her that thrilled, just a little, with the knowledge that in this new life of hers, she could count on someone to stand beside her.</p><p>Whatever there was to face beyond the smoking ruins of her old life, she would not be facing it alone.</p><p>She finally knew what she wanted. And since she did everything the hard way, she\u2019d had to go through hell to figure out that the right thing had been staring her in the face\u2014or brooding in her basement\u2014for weeks. He was the only one who\u2019d ever accepted her just the way she was, who\u2019d supported her dreams without questioning her ability to achieve them. And in return, she\u2019d pushed at him and run from him and pretended that she would have been able to let him go. He\u2019d been endlessly patient. She\u2019d been a fool. But Lyra was going to have all the time in the world to make it up to him. So she would give Jaden the only gift she had, the only one she could give.</p> <p>To get moving, and begin again. With him.</p><p>Jaden awakened to an empty room and the faint sound of laughter. There was something familiar and wonderful about it, and he let himself drift for a moment, listening as he stretched languidly, allowing himself the time to wake up fully.</p><p>Then he realized why he recognized the sound.</p><p>Lyra.</p><p>He was on his feet in an instant, slamming out of the room and rushing into the hallway. It was empty, but the sound of voices was clearer. Lyra was downstairs, engaged in what sounded like animated conversation with Lily. The relief surged through him, threatening to take him to his knees. He\u2019d begun to think the Lyra he\u2019d known was gone, replaced by a shell that would never do more than drift from place to place.</p> <p>He should have known she\u2019d be stronger than that. But what she\u2019d been through wasn\u2019t something most would ever have to experience, and something even the strongest people would have a hard time dealing with. He had managed to keep his family, after a fashion, once he\u2019d been turned. Losing them had been hard, one of the hardest things in his long life, but he\u2019d known they cared up until the end.</p><p>Lyra would get to live with the knowledge of her rejection. But he swore he would be there to help her deal with it, whether she wanted him or not. Her mark meant something to him, even if it was never more than an unfortunate reminder to her. The strange irony was that she wore the mark, but he was the one who felt the bond most deeply.</p><p>Jaden rushed down the stairs, taking them two at a time, before leaping the last few and heading into the parlor, which Lily had recently redone to her taste and often spent time in. The sight that greeted him as he hit the doorway stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>Lily and Lyra both turned to look at him, but all he could see was his woman. Lyra reclined comfortably on a leather couch, her legs loosely crossed. She wore the jeans she\u2019d arrived in, long since cleaned, and a light-colored button-down shirt he didn\u2019t recognize. Her feet were bare; her hair fell in loose coils over her shoulders. Though she still looked a bit too thin, a bit too pale, like she had just recovered from a long illness, the blush of health had returned to her cheeks. The look in her eyes, luminous in the candlelight that Lily often preferred here, was pure pleasure. Her smile, however, was unsure.</p><p>\u201cYou slept in,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shoved his hair back from his face, flustered by his overwhelming desire to rush in, gather her in his arms, and cover her in kisses. Somehow, he doubted she was ready for that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014yeah, I guess I did. Now I wish I hadn\u2019t,\u201d he said, and finally managed to walk in. He looked to Lily, who looked like a cat who\u2019d caught the canary.</p><p>\u201cLyra and I were just discussing some of her options. She thinks she might like to stay on, if I can find her something to do.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Lyra, who nodded. \u201cAs long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Jaden wasn\u2019t sure whether she meant the Lilim, or him personally. But from the way she shifted nervously and nibbled her lip, he thought\u2014he hoped\u2014it was both. Lily stood, an empty mug in her hand, and Jaden saw she was still in a rumpled pair of oversized pajamas.</p><p>\u201cI think you two probably want to talk,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some more coffee.\u201d Then she grinned at Lyra. \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of glad that vampirism didn\u2019t kill my coffee addiction. We\u2019ll talk more later, okay? But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back. And trust me, I\u2019ll be glad to have you here. We all will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For everything,\u201d Lyra said, and Jaden could hear the emotion in her voice as Lily glided past him, sliding him a knowing look on her way by. He didn\u2019t miss the fact that she shut the door behind her.</p><p>Lyra stood the moment the door was closed, and Jaden took a cautious step toward her. One. Two. But she showed no sign of bolting.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of things I want to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSo hear me out, okay?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cAll right. But after that, you\u2019re going to let me say my piece too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d she said, though she looked like she might be dreading that part. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he hoped she would be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I have to thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taking care of me when I couldn\u2019t take care of myself. Nobody\u2019s ever done that for me. Not that I can remember, anyway. I was always supposed to be self-sufficient, and strong, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all of that,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cWhat happened to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not finished,\u201d she said, holding up her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to lean on someone. You didn\u2019t give me a choice, and I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t, because alone, I don\u2019t know what I would have done. I don\u2019t know how I would be right now. Or if I would be right now. You gave me something to wake up for, and you kept pushing at me to do it. That means more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Jaden said, taking a step closer. Her words were a balm to him, healing wounds he hadn\u2019t even realized were there.</p><p>\u201cSecond, the fact that I\u2019m bonded to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Jaden rushed out. He\u2019d done a lot of thinking, and he had no interest in pushing her about it. That didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t keep trying to win her over, but as far as he was concerned, the bonding thing would not be an issue until she wanted it to be.</p><p>Lyra glowered at him. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously ruining my planned speech, Jaden. Give it a rest for a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>So happy to hear the snap in her voice, he fell silent.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and then plunged ahead. \u201cI want to honor it. And... I know how to seal it. If you want that.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, taken completely by surprise. \u201cYou... how...\u201d</p><p>She dropped her eyes. \u201cThe day after everything happened between us, I went digging in the histories the pack keeps. There was something there.\u201d She paused, then recited:</p><p>When werewolf\u2019s bite the vampire takes</p><p>The wolf will bear the mark that mates</p><p>And vampire\u2019s kiss will seal their fate</p><p>To bind, stop time,</p><p>Both day and night are thine</p><p>Eternally entwined.</p><p>She raised her eyes again to meet his, and he was arrested by all he saw there.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf what I read is right, it\u2019s possible. I won\u2019t age, I guess, and you... I\u2019m not sure what will happen to you, except that you\u2019ll be saddled with me.\u201d She gave a short laugh. \u201cThe one example of this I know about didn\u2019t really last long enough for them to record all of the pros and cons. So we\u2019re an experiment. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve got to give... but whatever there is, it\u2019s yours. If you want it.\u201d</p><p>He could barely speak, could barely breathe. She stood, waiting, but he was afraid that if he reached for what he wanted so desperately, she would vanish. Just like everything else he\u2019d ever truly wanted. But when he took another step toward her, closing the distance between them, she remained very real.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s fast, Lyra. I don\u2019t want this to be because you feel obligated, or afraid. I want you to be sure. I\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and took his hands, the warmth of her being flowing through her hands and making him feel sun kissed. He looked for any sign of indecision on her face, but there was none. Only acceptance. And if not love, a promise that there could be, in time.</p><p>\u201cI realized a little while ago that even if things had come off just the way I thought I wanted, I wouldn\u2019t have been happy. The thought of you walking away doesn\u2019t work for me, Jaden. I would have gone after you, or tried to keep you around, have it both ways. This was always going to happen. Because I need you more than I need anything else. I would have liked to figure it out in a less earth-shattering way, but... well, that probably wasn\u2019t going to happen, either. I can be kind of hard-headed about some things. You may have noticed.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to think, much less speak, when he was finally hearing the words he\u2019d never thought to hear. Not from anyone, but especially not from Lyra. But he couldn\u2019t quite let himself believe that for the first time, he was getting exactly what, and whom, he wanted. Needed.</p><p>Loved.</p><p>His voice sounded hoarse and strange to his own ears. \u201cBut if your father comes for you? What if the pack changes their mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Lyra said, her eyes hardening. \u201cBut even if they did, it wouldn\u2019t change how I feel about this. I put my life on hold for too long thinking I could change the way things were. And they cast me out for something that\u2019s really no one\u2019s business but mine. I\u2019m ready to live my own life, wherever that takes me. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd... how do you feel about... us?\u201d he asked softly. There were three words he longed for. He had given them to her. And he hoped, in time, she would return them. When she spoke, they weren\u2019t the three words he\u2019d wanted, but they were ones he would certainly accept in their stead for now.</p><p>If she was serious, they would have plenty of time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cI choose you. I\u2019m already yours. I want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come with me,\u201d Jaden said, and he laughed from nerves and excitement. \u201cCome with me before you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to,\u201d Lyra said, and her smile was beautiful. It was everything.</p> <p>As Jaden led her from the room, he felt himself flooded with a strange emotion, one that was vaguely familiar though it took him a moment to recognize it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure, but he thought it might be happiness.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-THREE</p><p>LYRA BARELY REGISTERED the walk from the parlor up to Jaden\u2019s room. She felt like she was floating, anchored only by the rapid fluttering of her heart. But she no longer had any doubts. Being with Jaden felt right. She wanted to join with him, fully. And when it was done, she planned to tell him what was in her heart.</p><p>That would be the right time, she knew. And since she\u2019d never said the words to any man, and never planned to say them to another, she wanted the timing to be perfect. It was amazing, how quickly doubt had fallen away once she\u2019d seen his face.</p> <p>She loved him.</p><p>Even with all the uncertainty before her, knowing that, accepting that, was all that seemed to matter right now. His love was the one thing she had been able to depend on through everything. And in return, she would give him whatever she had to give.</p><p>Right now, that amounted to her body, and her heart.</p><p>When he opened the door to the bedroom, Lyra eyed the mass of blankets and sheets in the middle of the bed with a wrinkled nose.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably burn those,\u201d she said.</p><p>His laugh was music.</p> <p>\u201cLater. The featherbed is comfortable, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Jaden closed the door, plunging the room back into darkness, though her wolf\u2019s eyes adjusted quickly. Even in the absence of light, Jaden was beautiful, she thought. And the way he was looking at her made her feel more precious than gold. It was an unfamiliar feeling, but one she savored.</p><p>Jaden\u2019s eyes sparked that amazing blue and began to glow softly as he approached her. His expression held so much longing that it took Lyra\u2019s breath away. Why had she been denying herself this, she wondered? All this time, he had been hers for the taking, and she\u2019d wasted it. No longer.</p><p>\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t fought it,\u201d she whispered, at a loss for the words that would properly express her regret.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have meant anything to you if you hadn\u2019t. And I wouldn\u2019t love you if you didn\u2019t fight.\u201d He lifted his hand to stroke her hair, her cheek, his eyes drinking her in with a thirst unlike any she had known. His words washed through her like moonlight.</p><p>\u201cBe with me,\u201d she said, her voice a plea, a sigh. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wish,\u201d he murmured, his breath feathering her face, \u201cmy command.\u201d</p><p>His mouth claimed hers in a series of teasing kisses designed to heighten her already fathomless desire. Jaden\u2019s hands dropped to her shirt as he continued his sweet torment, lifting the fabric gently to expose bare, creamy skin. She shivered in the cool air as she helped him, then tugged at his own top. It was gone in seconds, his motions quickening as need sparked and caught fire.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he murmured, pulling her to him. His own skin was far cooler than her own, and yet it had the opposite effect, sending heat coiling through her. His hands slid up her back, unfastening the clip of her bra to send that sliding to the floor. She closed her eyes and exhaled, half sigh, half moan as her bare breasts pressed against his skin. The nipples quickly pebbled into tight, sensitized buds, and every movement he made as he shifted against her was exquisite torment. Jaden\u2019s hands slipped down to cup her ass and pull her into him.</p><p>He was already rigid through the fabric of his jeans. Instinctively, Lyra arched into him, trying to get closer to his heat. She heard his shuddering breath, and he skimmed his lips down her cheek, her jawline, awakening thousands of tiny nerve endings that danced and quavered.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful Lyra,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI can never get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try,\u201d she replied softly. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m yours. Take as much as you want... there will always be more.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was like dark velvet. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how badly I\u2019ve been wanting to hear you say that. Mine,\u201d he sighed. And then again, with dark possession that made her tremble with need, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>It was a word she\u2019d once feared but now knew could be the sweetest heaven when the one possessing was also willfully possessed. She belonged with him. And she was so tired of fighting it when he was all she wanted.</p><p>They came together more eagerly now, mouths and tongues tangling in an ancient dance as they fumbled with their clothes. Lyra\u2019s hands roamed over his silken skin, unable to get enough of him, wanting to touch him everywhere. As incredible as the first time had been, she knew this would be more.</p><p>She pulled away only for a moment to drop onto the bed, landing amid the pillow-soft bedding to watch Jaden immediately come after her, on all fours, his ebony hair falling into his face and looking for all the world like a fallen angel. When she reached for him, he pushed her back gently with a small, wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he repeated. Then his mouth was on her, and she forgot to breathe as he began to claim her in earnest. He trailed a hot path down her body, beginning at the neck, where he kissed and nibbled down the long curve. She could feel the tiny points of his fangs graze her skin, a decadent reminder of what he was\u2014and what he could do to her.</p><p>What he would do to her.</p><p>Knowing what lay ahead fueled the fire burning deep within Lyra, as did Jaden\u2019s talented mouth as he suckled her breasts, drawing the tight buds between his teeth and lavishing them with attention. Lyra writhed beneath him, wanting more, restlessly urging him on with her body when words failed her.</p><p>He delved lower, swirling his tongue in the indent of her navel before sliding lower... lower...</p><p>Lyra cried out when he laved the throbbing bud of her sex in one long, hot stroke of his tongue, her hips jerking off the bed as everything inside her tightened with exquisite anticipation. She looked down to see his dark head between her thighs, and the sight alone was enough to push her even closer to the shimmering edge.</p><p>She wanted... yes, she wanted...</p><p>With only a few rhythmic laps of his tongue, Lyra came with a sharp cry, her body bowing upward. And still he tormented her, wringing every ounce of pleasure from her until she was shaking. Even then, she knew he was nowhere near finished. Nor did she want him to be.</p><p>Her breath came in short gasps as Jaden rose over her, her dark god of night. Their eyes caught, held. And in his, she saw the truth of his feelings for her. They were as real as the heart that beat against her chest, and her own heart sang in response. She had only a single word, ragged and broken as she lifted up against him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He was inside her in one long, hard stroke, filling her completely, stretching her so that each shift as he settled sent sensation shimmering over her skin. His beautiful face contorted as he moaned, the sound welling up from the depths of him and reverberating through her, making her hot, making her impossibly, deliciously wet. Lyra\u2019s hands went to the sharp juts of his hips, wanting to feel the flex and release of every thrust. He began to move, slowly at first, then faster as the passion took them.</p><p>In the darkness, Lyra clung to him as she felt the magic coil outward from the very center of her, intensifying sensation, binding them together as a single being. She heard his shuddering breaths as he began to feel it, rippling over skin, urging him to pump deeper, harder. The bed rocked beneath them, and the soft, guttural sounds Jaden made at the apex of each thrust were driving Lyra slowly wild. She gave over to the instincts, to her wolf, letting her claws lengthen, her teeth sharpen. She wanted only this vampire, both man and cat, and she told him so with her words, her mouth, her body.</p><p>She could feel him tensing, the air itself taking on an electric charge that would soon demand release. And everything inside her was winding tighter and tighter, until something had to let go.</p><p>They came together, Lyra slamming into him on a blinding flash of light as he went rigid, emptying himself into her with a shout. They clung to one another as the climax crashed through them, fusing them as one. Words echoed in her head, a chant.</p><p>Eternally entwined... eternally entwined...</p><p>\u201cYour bite,\u201d she whispered in his ear. \u201cNow...\u201d</p><p>She heard him gasp a word of praise to the gods above, and it made her smile even through the incredible sensations flooding her. He sank his teeth in, and she felt the night burst around her as though she were at the center of a supernova.</p><p>For the first time Lyra truly let go, swept into the sweet darkness of the man she loved, feeling herself changing as invisible bonds wrapped them together, gossamer threads as strong as iron, as unbreakable as forever. He drank, shuddering with pleasure, and then lifted his head to kiss her lips, letting her taste what she had given him.</p><p>The words rose in her mind, and she opened her mouth, glad to finally give him this gift, the only one she had to give.</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she stopped and stilled as a terrible pounding began at the front door, and she heard her name being called in an anguished voice she was stunned to recognize.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>Jaden stilled above her, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d better go see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>SHE THREW ON CLOTHES in the darkness, then headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s doing here?\u201d Jaden asked. He sounded angrier than she normally heard him, but she didn\u2019t blame him. The thought of seeing Simon, or any of her pack again, gave her a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. Not even her oldest friend had stepped up to defend her. It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference, but the support would have given her some small comfort.</p><p>Instead, she had left the pack without a soul to speak for her but the man beside her. And she wasn\u2019t going to forget it. Jaden, however, seemed worried as they stepped out into the light of the hallway and hurried toward the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever he says, don\u2019t let him guilt-trip you into anything,\u201d Jaden growled. Lyra looked over at him, surprised, as someone opened the door downstairs. She heard gasps and worried voices, and the sick feeling intensified. Something had happened, she knew it. And if it had to do with the Ptolemy...</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you care,\u201d Jaden replied. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but remember how quickly they cast you aside. Whatever has happened, you\u2019re not going to go rushing off to save the day with Simon. We\u2019re a team now.\u201d</p> <p>She glowered at him, but as they came around the curve of the staircase and she saw what was waiting for her at the bottom, her irritation was quickly forgotten. Dull horror replaced it as she took in the sight of the man, or rather the shell of the man, Simon had dragged in. Every last bit of glow from what she had shared with Jaden vanished.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she breathed. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>She flew down the last few steps, then stopped short as she watched a group of unfamiliar vampires, all dark and somehow feline, take Dorien\u2019s unconscious form and lower it to the floor. Lily was there, dressed now, and cast a single worried look at Lyra while issuing orders like a seasoned general.</p><p>\u201cWe need to change the bandages and see about cleaning out those wounds. Put him in the gold room on the second floor,\u201d she instructed the group of vampires. Newly minted Lilim, Lyra guessed, from the deference they showed Lily. There were nods, and they gathered to prepare to lift him back up. Lily instructed Ty, who was coming toward them from the back of the house, to call Vlad Dracul for his doctor. Lyra had heard the name in passing once or twice, but she wasn\u2019t sure why more vampires would be required.</p><p>\u201cHe has an excellent doctor among his people,\u201d Lily explained when she saw Lyra\u2019s puzzled look. \u201cI\u2019ll get a local doctor if I have to, but considering how fast we all heal, it can get sticky with the explanations. And the Dracul can get here quickly if they need to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey need to, then,\u201d Lyra said as she rushed to her father.</p><p>What she saw shocked her.</p><p>Dorien Black was less a man than a crisscrossing roadmap of wounded flesh. He had been bandaged in some places, but it seemed there had just been too much area to cover. Some of the bandages looked fresh, others were crusted with blood from areas that were still oozing. His face was white, covered with long, curved scabs. There was a faintly bluish tint to his lips, and the soft breaths Lyra could hear were distressingly shallow.</p><p>She had never seen him look so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she whimpered, her hands fluttering helplessly over wounded flesh. But he wasn\u2019t there... she could feel it. Dorien was either deep inside himself, or nowhere at all.</p><p>\u201cLet us take care of him,\u201d Lily said. \u201cWe can at least get him cleaned up and looked over while we wait, and then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to sit with him. Whatever was done to him it\u2019s more than what we can see. He shouldn\u2019t be unconscious.\u201d She pushed her hair behind her shoulders and motioned for the gathered Lilim to lift Dorien to take him up the stairs. It took a lot of effort for Lyra to step back, but somehow she managed. She heard Lily\u2019s muttered curse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a mess. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt Jaden\u2019s hands on her shoulders, shelter from another storm if she needed it. She nearly turned into him for comfort, except for the sight of the haggard man who was nearly unrecognizable from just a week before.</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d she breathed, and rushed to him, finding herself quickly enveloped in the warm and comforting embrace of her friend. He squeezed her tightly, nearly taking her breath away with the force of his hug. Then she understood exactly how bad it was. Simon was right on the edge of breaking down.</p><p>She pulled back when he released her. He was unmarked, but for a long red scar that curved from the top of his right ear down his cheek. His eyes were haunted, and he was just as pale as she was. Dark circles beneath his eyes made him look like he\u2019d been punched.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d Jaden said, his voice like ice.</p><p>Lyra turned to see Jaden watching the two of them with poorly disguised jealousy. She stepped away but could see the damage was already done.</p><p>If relations between he and Simon were going to improve, it wouldn\u2019t be anytime soon. She wondered how much convincing he needed to believe she wouldn\u2019t leave him. Then, right on the heels of that, she realized that she now had as long as it took.</p> <p>Despite everything, that knowledge gave her strength.</p><p>\u201cYou were lucky you got out when you did,\u201d Simon said, then closed his eyes and shook his head. He looked so defeated as he stood there, so unlike the man she\u2019d known for most of her life, that it scared her more than most things could. He had been there. If he thought there was no hope...</p><p>\u201cWas it the Ptolemy?\u201d Jaden asked. \u201cHave they moved in this quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPtolemy?\u201d Simon asked, looking puzzled. \u201cNo, those haven\u2019t been seen since that group attacked you. No, this is all Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all Eric?\u201d Lyra asked, her stomach doing a slow, sick roll. All those years suspecting her cousin would do something terrible. And now to have that come true... she should have done something, stopped him long ago somehow. But it was too late.</p><p>Simon laughed, a hollow, mirthless sound. \u201cEric Black is Alpha now. He challenged Dorien right after you two left, saying he should step down since his daughter\u2019s actions had ruined his credibility. Dorien had to accept. There was nothing anyone could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... I thought Dad left,\u201d Lyra murmured. She could never forget the sight of her father\u2019s back walking away from her for good.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get far. And, as you can see... it didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Lyra asked. \u201cHow could Dad not have beaten Eric? No one could beat my father! There wasn\u2019t another Alpha in the country who could take him on. This makes no sense, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison,\u201d Jaden said quietly, and all eyes turned to him. He looked up, met Simon\u2019s weary gaze. \u201cThat was where the Ptolemy came into all this. They provided some of that damned poison. Dorien would be a lot easier to beat if his wounds didn\u2019t heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Simon said. \u201cIt was some kind of poison, though I didn\u2019t know where it had come from. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Jaden said flatly, and Lyra thought of the long, thick scars on his back. He, of anyone, would know.</p><p>\u201cEric got you, too, I see.\u201d Lyra sighed. \u201cSimon, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI tried to help Dorien when I saw what was happening. It was the least I could do. I think it may have helped Eric decide not to kill your father outright, though. The crowd was not exactly... with him. Though he has enough supporters to stay in place, for now. I\u2019ve been taking care of Dorien all week, but the wounds aren\u2019t healing, and he got sicker and sicker. When I was asked to find you, I had to bring him with me. He kept asking for you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt the unwanted sting of tears and tried to blink them back. She was just starting to get her feet back under her, and she felt as though the world were tilting on its axis and trying its best to knock her off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you brought him to me,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do all we can for him,\u201d Lily added. \u201cAnd you, if you\u2019d like to stay. But as far as the affairs of your pack, if you\u2019re looking for someone to overthrow this Eric, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not something I want the Lilim involved with. We\u2019re just finding our footing as a dynasty, the Vampiric Council is watching us like hawks, and I\u2019m coming to find out that your kind likely wouldn\u2019t appreciate the meddling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Simon said, eyes widening. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to think that. And I wouldn\u2019t ask. It\u2019s not your job to fix what\u2019s happened. But like I said, I was asked to come find Lyra.\u201d He looked Lyra in the eyes, and she knew what was coming before he even said it.</p><p>Please no, she thought. Not now, after all this.</p><p>\u201cThe pack is restless, Lyra. Eric knows that they\u2019ll never see him as legitimate the way things went down, and he\u2019s a man who values his control. There was a big outcry over Dorien... and over you. So Eric sent me here. To ask you to come back and compete against him in the Proving, and settle this the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Jaden snarled, surprising Lyra with the heat in his voice. \u201cYou were there, you saw what they did. The whole damned pack turned their backs on her. And now they want her back because they don\u2019t like the alternative? They don\u2019t deserve her. They do deserve what they get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaden,\u201d Lyra said gently, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cI broke pack law. A big one, and a very old one. I\u2019m not sorry I did, but did you really expect that they would all just turn around and go against the law, not to mention their Alpha? It\u2019s the way the wolf pack operates. Strong leader, loyal followers. And with the Thorn, strict rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it didn\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for them either. I can understand the bloody cultural differences, Lyra, but you were banished and not a one spoke up. They have no right to ask you to come back and put your neck on the line for them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but she\u2019s our only chance. And if Eric did get that poison from the Ptolemy, then there\u2019s more trouble waiting in the wings. You want to condemn an entire pack because of hurt feelings, Jaden?\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s cool, disaffected tone surprised Lyra as much as the depth of Jaden\u2019s fury.</p><p>He rounded on Simon, fangs bared in his anger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to stand here and ask her to do this. You didn\u2019t see what it did to her. You didn\u2019t sit here and worry she was going to stay a zombie and never snap out of it. I blame every damn one of your pack, and Dorien most of all. This is his only daughter. He should have known to value her more than he did. Would he have come looking for her if everything had stayed the same?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s between him and Lyra,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to talk about it, if he ever wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare make light of this,\u201d Jaden growled, stepping closer to Simon. \u201cThis is Lyra\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And last I checked, you didn\u2019t run it.\u201d Simon was starting to bristle, and Lyra worried that in seconds she could have a full-blown fight on her hands. Both men had been pushed too far recently. And they both wanted very different things from her, which she had no idea how to reconcile.</p> <p>Lyra sighed, the weariness and depression she\u2019d just emerged from threatening to return and settle back around her like an old coat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t fight on my account,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve got to think through. Which means neither one of you is going to be satisfied right now.\u201d She looked at Jaden, who turned his attention back to her with a warning glint in his eye. It was amazing how quickly his calm strength had deserted him in the face of her old life. She knew he felt threatened. But right this second, she had more pressing concerns than assuaging his fears.</p><p>\u201cI want to see my father,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, though his eyes were troubled. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lyra shook her head gently. \u201cI need to see him alone.\u201d</p> <p>She saw the hurt and hated that she\u2019d caused it. But there were things she needed to say to her father in private, in case he never awakened. Things she only wanted him to hear.</p><p>\u201cSimon, let me show you to a room for the night. You look exhausted,\u201d Lily was saying as she led Simon away. He sounded grateful when he accepted, though he cast a long, searching look over his shoulder toward Lyra.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up if you want to talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAs will I,\u201d Jaden said. And despite the anger she could feel radiating off him, he leaned in and placed a soft, gentle kiss on her lips before turning and walking away, leaving in the direction Ty had gone. It had been meant as reassurance... and as a show of possession to the assembled.</p><p>Only Jaden, she thought ruefully, could make her feel flattered and pissed off at the same time.</p><p>Then she was alone, left to ascend the stairs in silence toward what she knew could be another good-bye. She didn\u2019t know exactly what she was going to do... she\u2019d been honest about that. But what she knew in her heart, and what she dreaded telling Jaden, was that no matter what, the pack was her family, they were in trouble...</p> <p>... and if they needed her, she would answer their call.</p><p>Chapter TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>YOU\u2019VE GOT TO RELAX, Jaden. She\u2019s not going anywhere tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jaden turned to glare at Ty, stopping in his tracks from where he\u2019d been pacing in Lily\u2019s parlor. He\u2019d been incredibly happy in this room not two hours ago. Now, he thought his head might burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to help him. Them. Miserable creatures, too timid to speak their minds and far too invested in playing follow the leader. How can she help them?\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned back on the couch, his silver eyes intent and unblinking. \u201cYou\u2019re right, in a way... but so was she when she said you still don\u2019t really understand the way a pack works. As monarchial as we are, there\u2019s a lot more open dissent among vampires than you\u2019ll ever find among wolves. They work as a unit, live as a unit. And ever since the humans hunted them nearly into the ground, they\u2019re very invested in protecting what they have. That includes not allowing their women to mate with men who can\u2019t give them children, and who might just take it upon themselves to either drain the pack of blood or drain a bunch of humans and then blame the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Jaden snapped. He hated it when Ty gave him one of his reasonable lectures. He was never in the mood. And Ty never cared.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t. Probably it made more sense a few centuries ago, when packs were smaller and a lot more exposed to danger. More vulnerable. So they need some better leaders who are willing to change things.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden glowered. \u201cLike Lyra, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds like many of them recognize it, even if they\u2019re not willing to openly advocate for it. That\u2019s a flaw in their system, Jaden, but one that can be corrected with time and encouragement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my woman risking her life.\u201d</p><p>That broke Ty\u2019s calm fa\u00e7ade a little. \u201cYes,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cAnd that. But you can\u2019t make the decision for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cI\u2019m going to bet Lyra would have a different opinion on that.\u201d</p><p>Jaden resumed pacing, his hair hanging in his face. \u201cTynan, Lyra is not bloody William Wallace of the Wolves, okay? She\u2019s not going to go leaping in there with her face painted blue howling about freedom. She\u2019s got a decision to make about whether to head back into that hornet\u2019s nest and do what she set out to do in the first place. But it\u2019s different now. She\u2019s got to worry about the Ptolemy, who have their fingers in this for sure. She\u2019s got to worry about her psycho cousin, and that little shit Simon, who I don\u2019t trust as far as I can throw, and she\u2019s got to worry about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ty supplied, taking a sip from a glass of bright red liquid that sat by his hand. He cocked his head at Jaden, giving him the appearance of a quizzical cat. \u201cTell me something, Jaden. You love this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jaden said, and the truth of it reverberated through the deepest reaches of his soul. \u201cWith everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you trained her, from what you told me, for just this thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were you confident in her ability before you were both tossed out on your ears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Jaden said, not sure where this was going.</p><p>\u201cThen why have you got your knickers in a twist so badly? If she decides to go back, with you, I\u2019m assuming, then nothing has changed except maybe you\u2019ll have a few more wolves on your list you want to beat the piss out of. If you know she can do it, then just... support her. Take it from a guy who\u2019s married to the descendant of a demon queen. Lily\u2019s got me beat in the scariness department, and I\u2019ve made my peace with it.\u201d</p><p>The truth came tumbling out before Jaden could think better of it.</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t love me? What if she gets hurt, or bloody dies, and just slips away from me? I can\u2019t lose her, Ty. Even if she never thinks of me as anything but a soft place to land, an acceptable fallback position, I can\u2019t. Because I love her... too much.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hawkish features softened with understanding, and Jaden felt the knots he was tied up in loosen, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cHave you said any of this to her? Hell, never mind, of course you haven\u2019t. Has she ever told you she loves you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaden said, stopping to shove his fingers through his hair. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve thought she might say something once or twice... but no. She cares, at least, or she wouldn\u2019t have finished the bond.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cFinished it? I didn\u2019t know there was more to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only half done before. Just on her end. I had to bite her... you know... among other things. But she\u2019s the one who knew how to do it. And she\u2019s the one who asked to seal it.\u201d He smiled, feeling like an idiot, ranting one minute, blushing like a schoolboy the next. Thankfully, Ty didn\u2019t press him for details.</p><p>\u201cIt was her idea to bind herself to you for the rest of her life, and you\u2019re worried she doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d Ty said blandly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I... yeah,\u201d Jaden replied, beginning to feel more than a little foolish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to think about that for a minute, dumbass, and then get back to me on how well it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Jaden, Lyra chose you. The first time, and the second time. She could have left. She could have told you to piss off. Instead, this woman who you have described to me as a prickly pain in the ass has thrown herself at you and demanded to be taken as your life mate. And you\u2019re worried she feels nothing.\u201d</p><p>Jaden paused. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fool.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed, but his smile was affectionate. \u201cYeah, but I went through it not that long ago. Just be careful not to hang on too tight, Jaden. You wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with her if she weren\u2019t strong. So let her be. She\u2019ll need you by her, whatever she decides.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed through Jaden, a cool and soothing balm to a soul that was ragged-edged with nerves and worry. Ty was right. He knew Ty was right. The truth had been there in Lyra\u2019s eye for a while now, not to mention in her voice, in the way she touched him. Still, he wanted to hear her say it. As soon as she felt comfortable doing it. And he planned to spend a lifetime\u2014lifetimes now, thanks to the bite he\u2019d given her\u2014making her so. They had time, if they could get through this mess with the Thorn.</p><p>Jaden sighed, stuffing his hands into his pockets. \u201cBut what if this is some kind of trap for her? What if the Ptolemy are waiting with Eric? I know her father\u2019s in some sort of coma, but this whole thing doesn\u2019t feel right. Too abrupt, too odd.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe Simon? Isn\u2019t he a friend of Lyra\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know. The little bugger has a thing for her, and she doesn\u2019t see it. Or she just ignores it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a separate issue,\u201d Ty said. \u201cTry to remember that. And I can already tell that Lyra isn\u2019t the sort of woman who would get this far with you and then change her mind. Wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaden said. Something about Simon and his story was niggling at him, though he couldn\u2019t put his finger on what. Probably some stupid little thing. He\u2019d go wait for Lyra, and then maybe his head would be clear enough to recall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, brother,\u201d Jaden said, meaning it. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always here for that, or a good kick in the ass, which works just as well sometimes,\u201d Ty replied with a smile. \u201cGo on. Her father\u2019s in bad shape. She\u2019ll be needing you, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Needing him. Hadn\u2019t she said as much?</p> <p>Jaden left the parlor and headed for the stairs, exponentially calmer and ready\u2014almost ready\u2014for whatever Lyra decided. And then, he would try like hell to support her as best he could... as long as she stayed by his side.</p><p>Lyra was still at Dorien\u2019s side as the sun began to rise.</p><p>She rested her head on the covers beside his arm, willing this poison to work its way out of his system. Jaden had poked his head in a while ago, noticeably calmer. She needed o remember to thank Ty for that, since she was sure it had been his influence. Jaden was quiet, but still waters ran deep. He was no exception.</p><p>He\u2019d said that Dorien would likely never look the same if he pulled through. Many of the scars would remain. Lyra didn\u2019t care... Dorien was her father, and despite what had happened, she still felt a terrible and deep love for him when she looked at his pale, almost fragile form laying so still in the bed.</p><p>He\u2019d also said that he would be waiting for her in their room, and that he was all right with whatever she decided as long as he could stand by her. Lyra smiled as she began to drift off, thinking that she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. What a gift, to have a man who didn\u2019t always feel the need to stand in front of her...</p> <p>\u201cLyra.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s voice slipped through her haze, and she lifted her head. He stood in the doorway of the room, the oddest expression on his face. It bespoke some incredibly strong emotion that might have been love... and was almost hate.</p><p>A chill slipped down Lyra\u2019s spine, though she admonished herself for it immediately. This was Simon, her best friend!</p><p>\u201cDid you come in to take a shift?\u201d she asked, standing to place her hands at the small of her back and stretch. \u201cI want to stay, but there\u2019s no change at all. He\u2019s quiet. And I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay,\u201d Simon said, not moving a muscle and continuing to stare at her. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo? Go where?\u201d Lyra asked, feeling the first tickle of fear at the back of her throat.</p> <p>He looked wrong somehow, like someone had taken her childhood friend and put someone else in his skin. Someone dark.</p><p>\u201cHome, of course,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWe have a deal, Arsin\u00f6e and I. We\u2019d already agreed that if she helped me take Alpha, she\u2019d have the full use of the pack and all its resources. But once she figured out Jaden was in town, she sweetened the pot a little: I give her Jaden, I get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d she murmured, trying to get her head around what was coming out of Simon\u2019s mouth. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like you didn\u2019t want me,\u201d Simon replied, his voice queerly flat. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do, beg you? You were what I wanted. You, and to get the hell out of that Podunk town. Remember when we were sixteen and we used to talk about going to Europe, checking out the Thorn\u2019s ancestral grounds, poking around all of the old lore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cIt was a great dream, Simon. We could still do it. But things got in the way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, with you they always seem to. School, playing werewolf ice princess, and then that cat vamp,\u201d he spat in disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m willing to overlook that half-mark you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He must have seen her surprise, because he smirked. \u201cYou and your cousin aren\u2019t the only ones who can access the histories, you know. I can deal with the mark. I can deal with the fact that you screwed him. But trust me, I\u2019ll enjoy giving him to Arsin\u00f6e. She\u2019s got a lot of plans for him. When they\u2019re finished, I\u2019m thinking that mark may fade right away. Jaden certainly won\u2019t be around to get in the way anymore.\u201d</p><p>As she watched him, listened to the unfamiliar coldness coming from her childhood friend, Lyra felt something inside start to ache.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Simon. I loved you. We were friends. Why would you do this to me? To the pack? To my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you how I felt. I wanted out. I wanted more than I was ever going to get pigeonholed into a second-rate position in the Thorn. If you haven\u2019t noticed, Lyra, there\u2019s not much room for upward mobility in our little pack. My bloodlines were only good enough for your father when he was getting desperate. You should have seen the faces when I won the Proving,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cThe Dales weren\u2019t supposed to be Alpha material. Guess they were wrong. But if it makes you feel any better, this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d consented to marry me when Dorien tried to force it, I could have been Alpha and avoided all of this. I still would have taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then handed us over to the Ptolemy,\u201d Lyra said, the ill feeling in her stomach intensifying until she thought she would keel over from it. \u201cGods, Simon, what are you doing? Do you know what they do to their servants? What they\u2019ll do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Simon said. \u201cTo the others, maybe, but not me.\u201d</p><p>Lyra could only stare at him for a moment, astounded that she hadn\u2019t seen this side of Simon before. Either it hadn\u2019t been there until recently, or he\u2019d just hidden it away until presented with the right opportunity. Hidden it under a mask she\u2019d believed in.</p><p>\u201cSo everything you told me was a lie,\u201d she said, her voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cMy father... Eric...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if you thought they were going to postpone the damned Proving just because princess Lyra got booted, you\u2019re wrong. It was two nights ago. Didn\u2019t you notice the full moon? No, never mind, you were probably too busy pouting and pretending your whole fucking life was over. And your pathetic father, so surprised to see me win. Actually said he was proud of me. Must have been a new feeling for him.\u201d His voice turned vicious, ugly. And unrecognizable as the boy she\u2019d once known.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Simon shrugged, his eyes feral. \u201cI could have done it myself. Not that the Blacks ever gave my family credit for anything. She sees it. My\u2014our\u2014new queen. She was looking for strength, not just my damn pedigree. I\u2019ve waited my whole life to be first in line, to get what I wanted instead of just the scraps you and your family left behind. And you know what? It was easy for me. A couple of Ptolemy in the woods for the Proving to clear the way, a little of Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s poison for Daddy, and I\u2019m right where I belong.\u201d His lip curled. \u201cWhere you could have been, if you had the guts to do what it takes to get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt sick. Simon\u2019s words had sliced her open as effectively as any knife.</p><p>\u201cAnd Eric? Was he even helping you?\u201d</p><p>At that, Simon actually laughed. \u201cLike I needed a Black to take over? To try and push me out of the way? No, Lyra. You\u2019re not listening. You never did. I did this. Your prick cousin was so upset at the Proving I thought he was going to sit right down and bawl. I would have liked that, actually. I thought about killing him, but Arsin\u00f6e likes the look of him, gods know why, so he\u2019s being... taught to obey. He likes rules so much, he\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d Simon smiled, and it was a horrible thing. \u201cYou bought all the crap I told you about him, didn\u2019t you? I whispered in a lot of ears, and he never knew where it came from. Dumbass. Those stories must have just killed that prude every time he heard one. The women, and the kinky death sex. I had a lot of fun with that.\u201d</p><p>Every revelation was a new punch in the gut, and there was no question Simon was enjoying her reaction. That he was preening over it.</p><p>\u201cYou know the only twisted thing about Eric is that he\u2019s probably still a virgin,\u201d Simon snorted. \u201cHe had a stick up his ass, but he was never any danger to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Lyra said, taking a step back. Her heart began to pump more quickly, adrenaline rushing through her system. \u201cWere you ever who I thought you were, Simon?\u201d It infuriated her and made her feel so incredibly sad at the same time. Especially because in Simon\u2019s sad smile, she saw a ghost of the boy she\u2019d adored.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you only saw who you wanted to see. Nobody ever really saw me. I tried to run with the Shades, but I couldn\u2019t be what they wanted either. I\u2019ve got so much anger in me, Lyra.\u201d His face twisted into something almost unrecognizable. \u201cSo much anger. I don\u2019t even know where it comes from. But you can make me feel better. You always do. Even when you\u2019re being a selfish bitch.\u201d He pulled something thin and silver from his pocket, and Lyra recognized it immediately: one of the collars the Ptolemy had used on their cats to keep them animal.</p><p>He would use it on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got another for Jaden, and a sack to throw him in. Pretty fitting for vamp trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d Lyra said slowly, moving away from the chair toward him. \u201cYou know I\u2019m never going to accept this. I\u2019m going to fight you tooth and nail, fang and claw, until one of us kills the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Simon said confidently. \u201cYou\u2019ll submit. Arsin\u00f6e\u2019s going to help me with that too. As long as I give her Jaden. It\u2019s amazing, how bad she wants this cat. The one downstairs, too, but she\u2019s waiting on him. Said one at a time is less conspicuous.\u201d</p><p>Lyra glanced at her father, still and unconscious, and then looked back up at the monster who had fooled her for so many years. Horror and sadness faded, consumed by a black rage unlike anything she\u2019d ever known. It looked as though she would be having her Proving here and now. And with the sun just breaking over the horizon, she would be doing it just as she\u2019d once wanted: on her own.</p><p>Except now she found herself wishing, desperately, that Jaden were by her side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter TWENTY-SIX</p><p>JADEN DRIFTED, as he always did when the sun rose, in a place somewhere between sleep and waking. As the sun went higher, he would sink deeper, sometimes dreaming, sometimes simply existing in his own darkness before the moon rose again.</p><p>His body relaxed as his mind slipped away, peacefully floating.</p><p>Then the noises began.</p> <p>He heard them from far away at first. A shout. The sounds of feet moving, scuffling. A snarl. Lyra\u2019s voice crying out.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s voice.</p><p>Jaden struggled upward, fighting the currents his body had become accustomed to for so many years. He clung to his consciousness by a thin thread, using it to pull himself out of the dark. He strained, forcing it long after he should have let go\u2014the sun had to be in the sky by now. Beads of sweat appeared on his brow... he could feel each cool bead form and roll.</p><p>And slowly, the voices grew louder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never let you take me, you son of a bitch!\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flew open in the darkness of his room. Jaden tried to get out of bed, but his movements were sluggish, like trying to walk through molasses. Still, he managed to get one foot down, then the other, and push onto his feet. He stood there for a moment, swaying, his body feeling as though it weighed a thousand pounds.</p><p>There was a crash, then a masculine shout.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me, Lyra! There\u2019s no one here to hear you!\u201d</p><p>Simon.</p><p>Anger sparked and began to work its way though his blood like wildfire, warming limbs cold and heavy with sleep. He righted himself and began to move more quickly. Still, he opened the door to his room cautiously. There weren\u2019t many windows here, only at the end of the hall, but he would have to be careful not to step into a pool of sunlight.</p><p>Sunlight. How the hell was he even up?</p> <p>Jaden didn\u2019t have time to ponder. There was another crash on the floor below. And as he thought of her, Jaden could feel the adrenaline pumping through Lyra\u2019s veins, taste the metallic tang of fear on his own tongue. She was scared for her life.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me do this, Simon!\u201d</p><p>Laughter. \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me, Lyra. Your father was right. You didn\u2019t have a prayer against the rest of us. And especially not me. I know you too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that if you have a choice between getting in this collar or me taking your father\u2019s life, you\u2019ll take the collar.\u201d</p><p>Then Jaden was running, his feet barely touching the floor as he leaped down the stairs, barely registering the light streaming in the windows on the east side, the halls illuminated in a way his eyes had not seen in well over two hundred years.</p><p>All he could think of was Lyra. And as though she had felt him thinking of her, she cried out his name.</p><p>\u201cJaden! Can you hear me? Help me!\u201d</p> <p>He burst into the room as Simon was circling her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cLike calling a vampire for help after sunrise is going to do anything for you. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, actually,\u201d Jaden growled, and both heads whipped toward him at once. Jaden saw immediately what was happening. A dagger, long and smeared with crimson, extended from Simon\u2019s hand. And Lyra was trying to keep between Simon and her father.</p><p>The relief on her beautiful face was all he needed to see. Though the sheer terror on Simon\u2019s was a bonus.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to take him out, or shall I?\u201d Jaden asked.</p><p>Lyra sank to the floor, and he finally noticed the spreading red stain on her shirt. She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take it.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s final seconds were consumed with a single sight: a pair of feral cat\u2019s eyes lighting with a bloodlust so dark and elemental that he knew there would be no defense against it. He flung up his hands and screamed as the cat leaped.</p><p>And Simon Dale knew no more.</p><p>It seemed to take days instead of hours, but by late afternoon, Lyra stood in the place she\u2019d never thought she would see again: home. And in the basement where Jaden had spent so many days was Eric Black, tied and beaten, but with a fire in his eyes that told her he\u2019d be all right.</p><p>Lyra quickly severed the bonds holding him, seeing the shimmer of silver in the rope. A clever way to hold a wolf, but easily undone with help, she thought, wincing only a little at the sharp pain in her side where Simon\u2019s poison-dipped blade had pierced her. The wound had been cleaned and bandaged as best she could, but it burned. Jaden had assured her it would subside before long.</p><p>He had slipped back upstairs, into the dark and shuttered house, once he\u2019d checked the rest of the basement. Lyra could barely think of him without her heart feeling like it might burst out of her chest. When she\u2019d needed him most, he had been there. He\u2019d saved her.</p><p>And strangely enough, having been saved didn\u2019t piss her off at all. It made her feel safe, secure... loved.</p><p>The thought of having a man to count on, to have her back in a fight, turned out not to be so hard to swallow after all.</p><p>And the fact that he\u2019d asked, very politely, if he could take Simon out didn\u2019t hurt. The memory, despite the terror she\u2019d felt at the time, made her smile. Only Jaden would decide to get proper at a time like that.</p><p>Gods, she loved him. And she would have told him already, if he hadn\u2019t been busy alternating between plotting to take out the entire house of Ptolemy and marveling at the sunshine the entire way here. His wonder at the first touch of light on his skin in centuries had been a precious gift to see.</p><p>The poem had been right, though she\u2019d had to remind him. Night and day are thine. She\u2019d gotten his life span. He\u2019d gotten her ability to walk in the sun.</p><p>They were stuck with each other now, both officially freaks of nature, even for the world of night. And she couldn\u2019t have been happier.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Lyra asked Eric as she pulled the gag out of his mouth. He looked at her warily as he flexed and moved muscles that had to be stiff and sore from being bound.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I actually preferred the days. This is like storage. At least it\u2019s quiet and I\u2019m not in that damned collar. Nights were...\u201d He trailed off, then shook his head. \u201cDid you kill Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, Jaden did.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cGood.\u201d He stood up, and Lyra watched him, realizing she didn\u2019t really know her cousin at all. She\u2019d spent all these years believing the worst of him, things that weren\u2019t remotely true of anyone in the pack except, perhaps, Simon himself. The thought of him made her nauseous. The thought of how long he\u2019d deceived her made her feel worse. But she knew that eventually she would mourn, if only for the idealistic dreamer of a child he\u2019d once been.</p><p>\u201cI take back what I said about your man,\u201d Eric said, looking over his shoulder at her. \u201cI only had a couple nights of the Ptolemy. He had, what, a couple hundred years? No thank you.\u201d He paused, then looked away. \u201cI was wrong. Blind. You were never the one who didn\u2019t deserve to be here.\u201d</p><p>It was a big admission. And Lyra felt she owed him one in return.</p><p>\u201cAnd I... apologize. For all the terrible things I said about you,\u201d Lyra said. He looked back at her sharply, as though he thought he hadn\u2019t heard her right. She nodded. \u201cI bought a line of bull without knowing you. That\u2019s on me. Maybe we\u2019ll get along, maybe we won\u2019t, but I\u2019ll make that up to you, Eric, if I can. If you\u2019ll let me. You\u2019re my blood. I\u2019d like to get to know you as my cousin instead of just a rival.\u201d</p><p>The flicker of surprise and cautious pleasure on his face told her she\u2019d done the right thing. He might never be her cup of tea... but then, Mr. Law and Order might not be so bad either. At least now, she would have the opportunity to find out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think... after all this... I\u2019m going to have to reassess some things. I hope you\u2019ll come back to us, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>Lyra found she didn\u2019t have an answer for that. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Come on,\u201d she said. \u201cJaden\u2019s upstairs looking for Arsin\u00f6e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t find her,\u201d Eric replied, following her up the stairs into the kitchen. \u201cThe woman has some serious protection around her. She wasn\u2019t spending her days in town. None of them were. Simon made a big deal out of the fact that he\u2019d hooked a big dynasty to help give the pack a leg up. I don\u2019t think the pack was too nuts about it. Or him. He started to get seriously strange after you... after I, um...\u201d</p><p>Lyra raised an eyebrow. That, he was perfectly allowed to feel like an ass about. Forever.</p><p>\u201cYou know you have my apology. And for what it\u2019s worth,\u201d Eric said quietly, \u201cit turns out the pack wasn\u2019t too pleased about that either. You should know that. They followed the law, but invoking it hasn\u2019t exactly made me popular.\u201d</p><p>Jaden reentered the kitchen, silent and graceful as a ghost. He didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he growled. \u201cI thought this would be it. I could put a stake in her and end one very big problem for our kind.\u201d</p><p>Eric stared at Jaden for a moment, as though only just realizing something. \u201cYou\u2019re out in the day how, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Jaden replied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cThough... if she\u2019s as powerful as you say, killing her might create more problems than it solves. Especially because everyone\u2019s going to suspect it was someone attached to your dynasty.\u201d</p><p>Jaden shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Not right now. All that matters today is that she won\u2019t be coming back here. The woman\u2019s got a sixth sense about places where her neck\u2019s at risk.\u201d</p><p>Eric looked between them, and Lyra realized how beat he looked. \u201cGods, Eric, I wasn\u2019t thinking. Go home. Though if you\u2019d stop and tell Gerry about Dad, that would help. Jaden and I will be over to tell him everything. Soon.\u201d</p><p>He looked relieved, and exhausted. \u201cI can do that. And... thanks. To both of you. I didn\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d He stopped, then smiled. At that moment Lyra recognized a young version of her father, handsome as sin with that smile. Maybe now he would do it more often. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust thanks,\u201d he finished, and made a point of shaking each of their hands before vanishing through the door, leaving Jaden and Lyra alone in the darkened kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry she wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Lyra said. She loved the way he looked, so darkly romantic. She just wished she could remove some of the care from his eyes. But when he turned them on her, glowing a soft blue in the semidarkness, she changed her mind. All of that feeling\u2014relief, care, longing, and most of all, love\u2014was for her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wish to change that precious gift.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked softly, moving toward her.</p><p>Lyra nodded, stepping forward as well and sliding into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, so far I\u2019ve gotten rid of the biggest psychopath in the pack of the Thorn and seen the sun for the first time in a couple hundred years. Also, I have my arms around the woman I love, so... not bad for a day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, you know,\u201d Lyra said. Jaden went very still, and the hope in his eyes tugged at her heart. He\u2019d been through so much. Lost so much. Lyra felt humbled that he was still capable of this kind of love, that he would give it to her. Nothing else could be nearly so important. She\u2019d been so worried about shaping her own destiny she\u2019d nearly missed the best parts that fate had sent her.</p> <p>She just wished it hadn\u2019t taken her so long to figure it out. But she would spend the rest of her life appreciating it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear that another thousand or so times, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. Lyra smiled and lifted her mouth to his for a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you. I love you,\u201d she said, punctuating each proclamation with a kiss. \u201cThere\u2019s a start for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start,\u201d Jaden murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have now, isn\u2019t it? The only question, love, is where you want to go from here.\u201d</p><p>She knew she would need to think that through. That they would need to talk about what each of them wanted and needed. Even if she was allowed to return here, would she want to? Lyra no longer knew. There would be a lot to sort through, a lot of things that needed to be said between her and her father regardless. But none of that mattered right now... because she had the most important thing right here in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cas long as you\u2019re with me. How\u2019s that for a start?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Jaden said with a slow smile. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to make our home somewhere, eventually.\u201d</p><p>Lyra pulled him close, her mouth a breath away from his, and told him what was in her heart.</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One month later</p><p>THE SLEEK GRAY WOLF stood in the middle of the circle, her final combatant stumbling away before flopping on the ground. From her teeth dangled a moonstone pendant on a chain, her family talisman, and the treasure to be sought beneath the full moon of the Proving. Her breath came in short, quick pants, adrenaline rushing through her system as the crowd of familiar faces erupted in wild howls all around her.</p><p>It was over. She\u2019d won.</p><p>Lyra shifted, dashing on long legs into the embrace of her dark-haired mate, who lifted her up and spun her around, a huge smile on his beautiful vampire\u2019s face before letting her father have a turn. Dorien Black\u2019s eyes glowed gold in the night, beaming with pride. Things had changed between them since his brush with death. A little sadder. A great deal sweeter. And far less concerned with tradition when it was clear there was a better way.</p> <p>\u201cI still owe you a boon,\u201d Dorien said, reluctantly letting go of his daughter so that she could return to Jaden. \u201cName it, boy. I owe you more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked up at her mate, a smile curving her lips. She\u2019d told Jaden to expect this. And despite the warmth with which her pack had accepted him, a thing that still touched her deeply after all that had happened, she knew that Jaden\u2019s request would make some waves. Good ones, she hoped. It was long past time for the old divisions to die.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve something in mind, actually,\u201d Jaden said, his eyes glittering in the dark. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t really the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Dorien blustered. \u201cNo better time and place than now. I\u2019ve learned that the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jaden said, exchanging a glance with Lyra, \u201cremember why we pretended I was here the first time? Ties between the Thorn and the Lilim and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yes,\u201d Dorien said, finally sounding wary. Lyra laughed softly. This was only the beginning. She wasn\u2019t the only one who was interested in shaking things up in the world of night, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI know someone who\u2019s looking for a few good, strong guards,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cSo tell me... which of your men and women might be interested in spending some time with a dynasty of vampire cats?\u201d</p><p>Beneath the full moon, the Thorn celebrated the selection of their new Second and future Alpha. And Lyra Black, the leaping cats and wolves of her mate\u2019s mark bared proudly, danced in the arms of the vampire she loved. </p> </body></html>"]
