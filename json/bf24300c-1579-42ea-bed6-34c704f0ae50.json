The torrential downpour continued with relentless fury, slamming ice-cold bullets against her skin and turning the night-dark of the forest impenetrable. Ducking her head, she spoke into the waterproof microphone attached to the sodden collar of her black T-shirt. \u201cDo you have him in your sights?\u201d</p><p>The voice that came back was deep, familiar, and, at that instant, lethally focused. \u201cNorthwest, half a mile. I\u2019m coming your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorthwest, half a mile,\u201d she repeated to ensure they were both on the same page. Changeling hearing was incredibly acute, but the rain was savage, drumming against her skull until even the high-tech receiver she\u2019d tucked into her ear buzzed with noise.</p> <p>\u201cIndy, be careful. He\u2019s functioning on the level of a feral wolf.\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstances, she\u2019d have snarled at him for using that ridiculous nickname. Tonight, she was too worried. \u201cThat goes double for you. He hurt you in that first tangle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a flesh wound. I\u2019m going quiet now.\u201d</p><p>Slicking back her hair, she took a deep breath of the watery air and began to stalk toward their prey. Her fellow hunter was right\u2014a pincer maneuver was their best bet of taking Joshua down without damage. Indigo\u2019s gut clenched, pain blooming in her heart. She didn\u2019t want to have to hurt him. Neither did the tracker on the boy\u2019s trail\u2014the reason why the bigger, stronger wolf had been injured in the earlier clash.</p><p>But he\u2019d have to if they couldn\u2019t bring Joshua back from the edge; the boy was so lost in anguish and torment that he\u2019d given in to his wolf. And the wolf, young and out of control, had taken those emotions and turned them into rage. Joshua was now a threat to the pack. But he was also their own. They\u2019d bleed, they\u2019d drown in this endless rain, but they would not execute him until they\u2019d exhausted every other option.</p> <p>A branch raked across her cheek when she didn\u2019t move fast enough in the stormy weather.</p><p>Sharp. Iron. Blood.</p><p>Indigo swore low under her breath. Joshua would catch her scent if she wasn\u2019t careful. Turning her face up to the rain, she let it wash away the blood from the cut. But it was still too bright, too unmistakable a scent. Wincing\u2014their healer would strip her hide for this\u2014she went to the earth and slathered mud over the superficial injury. The scent dulled, became sodden with earth.</p><p>It would do. Joshua was so far gone that he wouldn\u2019t detect the subtle undertone that remained.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d It was a soundless whisper as she stalked through the rain-lashed night. Joshua hadn\u2019t taken a life yet, hadn\u2019t killed or maimed. He could be brought back\u2014if his pain, the vivid, overwhelming pain of a young male on the cusp of adulthood, allowed him to return.</p><p>A slashing wind . . . bringing with it the scent of her prey. Indigo stepped up her pace, trusting the eyes of the wolf that was her other half, its vision stronger in the dark. She was gaining on the scent when a wolf\u2019s enraged howl split the air.</p> <p>Growls, the sickening clash of teeth, more iron in the air.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Pushing her speed to dangerous levels, she jumped over fallen logs and new-made streams of mud and water without really seeing them, heading toward the scene of the fight. It took her maybe twenty seconds and a lifetime.</p><p>Lightning flashed the instant she reached the small clearing where they fought, and she saw them framed against the electric-dark sky, two changelings in full wolf form, locked in combat. They fell to earth as the lightning died, but she could still see them, her eyes tracking with lethal purpose.</p><p>The tracker, the hunter, was bigger, his normally stunning silver-colored fur sodden almost black, but it was the smaller wolf, his pelt a reddish hue, who was winning\u2014because the hunter was holding back, trying not to kill. Aware her drenched clothing would make stripping difficult, Indigo shifted as she was. It was a searing pain and an agonizing joy, her clothes disintegrating off her, her body turning into a shower of light before forming into a sleek wolf with a body built for running.</p><p>She jumped into the fight just as the red wolf\u2014Joshua\u2014slashed a line into his opponent\u2019s side. The bigger wolf gripped the teenager\u2019s neck. He could\u2019ve killed then, as he could have earlier, but he was attempting only to subdue. Joshua was too far gone to listen; he reached out, trying to go for the hunter\u2019s belly. Teeth bared, Indigo leaped. Her paws came down on the smaller wolf, holding his struggling, snarling body to the earth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they stood there, holding the violent wolf down, refusing to let him go over that final destructive edge. The hunter\u2019s eyes met hers. A brilliant copper in his wolf form, they were so unusual she\u2019d never seen the like in any other wolf, changeling or feral. She glimpsed a piercing intelligence in that gaze, one that many people missed because he laughed so easily, charmed with such open wickedness.</p><p>Most in the SnowDancer pack didn\u2019t even realize he was their tracker, able to trace rogue wolves through snow, wind, and, tonight, endless rain. And though it was not their practice to call him Hunter, he was that, too, charged with executing those they could not save. But Joshua understood who it was he faced. Because he went silent at long last, his body limp beneath theirs.</p><p>Indigo released her grip with care, but he didn\u2019t spring up, even when the larger wolf let go. Worried, she shifted back into human form, her hair plastered to her naked back between one instant and the next. The tracker stood guard next to her, his fur rubbing wet against her skin.</p> <p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she said, leaning down to speak to the boy, determined to bring him back from his wolf. \u201cYour sister is alive. We got her to the infirmary in time.\u201d</p><p>No recognition in those dark yellow eyes, but Indigo wasn\u2019t a SnowDancer lieutenant because she gave up easily. \u201cShe\u2019s asking for you, so you better snap out of it and get up.\u201d She put every ounce of her dominance in her next command. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>A blink from the wolf, a cocked head. As Indigo watched, he rose shakily to his feet. When she reached for him, he lowered his head, whimpering. \u201cShh,\u201d she said, gripping his muzzle and staring straight into those wolf-bright eyes. His gaze slid away. Joshua was too young, too submissive in comparison to her strength, to challenge her in that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d Indigo said, ensuring he heard the truth in her words, in the way she held him\u2014firm, but not in a grip that would cause pain. \u201cBut I need you to become human.\u201d</p><p>Still no eye contact. But he heard her. Because the next instant, the air filled with sparks of light, and a split second after that, a young male barely past his fourteenth birthday was kneeling naked on the earth, his face drawn. \u201cIs she really okay?\u201d It was a rasp, the wolf in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was meant to be watching her, except I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t at fault.\u201d She put her fingers on his jaw, anchoring him with touch, with Pack. \u201cIt was a rockfall\u2014nothing you could\u2019ve done. She\u2019s got a broken arm, two broken ribs, and a pretty cool scar on her eyebrow that she\u2019s already showing off like a peacock.\u201d</p><p>The recital of injuries seemed to stabilize Joshua. \u201cThat sounds like her.\u201d A wavering smile, a quick, wary glimpse up at her before he dropped his gaze.</p><p>Smiling\u2014because if he was scared about the consequences of his actions, he was back\u2014Indigo gave in to her relief and nipped the pup sharply on the ear. He cried out. Then buried his face in her neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand down his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. But if you ever do this again, I\u2019ll strip your hide and use it to make new sofa cushions. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Another shaky smile, a quick nod. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d He swallowed, turned to look at the tracker. \u201cThanks for not killing me. I\u2019m sorry I made you come out in the rain.\u201d</p><p>The huge wolf beside Indigo, its tail raised in a gesture of dominance, closed its very dangerous teeth around the boy\u2019s throat. Joshua stayed immobile, quiescent, until the tracker let go. Apology accepted.</p><p>Making a futile effort to shake the rain from her hair, Indigo looked at the boy. \u201cI don\u2019t want you turning wolf for one week.\u201d When he looked shattered, she touched his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not punishment. You went too close to the edge tonight. No use taking chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah.\u201d A pause, a whisper of shame in his eyes. \u201cThe wolf\u2019s getting hard to control. Like I\u2019m a kid again.\u201d</p><p>That, Indigo thought, explained his irrational response to his sister\u2019s accident. She made a mental note to kick some ass on the heels of that thought. Adolescents and young teens did occasionally have control issues\u2014Joshua\u2019s teachers should\u2019ve picked up the signs. \u201cIt happens sometimes,\u201d she said to him, keeping her tone calm and matter-of-fact. \u201cDid to me when I was around your age, so it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. You come directly to me if you feel the wolf taking over again.\u201d She shifted into her other form as he nodded, his relief obvious.</p><p>The journey home to the den\u2014a huge network of tunnels hidden deep underground in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, out of sight of enemy eyes\u2014was quiet, the rain letting up about ten minutes after they began. A human might\u2019ve slipped and fallen a hundred times on the slippery terrain, but the wolf was sure-footed, its paws designed for increased stability\u2014and it found the easiest route for Joshua.</p><p>Indigo, with the tracker taking position behind the boy, herded Joshua all the way to the wide-open door in the side of what would otherwise appear to be a sheer rock face\u2014where his shaken mother was waiting with another wolf, a silver-gold one with eyes of such pale, pale blue, they were almost ice.</p><p>The boy fell to his knees in front of the SnowDancer alpha.</p><p>Indigo and the tracker backed away, their task complete. The pup was safe\u2014and would be taken care of. Now they needed to run off some of the strain of tonight. She\u2019d really thought they\u2019d have to kill Joshua. The boy had been all but insane when they\u2019d managed to corner him earlier. Glancing toward her companion at the memory\u2014the larger wolf having kept pace with ease\u2014she realized he was bleeding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She came to a halt with a snarl. He stopped only a step later, circling back to nudge her nose with his. Shifting into human form, she bent over him, pushing back her rain-wet hair. \u201cYou need to see Lara.\u201d Their healer would be better able to check his wounds, ensure they weren\u2019t serious.</p><p>The wolf nipped at her jaw, growling low in his throat. She pushed him away. \u201cDon\u2019t make me pull rank on you.\u201d Though to be honest, she wasn\u2019t sure she could\u2014and that disturbed both woman and wolf. He occupied an odd space in their hierarchy. Younger than her, he wasn\u2019t a lieutenant, but he reported directly and only to their alpha. And as their tracker, his skills were critical to the safety and well-being of the pack.</p><p>Another growl, another nip\u2014this one on her shoulder.</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cWatch it or I\u2019ll nip that nose right off.\u201d</p><p>He made a growling sound of disagreement, his canines flashing.</p><p>Reaching out, she tapped him sharply on the muzzle. \u201cWe\u2019re heading back right now.\u201d</p><p>Color under her hands, the wolf with fur the distinctive color of silver-birch bark shifting into a human with lake blue eyes and rain-slick hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He was on her before she knew it, cupping her face in his hands, his mouth on hers.</p><p>The caress was hot, hard, a slamming fist that held her motionless. And then . . . an inferno punching through her body, making her tangle her hand in that thick brown hair, tug back his head. \u201cWhat,\u201d she said on a gasping breath, \u201care you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it\u2019d be obvious.\u201d Laughter in his eyes, the lake seared by sunshine as his thumbs stroked over her cheekbones. \u201cI want to lick you up right now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take it personally. \u201cYou\u2019re high on adrenaline from the hunt.\u201d Pushing off his hands, she angled her head. \u201cAnd loss of blood.\u201d It ran in a clean, water-diluted line down his side. \u201cYou definitely need stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He kissed her again, pushing her down to the earth.</p><p>This time, she didn\u2019t back away at once. And got the full impact of the kiss . . . and of the rigid arousal nudging at the sensitive dip of her abdomen. Her heartbeat accelerated, startling her enough that she bit hard at his lip. \u201cIt\u2019s cold down here.\u201d Though the snow had melted away in this part of the range, the Sierra Nevada retained the chill kiss of winter even in the blush of spring.</p><p>A repentant look. She found herself on top an instant later. Still being kissed. Groaning at the stubborn wolf\u2014who could kiss so insanely well that she was tempted to let him have at it\u2014she pushed at his shoulders. \u201cGet up before you die of blood loss, you lunatic.\u201d</p><p>A scowl. And then Drew kissed her again.</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Andrew heard Indigo moan, felt her body soften a delicious fraction before the lieutenant got herself under control. Pushing off his shoulders, she rolled away to crouch beside him on the forest floor, her namesake eyes bright with the wolf\u2019s night-glow gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you for slobbering over me that one time. But do it again and I\u2019ll put you on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already there.\u201d He sat up. \u201cAnd I seem to recall you slobbering back.\u201d Her tongue had been a sleek, fast dart in his mouth before that damn self-discipline of hers had kicked in. \u201cWant to do it some more?\u201d</p><p>She pushed back her hair. \u201cI give up. Stay here. Die of blood loss. I\u2019m going to go slip into a nice warm bath and eat the slice of New York cheesecake I bribed Lucy to sneak up to me past the ravaging hordes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have cheesecake?\u201d He prowled over to crouch by her. It was hard, so fucking hard, to pretend this was only a game, to play with her, when all he wanted to do was bury his face in her neck and just . . . be. \u201cWill you share if I come back?\u201d</p><p>A low feminine growl that probably would\u2019ve sent most men packing. \u201cAre you trying to blackmail me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I do that?\u201d Needing to touch her, he pressed his lips to the skin of her shoulder.</p><p>She didn\u2019t push him away\u2014a high-ranking female allowing skin privileges to a male she thought needed the anchor. He didn\u2019t want to be just another male, just another wolf. But if it would get him near her, then he\u2019d take it . . . for now.</p> <p>\u201cIndy.\u201d Shifting so that he was behind her, he buried his nose in her neck, drawing deep and smiling in savage satisfaction when he scented her alone. No male. She didn\u2019t have a lover she\u2019d accepted to that level. He\u2019d already known that, but it was good to have the confirmation. Because he\u2019d made his decision\u2014to stop circling and fight for what he wanted.</p><p>And he wanted Indigo.</p><p>Smart, dangerous, fascinating Indigo.</p><p>Reaching back, she tugged at his hair. \u201cNo cheesecake unless you stop using that stupid nickname.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her fingers. Got a sigh. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d She shifted under his hands, a beautiful deep gray wolf with eyes that were a startling burnished gold.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he shifted beside her and let her lead them back. Once in the den, she bullied him to the healer and stood there snarling low in her throat until he shifted into human form and let Lara poke and prod at him. Only when Indigo was certain he was behaving did she leave.</p><p>His joy dimmed.</p><p>He could still feel her skin, silky and wet against his, still taste the wild heat of her mouth. God, but he craved the right to have her. Except that she was a dominant female, the highest-ranking woman in the pack, and he was a male whose dominance level was ambiguous\u2014an unusual situation in a wolf pack, but his work for their alpha depended on him being seen as outside the hierarchy. However, no matter how you cut it, she outranked him; she\u2019d been lieutenant for years. Added to that, she was four years older.</p><p>Frustrated at his thoughts, he moped his way back to his rooms when Lara released him, barely noticing the flesh-colored thin-skin bandage the healer had slapped on his side. He was just getting out of the shower when he heard the door to his room open. Indigo\u2019s scent followed a moment later. Rubbing haphazardly at his hair, he wrapped the towel around his waist and walked out to find her sitting cross-legged on his bed, her back to the wall, a huge slice of cheesecake on the saucer she had in her hand.</p><p>She was here. In his territory.</p><p>Leaning against the bathroom doorway, he just watched her. Her skin was flushed with heat, so she\u2019d taken that bath. And the hair she usually tied up in a ponytail lay sleek and damp down the back of her white T-shirt. Her soft black pajama pants hid the long length of her legs, but Andrew had memorized every lithely muscled inch of her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some or not?\u201d She lifted the fork.</p><p>Not stupid enough to refuse, he shot her a smile deliberately laced with pure wickedness. \u201cLet me put on some clothes. Unless you want me naked?\u201d</p><p>A feminine snort. \u201cSeen it, felt it, don\u2019t want to buy the T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>The insult cut. He was male, and he wanted her until he could hardly see straight. But he couldn\u2019t let her know that, not when she already held all the cards, so he shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201d And dropped the towel.</p><p>Indigo almost choked on her cheesecake as Drew walked over to the bureau on the other side of the room. Oh . . . my. Her eyes couldn\u2019t seem to move off his butt. Hard and muscled and bitable. Definitely bitable.</p><p>It was all she could do not to moan when he pulled a pair of sweats over that beautiful golden skin, those taut muscles. About to ask him to take the thing off, she realized exactly who it was she was ogling. What was wrong with her? Horrified, she stabbed the fork into the cheesecake and stuffed a big gob into her mouth just as Drew turned.</p><p>There was no longer any humor on his face, and suddenly, she saw not Riley\u2019s younger brother, not the laughing, teasing male who could charm every female in the den to get what he wanted, but the tracker who\u2019d hunted down his prey in a storm so harsh even the feral wolves had taken shelter. And he\u2019d never lost the scent\u2014a task she\u2019d have thought impossible given the mix of torrential rain and driving wind.</p><p>Shoving his hands through his hair, he walked over to the bed. The muscles at the front of his body, she thought, were as impressive as the ones in the back. But her eyes, right then, were on his face. She couldn\u2019t read him, she realized with gut-wrenching shock, not like she could the other young males. But she knew she\u2019d insulted him. Predatory male changelings could be very touchy about that kind of a statement from a female\u2014but that was usually within the confines of a relationship or courtship.</p><p>Still . . .</p><p>He sprawled beside her, bracing his back against the wall. Turning a little, she scooped up a bite of cheesecake on her fork and lifted it to his mouth. He took it, holding her gaze as she drew the tines out from between his lips. Her body warmed with a slow burn of heat as she remembered those lips on her mouth, strong and confident . . . and tempting.</p><p>He flicked out his tongue to lick up a bit of the cream, his eyes never leaving hers. When he sat up and took the fork from her hand, she let him. And when he raised the cheesecake to her lips, she almost let him put the tines to her mouth. Except that the intimacy of the act suddenly hit her with blinding force.</p><p>\u201cDrew, we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d The cheesecake was in her mouth, the flavors lush and rich, the tines warm as he drew them through her lips oh-so-slowly.</p><p>Drew took a long, deep breath. \u201cI can scent your hunger,\u201d he murmured, his voice dropping until it scraped over her skin, raw and arousing. \u201cI want to taste it.\u201d</p><p>Thrown off center by the unexpected, shocking shift in atmosphere, she shook her head even as her muscles seemed to melt, her body aching in a way that had nothing to do with the hunt they\u2019d just completed. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep with my subordinates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t report to you.\u201d Another bite of cheesecake lifted to her lips in teasing promise. \u201cI\u2019m independent of the lieutenant hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>Her skin tingled, her palms itching to trace the sculptured beauty of his pectorals. It had been so long since she\u2019d had a lover. The pickings weren\u2019t exactly plentiful for a dominant changeling female in this region\u2014though since Drew\u2019s brother, Riley, had mated with a cat, she\u2019d checked out the leopards, too, even gone on a date or two. None of the men had made her body spark. Not even a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that body was making up for lost time now, her skin seeming to stretch as a voluptuous warmth invaded her very cells, curling through her veins to pulse beneath flesh turned unbearably sensitive. Too long, she thought, shocked at the spread of need, it had simply been too long. \u201cDrew . . .\u201d</p><p>His mouth so close, his tongue licking over the seam of her lips to steal a tiny bit of the creamy treat she\u2019d bought into the room. \u201cLet me in, Indy.\u201d The heat of him was wild, fresh, young, and it stroked over her like a physical caress.</p><p>Groaning, she nudged the next bite to his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep with Riley\u2019s baby brother.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t be able to face her fellow lieutenant when he came back from his trip to South America.</p> <p>A hard glance out of blue eyes gone a turbulent cobalt. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, Indigo.\u201d</p><p>She was so startled at his use of her full name that she blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re too young for me\u2014and I was your trainer, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNext excuse.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice made her hackles rise. \u201cCareful, Drew. I\u2019m not one of your little playmates.\u201d He had a harem that tumbled into his bed at the crook of a finger. And they all apparently left happy\u2014none of his former lovers had ever bad-mouthed him. In fact, as far as she knew, they continued to adore him.</p><p>\u201cDid I say I wanted a playmate?\u201d Putting the cheesecake carelessly on the mattress on his other side, he reached for her. His fingers were on her jaw and his mouth on hers while she was still forming a response to his snapped question.</p> <p>The punch of sensation went straight to her gut, but so did the wolf\u2019s confusion at the sudden change in this relationship. She pushed against his chest. Of course, since he was a predatory changeling male, he kept on kissing her. She could\u2019ve gotten away, but unwilling to reject him so roughly, she chose to push at him again. He broke off only long enough to say, \u201cYou want me. I can scent it.\u201d His tongue licked against hers in blunt demand, his free hand closing over the back of her neck as he pressed her to the wall, the heat of his skin burning her through and through.</p><p>A red haze of anger, powerful enough that she had to fight to keep her claws sheathed.</p><p>Wrenching away using the skill and strength that made her one of SnowDancer\u2019s most senior lieutenants, she swept off the bed, fury pulsing in every inch of her. The kiss she would have forgiven. Even the pushiness\u2014she understood what he was, wouldn\u2019t have penalized him for it. But the hand around her neck, the way he\u2019d tried to use his body to pin hers to the wall, and most of all the arrogance with which he\u2019d taken it as a given that her touch-hunger made her his for the taking? No.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d she said, in a tone so calm it took all of her control to maintain it, \u201chaven\u2019t given you the right to touch me as you please.\u201d There was play . . . and then there were lines you didn\u2019t cross. \u201cNext time you try to touch me like that\u201d\u2014in possession, in ownership\u2014\u201cbe prepared to get that pretty face shredded.\u201d</p><p>So infuriated she couldn\u2019t hear anything but the surge of her own blood, she turned on her heel and left. The worst of it was that she\u2019d trusted Drew, thought he was a friend who accepted and appreciated her for the dominant female she was\u2014but clearly, he was just another cocky young male who thought the lieutenant could be brought to heel by sex. And where she might\u2019ve easily forgiven everything else, she could not forgive that betrayal.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p> <p>Enclosed within the privacy of a secure London apartment, Councilor Henry Scott looked across the desk at his \u201cwife,\u201d Councilor Shoshanna Scott, and considered the pros and cons of their relationship. They were Psy\u2014unlike with the other races, emotion didn\u2019t come into the mix when undertaking that evaluation. Their marriage had been\u2014was\u2014a piece of political strategy, a way to placate the human and changeling media by giving them an easily relatable image.</p><p>However, of late that plus was being canceled out by the questions people were asking about the exact nature of their relationship\u2014there had been too many leaks and the emotional races now had information they should have never had. It had led to several probing inquiries at the most recent press conference, inquiries that wouldn\u2019t have been made even two years ago.</p><p>But, though problematic, that issue could wait.</p><p>\u201cIt is still possible to close the Net to outside influences,\u201d he said, focusing on the more important concern. \u201cNikita is incorrect to say that things have reached a critical mass, that Silence is close to falling.\u201d Councilor Duncan had been tainted by her constant and prolonged contact with the changelings in her territory and, as such, was a threat to the purity of Silence, the Protocol that erased their race\u2019s madnesses as it erased their emotions.</p><p>Henry intended to reinitiate that purity at all costs, and he had a significant amount of support. Membership in Pure Psy, the group formed to ensure Silence didn\u2019t fall, was rising day by day. \u201cOur race neither wants nor needs any change in the Protocol.\u201d</p><p>Swiveling in her chair, Shoshanna picked up a remote and switched on a screen to her right. \u201cThese are the key players we need to eliminate in order to initiate a full closure of the Net.\u201d</p><p>The first image on the left was that of Sascha Duncan, Nikita\u2019s flawed daughter. It was followed by those of Faith NightStar and Ashaya Aleine. \u201cAll high-level defectors from the Net,\u201d he murmured, watching as Shoshanna brought up more images.</p><p>\u201cThe males they\u2019ve bonded with in the DarkRiver leopard pack will also need to be executed,\u201d Shoshanna added. \u201cChangelings are proprietary about their women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re also relentless,\u201d Henry said, staring at the row of images. \u201cWe need to eliminate the entire pack, or at least the strongest part of it, if we\u2019re to ensure success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d She flicked up another image, that of a man with ice blue eyes and hair of an unusual silver-gold. \u201cThe alpha of the SnowDancer pack needs to go, along with his lieutenants.\u201d Nine new images appeared on-screen. \u201cThe wolves are too tightly allied with the leopards to risk leaving them untouched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought our data stated that SnowDancer had ten lieutenants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears they\u2019ve lost one, or we had the wrong information in the first place.\u201d</p><p>That, Henry knew, was quite possible. Their spy in the SnowDancer ranks had been executed over a year ago. Since then, any information they had was sketchy at best. \u201cAny assassination attempt on a changeling stands a high chance of failure. Their natural shields give them enough of a warning that they have an opportunity to retaliate.\u201d And while he considered the animal races far less intelligent than his own, he respected their physical strength against weaker Psy bodies.</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but we can finalize the logistics later. However,\u201d she continued, \u201cin light of the close alliance between SnowDancer and DarkRiver, it may be a good strategic move to remove the wolf alpha from the equation before we target the leopards. Their emotional natures will mean they\u2019ll be weakened by the damaging psychological impact of such a loss.\u201d</p><p>Since Shoshanna had proven skilled in predicting such responses in humans and changelings, Henry had no argument with that. \u201cFocusing our resources on the San Francisco area first,\u201d he said, \u201cmakes sense. The majority of the problems have been spawned by a relatively small group.\u201d</p><p>Two more images appeared on the screen\u2014Nikita\u2019s human security chief and the fractured Justice Psy who was likely in a relationship with the man. The J-Psy\u2019s shields were inexplicable and impenetrable, but the fact that she was still in the Net in spite of her broken Silence was so unacceptable that it needed no discussion.</p><p>Another three images. All fellow Councilors.</p><p>\u201cNikita needs to go.\u201d Shoshanna\u2019s tone was flat, with no room for compromise. \u201cMing has access to significant military resources. If we can\u2019t co-opt him, he must be eliminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Henry said. \u201cBut he is not a primary target.\u201d He nodded at the third image. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on Anthony?\u201d He didn\u2019t trust his wife an inch, but he respected her political acumen. Just as he respected the fact that one day soon he\u2019d have to kill her\u2014to ensure she didn\u2019t kill him first.</p><p>\u201cUncertain,\u201d she said now. \u201cAnthony has supported Nikita in the Council on the issue of Silence, but he has also supported our interests at times and could therefore be turned. He has no connections outside the Net except for his subcontracting arrangement with his daughter, and that decision is one I may have made myself in the same situation.\u201d</p><p>Since Faith NightStar was the strongest F-Psy in the world, able to predict futures other foreseers couldn\u2019t even glimpse, her services worth millions if not billions, Anthony\u2019s decision was one Henry understood as well. \u201cHe is, however, protective of his investment. We\u2019ll have to think carefully before we eliminate Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we can consider her toward the end.\u201d A pause. \u201cF-Psy are, after all, often fractured and kept under psychic guard. She could be reassimilated into the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA possibility.\u201d Henry made a note to investigate whether Shoshanna had a \u201cpet\u201d F-Psy of her own. Her telepathic reach was more than powerful enough to direct the unstable mind of a broken foreseer. \u201cThese two,\u201d he said, picking up the remote to highlight the images, \u201care the primary targets. Kill them and we bring the city to its knees.\u201d</p><p>And he already had the operation in place to ensure it.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Andrew knew he\u2019d messed up\u2014badly.</p><p>Standing under the cold spray of his morning shower, he pressed his forehead to the tile, his hand fisted against the cool white surface. He didn\u2019t blame Indy for thinking he was only interested in sex, in the physical. Yes, he was sexually hungry. Very, very hungry. But not just for sex. For sex with Indigo\u2014he\u2019d wanted her for what seemed like forever, but these past few months, his needs had turned highly specific in every way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sole thing that had kept him from imploding was the fact that he knew she hadn\u2019t been with anyone those months, either.</p><p>And now he\u2019d gone and mucked his chances up but good. Not only that, he\u2019d reinforced her opinion of him as a young male led by nothing but his cock, not worth taking seriously in the personal arena. \u201cDamn it.\u201d Wanting to strike out at something\u2014preferably his own stupidity\u2014he wrenched off the shower and stepped out to rub himself dry. He was thrusting a hand through his damp hair when his phone beeped. It was his alpha.</p><p>\u201cMy office, five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Adrenaline pumped through his veins at the summons. Better, far better, to be given some task that would mean racing through the cold climes of the Sierra than trapped in this room, this den, saturated with Indigo\u2019s unique scent.</p><p>Rainstorms and fire, ice and steel, that was what Indigo was to him.</p><p>And it was a scent that was waiting for him in Hawke\u2019s office. Sucking in a breath as he entered, he reined in the lunge his wolf wanted to make. Indigo glanced at him from where she stood in front of their alpha\u2019s desk, but her eyes told him nothing.</p><p>However, the straight line of her spine, the angle of her jaw, it all said \u201ckeep your distance\u201d loud and clear. Though it kicked him in the guts that he\u2019d broken the trust between them, Andrew wasn\u2019t about to listen to the silent order. And if Indigo thought he\u2019d give up that easily, she had no idea who she was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cGrab a seat, both of you,\u201d Hawke said, sitting down in his own chair. \u201cHave you heard from Riley, Drew?\u201d</p> <p>Andrew slid into a seat beside Indigo, stretching his legs out in front. \u201cGot a text saying they\u2019re planning to visit Rio de Janeiro today. Oh, and that he\u2019s already in love with Mercy\u2019s grandmother. Since she hasn\u2019t clawed his guts open yet, he thinks she might like him back.\u201d</p><p>Hawke grinned. \u201cPoor Riley. I hope he survives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew what he was getting into when he mated with a dominant female,\u201d Indigo said, tapping a finger on the arm of her chair. \u201cIf he has the sense to continue to treat Mercy as exactly what she is, I\u2019m sure her family will have no problem with him.\u201d</p><p>Andrew knew the words were directed at him. Yeah, they cut. But they also shored up his determination. Because no way in hell was last night going to be the final word on their relationship. \u201cYou know the two cats who came up here?\u201d he said out loud, mentally vowing to melt that icy control, and more, to make her see him. \u201cThe ones who thought they might have a shot with Mercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEduardo and Joaquin?\u201d Hawke said, his hair catching the light as he leaned back in his chair and folded his arms behind his head. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took Riley out drinking last night.\u201d</p> <p>The three of them digested that for a second . . . before grins appeared on all their faces, segueing slowly into chuckles, then outright laughter\u2014including from the lieutenant sitting so straight and stiff next to him. His wolf bared its teeth in a feral smile. Indy might think she could freeze him out like she could everyone else, but just wait.</p><p>After they\u2019d gotten the amusement out of their system, Hawke picked up a notepad. \u201cOkay, with Riley and Mercy both away, we\u2019ve got to move some things around. I need you\u201d\u2014glancing at Andrew\u2014\u201cto do a few extra security shifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d While his position as Hawke\u2019s eyes and ears in the wider pack had him on the road much of the time, he also functioned as a senior-level soldier during the times he was in the den.</p><p>Hawke made a note. \u201cIndigo, you good with continuing to coordinate our resources?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Indigo\u2019s tone was calm, practical, with not the slightest hint of the passionate nature he\u2019d glimpsed for a brief moment last night. \u201cAre you handling the liaison with the leopards?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s scowl had Andrew fighting a grin. \u201cYeah. Do you know how many juveniles I had to spring from cat territory yesterday? Five,\u201d he said without waiting for an answer. \u201cThey\u2019d gotten the bright idea to catch a leopard juvenile in animal form and cover him in blue and silver paint.\u201d</p><p>Andrew snorted. \u201cAt least they chose the pack\u2019s colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, too bad for them that the \u2018juvenile\u2019 they caught was actually a full-fledged female soldier who just happens to be slightly smaller in size.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo\u2019s wince was a hiss of air. \u201cHow bad did she slice them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll live.\u201d Hawke\u2019s wolf was in his eyes, clearly amused. \u201cMy punishment was probably worse. I doused the idiots in their own paint and told them they\u2019re not allowed to shift to get rid of it. It washes off in the shower, or it doesn\u2019t come off.\u201d</p><p>That, Andrew thought, explained the sheepish-looking teenager he\u2019d seen on the way here, his hair sticking up in stiff blue spikes. \u201cYou want me to handle any of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hawke shook his head. \u201cIndigo or I will move you around as we see a gap. Riaz will be arriving later today, so we\u2019ll have another lieutenant soon, but he\u2019ll need a few days to rest and get himself up to speed.\u201d</p><p>Indigo leaned forward a bare fraction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was coming home.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wolf growled a warning inside his mind at the sign of her interest in the other man. Riaz, he knew, was around Indigo\u2019s age and ranked just below her in the hierarchy. The male had spent most of the past couple of years away from SnowDancer territory, roaming through various parts of the country and the world to gather information; to function as the pack\u2019s business representative when necessary; and more recently, to initiate contact and/or informal alliances with other changeling groups.</p><p>But none of that was important to his wolf. What made its fur bristle was one simple, inescapable fact: Riaz and Indigo had once been lovers. His hand clenched on the arm of his chair, his claws slicing out to dig into the leather-synth. He retracted the physical evidence of his emotions before anyone could notice, but there was nothing he could do about the claws slicing at the insides of his skin as the wolf paced, a low growl humming at the back of its throat.</p><p>The intensity of his response surprised even him.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d Riaz get back into the country?\u201d While he continued to fight the wolf\u2019s primal urges, Andrew knew without conceit that no one would guess he was having trouble maintaining an even keel\u2014that ability to slide under the radar was a skill he\u2019d had all his life. But he\u2019d truly honed it to perfection in the months following his sister Brenna\u2019s abduction and torture. Riley had had nightmares. Andrew . . . Andrew had run himself into exhaustion every night for weeks. Alone. \u201cLast I heard, he was in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Hawke said, interrupting the dark wash of memory. \u201cLanded in New York only a few hours ago. Should be in San Francisco by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick him up,\u201d Indigo volunteered.</p><p>Andrew flexed his hand on the side of his chair hidden from Indigo\u2019s view, his claws slicing in and out. \u201cIs that everything?\u201d He needed to escape the intoxication and provocation of Indigo\u2019s scent, get a handle on himself before he did something else stupid.</p><p>Hawke shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got something I want you two to do.\u201d Settling back, he blew out a breath. \u201cThe thing with Joshua? Shouldn\u2019t have happened. And it\u2019s a pack issue, not a case of one or two individuals dropping the ball.\u201d</p><p>Andrew relaxed a fraction as his wolf\u2019s protective drive toward the pack overcame its more primitive instincts. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so busy with protecting SnowDancer against the Council that we haven\u2019t paid enough attention to the young ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew is right.\u201d Indigo braced her forearms on her thighs, her scowl apparent in the tone of her voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on training up the older soldiers, the dominants, to the detriment of the other ranks, and that\u2019s not how a healthy pack, how our pack, is supposed to work.\u201d She sounded both angry and frustrated\u2014with herself, Andrew knew. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t we notice the problem earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone did. I told him it wasn\u2019t a priority.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Indigo followed Hawke\u2019s gaze to Drew, who shrugged in that fluid way he had. \u201cI should\u2019ve pushed you harder on the point,\u201d he said to their alpha, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t seem necessary at the time\u2014and Joshua was shoved over the edge by a highly volatile situation. None of the others are anywhere near that stage. I would\u2019ve made you pay attention if it was that bad.\u201d</p><p>Indigo wasn\u2019t used to finding herself out of the loop. It irritated her, but more, it made her wonder exactly how much more she didn\u2019t know about the things Drew did for the pack, for Hawke. Sitting up straight, she folded her arms and pinned him with her gaze. \u201cHow is it that you\u2019re so on top of what\u2019s happening with the juveniles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople talk to me.\u201d Easy words, but there was an edge to them, his wolf baring its teeth in response to her aggressive tone. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the den kids,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are a few out in the wider territory who are struggling in various ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them up here by the weekend,\u201d Hawke said, pale eyes dangerously intent.</p><p>Indigo wondered what he saw, but she didn\u2019t ask. Because she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know. Drew had changed the status quo last night, changed it in a way that left only confusion and a restless fury in its wake. It wasn\u2019t a feeling she appreciated. \u201cWhat\u2019re you planning?\u201d she asked Hawke, determined to find her balance again. Other wolves might enjoy chaos, but Indigo, wolf and woman both, preferred order. Hierarchy was the solid core of that order. No wolf pack as strong as SnowDancer could survive without it.</p><p>Now Hawke, the man at the top of that chain of command, said, \u201cI want you two to take the affected juveniles up into the mountains for a couple of days, give them some intense one-on-one attention, find out if there are more serious issues below the surface that we need to be handling.\u201d He pushed across a piece of paper. \u201cThese are the names Drew gave me last time. Add any others you think might benefit. If we have too many, we can split them into two groups.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Indigo\u2019s wolf saw the sense in what he was suggesting\u2014bonding was at the heart of a healthy pack. And at present, things were relaxed enough that they could take time out to nurture those in danger of faltering. But the idea of spending that much time alone with the young male sitting to her left rubbed her fur the wrong way. Before last night, she\u2019d have gone with him without a blink, trusting him to do what was necessary\u2014and not act the ass.</p><p>However, below all that\u2014the frustrated anger, the inability to understand why he\u2019d done what he had\u2014she was still a SnowDancer lieutenant. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to see you, too,\u201d she said to Hawke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clearing the decks so I can join you for at least one of the days.\u201d His facial muscles tensed without warning.</p> <p>A second later, Indigo caught a familiar scent on the air currents. Not long after that, a pretty girl with brown eyes, her hair tamed into a long braid, poked her head around the corner. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll come ba\u2014\u201d she began at seeing the three of them.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re just finishing up.\u201d Drew rose to his feet with a muscular grace Indigo had always known about, having sparred with him more than once. They\u2019d also done any number of climbs together, both of them enjoying the thrill that came with pitting themselves against the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. But she\u2019d never truly seen that grace until this moment.</p><p>The sudden awareness of him as a male, and not only that, but as a strong, handsome male, unsettled what balance she\u2019d managed to regain. For the first time, she found herself seriously worried that things would never return to the way they\u2019d once been\u2014that their friendship had died in his room last night. The thought shook her enough that she had to make a conscious effort to catch Drew\u2019s next words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finalize the list today,\u201d he said to Hawke. \u201cWe can decide the details, time of departure, et cetera, once we\u2019ve contacted everyone. That work, Indy?\u201d</p><p>Her concern was swept away under a surge of annoyance as she wondered if the damn copper-eyed wolf thought he could smooth things over with so little effort. \u201cFine. You take care of contacting the out-of-towners; I\u2019ll do the juveniles in the den.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew nodded and headed toward the door, sentient to the rising tension level in the room\u2014and it wasn\u2019t all his and Indigo\u2019s fault. Sienna gave him a small smile as he came close to where she waited in the doorway. Even after all these months, it was strange to see her with those eyes and that brown hair that was nothing close to her spectacular true shade. But no matter the shell she\u2019d had to don to allow her to move safely in the outside world, her personality shone through. Quiet, determined . . . and with a little bit of hellion thrown in for spice.</p><p>Leaning down, he cupped her jaw in his hand and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cHow are you doing, little sister?\u201d The question wasn\u2019t a simple courtesy. She\u2019d been in trouble, her psychic abilities starting to spiral out of control before she\u2019d moved away from the den to spend time in the care of the DarkRiver leopards.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I get after I sent you a whole box of premium chocolate-cherry cookies?\u201d he said, feigning extreme disappointment. \u201cJust \u2018good\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Furrows appeared between her brows, dark little lines that marred the beauty of her sun-dipped skin. \u201cDrew.\u201d</p><p>But when he grinned and took her into his arms, she not only allowed the affection, she slid her own arms around him. It had taken him months of patient care to get her to trust him with her body in that way. \u201cIs that leopard boy . . . what\u2019s his name\u201d\u2014Andrew pretended to think\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s right, Kit. Is Kit treating you right?\u201d He murmured the question at a volume Hawke was certain to overhear, knowing full well he was throwing the cat among the pigeons.</p> <p>\u201cDrew.\u201d Sienna pulled back, fisting a hand on his chest. Her eyes sparked fire at him, and for an instant he could almost see through the dark brown of her contact lenses and to the night-sky eyes beyond. White stars on a spread of black velvet, it was said that the eyes of a cardinal Psy reflected the stark, sprawling beauty of the PsyNet.</p><p>Leaning down, he kissed her other cheek and\u2014dropping his voice low enough that it would skate under even his alpha\u2019s acute hearing\u2014said, \u201cGive him hell, sweetheart. Then come tell me about it.\u201d Ruffling her hair, he finally let her pass and exited the office.</p><p>Indigo fell into step beside him a second later. \u201cThe famous Andrew Kincaid charm in action?\u201d Her question was sharp . . . but held an undertone of amusement. Because she\u2019d been close enough to hear what he\u2019d said to Sienna at the end.</p><p>His wolf wasn\u2019t fooled\u2014the ice hadn\u2019t melted. It had simply been eclipsed momentarily by the wolf\u2019s curious nature. \u201cSienna could do with some charming.\u201d The Psy girl\u2014young woman now\u2014had been through things that would\u2019ve broken far older and stronger men, been scarred by them. \u201cIf Hawke would figure that out, he\u2019d be much happier.\u201d</p><p>Indigo snorted. \u201cYeah, I can just see him pulling charm out of a hat.\u201d</p><p>Andrew angled his body toward her. He\u2019d planned to apologize for his behavior last night as soon as they had privacy, but as he went to open his mouth, he glimpsed a fleeting expectation in her eyes. The lieutenant was waiting for him to say it. When he did, she\u2019d forgive him\u2014both because she wasn\u2019t the kind of woman to hold a grudge and because it would shove them firmly back into the roles she\u2019d decided were the only acceptable ones.</p><p>His wolf went quiet, thinking.</p><p>Better, he thought, feeling sneaky and downright delighted with himself, far better to keep her angry and thinking about him. Oh, there was no question he\u2019d been a dick and needed to apologize, but he\u2019d do so in a time and place of his own choosing\u2014and in a way that would further his cause, not hers. \u201cSee you later, Indy.\u201d</p> <p>He was almost sure he heard a low feminine snarl as he strolled off down the corridor.</p><p>His wolf peeled back its lips in a feral grin.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Sienna ran her hands self-consciously over her hair, wondering how badly Drew had messed it up. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d The words came out stiff, jerky. No matter how composed she was around everyone else\u2014until more than one wolf in the den had called her an \u201cold soul\u201d\u2014she got to Hawke and it all fell apart.</p><p>He rose to his feet, his desk between them. \u201cWe were done.\u201d Ice blue eyes swept over her face . . . her cheeks\u2014which she knew were ridiculously freckled after all the time she\u2019d been spending out of doors.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you and Drew were close.\u201d It was a question phrased as a statement.</p><p>She fought the urge to cover up the cheeks he continued to stare at and shrugged\u2014a very human or changeling motion, something she\u2019d picked up after spending almost three years outside the PsyNet. Once, she wouldn\u2019t have answered Hawke\u2019s implied question, awaiting a direct query. But once, she\u2019d been Silent, her emotions chilled like so much ice . . . not full of so much fire that it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cDrew figures that since his sister is mated to my uncle,\u201d she said, focusing on a spot beyond Hawke\u2019s shoulder in an effort to regain her equilibrium, \u201cthat gives him the right to claim me as family.\u201d She was a cardinal Psy, her psychic power blinding, but she still couldn\u2019t figure out how Drew had snuck in under her defenses and made room for himself in her life. She just knew she\u2019d miss him horribly if he ever left. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, her voice stupidly breathy, \u201che says he\u2019s not old enough to be an uncle, so he\u2019s decided to treat me like another younger sister.\u201d</p><p>Most people would\u2019ve rolled their eyes at the convoluted reasoning, but Hawke simply nodded, as if it made perfect sense. Of course, to him, it probably did. The predatory changelings she knew were all big on family\u2014and she had to admit, it was . . . nice to be treated with such easy affection by those she trusted. Drew understood that she was powerful, that she could cause incredible damage, and yet he continued to tease her as mercilessly as he did his real sister, Brenna.</p><p>Sometimes, Sienna even teased him back. Self-defense, she called it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want permission to return to DarkRiver land?\u201d Hawke asked, and his voice was as cool as Drew\u2019s had been warm, shattering what stability she\u2019d managed to recapture. But no, she thought, remembering what Sascha had told her the last time she\u2019d spent the night in the home of the woman who was a fellow defector from the PsyNet\u2014and an empath able to sense and heal emotional hurts.</p><p>No one can take from you what you don\u2019t want to give. It is your choice.</p><p>And, she thought, steeling her spine, she chose not to let this strange compulsion toward a man who wasn\u2019t interested, who would never be interested, break her. \u201cI wanted to say thank you,\u201d she said, controlling her volatile emotions by reciting a calming mantra she\u2019d learned during her conditioning in the PsyNet, \u201cfor letting me spend so much time with the cats.\u201d</p><p>Hawke finally walked out from behind that desk he always kept as an impassable wall between them. And that quickly, everything shifted, her shields trembling under the impact of him.</p><p>\u201cHas it helped?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She would not give in, not today. \u201cMy control over my abilities is far better.\u201d Because he wasn\u2019t constantly there, wasn\u2019t breaking through her defenses with nothing but his presence. \u201cSascha and Faith have been helping me refine and strengthen my shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-Psy,\u201d she said, referring to Faith\u2019s ability to see the future, \u201chave incredibly tough shields. And Faith\u2019s recalibrated hers for maximum effectiveness.\u201d For now, those same shields were giving Sienna a measure of peace.</p><p>Though now, today, her heart beat like that of a trapped rabbit against her ribs, her skin suddenly too tight over heated flesh.</p><p>Reaching out, Hawke touched the top of her right cheekbone. It was the barest graze . . . but it was the first time he\u2019d touched her in over a year. Fractures cracked across her shields, sudden and vicious and threatening to shove her into the black abyss of her power. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trembling, she stepped back. \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch me.\u201d Choked-out words.</p><p>Hawke curled his hand into a fist at Sienna\u2019s near-silent command, his wolf snarling to get out, to teach this slender girl that he would not be rejected. \u201cYou have a cut there.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers lifted to that cheek, a cheek that also bore a scattered spray of sun golden freckles she hadn\u2019t had the last time they\u2019d spoken. \u201cOh,\u201d she said after a moment, \u201cthat must\u2019ve been from when I was with Kit yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>His wolf pulled back its lips, baring the lethal sharpness of its canines. Kit was young, extremely dominant, and very close to Sienna in age. That didn\u2019t mean he was right for her. \u201cHe hurt you?\u201d It came out a cold question, his wolf gone predator-still.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t looking where I was going on the run back from a sparring session and I tripped.\u201d An embarrassed look. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be as graceful as a changeling.\u201d</p><p>Hawke said nothing, could say nothing, his mind filling with images of the young leopard male touching her, laughing with her as he helped her up from the earth. \u201cHow much longer are you planning to stay in the den?\u201d He\u2019d fought against her going to DarkRiver, but there was no arguing that she was far more stable now than she\u2019d been before.</p><p>\u201cA while longer. I miss Toby so much when I\u2019m with the cats,\u201d she said, referring to the little brother she loved with an intensity that was almost wolf in nature. \u201cI also want to talk with Judd about some things to do with my abilities. But later this month, I\u2019m going on a small hiking trip with Kit and a few other novice soldiers in DarkRiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you speak to Indigo so she can adjust your duties.\u201d Hawke\u2019s wolf was scraping at the insides of his skin now, his vision starting to blur. \u201cAnd stay out of my way while you\u2019re here.\u201d The order came out harsh as the edge of a rusted blade.</p> <p>Sienna\u2019s face went white even as fury tightened the corners of her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t come back to see you.\u201d</p><p>Indigo stood with her back to the airport wall, waiting for Riaz to exit his gate. She\u2019d already tracked down and spoken to all the teenagers on her half of the list, informing them they needed to be packed and ready to head out into the cold but spectacular beauty of the mountains in a couple of days\u2019 time. The responses had ranged from gulps to outright glee.</p><p>She\u2019d also had a message from Drew saying he was almost through his half of the list, too, but hadn\u2019t actually seen him since the meeting with Hawke. That only fired up the burner on her anger\u2014because if nothing else, she\u2019d expected an apology for his behavior. Instead, he\u2019d acted like nothing had happened. Idiot.</p><p>Scowling, she lifted her head just as Riaz appeared in the stream of passengers disembarking from the New York flight. At six feet two, he was taller than her by four inches and built along the lines of his solid grace in wolf form. It was all pure muscle\u2014and Riaz knew how to use it well.</p><p>He scented her from the gate, teeth flashing white against his dusky skin as their eyes connected. \u201cHola, bella,\u201d he said, dropping his bags on the floor and lifting her up in a powerful hug as she met him halfway.</p><p>Laughing, she kissed him on the jaw, feeling the rasp of stubble against her lips. \u201cHello, stranger. You back for good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends who\u2019s asking.\u201d A lazy smile in those eyes that were such a pale brown as to be beaten gold. Unusual. And for most females, fascinating. He raised an eyebrow when she continued to stare. \u201cDid I grow a second nose or something?\u201d</p><p>Stepping out of the soap-and-earth-and-warmth of his embrace, she watched him pick up his bags. \u201cNo, but you\u2019ve put on some more muscle.\u201d It was a dodge. Because in truth, she\u2019d been thinking something far different\u2014that Riaz, with his jet-black hair and eyes of Spanish gold, was gorgeous and sexy and\u2014very importantly\u2014a dominant only just below her in the hierarchy. The difference wasn\u2019t enough to bother her wolf. And they\u2019d never had a problem with physical chemistry.</p><p>All facts to consider.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s lips curved into a deeper smile as he hefted one duffel over his shoulder while gripping the other in his free hand. \u201cSo you noticed. Want to feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy you might be; Don Juan you\u2019re not.\u201d Laughing at his affronted look, she led him to the vehicle, and they clambered inside after dumping his bags in the trunk. \u201cHow was Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all pretty girls, flash hotels, five-star food,\u201d he moaned, pushing back his seat as far as possible so he could stretch out those long, powerfully muscled legs. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go mad.\u201d</p><p>Smile tugging at her lips, she waved her debit card at the parking gates, and they opened with a quiet swish. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d</p><p>Riaz said nothing for several minutes, putting down the window to let the wind ruffle his hair. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to be home, Indigo.\u201d Heartfelt words, the homesickness of his wolf evident in every syllable. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to run through the forests, to walk in the den, to shoot the bull with the rest of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been back now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew I\u2019d be leaving again,\u201d the other lieutenant said, \u201cso I never really gave myself a chance to settle. But now . . .\u201d He exhaled, long and slow. \u201cAnything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s gone to meet his mate\u2019s grandparents.\u201d</p><p>Riaz shook his head, that black-as-night hair whipping off his face as she accelerated. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d mated with a cat when I heard, but having met Mercy on my last trip home, I can say the man has excellent taste.\u201d Another comfortable silence, then, \u201cSo, what was that at the airport about me being tall, dark, and irresistible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall using those words.\u201d</p><p>Eyes of beaten gold met hers full-on for a single instant before she returned her gaze to the road, and he moved his hand to the back of her neck, massaging gently. It was a familiar and intimate touch. Unlike with Drew, her wolf allowed this one. Because Riaz had earned the wolf\u2019s trust on that level, been given that right. He hadn\u2019t simply tried to claim it the way Drew had\u2014as if a few kisses gave him the prerogative to demand everything. Her hands clenched on the manual steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not attached, Indigo,\u201d Riaz said with a solemnity that struck her as somehow \u201cwrong,\u201d though she couldn\u2019t put her finger on why. \u201cSo if you\u2019re thinking you need someone with whom to work off the tension, I\u2019m more than happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>Shoving away the memory of Drew\u2019s kisses, the infuriating arrogance of his attempt to use her touch-hunger against her, she nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>It gutted Andrew, fucking eviscerated him, to see Indigo laughing with another man, a man who had no concept of the true value of the woman beside him. No, that was unfair. Riaz\u2019s remarkable eyes sparked with intelligence, with respect, when he looked at Indigo. The male lieutenant understood exactly who she was.</p><p>Staying in his shadowed spot\u2014in the back of the room where all the senior members of the pack had gathered to throw Riaz an impromptu welcome-home party\u2014Andrew sucked on his beer and forced his attention off the couple on the other side\u2014to something, anything, else.</p><p>He saw Hawke speaking with Elias and Yuki, glimpsed Sing-Liu playfully grabbing her mate\u2019s ass, and\u2014He blinked. Walker Lauren was here. That wasn\u2019t a huge surprise, because though quiet, the Psy male had turned out to be a genius when it came to dealing with young hotheads, to the extent that Hawke had assigned him as the go-to man for the ten-to-thirteen-year-old crowd.</p><p>What held Andrew\u2019s attention was the fact that Walker was standing very close to Lara, and from the expression on the healer\u2019s fine-boned face, the way she was all but poking the much taller man in the chest, she was well and truly pissed. Walker\u2019s own expression was more difficult to read, but\u2014</p><p>Low female laughter. Intimate. Painfully familiar.</p><p>Clenching his jaw, he refused to turn, to watch.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been gut-punched.\u201d Quiet words from a man who\u2019d once been the shadow in the dark, the assassin you\u2019d never see, never know about, until it was far too late.</p><p>Andrew glanced at his sister\u2019s mate as Judd came to stand against the wall beside him. \u201cI feel worse.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes were on the other side of the room\u2014on the curious tableau presented by his older brother and Lara\u2014but he spoke to Andrew. \u201cDo you want me to leave you alone?\u201d</p><p>And that was why\u2014in spite of the fact that the other male dared get into bed with Andrew\u2019s beloved sister on a regular basis\u2014Andrew liked Judd. \u201cNo, but I need to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t say anything, just put down his own drink and melted away in the direction of the door. Andrew followed, leaving his unfinished beer on a table in the corner as he walked out, refusing to torture himself any further. It had always been bad, seeing her interact with other men in a way she simply didn\u2019t interact with him, but never like this\u2014because he knew just how dangerous Riaz was to his own goals.</p><p>His senses told him there was nothing sexual between Indigo and Riaz . . . now. That last word was the operative one. Because the way Riaz looked at Indigo, the way she looked at him\u2014they were considering it on some level. And if Andrew wasn\u2019t careful, proximity alone might push them into making a decision that would rip Andrew\u2019s heart into a thousand pieces.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Judd nodded at a corridor that led eventually to one of the less utilized exits. Leaving through it, they walked out past the White Zone\u2014the area closest to the den, where their young were free to play\u2014and into the more densely forested area beyond. Sandwiched between the heavily guarded perimeter and the equally well-guarded entrance to the White Zone, it provided a massive range for adult and juvenile wolves to run in, play in, and come to find solitude. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like now.</p><p>Silence was something Judd was good at, but after almost ten minutes of it, the Psy male glanced at Andrew. \u201cIf it was me,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d understand the need to walk alone. But you\u2019re a social individual, one of the most popular people in SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>The unspoken question hung in the air between them.</p> <p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Andrew hadn\u2019t spoken of his attraction to Indigo to anyone, ever. Because though he loved his pack with every breath in him, he didn\u2019t want them peering over his shoulder while he fought for his right to court her. \u201cGod, if Riley could see me now.\u201d He\u2019d hassled his brother endlessly about Mercy.</p><p>Judd continued to walk, his stride elegant even along the soaked earth. It was an explicable grace, given that the man most thought a telepath was actually also a viciously powerful telekinetic. Judd had already been in the pack for well over a year before any of them discovered that truth. So Andrew had no doubts about the fact the man could keep secrets\u2014at least from the pack. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell Brenna, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The Psy lieutenant turned and simply looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Andrew blew out a breath. \u201cNot like that\u2019s a question.\u201d Neither was it reason enough to keep his silence\u2014his sister was loyal to the bone. She might mess with him in private, but she\u2019d keep it close to her chest if he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d Judd\u2019s voice was calm and clear in the snow-laced chill of the night. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at the lieutenant. So has Brenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d The pack, with its loving teasing, could do more harm than good right now, when Indigo was so determined to draw a line in the sand between them. \u201cIs it that bloody obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Judd waited until Andrew began to walk again to continue. \u201cHowever, we are . . . family.\u201d Emotion\u2014being open with it\u2014was still difficult for Judd. But not only had Drew once stood in the path of a bullet that had been aimed at the woman who was Judd\u2019s heart, the wolf male had used his considerable charm to bring a smile to Sienna\u2019s face.</p><p>For those two things alone, Judd would\u2019ve owed him. But even before Drew started interacting with Sienna and the other Lauren children, he and Judd had also forged a cautious kind of friendship\u2014built on their shared love for Brenna. \u201cBrenna worries about you.\u201d</p><p>Drew gave a startled laugh. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not Riley. I don\u2019t take responsibility for the world\u2019s ills.\u201d It was said with open affection for the brother Judd knew had all but raised both Drew and Brenna.</p><p>Using a slight amount of Tk, Judd absently braced a water-logged branch that had been about to break off right above their heads. \u201cI think Mercy might be trying to cure him of that.\u201d</p> <p>A minute . . . two, of silence. Except it wasn\u2019t silent. He\u2019d been an assassin, knew how to move without sending a ripple through the air currents, thought he\u2019d been familiar with the quiet dark of night. But Brenna, his mate, had shown him her night, her silence, and it was an amazing, beautiful world.</p><p>The rustle of a rabbit as it caught their scent and froze.</p><p>The dull thud of that branch falling to the earth.</p><p>The soft touch of rain-heavy air against his face.</p><p>Small things that filled the silence, the dark, until it wasn\u2019t bleak, but a serene wonderland.</p><p>\u201cIndigo thinks Riaz\u2014or someone like Riaz,\u201d Drew said at last, his voice taut, strained, \u201cwill be right for her. I can see it clear as day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them know her, not like I do.\u201d</p> <p>Judd angled his body left, taking them down a slight slope that would lead eventually to one of the lakes that dotted the Sierra. Most in the higher altitudes, especially in the central and southern areas, remained locked in ice, but this one was liquid, its waters rippling under moonlight as the clouds parted. \u201cBut do you truly know her, Drew?\u201d</p><p>Andrew felt his shoulders go stiff, his wolf baring its teeth in instinctive response, but he respected Judd\u2019s intelligence enough to rein it back. \u201cAre you saying I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that from what Brenna\u2019s noted, you\u2019ve had a crush on Indigo since you were a very young man.\u201d Judd held up a hand when Andrew would\u2019ve interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning what you feel; I\u2019m not telling you that you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m simply asking you to examine your own emotions,\u201d he said with implacable logic. \u201cAsk yourself if it\u2019s Indigo you want, or a mirage of her you\u2019ve built up in your mind.\u201d</p><p>With that, Judd jogged down the final steep part of the incline to the pebbled edge of the lake. Andrew followed with far less grace, for all that he was changeling. His mind was misfiring, his body not quite under his control. It felt as if his world had just been skewed on its axis.</p><p>A few feet away, the lake lapped with placid regularity over the smooth water-shaped pebbles, in stark contrast to his own disordered state. Swearing under his breath, he ripped off his sweatshirt and went for his boots.</p><p>Judd walked away without a word, taking a path along the curving edge of the dark spread of water.</p><p>Stripping down to his skin, Andrew looked up at the moon, his wolf confused, floundering. The bright sphere, its face covered by clouds an instant later, could give him no answers, and the more he thought, the more he tangled himself up in the sticky confusion of a thousand cobwebs. Shrugging off the cutting bite of the wind, he strode in through the shallows and dived.</p><p>Ice.</p><p>The shock of it tore the air from his lungs, froze the blood in his veins . . . and returned clarity to his mind.</p><p>Indigo snapping at him because he\u2019d been messing around during training.</p><p>Indigo allowing him to cuddle into her because she thought he needed the touch of Pack.</p><p>Indigo pissy on a short trip they\u2019d taken to Los Angeles.</p><p>Indigo laughing with Mercy as the two of them teased Riley.</p><p>Indigo calm and smart as she advised Hawke against a planned maneuver.</p><p>Indigo whooping with glee as they finished scaling one of the tougher climbs they\u2019d attempted.</p><p>Indigo teeth-grittingly obstinate as she arrowed toward the man she thought was right for her.</p><p>Wiping the water from his face, he sucked in a breath of the bracing air and yelled out to the night, \u201cI know every part of her, warts and all! And I still adore her!\u201d He began to head back to shore without waiting for an answer. Even his tough changeling body couldn\u2019t handle water this icy for long.</p><p>A towel was waiting for him by his discarded clothes. He grinned. Having a telekinetic as a friend did come in handy sometimes. Wiping himself off with rough strokes that got his blood pumping, he rubbed at his hair then pulled on his clothes. He was sitting on the rocky shore, the towel around his neck, when Judd returned to his side. The other man took a seat beside him, his movements so quiet that if Andrew hadn\u2019t scented him, he\u2019d never have known there was anyone beside him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Judd said, \u201cwhat\u2019re you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have been doing,\u201d Andrew said, his wolf growling in feral agreement. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let her ignore me just because I don\u2019t fit neatly into the box she has marked out for the man she\u2019ll take as her own.\u201d He wanted to use the word mate, but that had a very specific meaning for changelings.</p><p>And though it hurt him to admit it, there was no mating dance between him and Indigo, no compulsion from the wild heart of their natures that would\u2014if nothing else\u2014tug her inexorably to him, make her pay attention. No, all he had was his stubborn determination . . . and his heart.</p><p>Judd sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me dating advice?\u201d Andrew was dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mated,\u201d Judd pointed out with a cool arrogance that almost hid the laughter in his voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get the woman you want into bed. I\u2019d listen if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Andrew gave him the finger, but his wolf pricked up its ears. \u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d Judd said in an abrupt change of subject, \u201cis slow to take to people, suspicious of everyone\u2019s motives. She\u2019s had to become that way to protect herself, but she lets you hold her. Do you understand how big a deal that is for her?\u201d</p><p>Judd had almost intervened the first time he\u2019d seen Drew pull Sienna into a hug. He\u2019d thought his niece was being forced. But then, right before he\u2019d turned Drew\u2019s bones into so much shrapnel, he\u2019d seen Sienna\u2019s arms go around the wolf male\u2019s waist, her face lift up to his with a tiny smile of welcome.</p><p>The sight had literally stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Drew now said, a tenderness in his voice that was most usually apparent when he spoke to his sister. \u201cI knew she was hurting. Hell, I probably understand what she\u2019s going through in one particular area of her life better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t pursue that avenue of thought\u2014trouble was brewing there, but they had time yet. Tonight, he\u2019d focus on Drew. \u201cHow did you get Sienna to trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d A shrug Judd sensed more than saw, the moon eclipsed by the rain-heavy clouds. \u201cI talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bribed her with a dozen deluxe cupcakes, each with its own weight in frosting.\u201d Judd could still remember how the three cousins\u2014Sienna, Toby, and Walker\u2019s daughter, Marlee\u2014had sat around and gobbled up the sweet concoctions. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a crumb left by the end of the day, and I\u2019m pretty sure Sienna and the kids were in sugar comas.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s laughter was warmth in the darkness. \u201cI saw her eyeing a photo of them in a magazine. It was just a way to get into her good graces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame with painting pink daisies on the door of the vehicle she most often uses to drive to DarkRiver territory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was water paint,\u201d Drew said, clearly unrepentant, \u201cbarely took her a minute to wipe it away.\u201d A grin. \u201cShe only got mad when she found out I\u2019d painted her rucksack, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Judd couldn\u2019t help it. He laughed. It was still new to him, that sound, the feel of it. But he liked laughing, liked the bubbles of joy in his bloodstream, the feel of his chest muscles flexing in a way that had once been wholly unfamiliar. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Drew.\u201d</p><p>A low growl colored the air. \u201cMy sister might be a sucker for your face, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll hold my punches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask the question again\u2014how did you get Sienna to trust you?\u201d</p> <p>Obviously irritated at the repetition, Drew threw a pebble into the water, picked up another. \u201cIndigo would say I charmed her into\u2014Oh.\u201d Still holding the pebble, he stared at Judd. \u201cI am an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Having left Drew to plot the next step in his courtship of Indigo, Judd went home to kiss his mate and promise her he\u2019d be home in a couple of hours. Brenna tugged down his head, rubbed her nose affectionately against his. \u201cYou\u2019ll be careful.\u201d It was an order.</p><p>\u201cNothing dangerous tonight,\u201d he murmured, stroking his hands down her back, stunned as always by the delicate strength of her\u2014such power in so small a frame. \u201cAre you planning to wear one of those lacy things to sleep in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I bother.\u201d A smile against his lips, her wolf dancing in her eyes. \u201cThey never stay on long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them.\u201d He most especially liked peeling them off her inch by slow inch.</p> <p>A husky laugh. \u201cThen don\u2019t be too late.\u201d</p><p>Properly motivated to complete his errand and return to her arms, he made his way down into the night-cloaked streets of San Francisco, and from there, to the peaceful hush of the place Father Xavier Perez called both his vocation and his home. Xavier was waiting for him in the otherwise empty confines of the simple Second Reformation church, and Judd\u2019s light mood transformed into concern as he came close enough to see the lines of strain on the other man\u2019s normally serene countenance.</p><p>\u201cXavier,\u201d he said, meeting the man of God in the center of the aisle, right below the peak of the roof, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I tell you now, you cannot share with our mutual friend.\u201d Xavier\u2019s eyes were troubled but resolute. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Ghost has his own agenda.\u201d Judd, too, was worried about the powerful Psy rebel who was the third part of their triumvirate. The Ghost was connected to, and loyal to, the PsyNet. But the growing darkness in that very Net seemed to be in danger of corroding what remained of the other man\u2019s soul. And if the Ghost snapped . . . A chill snaked its way up Judd\u2019s spine. \u201cI will not tell him.\u201d</p><p>Xavier dipped his head in voiceless acknowledgment before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken of it, but there are a number of Psy among my congregation.\u201d</p> <p>Judd bit back his surprise. Religion was nonexistent in the PsyNet. Silence did not allow for it. \u201cDo they come to you for guidance?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile that did nothing to ease the tension around Xavier\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo, they hide in the shadows. But I know they are there, and some have been coming for long enough that I feel they are mine to watch over.\u201d</p><p>Judd waited as the priest opened his Bible and withdrew a folded piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cA few of them have, over time, trusted me with their contact details.\u201d He passed the paper to Judd. \u201cThis woman, Gloria, has attended the service every Thursday night without fail for two years.\u201d</p><p>Judd had been an assassin, an Arrow the Council used as a weapon. He connected the dots before Xavier drew them. \u201cShe has stopped coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once, tonight,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cBut she always contacts me if there\u2019s even a chance she might miss a service. I received no message today, and no one answers when I attempt to call.\u201d</p><p>Memorizing the information on the slip of paper\u2014a simple telephone number\u2014Judd passed it back to Xavier. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d</p><p>Xavier slid the paper back into the Bible, his dark eyes drenched with worry. \u201cHer soul was so lost when she first began coming\u2014she was cold to the point of lifelessness. This past year, though, I could see her coming to life.\u201d</p> <p>Judd didn\u2019t say anything, but he had a feeling that Gloria\u2019s awakening had brought her the wrong kind of attention\u2014the kind that led to rehabilitation. No one came back from rehabilitation. It erased the personality, wiped the mind, and left only the shambling husk of an empty shell behind.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Indigo didn\u2019t see Drew the next morning as she strode through the corridors, her destination the small office that was her own near the training rooms. She\u2019d glimpsed him leaving Riaz\u2019s party early with Judd the previous night. Now she found herself wondering if he\u2019d stayed with the Psy lieutenant, or hunted up one of his little playmates and gone horizontal.</p><p>Gritting her teeth against her mind\u2019s obliging slide show of images that displayed Drew tangled up with some faceless female, she told herself she should\u2019ve taken up one of the offers that had come her way last night as the senior members of the pack let down their hair. A good sweaty workout between the sheets would certainly have wrung the tension out of her body. But she hadn\u2019t\u2014for reasons she couldn\u2019t quite understand\u2014and now she was paying for it, her skin too sensitive, her wolf irritated and out of sorts.</p><p>Ordering herself to focus, she switched on her datapad as she walked, bringing up the day\u2019s schedule. She\u2019d been in charge of training the novice soldiers for eight years, four of them as assistant to her father, Abel, the last four on her own, with Abel taking over another role. However, over the past couple of years, she\u2019d also started handling more personal issues related to the young dominants in the pack. They came to her with questions, for advice, to vent, and sometimes just to hang out\u2014because her wolf calmed theirs. \u201cWhich you will not be able to do unless you get yourself under control,\u201d she muttered, annoyed with herself for allowing Drew to rattle her in this way.</p><p>That was when she ran into the one person who could take one look at her and read her like an open book.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d her mother said, her smile so full of love it made Indigo\u2019s heart ache, \u201cgive me a hug.\u201d</p><p>Indigo was already leaning across to do exactly that, every part of her adoring this woman who was the template from which she\u2019d been cast. Tarah Riviere had the same jet-black hair, though hers bore a few\u2014very few\u2014glimmers of silver now, the same vivid blue eyes shot with streaks that were almost purple, the same long-legged height.</p><p>But that was where the similarities ended. Where Indigo\u2019s frame was all supple muscle, her mother was fit but sweetly curved. Where Indigo was a dominant and had been from soon after birth, Tarah was a true submissive, one of the gentlest people in the pack. And where Indigo would never surrender everything to any man\u2014even one she loved\u2014Tarah found incomparable joy in leaning on her mate.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Cupping Indigo\u2019s face in her hands, her mother examined her with those wise eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you, my big girl?\u201d</p><p>With every other person in the den, Indigo would\u2019ve stood firm and frozen off any inquiries. In front of her mother\u2019s tender concern, she folded like a leaky balloon. \u201cI\u2019m fighting with Drew,\u201d she said, hoping Tarah would take that at face value. She really didn\u2019t want to explain the genesis of the fight.</p><p>Tarah laughed and, dropping her hands from Indigo\u2019s face, slipped her arm through her daughter\u2019s and began to walk toward one of the large common areas in the den. \u201cHave you got time for a morning coffee with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d It was a ritual they had\u2014though it had no rules, no set dates. But at least a couple of times a week, Indigo found herself alone with Tarah. Sometimes they chatted over coffee, sometimes they walked in the forest, and sometimes they made a bowl of popcorn and watched some movie that made them both bawl like babies.</p><p>Her father tended to avoid being in those nights.</p><p>Grinning, Indigo found herself thinking back over the years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this in one form or another since I was, what, ten?\u201d It was, she knew, because of Evangeline.</p><p>Her much younger sister had been frighteningly weak as a child, though no one could diagnose the reason behind it. Indigo would catch a cold and be up and running the next day. Evie would catch a cold and need to be hooked up to machines so she could breathe, her little body wracked by shivers. It used to terrify Indigo that she might lose the sister she loved so much\u2014and to something Indigo couldn\u2019t fight, couldn\u2019t defend against.</p><p>Her mother squeezed her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re my baby, too.\u201d</p><p>Indigo shifted closer to her mother, the wolf wanting to brush up against her as they walked. \u201cHow is Evie? I haven\u2019t spoken to her for a few days.\u201d Her sister had finally thrown off the inexplicable\u2014especially for a changeling\u2014sickliness in her teens. Now in her second year of college, she was a sweet-tempered, submissive wolf chased by more than one young wolf in the den\u2014and humans outside of it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming for a visit in three weeks\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s wolf stretched out its paws and arched its back in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Tarah continued, \u201cshe told me to tell you not to scare off all the men beforehand\u2014she wants to date the wild and dangerous types, thank you very much.\u201d Laughing at the look on Indigo\u2019s face, she said, \u201cGrab us a good seat. I\u2019ll get the coffees.\u201d</p><p>Still scowling at the idea of her willow-slender sister with some of the rougher young males, Indigo wandered through the room filled with furniture in bright citrus tones until she found two armchairs facing each other in a quiet corner. They were both a funky orange, the table between them a dark, varnished wood that bore the nicks and scratches of constant use.</p><p>\u201cHey, Indigo.\u201d</p><p>Waving a casual hello at Tai as the young soldier passed by, she settled in to wait for her mom. That was part of the ritual, too. It was always Tarah who got the coffee, mixing the ingredients in a way that made it taste incredible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s love, Tarah had once laughingly said. That\u2019s the secret ingredient.</p><p>\u201cIndigo?\u201d Tai had circled back.</p><p>She looked up into his pretty, pretty face, all silky hair and those wild green eyes with a slight upward tilt that spoke of the Balinese ancestry on his mother\u2019s side. \u201cYes, she\u2019s coming home for a visit. No, I will not give you a free pass. You put one finger on her, I\u2019ll beat you to a pulp.\u201d</p> <p>Tai snarled low in his throat, his wide shoulders going stiff as he fisted his hands. \u201cYeah, well, maybe I\u2019ll beat you back.\u201d Face thunderous, he stalked off as she fought her smile. Hmm, perhaps Judd\u2019s young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had potential. None of the others had dared stand up to her. And Indigo wasn\u2019t handing over her vulnerable younger sister to a wolf who couldn\u2019t protect her from all comers.</p><p>Tarah placed a tray between them as Tai left the common room. It held two steaming mugs of coffee and a couple of large blueberry muffins. \u201cThey were the last ones there,\u201d Tarah said, shaking her head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack\u2019s got a young population,\u201d Indigo said, taking a sip of her coffee before putting down the mug and picking up a muffin. \u201cYou should see how much some of my trainees go through in a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the young population\u201d\u2014Tarah eyed Indigo over the top of her own mug\u2014\u201cI told you not to scare off Evie\u2019s dates.\u201d</p><p>Indigo wasn\u2019t the least cowed by her mother\u2019s mock scowl, well able to see the amusement behind it. \u201cShe\u2019s mine to look after.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always were possessive about her.\u201d Shaking her head, Tarah sipped her coffee.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Indigo asked after several minutes of companionable silence.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p><p>Indigo felt her lips curve. Tarah alone could call her that and make it sound perfectly acceptable. Of course, her father tended to call her \u201cpumpkin\u201d and ruffle her hair like she was five years old. No respect, she thought with an inward smile, she got no respect from her parents. \u201cDo you ever get angry at Dad?\u201d</p><p>Tarah\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cSure I do. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean the little spats.\u201d Though you couldn\u2019t really call them that, either. Her parents were so in sync it was scary. \u201cBut at his dominance . . . don\u2019t you sometimes wish he\u2019d let you take control?\u201d She\u2019d never before asked her mother that question, had always felt it would cross some line, but today, she needed to know.</p> <p>Putting her mug on the table, Tarah leaned forward and picked a blueberry from her muffin. She chewed thoughtfully before answering. \u201cNo,\u201d she said at last, her response free of ambiguity. \u201cMy wolf needs to feel protected, feel safe.\u201d Angling her head when Indigo remained silent, Tarah said, \u201cI know you\u2019ve never understood that, baby, for all that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d A gentle command that had Indigo swallowing her apology. \u201cThe fact is, you\u2019re a dominant\u2014that\u2019s why you and your father always butted heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA terror.\u201d It was a cheerful reply. \u201cBut because of the hierarchy, we could deal with you without too many problems. Your father outranked you\u2014so when push came to shove, you had to listen.\u201d</p><p>Now Indigo outranked Abel\u2014though she would never in a million years actually bring that up. Ever. Some relationships were sacred, and when she was with her father, Indigo treated him as the dominant. \u201cThat used to make me crazy\u2014that he could shut me down by pulling rank,\u201d she said in answer to her mother\u2019s statement, \u201cbut at the same time, it was calming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see, you do understand.\u201d Tarah plucked out another blueberry. \u201cStrict adherence to the hierarchy helps maintain the balance of the pack. Our wolves are happiest when they know their place in the scheme of things. For my wolf, that place is in the shelter of Abel\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>Indigo gave a slow nod, seeing a deeper truth in her mother\u2019s words. \u201cI would never be happy,\u201d she said, the words spilling out before she realized how much they might betray, \u201ceither with a man who treated me as a submissive or with a man my wolf saw as weaker.\u201d</p> <p>Tarah gave her a penetrating look and Indigo knew her mother saw too much, but all she said was, \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Your place is not the same as mine. For you to be happy, you must accept and respect your partner to the very core of your soul\u2014or your wolf will make both your lives a misery.\u201d</p><p>Having come down to the city to talk to one of his contacts in the human population, Andrew decided to say hi to Teijan as well, figuring he might as well use the time in a productive fashion. Because if he went back to the den, he\u2019d undoubtedly end up tracking Indigo. And he couldn\u2019t tip his hand, not yet, not before he was prepared.</p><p>So he was waiting for the Rat alpha at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf as the sun rose high enough to chase off the whispers of fog that still licked over the bay. Teijan turned up as slick and neatly attired as if he\u2019d stepped out of some sophisticated men\u2019s magazine.</p><p>\u201cShucks,\u201d Andrew said, leaning his arms on the metal fence that lined this section of the wharf, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to get all dolled up on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be so lucky.\u201d Teijan aligned his cuffs with the sleeves of his jacket. \u201cI\u2019m going for a job interview.\u201d</p><p>Andrew narrowed his eyes. \u201cSince when does the Rat alpha need to find a job?\u201d Teijan operated what was effectively the biggest information network in the city, and probably the state. And there was serious money in information\u2014especially since SnowDancer and DarkRiver had both decided to share the profits from any deals that came about because of intel the Rats passed on.</p><p>Brutal fact was, they could\u2019ve demanded that data as a condition of allowing the weaker changeling group to remain in the city, but Lucas and Hawke were highly intelligent men. They understood that the Rats would be far more invested in the protection of the city if they not only had the right to call it home but were treated as an integral part of its functioning. Which they were most assuredly becoming.</p><p>Now Teijan shot him a sharp little smile, full of teeth. \u201cFunny how easy it is to get into some buildings if you carry a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and look \u2018respectable.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing to tell yet.\u201d The dark-haired male looked out over the glittering sun-struck water of the bay. \u201cMy animal knows it can swim,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut just the same, neither it nor the human part of me is too fond of the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cWe\u2019d been scraping by, trying to find a home for a long time, and the old subway tunnels were unclaimed.\u201d A whisper of wind ruffled his GQ-perfect hair. \u201cGood thing it was the cats who found us out. You wolves would\u2019ve probably decided we tasted good spit-roasted over an open fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo self-respecting wolf would eat a rodent\u2014though we might\u2019ve been able to use your teeth as decorations,\u201d Andrew said with a straight face.</p><p>Teijan hissed out a very unratlike snarl. \u201cWhy the hell do I bother to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke thinks I give you cheese.\u201d He pulled a small, foil-wrapped wedge out of his pocket. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d But the Rat alpha was laughing. \u201cWhy\u2019d you want to meet?\u201d</p><p>Putting both hands in the pockets of his jacket, Andrew let the salt-laced wind sweep across his face. \u201cWanted to see if you had any news to share.\u201d DarkRiver always copied SnowDancer in on any reports as per their alliance, but Teijan quite often had little tidbits in progress that he didn\u2019t put into the reports until he\u2019d confirmed everything.</p><p>\u201cSomething weird going on with the Psy,\u201d the Rat alpha now said. \u201cCan\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say they were jumpy.\u201d</p><p>Since Psy didn\u2019t feel, that kind of apprehension was more than curious. \u201cAnything to back up that feeling?\u201d he asked, knowing Teijan had finely developed antennae for trouble after keeping his people safe and protected for years in spite of their lack of numbers and physical strength.</p><p>Teijan made a clicking noise with his tongue. \u201cI\u2019ve heard whispers of two or three Psy dead in suspicious circumstances, but no confirmations yet. Could just be a bad rehabilitation or two.\u201d</p><p>Andrew felt his skin creep at the thought of the Psy punishment of choice\u2014a total psychic brainwipe that destroyed the individual and left a drooling shell behind. \u201cMaybe they suicided.\u201d At Teijan\u2019s glance, he shrugged. \u201cIf that was me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Teijan blew out a breath. \u201cBut word is there\u2019s nobody home after rehab, and there would have to be for them to understand what they\u2019d become.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI better get going. I\u2019ll send the intel through the grapevine if I hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>As Andrew watched the other man leave, he wondered what face this world would\u2019ve worn if the Psy Council had been successful in seizing total power as it had been trying to do for decades.</p><p>The vision was chilling.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>Shaking off the brutal images, he shifted on his heel to find himself facing Lara. \u201cYou must\u2019ve come down before the shops opened,\u201d he said, looking at the bags she had in hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a bad mood,\u201d she said. \u201cI decided to work it off by spending money, but I hate everything I\u2019ve bought. Who needs a stupid yellow dress anyway? Not someone with my skin tone.\u201d That skin, a natural dark tan stroked with gold in this light, scrunched up as she made a face.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll look gorgeous in yellow.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, cuddling her smaller body to his. Like most people in the den, he tended to forget she wasn\u2019t that much older than he was, she was so competent. But today she looked unbearably young. \u201cThis bad mood have anything to do with\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d she warned, even as she slid her own arm around his waist, the soft black of her corkscrew curls glinting with sparks of red. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t hassle you about Indigo.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cHow the hell do you healers pull that shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade secret.\u201d A hint of a smile, those high cheekbones giving her eyes an almost feline appearance as she glanced up. \u201cHow come she\u2019s so mad at you?\u201d she asked with a blunt honesty that reminded him of Ben, the pup the healer often babysat for her friend Ava.</p> <p>\u201cNot telling.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched her nose at him. \u201cYou going to do anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Andrew thought of the plan he\u2019d hatched late last night. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m going to do something about it.\u201d And the lieutenant would never see it coming.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Having said good-bye to her mother a few minutes earlier, Indigo found Hawke and they sat down to coordinate the pack\u2019s resources. \u201cWe have a lieutenant meeting later today,\u201d she said toward the end.</p> <p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Rising from his desk, he folded his arms, unfolded them, then shoved his hands through his hair, hair that echoed the stunning color of his pelt in wolf form. Right now, that wolf was riding him hard.</p><p>\u201cWant to go for a run?\u201d she asked, feeling more than a little twitchy herself. \u201cWe could both use it.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Hawke didn\u2019t even bother to pretend he didn\u2019t need to let the wolf roam told her more than anything else. \u201cWolf or human?\u201d he asked, his voice shifting in a way that made it clear the wolf was already in charge. His eyes, too, shimmered in the most subtle of ways\u2014the wolf watching her from a human face.</p><p>\u201cHuman wolf,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s harder to maintain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>By the time they cleared the den, her wolf was at the forefront of her mind. She was still physically human, but her thought processes were no longer those of the cool, collected lieutenant. They were of the wolf who lived in her soul\u2014of her body, only her eyes would\u2019ve reflected the change. Though as they began to run, she felt her claws pricking at the insides of her skin and decided to let them slice through.</p> <p>They ran side by side, getting out of the White Zone and into the thick darkness of the forest beyond, the trees whipping by in a blur of rich green and\u2014as they began to climb higher\u2014the occasional splash of snowy white. She was damn fast, but she knew Hawke could\u2019ve outstripped her. It wasn\u2019t simply that he was alpha\u2014though that played a part in it. Her own wolf didn\u2019t want to outstrip him, would\u2019ve been confused if it could. But a larger part of it was that he was naturally faster.</p><p>But she was making him work for it, and that was what was important. It was a lieutenant\u2019s job to challenge her alpha when necessary\u2014as it was an alpha\u2019s job to look after his pack. So Indigo ran them both to the edge of exhaustion, flying over fallen rocks and old trees, branches grazing her arms and threatening to slap her face, the wind a crisp knife across her skin.</p><p>Her wolf gloried in the rush of speed, the pump of blood, the wild pleasure of running with a packmate. It was only when they reached the top of a ridge, when there was only silence around them, the pack lands spread out below in a sea of white, green, and lake blue, that the wolf sighed and halted. Hawke stood with his hands on his knees beside her, chest heaving and face gleaming with sweat.</p><p>Glancing at him, she saw his wolf grinning back at her, the shimmering ice of his eyes filled with fierce joy. She grinned back, allowing herself to collapse onto her back on the snow-dusted grass, the chill a welcome kiss against her heated skin. The sky was a gorgeous crystalline blue overhead, Hawke\u2019s eyes a curious and much paler hue as he looked down at her, his head angled in a way that was simply not human.</p><p>She snapped her teeth at him.</p><p>It made him laugh, relax, and lie down beside her, their arms companionably tangled. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, his voice holding the edge of a growl.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she replied, her own wolf prowling contentedly inside her skin.</p><p>Shifting, Hawke raised himself on his elbow before leaning down to nip at her lower lip in a quick, sharp bite.</p> <p>With those amazing eyes, and that gorgeous mane of silver-gold, many women would\u2019ve taken what he\u2019d done as a sensual invitation. She was wolf. She knew that coming from her alpha, it was very much the opposite.</p><p>Rubbing at her lip, she scowled. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Because it had been a rebuke. A playful one, sure, but a rebuke nonetheless.</p><p>Hawke tapped her on the nose with his index finger. \u201cMy wolf can sense that yours is in trouble. Why didn\u2019t you come to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, pushing him away with a growl when he would\u2019ve used his teeth on her a second time. Yes, he was alpha, but she was a dominant female. \u201cCorrection\u2014it is something, but it\u2019s not anything I need your help to manage.\u201d Drew was her problem, and she would get a handle on the situation.</p><p>Bracing himself on his elbow again, Hawke watched her for several more minutes, the eye contact searing. His wolf was far closer to the surface than that of any other male in the pack, and she was one of the few people who probably knew why. Reaching up, she clenched a hand in his hair and tugged him down until their noses almost touched. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s got a problem.\u201d</p><p>He growled at her. She let him feel her claws against his face. Ice blue eyes locked with her own. \u201cYou know what it is,\u201d he finally said, his voice so deep it was difficult to understand. Rolling away from her, he lay on his back with one arm under his head.</p><p>Yeah, Indigo knew what it was. \u201cShe\u2019s far older now than she was when she first entered the den.\u201d</p><p>Hawke said nothing. He didn\u2019t need to\u2014she could all but feel his thrumming tension.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to stop you if you decide to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hawke was suddenly leaning over her in one of those electric snaps of movement, his wolf very much in charge. \u201cRiley made it clear she was off-limits.\u201d</p><p>Indigo knew her fellow lieutenant had issued that warning not simply because Sienna was family and thus his to protect, but because the girl had needed time to come into her own before she had to pit the strength of her personality against Hawke\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThen, she was.\u201d She stroked her fingers through his hair because he needed the touch of Pack. \u201cNow . . . she\u2019s stronger. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s ready for the full Hawke assault\u201d\u2014her wolf bared its teeth when he growled\u2014\u201cbut she can take a little bit.\u201d That said more about Indigo\u2019s judgment of Sienna Lauren than anything else\u2014because there were very few women on the planet who she thought might be able to handle Hawke.</p><p>The fact that the top contender was an eighteen-heading-for-nineteen-year-old Psy defector was one hell of a surprise, but that didn\u2019t mean they should just ignore the subject and hope it went away. Especially not when the girl seemed to reach parts of Hawke no one else could even see.</p><p>Indigo knew what Hawke had said to Riley when the subject came up last time, waited to see if he would reject the idea out of hand again. As she watched, he flowed to his feet and went to crouch at the edge of the cliff, his back and hair dusted with ice crystals that glittered in the sunlight. \u201cWe should get back,\u201d he said after several long minutes, his voice human once more.</p><p>Indigo didn\u2019t push. This was a decision Hawke would have to make on his own. Because once made, she knew that decision would be final and absolute. If he decided to pursue Sienna . . . Sucking in a breath, Indigo promised herself she\u2019d warn the girl if and when the time came\u2014because no woman should have to face that kind of a campaign unprepared.</p><p>In spite of his determination to keep his distance, Andrew found himself following the compulsion to track down Indigo as soon as he returned to the den\u2014only to be told that she\u2019d gone running with Hawke.</p><p>Images of what they might be doing at that moment slammed into him without warning. Indigo was the highest-ranking female in the den. Only two people outranked her. Riley, who was happily mated to Mercy. And Hawke.</p><p>Who was very definitely not mated.</p><p>Claws digging into his palms, he shut himself inside his room and tried to fight the buzzing in his head, to think. That proved close to impossible. No matter all his plans, all his instructions to himself, he might\u2019ve gone off half-cocked and made a fool of himself if his cell phone hadn\u2019t rung at that moment.</p><p>He answered without looking at the caller ID. \u201cAndrew speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything in the den?\u201d came Riley\u2019s familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cRelax, big brother.\u201d Andrew tried for a breezy tone. \u201cWe\u2019re managing to limp along without you.\u201d</p><p>A small pause. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. His oldest sibling knew him better than anyone else\u2014there was no way he\u2019d buy a bullshit answer. \u201cI have a question. Have Indigo and Hawke ever . . .\u201d Acid burned in his gut as he gave voice to a possibility he\u2019d never even considered before.</p><p>Another, longer pause. \u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>Andrew collapsed into a sitting position on the bed. \u201cNow you have to forget I ever asked you that question.\u201d</p><p>Other wolves might have teased, but Riley handled it in his own way. \u201cPiece of advice\u2014don\u2019t ever let Indigo catch even a hint that you had that particular thought. The asinine stupidity of it will outweigh any gains you make.\u201d</p><p>Andrew winced. \u201cI\u2019m not making many gains right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were a kid,\u201d Riley said, \u201cit was impossible to make you let go of a toy once you\u2019d clamped your teeth on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndigo\u2019s hardly a toy.\u201d No, what she was, was a tough, intelligent woman who would fall easily into no man\u2019s arms\u2014least of all one she was determined to think of as off-limits.</p><p>\u201cThe point,\u201d Riley said dryly, \u201cis that you\u2019re even more stubborn than I am\u2014just takes people a hell of a lot longer to figure it out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That suddenly, Andrew\u2019s brain started functioning again. Smiling at the thought of sinking his teeth into Indigo\u2014not to hurt, just to mark a little\u2014he said, \u201cHow\u2019s the vacation going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy\u2019s grandparents want cubs or pups to spoil\u2014they\u2019re not fussy which. Tomorrow would be nice, but they\u2019re willing to give us a whole entire year to \u2018get down to the business.\u2019\u201d Riley\u2019s tone was deadpan, but Andrew didn\u2019t miss the way his voice softened when he spoke of children.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s grandparents, he thought, might just get their wish sooner rather than later. \u201cBrenna\u2019s out with Judd,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cbut you should be able to get her on her cell. I know she wants to catch up with you.\u201d Having effectively raised both Andrew and Brenna, Riley was, for want of a better word, the patriarch of the Kincaid family. Even Brenna\u2019s assassin of a mate treated Riley with quiet respect. They all missed him\u2014and his rock-solid advice\u2014when he wasn\u2019t in the den.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her a quick call.\u201d A rustle. \u201cMercy says to tell you she hopes you\u2019re behaving.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling at the thought of Riley\u2019s fiery mate, Andrew said, \u201cNot a bit.\u201d</p><p>Mercy came on the line an instant later. \u201cDid I hear you say something about Indigo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy,\u201d Andrew began.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not going to meddle. But I am going to give you a little advice in return for something important you said to me once, so listen up.\u201d</p><p>Not having been born stupid, no matter his recent actions, Andrew did just that.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anyone but who you are,\u201d the leopard sentinel told him. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you the element of surprise when you pounce.\u201d</p><p>On the surface, it was a lighthearted comment, but Andrew saw it for the truth it was. How had Mercy known? he thought. How had she guessed that his confidence had been badly dented by the knowledge that he was so much not what Indigo had in mind for her mate? However she\u2019d known, he was grateful for the boost. \u201cThanks, Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say\u2014you remind me of the fiends I call brothers.\u201d An affectionate comment. \u201c\u2019Bye, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up after replying in kind, he took a deep breath and fired off a quick e-mail to Hawke with his notes on what Teijan had shared. And though the temptation to track down Indigo was a fever in his gut, he set his jaw and went to the weight room, funneling his need into the physical. Because when he, as Mercy had put it, \u201cpounced,\u201d he wanted Indy all to himself, no avenues of escape, no buffer of pack.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>In spite of her earlier run with Hawke, Indigo couldn\u2019t quite find her balance at that afternoon\u2019s lieutenant meeting. She told herself it had nothing to do with the fact that she\u2019d seen Drew only minutes ago, his hair damp with sweat and his arm around Lucy as the sunny-natured young female hugged him affectionately.</p> <p>Women loved Drew. No wonder he\u2019d thought he could get Indigo into bed with so little trouble\u2014and then pick up right where they\u2019d left off, as if he hadn\u2019t fundamentally altered the nature of the relationship between them. Her wolf bared its fangs at the idea of being lumped in with his little playmates until she had to consciously fight for control. It was as well that she was sitting in a special comm room surrounded by SnowDancer lieutenants.</p><p>Because of the breadth of SnowDancer territory, it was rare for all the lieutenants to meet in person. However, they had monthly meetings by comm-conference and each lieutenant passed through the den at least once every two months, which ensured the pack continued to function as a cohesive unit. Hawke, too, made trips to each part of their territory on a regular basis. Then there was Drew, who, with the support of his small and tight-knit team, roamed across the state on an as-needed basis.</p><p>Gritting her teeth as the damn wolf intruded into her thoughts once again, she looked up and focused on the screens set up in a semicircle around the room. The computronic setup allowed all of them to interact with each other at such an effective level that they often forgot they weren\u2019t actually in the same physical location.</p><p>Jem\u2014real name Garnet\u2014had logged in from Los Angeles and was currently trading barbs with the startlingly green-eyed Kenji, something the two of them did so often, there was a running pool on exactly when they\u2019d rip each other\u2019s clothes off and just get it over with.</p><p>Alexei and Matthias were watching, quiet as always. Those two only moved when necessary, and they spoke even less most of the time. Of the two, Alexei, with his sun gold hair and movie star looks, was probably the more talkative\u2014which meant he spoke maybe two words an hour instead of one.</p><p>Cooper, as one of the more senior sentinels\u2014his place in the hierarchy similar to Riaz\u2019s\u2014looked on with open amusement, his skin gleaming a rich dark bronze in the sunlight pouring in through what Indigo knew to be a huge window to the left of his office, the jagged scar along his left cheek adding a rough accent to his features.</p><p>Women tended to look at him and shiver in a mix of fear and anticipation.</p><p>That was the closest they\u2019d ever come to him, because Coop was crazy in love with\u2014and courting\u2014a woman so sweet, it had the whole pack abuzz. No one had expected mad, bad, and dangerous Coop to fall head over heels for the submissive wolf, least of all the wolf herself. Indigo bit back a grin as she thought of how bewildered Coop\u2019s beloved had looked when it had dawned on her that she was being pursued by one of the most lethal men in the pack. That hadn\u2019t lasted long. Because she might\u2019ve been sweet, might\u2019ve been submissive, but as Coop was learning, that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have a mind\u2014and a will\u2014of her own.</p> <p>Then there was Tom\u00e1s, who happened to be one of Drew\u2019s closest friends\u2014and consequently, seemed to take nothing seriously and had a way of smiling with those chocolate-dark eyes that made most women melt into puddles of goo.</p><p>Indigo gave Tom\u00e1s a quelling stare when he glanced at Jem and Kenji and winked. But she couldn\u2019t help her wolf\u2019s answering grin. Because seriously . . . \u201cYou two need to get a room.\u201d</p><p>Jem didn\u2019t even stop arguing to give Indigo a highly specific nonverbal gesture with one deceptively delicate-looking hand. Kenji echoed the move with such unerring accuracy, it was as if they\u2019d synchronized it across two different parts of the state. Next to Indigo, Riaz mouthed, \u201cKenji\u201d to Tom\u00e1s, who shook his head and mouthed, \u201cJem.\u201d Riaz held up a hand, fingers spread. Tom\u00e1s nodded, accepting the bet.</p><p>Judd said nothing from where he sat two seats to Indigo\u2019s left, but he was relaxed to an extent he\u2019d never have been a year ago, his chair tilted back to lean against the wall and his legs stretched out in front. But no matter his apparently lazy pose, Indigo had no doubts that he\u2019d seen and logged every word that had passed since he entered the room.</p><p>Pushing back her own chair, Indigo put her legs up on the table in front of her and raised a hand in a casual wave as Hawke arrived to grab the empty seat on her right. \u201cNow that we\u2019re all here, we can begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me a break, Indy.\u201d Hawke grinned at the look she shot him, but his next words were pure growl. \u201cI just spent ten minutes explaining to the juveniles why they can\u2019t go around sniffing after the leopard girls without expecting to get their asses kicked by the leopard boys at least once. When the hell is Riley coming back?\u201d</p><p>Alexei and Matthias both smiled, slowly and with the wolf in their eyes, while Tom\u00e1s rocked back and laughed with open amusement, the lean male dimples that creased his cheeks turning his handsome face even more gorgeous. Shaking her head, Indigo reached over to tap Hawke lightly on the cheek with her pen. \u201cYou\u2019ll live.\u201d Turning back to the others, she said, \u201cKenji, cut the foreplay. Report.\u201d</p><p>Kenji switched into lieutenant mode so fast, Indigo would\u2019ve gotten whiplash if she hadn\u2019t seen him do the exact same thing before. \u201cNothing significant to report. We\u2019ve had a few extra Psy move into the region, but our intel says they\u2019re no threat\u2014looks like most came in for a job at a new Psy computronics factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny indication the factory is a front for something else?\u201d Hawke asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my eye on it.\u201d Kenji thrust back strands of his stick-straight black hair. \u201cBut everything checks out so far. And it\u2019s one of Nikita Duncan\u2019s\u2014she tends to like to keep her profits separate from her politics.\u201d</p><p>Indigo agreed with that assessment, but made a note to have the den\u2019s resident hackers dig deeper into the factory\u2019s files nonetheless. \u201cTom\u00e1s, how\u2019s your patch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo change.\u201d</p><p>Jem went next. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a spike in the murder rate, but it looks to be human-on-human gang violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou on it?\u201d Hawke tapped a finger restlessly on the arm of his chair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already had a talk with the gangs. They want to make trouble, they don\u2019t do it in our territory.\u201d What was left unsaid was that if they continued, they\u2019d soon find themselves hunted down like so much prey. The pack didn\u2019t hold the largest territory in the country because it played nice. One warning was all you got.</p><p>Matthias spoke for the first time, and his deep voice was a pleasure to listen to, resonant and with an almost impossible clarity. \u201cI sent you that note about some weird ship movements. We haven\u2019t been able to pin anything down yet, but I\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>Indigo looked at Cooper. \u201cAnything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got two female novices who\u2019re showing signs of skill at sharpshooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend me their details,\u201d Judd said. \u201cI\u2019ll evaluate them and set up a training schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Coop,\u201d Tom\u00e1s called out, the devil in his eye. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with your pretty little wolf?\u201d</p><p>Cooper glanced over, unruffled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the last to know. But the next time you send her flowers, I\u2019m going to come over for a nice friendly visit and shove them where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ignoring the suspicious cough that seemed to have affected everyone in the meeting, Indigo pointed at Alexei.</p><p>\u201cThis sector\u2019s stable,\u201d the young lieutenant said, making a valiant effort to fight a laugh, \u201cthough I think we need to organize one of the packwide parties again. I\u2019ve got too many unmated adults in my area and they\u2019re starting to irritate each other.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Indigo needed to be thinking about was the sexual hunger of their animals, but she set her jaw and got to it\u2014because fact was, touch-hungry changelings, especially wolves as aggressive as those in SnowDancer, needed an outlet\u2014and if they couldn\u2019t have sex, they\u2019d choose violence. Add in the lack of choice in Alexei\u2019s comparatively small sector and you had a recipe for trouble.</p> <p>\u201cMay,\u201d she said, checking her calendar. \u201cWe can have a week-long event in den territory. That\u2019ll give us the flexibility to ensure security doesn\u2019t slip.\u201d</p><p>No one had any issues with that, so they moved on.</p><p>\u201cThe falcons are making use of the flight treaty,\u201d Matthias said toward the end, his thickly lashed eyes dark and intense. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them flying over my sector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Alexei leaned forward, bracing his arms on a glowing cherrywood desk. \u201cWhere are we on a possible alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cI sent Drew to spend some time with them on the ground a month ago, and his report backs up my instincts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe in the den?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cIt\u2019d be good to hear what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>When Hawke nodded, Indigo said, \u201cTen-minute break,\u201d in a tone she hoped sounded practical and nothing else, \u201cthen we reconvene. I\u2019ll hunt down Drew.\u201d</p><p>That proved to be child\u2019s play. He opened the door to his room with a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair wet. \u201cIndy.\u201d Blinking water from his eyes, he stepped back and angled his head. \u201cCome in. I was just about to throw some clothes on.\u201d</p><p>Heat uncurled in her abdomen\u2014because no matter how pissed she was at him, Andrew Kincaid made her fingers itch to touch. Smooth, gleaming skin, toned muscle, and those eyes that never lost the edge of wickedness. \u201cYou\u2019re needed in the main conference room, five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Heading back inside when she remained on the doorstep, he disappeared behind the door. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcons.\u201d Her mind insisted on providing her with all sorts of salacious images as she heard the soft rasp of the towel leaving his body to pool on the floor, the rougher sound of him pulling on jeans\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t be late,\u201d she bit out and swiveled on her heel.</p> <p>Andrew\u2019s fingers clenched convulsively on the T-shirt in his grasp. She was still mad; that much was clear. And no matter that keeping her angry was part of his ultimate strategy, he had the violent urge to tug her close and kiss the anger right off her lips.</p><p>Of course, he thought, in her current mood the only thing that would get him was a nicely eviscerated chest. \u201cCharm,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that\u2014it\u2019s all about charm. Stick to the plan.\u201d</p><p>Pulling on the T-shirt, he laced up his sneakers and made his way to the conference room. \u201cNice to see everyone hard at work,\u201d he said when he walked in to find them playing virtual poker.</p><p>There were a slew of responses to that, some rude, some friendly, but the game was cleared away in under a minute, with Alexei declared the winner. After the golden-haired lieutenant took a mock bow, Andrew\u2014viscerally aware of Indigo\u2019s silent presence on Hawke\u2019s other side\u2014laid out his impressions of the falcon wing.</p><p>\u201cGood, strong unit,\u201d he said. \u201cWell drilled and trained to work together. The ancestors of the core group formed the wing prior to the Territorial Wars, so they\u2019ve been around several hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they bigger in numbers by now?\u201d Judd asked from his position at the far end of the table.</p><p>Hawke was the one who answered. \u201cBirds tend to keep their wings small. I think it has to do with ensuring enough open sky, though I\u2019ve heard they stay in close contact with other wings across the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke\u2019s right,\u201d Andrew said, even as his wolf picked out Indigo\u2019s scent from all the other threads in the room and rolled around in it like a pup. \u201cI asked Adam, their wing leader, about that. He says their flight paths often overlap, so it makes sense to keep things pleasant. But the end result is that while WindHaven might not be huge, we ally with them, we gain access to a network of wings across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper raised an eyebrow. \u201cNothing to sneeze at. So long as they can handle us.\u201d A blunt truth. \u201cOtherwise, the dominance issues will make a mess of things.\u201d</p><p>Hawke rocked back in his chair, linking his hands behind his head. \u201cHaving dealt with Adam, and Jacques, his second, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to start the ball rolling?\u201d Indigo\u2019s voice, slicing through Andrew\u2019s concentration with the ease of a razor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to DarkRiver,\u201d Hawke said, \u201csee if they have any further information, but yeah, I think we should take advantage of the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Andrew listened as Indigo went through a couple of other matters before ending the meeting. Her words were crisp, her commands clear, and her intelligence as sharp as a blade\u2014there was no way in hell she was going to make this easy for him.</p><p>His wolf sat up in anticipation\u2014he\u2019d never wanted easy. He\u2019d always wanted Indigo. And tomorrow, he\u2019d have her all to himself, far from the den and the hierarchy . . . and the rules that she used to keep her own explosive response to him under vicious control. But he knew. He\u2019d tasted it.</p><p>And he was going to make Indy admit it\u2014even if he had to sneak in under her defenses using every dirty trick in the book. This was war. Who the hell cared about playing fair?</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Councilor Nikita Duncan met Councilor Anthony Kyriakus outside a small house situated on the heavily forested edges of Tahoe, having driven herself there in a bland gray sedan with tinted windows. \u201cWas this where your daughter lived while she was in the Net?\u201d she asked Anthony when he pushed open the door.</p><p>Anthony\u2019s black hair, silvered at the temples, lifted a fraction in the forest breeze as he answered. \u201cYes.\u201d He nodded at the door. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d As she entered, she took in everything about the place. The room immediately to her right may once have functioned as a living area, but was now an office/meeting room with a small table featuring a built-in computer panel and four chairs. \u201cDoes the F ability make an appearance every generation?\u201d The NightStar Group\u2019s grip on the market for foreseers was all but airtight.</p><p>\u201cThere are sporadic skips, but overall, yes,\u201d he said, as they took their seats opposite each other. \u201cIt is the same in your family, is it not?\u201d</p><p>Nikita answered because it was no secret\u2014the \u201cflawed\u201d E designation was the Duncan family\u2019s genetic millstone. \u201cIt tends to skip a generation.\u201d Not quite the truth, but close enough that it would pass. \u201cYou know why I contacted you.\u201d And why she\u2019d done it away from the dark skies of the PsyNet.</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes were penetrating as they met hers across the table. \u201cSomething is happening with the Arrow Squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ming was the official leader of the assassins who were the Council\u2019s most lethal army, but Nikita\u2019s spies had caught ripples that said things might well be changing. \u201cIf the leadership shifts, there are only two possible successors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaleb and Vasic,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cBut while Vasic is an Arrow and the single true teleporter in the Net, my information is that he doesn\u2019t consider himself a candidate for the position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, with his support, someone else could take the leadership.\u201d The squad was incredibly secretive, but Nikita wasn\u2019t a Councilor because she gave up at the first hurdle. She\u2019d unearthed enough data that she felt confident in saying, \u201cThere are rumors of another Arrow the squad may accept as a leader.\u201d</p><p>Anthony took a moment to reply. \u201cHis name is Aden. I\u2019m keeping an eye on affairs as they develop.\u201d</p><p>It was, Nikita understood, a very deliberate sharing of information. \u201cGood. But that situation, while important, isn\u2019t the critical one as far as we are concerned.\u201d Neither of them was in the fight to lead the Arrows.</p><p>Anthony made no pretense of not understanding her meaning. \u201cHenry and Shoshanna,\u201d he said. \u201cThey support the idea of Purity to the exclusion of all else, though it is clear that Silence is failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivided, we have a high chance of falling to their stratagems,\u201d she said, having made her decision the first time she called Anthony, \u201cbut together, we are a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Then she asked the most important question. \u201cWhere do you stand, Anthony?\u201d</p><p>Anthony took a drink from the glass of water at his elbow, answering only after almost ten seconds of thought. \u201cI do not support any group or system that would erase my individuality, and the Scotts are determined to create a true hive mind in one form or another.\u201d He put the glass on the table. \u201cMore importantly, they have interfered once too often in this territory\u2014and in my business interests.\u201d</p><p>Nikita wondered if the Scotts had attempted to meddle in Anthony\u2019s subcontracting agreement with his daughter. Not that the details mattered; whatever they had done, it was to Nikita\u2019s benefit. \u201cIf we are to work effectively together,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is something else we need to discuss.\u201d And then she spoke of death.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>It had taken Judd more time than he\u2019d expected to track down Xavier\u2019s missing parishioner, Gloria. His mate, with her brilliant mind, had done most of the cyber-detective work, backtracking the phone number and digging through layers of security to unearth the address that went with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo activity on her charge cards for the past four days,\u201d Brenna had said, worry a dark shadow in her eyes when she gave him the information. \u201cAnd it appears she\u2019s given up her lease. She might not even be there.\u201d</p><p>Now, in the chill quiet of the midnight hours, Judd picked the low-security lock on Gloria\u2019s former apartment and slipped inside. If there was someone within, he\u2019d teleport out before they ever saw him. But he felt only the cold emptiness of a place in which there had been no life for days.</p><p>Using a flashlight with its beam set on low, he checked both rooms. The furniture was still there, but from the looks of it, it might well have come with the apartment. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, no toiletries in the bathroom, and no food in the kitchen. More importantly, the apartment was clean.</p> <p>Very, very clean.</p><p>The kind of clean that meant someone had been erased out of existence.</p><p>Gloria was dead.</p><p>His instincts told him someone\u2014likely in the Council superstructure\u2014had sent in a cleanup crew to ensure no trace remained of the woman who\u2019d found herself in Xavier\u2019s church. But Judd wasn\u2019t going to give the priest that information until he was certain\u2014because there was a slight chance Gloria had been rehabilitated instead.</p><p>A fate worse than death.</p> <p>Deciding to work SnowDancer\u2019s Psy contacts when morning broke, he focused on the image of the bedroom he shared with his mate, and then . . . he was home. Dressed in a strawberry satin and white lace slip, Brenna lay curled up on his side of the futon. She always did that when he wasn\u2019t with her, as if she was holding him close even in sleep.</p><p>Taking off his clothes with a silent grace that came from a lifetime of training, he slipped in beside her, and then, bracing himself on one arm, leaned down to press a kiss to the silky warm curve of her neck.</p><p>She shivered, her body relaxing from its curled-up position as she turned to face him, her hands reaching out to press against his pectorals. \u201cJudd.\u201d It was a sleepy murmur of welcome, her wolf apparent in the brilliant night-glow he glimpsed between her barely parted lids.</p><p>Claiming her lips with his own, he moved his hand down over her pretty little nightdress until he found skin. Then he indulged in a pleasure that seemed to get ever more piercing, ever more intense. Once, he hadn\u2019t been able to touch her without causing himself pain. Now, it only hurt when he didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>Though the day dawned clear and bright, the sun promising a brilliant show, Indigo was in a snippy mood and she knew it well enough to keep it under control. It wasn\u2019t the fault of these poor teenagers milling in the White Zone that Drew was an idiot who\u2019d changed everything between them with an imbecilic play for sex\u2014then made the whole thing worse by refusing to face up to it.</p><p>Beating her snippiness into submission, she helped one of the juveniles tighten the straps of her small pack. \u201cYou looking forward to today, Silvia?\u201d</p> <p>The girl swallowed, flushing under the lush coffee of her skin, and her words, when they came out, were hesitant. \u201cI\u2019m not strong like you.\u201d</p><p>And that, Indigo thought, was even more of a problem than the control issues of the dominant males. \u201cYou listen to me,\u201d she said, cupping the girl\u2019s cheek, able to feel the soft down of youth against her callused palm, \u201cwe soldiers are the brawn, the muscle. It\u2019s the maternal females like you who are the heart of the pack. You\u2019re the glue that holds us together. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re the strongest part of SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>Silvia blinked those long, silky lashes, leaning her cheek a little into Indigo\u2019s touch. \u201cI . . . my mom said . . . but it\u2019s nice to hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Indigo hugged her, and they walked over to join the rest of the group. Twelve kids between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. All simply needing a little bit of extra attention to get them back on the right track. \u201cEveryone ready?\u201d</p><p>A sea of nods.</p><p>\u201cI thought Drew was coming,\u201d said a slender young male with a thick mop of pale brown hair and a voice that was far too deep for his scrawny body. It\u2019d be perfect when Brace grew into those shoulders, but right now, he tended to flush whenever he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHe can catch up.\u201d Okay, so maybe she wasn\u2019t over the snippy. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>She set a steady pace\u2014not so easy that they got bored, not so hard that they couldn\u2019t keep up\u2014taking them up into an unusual part of the mountains, one of such exquisite beauty it could make the heart stop, but an area even the pack rarely visited because it was more difficult to get to than so many other gorgeous spots. However, right now, it had the benefit of being almost entirely clear of snow, while comparable areas in the southern section of the Sierra remained packed with the white stuff.</p> <p>They stopped for snacks around midmorning. No sign of Drew.</p><p>If he left her alone all weekend, she\u2019d strip his hide. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, hoping her inner snarl didn\u2019t show. \u201cWe\u2019re not even halfway yet.\u201d</p><p>Pained groans, but she knew they were faking. She\u2019d felt their exhilaration as they tested their bodies, as they loosened up enough to speak to her, ask her questions. So she upped the speed, knowing they could take it, that they\u2019d be proud of it. But they were still exhausted when they walked over the edge of a hill and to the spot where she intended to break for lunch . . . to find the plateau set with a huge picnic blanket holding fruit, drinks, sandwiches, cake, and, of course, potato chips.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t only food waiting for them.</p><p>Drew bent at the waist, a checkered tea towel folded dramatically over his arm. \u201cWelcome to my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Indigo clenched her stomach muscles against the shock of seeing him face-to-face after having mentally eviscerated him for most of the journey. The juveniles had no such qualms. Cheering, they descended upon the feast as if every single one of them hadn\u2019t gorged on trail bars and dried fruit a bare couple of hours ago.</p><p>Drew skirted the plundering horde and walked across to join her. \u201cI set up a blanket for you over there. Thought you could do with a break.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf was more than suspicious of his solicitude after the recent awkwardness between them. Or maybe, she thought with a silent growl, this was all part of his \u201clet\u2019s just pretend it never happened\u201d policy. \u201cThis is why you abandoned me with twelve teenagers?\u201d She folded her arms, refusing to give in to the urge to fix the wind-tousled mess of his hair. That was something she might have done before. When he\u2019d been a trusted friend.</p><p>Reaching up, Drew flicked his ear. \u201cBig ears.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, she saw their charges were involved in the food, but he had a point. So she didn\u2019t argue when he urged her to follow him down the slope a little and onto a small shelf of land out of sight and downwind of the others.</p><p>The picnic blanket waiting there was smaller, striped with blue and white, and lying in a dappled patch of sunlight. A collapsible picnic basket sat a little to the side, while the blanket itself was set with small platters holding plump berries, sliced chicken, fluffy bread, what looked like a fresh salad, and two bottles of water that sparkled in the sun.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s wolf liked the idea of food, but neither it nor she was about to let Drew off the hook. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you could handle the juveniles\u201d\u2014easy words with no apparent undertone\u2014\u201cand I figured I\u2019d better run up here and check the trail in case of possible rock slides from the storm. Far as I know, no one\u2019s been up here since.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she should\u2019ve thought of that. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a message on your phone.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Indigo pulled her cell phone out of her pocket. Double damn. \u201cI forgot to charge it.\u201d Still angry\u2014though it was irrational and had nothing whatsoever to do with his actions today\u2014she finally shrugged off her pack and took a seat on the blanket.</p><p>Drew sat in silence as she made herself a sandwich, then he made one for himself. The air up here was crisp, fresh, and somehow freeing. She felt her shoulders loosen up, her emotions turn mellow in spite of her vivid, almost uncomfortable awareness of the male wolf sitting on the other side of the picnic basket. When he reached for the basket, she was curious enough to glance over. \u201cWhat else have you got?\u201d</p><p>A smile that lit up his eyes to a blinding shade, making her suck in a startled breath. She wasn\u2019t obstinate without reason\u2014she could admit Drew had a way about him. He\u2019d always used it to make her smile before. But she wasn\u2019t ready to be charmed today.</p><p>Then he opened the bakery box in his hand to reveal a slice of New York cheesecake. \u201cSince I ruined the experience of the other one.\u201d Putting it on the blanket between them, he placed several fresh berries on top and nudged it her way. \u201cIt\u2019s all for you.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s heart threatened to melt, but she held firm. Sure, he looked woebegone, but she\u2019d known him far too long to fall for that. \u201cThanks.\u201d Taking the cheesecake, she picked up the fork and ate a bite, watching as Drew packed up the rest of the stuff and moved the basket so he could sidle up right next to her. \u201cWatch it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she glanced at him\u2014to see that those always-laughing eyes had gone truly solemn, his expression intent. \u201cAbout what?\u201d Her wolf had to be certain. Neither part of her liked shades of gray.</p><p>\u201cAbout the way I acted the other night.\u201d A sheepish smile. \u201cYou were right. I was high on adrenaline\u2014I should\u2019ve crashed instead of hitting on you.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion whispered through her veins. There was something he wasn\u2019t saying, she thought, but she couldn\u2019t quite figure out the loophole. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say this earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it right\u2014and you were too mad to listen.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she admitted, she had been. Her sense of betrayal had been\u2014she could now admit\u2014out of all proportion to what he\u2019d actually done. Except that it had been him, a wolf she\u2019d given her deepest trust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nudged her shoulder with his own when she stayed silent. \u201cI hate that I\u2019m worried about touching you now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know it\u2019s my fault.\u201d A pause. \u201cIndy, come on. Do you know how early I had to get up to go get your cheesecake?\u201d Big blue eyes that looked as guileless as a newborn pup\u2019s.</p><p>She knew half of it was an act\u2014but her wolf liked his playfulness. She always had. And . . . he had apologized. Flat out. No reservations. Most dominant wolves\u2014and Drew was categorically a dominant, for all that he fooled people into thinking otherwise\u2014had trouble with the s word, even when they were utterly in the wrong. Maybe he hadn\u2019t been avoiding her because he was sulking, she decided; maybe he had actually been figuring out how to apologize. As a dominant herself, she understood exactly how hard it had to have been for him.</p><p>So she scooped up a bite of the cheesecake and lifted the fork to his mouth. He accepted it, a smile creasing his face. Then he nuzzled at her neck, and her wolf allowed it . . . welcomed it.</p> <p>That was when Indigo realized she\u2019d hated not being able to touch Drew, too.</p><p>Andrew fisted a hand on the blanket behind Indigo, drawing the rainstorm and steel scent of her into his lungs. His wolf was starved for it, rolled around in it as if it was drunk, unable to get enough. When she didn\u2019t push him away, he allowed himself another precious, excruciating second to indulge in the silken heat of her skin before raising his head.</p><p>She lifted another bite of cheesecake in his direction. Giving a huge sigh, he held out a hand. \u201cNo, no. I told you it was all for you.\u201d</p><p>A tug of her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible, you know that.\u201d She put the fork to his lips.</p><p>He parted them, let her feed him, the small intimacy making his wolf want to sing in thrumming pleasure. \u201cThat\u2019s why you love me.\u201d</p> <p>A shake of her head, but her lips curved upward, her eyes shimmering with laughter. \u201cHow did Riley ever put up with you when you were a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Riley. Nothing bothers him.\u201d Except Mercy, Andrew thought. His brother, the Wall, had fallen. And so would Andrew\u2019s smart, stubborn Indigo. \u201cI\u2019d do something stupid, he wouldn\u2019t yell, wouldn\u2019t snarl, he\u2019d just dump me in the lake. Rinse and repeat until I got the point.\u201d</p><p>Indigo snickered, and it made his wolf go motionless, cock its head. The sound of her happiness . . . yeah, he\u2019d do anything for it.</p><p>\u201cToo bad you\u2019re too big to be dumped in the lake now.\u201d</p><p>Lying back on the blanket with his arms folded beneath his head, he stared up at the leaves outlined against the excruciating blue of the sky. It was a stunning beauty, but it couldn\u2019t hold his attention. Indigo\u2019s scent, her warmth so close, her hip brushing his, it scored him to the soul. \u201cOh, I dunno,\u201d he said, keeping it light because there was no way he wanted to spook her again, \u201che did it a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>He all but saw Indigo\u2019s wolf prick up its ears. Twisting her body, she leaned over to put the empty bakery box beside the picnic basket, then placed one hand on his chest, gave a little nudge. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>Her touch locked the air in his throat, threatened to steal his words, his soul. Indigo nudged again when he didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019ll find out anyway, you know.\u201d</p><p>Glad she\u2019d misunderstood his silence, he made a face at her. \u201cAll I said was that he should shave.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down until her nose almost touched his, she narrowed her eyes, \u201cUh-huh. Which part of him did you suggest he shave?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>He grinned, his wolf delighted with her. \u201cHis head.\u201d When Indigo touched her nose to his, he dared raise one of his hands and play with strands of her hair, her ponytail having tumbled over her shoulder. \u201cI might have hinted that he was turning old and gray. Oh, and maybe losing his hair anyway.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s body shook. \u201cYou know newly mated men are touchy about things like that.\u201d But her hand clenched on his T-shirt before she fell away and onto her back beside him, the sound of her laughter husky and open. \u201cGod, I wish I\u2019d seen his face.\u201d</p><p>Andrew wanted nothing more than to raise himself on his elbow, reach down and stroke his hand over Indigo\u2019s face. He\u2019d hold her with his fingers on her jaw as he took her smiling lips with his own, indulging once more in the taste he hadn\u2019t been able to get out of his mind since the night of the storm.</p><p>His body tensed, blood pumping hot and hard. Gritting his teeth, he bent one leg to hide the blunt evidence of his reaction, even as he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he fell for it.\u201d His brother was in the prime of his life, one of the most powerful wolves in the pack. And he was assuredly in no danger of losing his hair.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to think completely straight for a while,\u201d Indigo said, \u201cbut the mating dance is the worst part. Men go a little nuts during that time. I remember when Elias met Yuki. He turned into his evil twin, snarling at anyone who so much as looked her way.\u201d</p><p>Andrew couldn\u2019t imagine even-tempered Elias snarling at anyone. But as he himself knew, it was hard to be rational when your whole being was focused on a woman to the extent that the need to touch her skin, to draw the scent of her deep into your lungs, became a fever in your blood. \u201cI think the natives are getting restless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hear them.\u201d Sitting up, she slapped him lightly on the chest. \u201cI\u2019ll go help them clean up, pack up the leftovers for later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of things here.\u201d Rising, he watched her walk away, a tall, strong woman with contentment humming through her stubborn bones\u2014because he\u2019d apologized, because she thought he\u2019d turned the clock back to the way things had always been.</p><p>His hand fisted again, but not in anger. In determination.</p><p>They made camp late that afternoon. Since the weather was holding and the night sky promised to be beautiful beyond compare, Andrew suggested they lay their sleeping bags out on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not damp anymore,\u201d he said to Indigo, having tested the earth. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll rain any tonight, either. And this area\u2019s only logged the odd snowfall the past few weeks, so we should be good on that score.\u201d</p><p>Indigo rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly never been a teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He looked out at the kids, who\u2019d collapsed against trees or on the earth. \u201cThey\u2019re all good kids. And they\u2019re changelings.\u201d No matter what their place in the hierarchy, all wolves could survive in the forest with no amenities whatsoever.</p><p>Shaking her head, Indigo said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having to explain this to the man who knows everyone and has probably had dinner with more people in the pack than me, Hawke, and Riley combined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rub it in.\u201d He scowled at the teasing\u2014though his wolf was spinning around in untrammeled joy that she was playing with him. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed the glances passing between male and female?\u201d She raised an eyebrow, nudging his attention toward a certain pairing. \u201cSure, it\u2019s no big deal to be naked when you shift\u2014but we\u2019re human, too. No teenage girl is comfortable with her body. Especially with a boy she\u2019s interested in looking on.\u201d</p><p>Andrew rubbed his jaw, aware he\u2019d missed the signals passing between the kids because he\u2019d been so focused on Indigo. \u201cHuh. Cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be. But there\u2019ll be no monkey business on my watch.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her stern expression. \u201cI bet you were confident about your body when you were a teen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d lose that bet.\u201d Snorting, she cupped her hands around her mouth. \u201cCome on, boys and girls, get the tents up! Then we\u2019ll play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the prize?\u201d was the cheeky response from Harley, who at sixteen was still fluctuating so wildly in his control\u2014and resulting dominance\u2014that no one knew where to put him in the hierarchy. Hawke was hoping that two days of concentrated time with the pack\u2019s dominants would decide the matter one way or another.</p><p>Indigo grinned. \u201cAn extra marshmallow in your hot chocolate\u2014if you\u2019re lucky. Now snap to it.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling at her \u201cslave driving,\u201d they began to put up their tents in pairs, as they would all be sharing. Indigo had worried about that with Drew, but now that they were back to normal, they\u2019d do the same. It made her wolf happy. Like most SnowDancers, it preferred sleeping with Pack to a lonely bed. It was only the human half that chose privacy. But tonight with Drew, both sides would be satisfied.</p><p>Drew was already bending down to pull out the tent from where it was attached to the bottom of his pack. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he muttered, continuing their earlier conversation. \u201cWhat did you have to worry about as a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She helped him spread the groundsheet on a level section of earth facing the other tents and hunted out the high-strength pegs as he unfolded the whisper-thin fabric of the tent itself. \u201cI grew to my full height at fourteen.\u201d Five feet ten in her bare feet, Indigo loved her height. Now.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she continued as they pegged down the edges, \u201cI didn\u2019t have any curves. None. All I had were clown feet I kept tripping over, and a body that was all right angles. I felt like a giant in the land of little people. A flat-chested giant with elbows of doom.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Drew fed through one of the flexible struts that snapped the tent upright without the need for a central support pole. \u201cI was short at fourteen. Really short.\u201d</p><p>Indigo thought back, tried to remember. But she\u2019d been eighteen, and fourteen-year-old boys hadn\u2019t merited much attention. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He watched as she fed through the second, cross-supporting strut. \u201cRiley was already all manly, and I couldn\u2019t even see over the tops of my shoes.\u201d A mournful expression.</p><p>Laughing, she finished her task and opened the flaps so he could throw their packs inside. \u201cAh, well, we both grew into our bodies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn my case, I grew out of it,\u201d Drew corrected. \u201cShot up like a pine tree the summer between my fourteenth and fifteenth year. Unfortunately, I continued to lack any manliness whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, Indigo squeezed his upper arm, the skin of her fingertips a little rough from all the work she did combat training their young dominants. \u201cWell, you bloomed nicely.\u201d</p><p>It took every ounce of control Andrew had to keep his tone light when all he wanted to do was to strip himself naked and have her stroke those capable hands over every straining inch of his body. Thank God his T-shirt covered the hard ridge of his cock as he took a seat beside her, his arms braced loosely on raised knees. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said when she looked to him for a response. \u201cThat\u2019s what Meadow Sanderson said when she divested me of my virginity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeadow . . . hmm I don\u2019t remember her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d he said, recalling the lushly sensual girl who\u2019d tied him up in knots over the course of a long, hazy summer. \u201cShe dumped me for the quarterback after she\u2019d played my body like a banjo. So sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I was heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA whole week.\u201d An eternity in the life of a teenage boy. \u201cThen I realized other girls had noticed my new manliness, too, and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d Adoring girls had never been hard for him. He liked the way they smelled, the way their bodies curved, the way they laughed. But that blissful year, for the first time in his life, those girls had adored him back. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the hunter, not the hunted,\u201d she said with a slow smile of remembrance. \u201cI finally grew some breasts in my second-to-last year of high school\u2014and decided I\u2019d waited long enough, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>He could see her in his mind\u2014a tall, lusciously curved girl who\u2019d made his head spin. It had been a general admiration at that stage\u2014he\u2019d thought she was hot, no doubt about it, but he\u2019d been more focused on getting girls his own age to pay attention to him. \u201cWho was the lucky guy?\u201d Jealousy dug sharp little claws into his gut, but he shut that door tight almost before it opened.</p><p>Changelings were sensual creatures\u2014touch was the cornerstone of how they related to each other. He would have never wished for Indigo to have spent her adult life without intimacy; it would\u2019ve hurt her on the deepest level. But that was then. If she went to bed with another man now . . .</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wolf saw red.</p><p>\u201cAn Ecuadoran exchange student named Dominic.\u201d Indigo\u2019s voice cut through the haze, pulling him back into the present. \u201cDark, handsome, and with that accent\u2014and the boy did know what he was doing.\u201d A laugh . . . but that husky tone was just a fraction \u201coff.\u201d \u201cThough I remember him scrambling backward when my claws sliced out.\u201d</p> <p>Attuned to every tiny aspect of her, he paid close attention. \u201cWas he human, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChangeling, and dominant, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been with a female who was as dominant.\u201d A pause. \u201cI don\u2019t think the experience made him want to repeat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid boy,\u201d Andrew said, too angry to be anything but blunt. \u201cI hope you found someone with more balls for your next time.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s laugh was startled. \u201cSo to speak.\u201d Tension leaching from her expression, she nudged him with her shoulder. \u201cTime for you to do your thing, hotshot. Make the tracks hard, but not impossible. It\u2019s all about building up their confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Getting up, he pulled off his sweatshirt and tee at the same time, throwing them inside the tent.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Indigo said, looking up with a scowl, \u201cI got the feeling you wanted to help the boys with their romantic interests.\u201d</p><p>Andrew followed her gaze . . . to see several pairs of female eyes on him. Teenage female eyes. \u201cShit.\u201d Ducking inside the tent, he finished stripping and shifted, hoping like hell his wolf would listen to reason when it came to the woman who put her hand on his ruff and whispered in his ear as soon as he stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cNo tricks.\u201d</p> <p>Quivering inside with the urge to tumble her to the earth until she shifted, until she laughed and gave chase, he closed his teeth around her free hand. A gentle bite. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a smile that almost shattered the wolf\u2019s control, \u201cno tricks they can\u2019t handle. Go.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s fur slid out from under Indigo\u2019s palm, the muscled weight of him fluid as he disappeared into the forest. She watched for him, but he was gone, a whisper in the early evening shadows. Turning back around to face her charges, she curled her fingers into her palm, disturbingly aware of how he\u2019d felt, the heat and wild beauty of him.</p><p>\u201cSimple rules,\u201d she told the teenagers once they\u2019d shifted. \u201cFirst one to find Drew wins. You can work in pairs, or you can go solo, but you have to decide now.\u201d She gave them a couple of minutes to make up their minds before continuing. \u201cNo booby traps, no blood. This is about tracking.\u201d Glancing around to make sure they all understood, she raised her arm, then dropped it in a sharp downward strike. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>As they shot out from around her like streaks of lightning, she followed on human feet. She could easily see\u2014and scent\u2014where Drew had gone, but the kids were moving slower, having seldom had the chance to work with someone of his skill. It made Indigo wonder if she could track him if he didn\u2019t want to be tracked.</p><p>Her wolf didn\u2019t like that thought\u2014she was used to being able to run down anyone she chose except Hawke. Their alpha was all kinds of cunning when he didn\u2019t want to be found, but Drew was their tracker, born with an almost preternatural ability to zero in on rogue wolves. Lines marred her forehead as a new thought intruded. Was it possible Drew could locate Hawke even when their alpha preferred to be lost?</p><p>Catching a whiff of iron in the air, she changed direction to make sure no one had been injured. She found Silvia\u2014a sharp branch had whipped across her muzzle. The girl was gone before Indigo could tell her that the damage was superficial. Indigo\u2019s wolf approved.</p><p>Burying the branch to ensure it wouldn\u2019t inadvertently lead the others this way, she carried on keeping watch over the hunters. True dark was hovering on the horizon when she heard a victorious howl on the cool evening wind.</p><p>Brace.</p><p>Nothing like wanting to impress a girl\u2014in this case, Silvia\u2014to nudge a male wolf into gear. Lifting her head, she joined in as the others in the group began to howl in response to Brace\u2019s triumph. The sound was . . . It touched the soul, the music haunting, starkly pure and yet so very earthy.</p><p>Home. Pack. Family.</p><p>Aware that Drew would herd everyone to camp, she lowered her head on the fading echo of the last note and jogged back herself\u2014to find that Silvia had beaten her there. The girl\u2019s bruise looked worse in human form, but the maternal female wasn\u2019t worried. \u201cI found something,\u201d she said with an almost puppyish eagerness. \u201cLook.\u201d A round metal ball lay in the palm of her hand. It was rusted, and had clearly come off the worse against rocks, but was recognizable as a man-made object.</p><p>Indigo frowned. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d SnowDancer was very strict about garbage. Nothing, but nothing, was allowed to pollute their lands.</p><p>Silvia described a location about a five-minute run east from where Indigo had last seen her. \u201cIt was stuck between two rocks on the edge of the stream. I think it must\u2019ve been washed down.\u201d</p><p>That was Indigo\u2019s thought, too, and, given the network of tributaries that ran down through the mountains, it meant there was no way to trace the object\u2019s origin. \u201cI don\u2019t think even Brenna will be able to figure out what this was meant to be.\u201d Because while she could see the remnants of a few wires inside, the metal orb was mostly hollow.</p><p>Silvia\u2019s face fell. Reaching out, Indigo squeezed the girl\u2019s rounded shoulder. \u201cBut you did good bringing it to me. Even if it is simply trash, we need to track down the guilty party and tell them to keep their junk off our land.\u201d</p><p>The others began to trickle in then, and she turned to put the sphere in the tent. Drew nudged his way inside while she was still packing it away. Shifting in a shower of sparks, he tugged at the clasps of his pack. \u201cI\u2019m going to go take a dip in the stream.\u201d</p><p>Indigo realized she was staring at the muscled slope of his back, her fingers uncurling as if in readiness to stroke. \u201cSure.\u201d Coloring at her own rudeness, she backed out of the tent. Thank God Drew had been too intent on pulling out a change of clothes to notice.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Two hours after the completion of the chase, and an hour after dinner, with their charges having collapsed in their tents, Andrew lay on top of his sleeping bag. He and Indigo had pinned up the flaps of their tent and placed their sleeping bags side by side facing outward. The position would allow them to drink in the night sky and keep watch at the same time.</p><p>Now, he waited for Indigo with taut anticipation in his gut.</p><p>Alone, they\u2019d finally be alone\u2014and within touching distance.</p><p>Indigo had gone down to the stream to bathe, and his wolf itched to prowl after her. She had the most beautiful body\u2014all toned muscle and dangerous curves. He wanted to have the right to stroke those curves as he pleased, as pleased her. He wanted to have the right to watch her as she bathed, to caress her while she was sleek and wet. He just wanted.</p><p>Sucking in a breath as his cock hardened in response to his thoughts, he clenched the hands propped under his head, his gaze skyward. But no matter his teeth-gritting concentration, his body was still under no kind of control when he scented Indigo returning from her bath, all damp and fresh and lushly female. Damn. If she caught even a hint of his arousal, she\u2019d put up that barrier of icy control between them before he could so much as blink.</p><p>It\u2019d be almost impossible to get her to lower it a second time.</p><p>He flowed to his feet outside the tent, waiting only until she\u2019d caught sight of him before hitching his thumb toward the forest, as if he was going to answer the call of nature. He faded into the solid bulk of the firs before she could do more than nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then he ran.</p><p>Lying between the unzipped halves of her sleeping bag\u2014to ensure a fast exit should she need to move\u2014Indigo finally gave up waiting for Drew and closed her eyes in the shallow sleep she\u2019d learned to utilize in her first year on the watch rotation. Drew, she thought with an exasperated smile, had probably been seduced by the cold, clear night into going for a run.</p><p>Her wolf pouted, if a wolf could be said to pout. She\u2019d wanted to go running as well, but had forced herself to come back to the campsite . . . though it hadn\u2019t really taken much force, not when she knew Drew was waiting for her. Frowning, she shifted, uncomfortable with the direction of her thoughts, with the low hum of heat in her abdomen.</p> <p>Her eyes snapped open as she identified the feeling. Lust. Desire. No doubt about it. When Drew had innocently shrugged off his T-shirt earlier, it hadn\u2019t only been the teenage girls who\u2019d taken notice. Indigo had sucked in a pleased breath at the sight of those solid shoulders, those muscular arms, that gleaming, healthy skin with a shimmer of gold. Then had come the moment in the tent when she\u2019d found herself drinking in the masculine beauty of his naked form.</p><p>The prickle of heat in her belly, across her breasts, was exacerbated by the fact that she\u2019d tasted Drew\u2019s kiss, felt that strong body slippery and naked against her own. And now that Drew had let the genie out of the bottle, it refused to be put back in. It didn\u2019t even matter that she knew nothing good could come of even a fleeting sexual relationship.</p><p>She\u2019d seen with her own eyes what happened when a dominant female chose a less dominant male, much less one who was four years younger. Pain. Hurt. Anger. Over and over again. A vicious cycle.</p><p>None of that mattered to her body.</p><p>It knew Drew\u2019s now\u2014more, it knew that they had serious, combustible chemistry.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just been a long time, that\u2019s all,\u201d she muttered to herself, but even as she said the words, she knew them for a lie. Yes, she was an adult changeling female. Yes, she ached for touch. But she\u2019d always been able to control her needs.</p><p>The heat low in her abdomen curled even tighter, a heavy, waiting warmth.</p><p>Glaring at the sky, she was in no mood to catch Drew\u2019s scent tangled with the freshness of water. He\u2019d obviously taken a dip in the stream after going running. He was, her mind supplied, likely naked\u2014or at least half-naked. Determinedly shutting her eyes, she tried not to hear anything as he snuck in.</p><p>Except it was freaking impossible not to realize that he was throwing a sweaty pair of jeans in a corner and pulling on . . . something light, soft, something that brushed against his skin in a way she couldn\u2019t identify with her ears alone. \u201cYou woke me up.\u201d</p><p>He froze, and she knew he was looking at her, but she didn\u2019t open her eyes. Refused to give in to the temptation to see what exactly he was wearing. She wasn\u2019t some young female drunk on her own sexuality. She was a woman used to choosing her lovers with care\u2014not being driven to it by the cravings of her body.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t really asleep,\u201d Drew said with a hint of a smile in his tone. \u201cAnd I brought you a present.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t an acquisitive person, but neither was she dead. Blinking open her eyes at last, she couldn\u2019t resist taking a slow tour of his body as he knelt to get something from the pocket of his discarded jeans. Muscled shoulders in shadow, a back so beautiful it cried out to be stroked . . . and boxers. Plain black and\u2014\u201cSilk boxers while we\u2019re camping?\u201d</p><p>A shrug that drew her attention to those shoulders again. \u201cThey were at the top of the clean laundry.\u201d Finding whatever it was that he\u2019d brought her, he flipped onto his front on his sleeping bag and braced himself on one arm, holding out something in a closed fist with the other.</p><p>She stared, suspicious. \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d The scent of him\u2014wild and earthy and a little rough\u2014curled around her in an almost physical caress . . . until her wolf growled and nudged at the human half to press her lips to his skin, to satiate the touch-hunger that suddenly had her at breaking point.</p><p>Drew extended his fisted hand a little farther. \u201cCome on, Ms. Grumpy, take it.\u201d A teasing smile that made her want to kiss it right off his lips . . . before she tumbled him to the ground and rubbed her body along the warm, muscled strength of his.</p><p>Swallowing the insane urge, she turned on her side and held out a hand. He placed a small, light object on her palm. \u201cFor your collection.\u201d</p><p>She jerked into a sitting position when she saw what it was, crossing her bare legs under her as she brought the small piece of flat rock to her eye. The fossil embedded within it was delicate\u2014a tiny, beautifully preserved leaf. Heart thudding, she brought it even closer.</p><p>Oooh, pretty. Perfect.</p><p>When she turned to look at Drew\u2019s face as he lay on his back, arms crossed under his head, she saw a smug smile. He looked so pleased with himself that she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014her own lips curved. \u201cHow did you know I collect fossils?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see all and know all.\u201d</p><p>Scrunching up her nose at him, she cupped the precious fossil in her palm and bent to kiss him on the lips. It was meant to be a thank-you kiss, a little bit of affection between packmates who were close, nothing more. But when he froze under her, when her body turned into one big flame, she knew she\u2019d made a mistake. A mistake that might burn them both to ash.</p><p>Wrenching back from the searing contact, she looked down at him, her chest heaving. He watched her with those clear blue eyes that gave away nothing\u2014but his body told its own story. And she could no more stop herself from looking than she could stop the racing beat of her own heart. The flat plane of his abdomen was taut, the golden silk of his skin broken up only by the thin line of dark hair that disappeared into the waistband of his boxers. The black silk strained against the proud ridge of his erection.</p><p>So strong and beautiful and male\u2014every part of her body warmed with pleasure at having him near. She wanted to reach over, stroke the hard demand of his cock, cup him with her palm, make him lose the control that had his tendons standing out in stark relief against his sk\u2014</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>She should\u2019ve said something but couldn\u2019t make her throat unlock, her mouth open. Then Drew shot her a sharp, sheepish grin. \u201cHey, I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m male. Stupid biology.\u201d Turning over, he pillowed his head on one arm and went to sleep.</p><p>She blinked, not sure what had just happened. But five minutes later and his breathing was easy, even. Putting the precious fossil in the side pocket of her pack\u2014after wrapping it in the soft fabric of an old tee\u2014she finally lay back down and pulled the top flap of her sleeping bag over her uncomfortable body. Her nipples rubbed against the fabric of her T-shirt, taut and aching. Her panties suddenly felt far too constricting, and her wolf\u2014she was pissed at being denied.</p><p>Not Drew, she told her wolf again. I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt him. And she would. Because a relationship between a dominant female and a lower-ranking dominant male was never going to end in anything but disaster.</p><p>Andrew released his fisted hand what felt like hours later, when he sensed Indigo drop off into real sleep at long last. Turning over carefully onto his back, conscious she\u2019d wake to the slightest awareness of a threat, he allowed himself to run his gaze over the line of her body as she lay with her back to him. She\u2019d kicked off the top of her sleeping bag and the long lines of her legs were bare below the white of her T-shirt, her skin smooth and oh-so-touchable.</p><p>Desire spiked again, but intertwined with it was an almost overwhelming tenderness. He wanted to curve his body around hers, wrap his arm over her waist, and tug her close. Just hold her. She might\u2019ve let him earlier, but after that kiss . . . His gut went tight, his wolf pawing at the ground for another taste of her.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him. He\u2019d seen the flare of shocked need in her eyes, glimpsed the hunger of the wolf. But as he\u2019d already learned, when it came to Indigo, hunger alone would never be enough. A less stubborn man might\u2019ve given up, but Andrew was playing for keeps.</p><p>She shivered a little.</p><p>Moving at once to pull across the top flap of her sleeping bag, he froze, close enough to feel the warmth of her body. What would she do if he snuggled into her? She might let it go, thinking he was doing it in his sleep\u2014or she might kick his ass. The wickedness in him pricked its ears, game to take the risk.</p><p>Relaxing his body as much as possible, he spooned himself around her, stroking his arm over her waist. She woke the instant he touched her\u2014but she didn\u2019t shove him away. Nuzzling his face into her hair, he let his eyes close. It was no longer pretense, not with her warm and luscious against him. Sleep began to whisper in his ear, and he decided to let it sweep him into dreams where Indigo didn\u2019t just let him hold her, but so much more.</p><p>He had to be asleep, Indigo thought, lying quiescent in the heat of Drew\u2019s embrace. There was no way he\u2019d have done this if he\u2019d been awake\u2014not after the response she\u2019d accidentally incited in both of them. Of course, he was also half demon, so he could be tormenting her to get some of his own back.</p><p>Still, when his fingers laced with her own, she relaxed. He was blazingly hot against the mountain chill, Pack she trusted to the deepest core of her soul. Settling herself more comfortably against him, she drifted off to sleep, having no awareness that she\u2019d be jackknifing to dangerous wakefulness less than an hour later.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Miles away, on the outskirts of a sleeping San Francisco, Judd took a seat beside Father Xavier Perez on the back steps of Xavier\u2019s church.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Xavier,\u201d he said, knowing the priest would prefer the truth at once. \u201cGloria is gone, murdered.\u201d He\u2019d gotten the confirmation without having to tap his contacts. Brenna had hacked through a records database, found the death certificate. It had listed \u201csudden cardiac failure\u201d as the cause of death, but her spotless apartment had told a different story.</p><p>Xavier let out a long, slow breath before dipping his head and murmuring a quiet, heartfelt prayer. Judd waited in silence until the other man raised his head. \u201cShe dared to reach for something beyond what was permitted,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cAnd they killed her for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He told Xavier something Drew had shared with him, having heard it from the Rat alpha. \u201cThere are rumors of other dead Psy in the city. Do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Xavier shook his head. \u201cOur mutual friend may know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So would another man. A man, Judd thought, that his outwardly careless younger brother-in-law called if not friend, then at least a friendly acquaintance. He\u2019d ask Drew to follow up on the issue with that contact once he returned from the mountains.</p> <p>Now, he listened to the insects going about their business in the back garden and waited.</p><p>The stir in the darkness came not long afterward.</p><p>Judd focused. \u201cYou\u2019re late tonight.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost leaned against an old oak tree, his face swathed in shadow as always. \u201cI was delayed by an unexpected guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead Psy in the city,\u201d Judd said, asking the most important question, \u201cdo you know anything about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Ghost murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy with other matters. What has occurred?\u201d</p><p>Judd had an inkling about the nature of the Ghost\u2019s \u201cother matters\u201d\u2014and if he was right, then the most dangerous rebel in the Net was about to become even more lethal. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but rumors at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I discover anything, I\u2019ll share it with you.\u201d The Ghost moved deeper into the shadows as the clouds parted to expose the moon\u2019s pearly light. \u201cBut San Francisco doesn\u2019t hold much interest for me at present.\u201d</p><p>Judd heard something in that statement, something that made his instincts snap to wakefulness. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of us came together because we believe the Council is destroying the Psy race and taking the rest of the world along,\u201d the Ghost said. \u201cThe Councilors now have their knives out for each other. Any resulting war will devastate the Net, kill millions\u2014Psy, human, and changeling.\u201d</p><p>Judd agreed . . . and he also understood. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to kill them all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf necessary,\u201d the Ghost said. \u201cThere can be no war if there is no Council.\u201d</p><p>And, Judd thought, it would leave the Net entirely in the Ghost\u2019s grasp.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Metal. Intruder.</p><p>Indigo was at full alert when her eyes snapped open. She felt Drew come to life at almost the same instant. Glancing at him, she saw his eyes had gone night-glow, the wolf at the forefront.</p><p>\u201cPsy,\u201d he mouthed more than said.</p><p>She gave a decisive nod. Nothing else would account for that scent. It was as distinctive as blood on snow, and it cut against changeling senses with the jagged brutality of twisted metal. Not all Psy carried that metallic taint, and the current theory was that it clung only to those who had given in irrevocably to Silence . . . lost their soul to the emotionless chill of the PsyNet. Whatever the truth, there was no reason for it to be here, deep in the heart of SnowDancer territory.</p><p>Glancing at the kids\u2014all asleep\u2014Indigo made a snap decision. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>Drew shifted and flowed away from the campsite as she walked to Harley\u2019s tent and reached in to squeeze his shoulder.</p><p>The boy woke at once. Putting a finger to her lips, Indigo bent down. \u201cI need you to keep watch. Sound the alarm if you sense an intruder.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, the boy extricated himself from his tent without waking his tentmate, his eyes already watchful. \u201cI\u2019ll use the wolf\u2019s call.\u201d</p><p>Confident he was up to the task, she shifted without bothering to strip off her T-shirt and streaked off after Drew. The metallic scent was strong, fresh, and not difficult to track, even if Drew hadn\u2019t gone ahead. Reaching the end of the trail, she found herself in a small moonlit glade bearing the faintest traces of boot prints.</p><p>Putting her nose to the earth, she attempted to find the intruders\u2019 exit route and came up blank. Teleportation. Which most likely meant the Council\u2014or a Councilor, at least\u2014was involved in this somewhere. Teleport-capable telekinetics were a scarce resource, and they were almost always pulled into the Council ranks, according to Judd. Frustrated, she looked up as Drew appeared from the other side of the glade, having apparently circled the area.</p><p>Coming over until their muzzles almost touched, he shook his head.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>She shifted. They needed to talk and better it be here than back at the campsite. It was no use scaring the kids when there was nothing to be done at this moment. \u201cNo hint of a trail?\u201d She fisted her hand in his fur as she asked for confirmation of his nonverbal report, his coat incredibly soft beneath the protective roughness of the guard hairs.</p><p>Another shake of his head before he tugged away and shifted to crouch across from her, a sleekly muscled man with lake blue eyes that held the slightest night-glow edge\u2014the wolf looking out from behind the human skin. \u201cTk\u2019s.\u201d His voice was low, deep, wolf.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Attempting to ignore the way that rough tone raised every tiny hair on her body, she spread her fingers on the stubby grass. \u201cWhy here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsolated\u2014or it should\u2019ve been.\u201d Drew angled his head in a way that had nothing to do with the human half of him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were using it as a meeting place, realized we were up here, and poofed.\u201d</p><p>There was some merit to that, Indigo thought, her own wolf prowling inside her mind, its anger cold and rational. SnowDancer territory was unwelcoming to intruders, but by the same token, it was also so vast that if someone wanted to have a meeting away from watchful eyes, and could access the area without alerting the sentries, it was the perfect location. \u201cWe need to log this, get some extra patrols going up here in case they decide to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that back at camp.\u201d Drew shifted with those words, and for a moment she sat still and admired the beauty of the large silver wolf looking back at her with curious copper-colored eyes.</p><p>Raising a hand, she indulged herself as she wouldn\u2019t dare do while they were in human form, running her fingers through his fur in a long, slow caress. \u201cYou sure are a pretty wolf, Drew.\u201d</p><p>That got her an affectionate nip on the chin, a nuzzle into her neck. Feeling a smile creep across her face, she let him tumble her to the ground. The Psy were gone and, given the fact that their swift departure indicated they\u2019d caught wind of the camp, unlikely to return tonight. A few more minutes wouldn\u2019t make any difference.</p><p>Staying in human form, she wrestled with Drew as he attempted to pin her, slipping out from underneath his paws and circling around to take him from behind. He was too fast for her, sliding out and away to leap on her. Laughing, she wiggled out from under his playful hold before shifting herself.</p><p>He pounced again, but she was already tumbling out of the way. Across from her, he crouched with his front feet forward, his back arched, a clear invitation to play. It was too tempting to resist. Jumping at him, she mock-attacked, growing low in her throat. He attacked back . . . but he was really just trying to get his teeth on her tail.</p><p>Laughing inwardly, she slipped and he almost got her . . . but she slammed her body against his, pushing him off balance. Then she went for his tail. Yipping, he danced out of the way, his eyes brimming with a joy that could come only from the heart of the wolf that lived within.</p><p>It was tempting to keep playing, but they couldn\u2019t leave their charges alone all night. Touching muzzles with him, she turned and led the way back to camp, where they pulled Harley off watch, then used Drew\u2019s cell phone to report their findings. Judd happened to be on the midnight-to-six shift at the den, and Indigo could see his gaze sharpen even on the tiny screen of the cell phone. \u201cDid they leave anything behind?\u201d the Psy male asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that we could see,\u201d Indigo reported, very conscious of the living heat of Drew\u2019s body as he pressed up behind her\u2014so he could look at the screen. \u201cSilvia did find something metallic earlier today. It could\u2019ve come from anywhere, however. There\u2019s a high chance it was washed down by the rivers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm in the techs having a look at it anyway.\u201d Judd made a note. \u201cThreat assessment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow,\u201d Indigo said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to change our plans. Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you. If they\u2019d wanted to attack,\u201d he added, \u201ctheir best chance would\u2019ve been tonight while they had the element of surprise, and they didn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>Judd nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll organize some extra patrols in that area, starting from when you leave. Your presence there at the moment should act as a deterrent.\u201d</p><p>Indigo nodded. \u201cMake sure you send up only experienced men and women. The Psy are too dangerous for the novices to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Hawke will be joining you tomorrow, so you can discuss this further then.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up after a couple more words, Indigo frowned. \u201cIt takes some kind of balls to come into our territory knowing how tough we are on intruders.\u201d SnowDancer had a reputation for shooting first and asking questions of the corpses.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Drew said, slipping his arms around her waist and tugging her against him, \u201cor sheer arrogance.\u201d</p><p>Indigo didn\u2019t reply straightaway, her brain cells fried by the wave of flame that licked up her body. For a moment, she considered turning her face to that of the beautiful wolf at her back and letting the heat take over. It would be good\u2014that much was certain. He was big and gorgeous and playful and gave every indication that he\u2019d be a generous, affectionate lover.</p><p>Tightening his arms around her, Drew propped his chin on her shoulder. \u201cWith all the Psy stuff that\u2019s been happening this past year, I want to think something sinister is going on, but that feels like an overreaction to what was most likely a simple territorial violation.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to think past the pounding hunger of her pulse. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever simple with the Psy,\u201d she said, turning her head a little so she could feel his hair brushing against her cheek.</p><p>He kissed her on the jaw, a quick, almost absentminded caress. \u201cTrue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut yes, there is a chance they were just using the location as a safe meeting place.\u201d Unable to resist, she reached up to touch his face. He pressed his beard-roughened jaw into her palm, and as her wolf hummed in contentment inside her, she remembered how much she\u2019d missed this contact after they\u2019d had their blowup. If she seduced him\u2014and it made her guilty to even consider it\u2014they\u2019d be going right back there.</p><p>She treasured his friendship too much to risk it. Because no matter what, sex would change everything, create a subtle tension that nothing would ever erase. \u201cWe should get some sleep,\u201d she said, not stopping to wonder why she was so certain she wouldn\u2019t be able to remain friends with Drew after intimacy when she had perfectly cordial relationships with her former lovers. \u201cEarly morning wakeup tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Drew yawned and released her. The sudden chill caused by the absence of his body heat made goose bumps rise over her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cI want to talk to Hawke about Harley,\u201d Drew said, moving to his own sleeping bag. \u201cKid\u2019s not really fluctuating as much as everyone thinks\u2014and from the looks of it, he\u2019s promising to be a high-level dominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d picked that up.\u201d She slipped inside the unzipped halves of her sleeping bag.</p><p>Drew scowled at the raised bumps on her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She was an adult wolf\u2014cold wasn\u2019t something that really bothered her, even in human form. As for the emotional reasons behind the unexpected strength of her reaction\u2014she wasn\u2019t going there.</p><p>\u201cAnd Silvia,\u201d Drew murmured, his voice drowsy, \u201cthere\u2019s something about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. She\u2019s a maternal dominant.\u201d The girl would be an anchor for the pack once she gained a little more confidence.</p><p>\u201cG\u2019night, Indy.\u201d</p><p>She thought about telling him not to use that nickname, but then he curled his body around hers, sliding one arm and leg under the top flap of her sleeping bag, and she decided to let it go for tonight . . . and allowed sleep to tug her under.</p><p>Hawke turned up at camp early the next morning\u2014but he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cAndrew,\u201d drawled the lissome young female he\u2019d brought with him, \u201cso this is where you\u2019ve been hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria\u2014\u201d Drew\u2019s words of welcome were cut off when the petite but curvy woman jumped up and planted her plump, ruby red lips smack-bang on his, her legs wrapping around his waist as he caught her beneath the thighs.</p><p>Indigo narrowed her eyes at her alpha, unable to erase the image of Drew\u2019s fingers closing over Maria\u2019s taut flesh. \u201cYou brought me another camper?\u201d Catty, she thought, that was catty.</p> <p>A gleam in those pale eyes, but his tone was even as he said, \u201cMaria\u2019s a soldier, as you very well know, and she\u2019s a capable one.\u201d Hawke looked over to where the kids were grinning and wolf-whistling at Drew and Maria. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be good experience for her to come up here, spend some time coaching the younger kids.\u201d</p><p>Drew was putting the girl on her feet now, having broken the kiss\u2014though his hands remained on her tiny waist. Color burned hot and bright over his cheekbones, and Indigo wanted to believe it was embarrassment, not desire. Except that he was a healthy young male, and Maria of the big breasts, flashing dark eyes, and lush hips was giving him some hotly explicit signals, her hands splayed on his chest, all but openly petting.</p><p>Indigo felt her claws prick the insides of her skin just as Hawke put two fingers to his mouth and whistled. \u201cTime to go hunting. I want everyone in wolf form.\u201d</p><p>Good, Indigo thought, because she was in the mood for blood. Preferably of the \u201csweet young thang\u201d kind.</p><p>Andrew wanted to kill Hawke\u2014slowly and with great pleasure. Of all the women to bring up here . . . \u201cWhy?\u201d he muttered to his alpha when Maria detached herself at long last to go stash her pack, her hips swaying in invitation as she blew him a kiss over her shoulder.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s gaze was so innocent, Andrew knew it was pure bullshit. \u201cI asked for a volunteer\u2014she raised her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Shoving his fingers through his hair, Andrew glared at the man he fully intended to strangle at the first opportunity.</p><p>\u201cMaria\u2019s sweet, she\u2019s sexy, and she wants to bang your brains out.\u201d Hawke\u2019s grin was pure, amused wolf. \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem here\u2014especially since you obviously need to get banged.\u201d</p> <p>His alpha knew exactly which buttons to press, but then so did Andrew. \u201cProjecting, Hawke?\u201d</p><p>Ice blue flared with something hotter, more brilliant, but Hawke didn\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cSmart-ass. Tell me about the problem last night.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laid it out, momentarily pushing aside the complication caused by Maria\u2019s entrance into his courtship of Indigo. \u201cI went out and had another look this morning before you arrived. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Hawke stared out at the winter green of the forest. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an eye on the situation, see what develops. Judd\u2019s heard nothing from his contacts that implies a Council operation, but we\u2019ll stay on alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a message for Lucas,\u201d he said, naming the leopard alpha. \u201cRiaz and Elias are running things at the den today, so they\u2019ll contact us if the cats discover anything.\u201d Looking around, he took a deep breath of the chill morning air. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy this day\u2014not often we get a chance like this.\u201d Reaching back to his nape, he pulled up his T-shirt, stripping it off as Andrew got rid of his own.</p><p>They\u2019d both changed into wolf form by the time the kids ambled back. Maria, too, had shifted. She was a frisky little wolf, pretty and dainty, even in her animal form. Andrew thought she was sweet enough, but she wasn\u2019t the woman he wanted. That woman was an elegant, long-legged wolf with fur of a rich dark gray, and a distinctly haughty look in her golden eyes when she strolled up to stand beside Hawke.</p><p>He wanted to bite her.</p><p>Maria nipped his flank instead.</p><p>I am so going to kill Hawke for this.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>The juveniles were exhausted that night, crawling into their sleeping bags as soon as darkness fell, but they\u2019d dragged those bags outside, so they could sit and listen to the older members of the pack talk. A few had chosen to remain in wolf form, sitting curled up close to the laz-fire, a portable heating device that gave an excellent approximation of flames but with zero chance of creating a forest fire.</p><p>As Andrew watched from his spot on a log opposite Hawke and Indigo, his lieutenant\u2014and yeah, he was discovering quick-fast that he was a possessive bastard\u2014showed their alpha the little metal ball Silvia had discovered. Hawke played the object over his hand after sniffing at it to see if the wolf\u2019s nose could tell him anything. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what Bren and the other techs can do with this,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like anyone putting their shit on our land\u2014Council or conglomerate.\u201d</p><p>Maria nudged Andrew with her elbow when Hawke and Indigo fell to discussing what adjustments they\u2019d have to make to the watch patrols to free up soldiers for this area.</p><p>\u201cAre you off shift next weekend?\u201d she whispered, her breast soft and warm against his upper arm as she snuggled closer. \u201cI have tickets to a new show. It\u2019s got really great reviews.\u201d</p><p>Andrew kept his arms hanging over his knees, his fingers loosely intertwined. \u201cI thought you were seeing Kieran.\u201d He\u2019d noticed\u2014and been grateful\u2014that she\u2019d stopped throwing lures his way after hooking up with the boy.</p><p>A sniff, firelight glinting off the soft ebony of her curls as she ducked her head. \u201cYesterday\u2019s news.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wolf stilled at the deep hurt he sensed beneath the blazing heat of her sensuality. \u201cCome for a walk,\u201d he said, knowing she\u2019d never open up within earshot of the others.</p><p>She agreed with alacrity. He wondered if Indigo even noticed their departure, she was so deep in conversation with Hawke\u2014and that was one hell of a punch to the ego. But he kept that to himself as he led Maria away from the campsite and toward a more private spot, because if security was part of Indigo\u2019s mandate in the pack, this was part of his\u2014looking after those who might not trust their pain to anyone else.</p><p>Maria slid her hand over his abdomen as soon as they hit the darkness of the trees, her goal the waistband of his jeans. \u201cSoooooo . . .\u201d</p><p>Fully in control, he gripped her wrist, squeezed. \u201cHush.\u201d Then, fingers locked around her wrist, he continued to lead them through the winter green firs.</p><p>Maria didn\u2019t resist either his hold or his order, and that was a clear indication that his hunch was right. Young predatory changeling females weren\u2019t at all shy about going after what they wanted, and Andrew had never before been able to discourage her so quickly. Bringing them to a flat glacial rock, he took a seat, tugging her up to sit beside him. \u201cSo, he broke your heart, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d She wrenched away her hand. \u201cI thought you were bringing me out here to do something interesting, not talk about old rubbish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria.\u201d Reaching out, he did hug her then, rubbing his chin over the softness of those pretty curls. \u201cTalk to me, sweetheart. You know you can.\u201d</p><p>Another sniff, this one distinctly wetter. \u201cAll the girls warned me about him, but I didn\u2019t listen. I thought I could tame him. How stupid!\u201d</p><p>Andrew cuddled her closer, until she was almost in his lap. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>And she did, pouring out her heart. Kieran, for all his humanity\u2014having been adopted into SnowDancer\u2014was more of a wolf on the prowl than most, leaving a trail of broken hearts in his wake. Maria, Andrew thought, wasn\u2019t the first casualty, nor would she be the last. Her heart would heal, but he sympathized with the burning hurt of the fresh bruise\u2014he knew better than most how badly the heart could ache when the one you wanted didn\u2019t want you back.</p><p>Indigo had been a warm, luscious presence beside him all night long, her legs tangled with his, smooth against his rougher skin, but he didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking she\u2019d changed her mind about his suitability as a lover. Still, she\u2019d responded to him in a sexual way more than once since they\u2019d hit the mountains, the scent of her desire a taunting perfume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had taken everything he had not to stroke his fingers up to cup her breast last night after she kissed him, to nuzzle his way down and lap up the warm, erotic scent at the juncture of her thighs, to pleasure her with his mouth and his hands, to adore her in the most rawly sexual of ways.</p><p>He\u2019d almost snapped when he\u2019d realized she was fighting against her own body\u2019s needs once again. Sometimes he wanted to shake Indigo, make her see sense. After the arousal he\u2019d scented, he now knew he could seduce her by stoking up the embers of her passion until her wolf\u2014sensual, tactile, with far fewer concerns than the human\u2014pushed her into his arms.</p><p>But of course, it wasn\u2019t that simple.</p> <p>Feeling Maria rub her damp cheek against his chest, he pulled his attention back to the present, running his hand over and along her back until she quieted down. \u201cKieran\u2019s an idiot,\u201d he murmured, continuing to pet her with the undemanding caresses of a packmate. \u201cWhen you grow up a little more and become the woman you\u2019re going to be, he\u2019s going to kick himself. And you can rub his face in it.\u201d</p><p>Maria gave him a shaky smile, dark eyes near black even to his night vision. \u201cYou know how to stroke a woman\u2019s ego.\u201d</p><p>Using his thumbs, he wiped away the remnants of her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s easy with someone like you.\u201d Too bad he was stuck on a woman who might just drive them both to insanity with her refusal to even admit the possibility that there might be something between them.</p><p>Indigo found herself alone half an hour after Drew left with Maria clinging to him like kudzu. No guesses as to what the two of them were doing, though thankfully, they\u2019d gone far enough out of range that she couldn\u2019t hear or scent their bodies. As for Hawke, he\u2019d noticed that four of the juveniles weren\u2019t as exhausted as their peers and had rounded them up for an exploration of the night-swathed forest.</p><p>The eight Hawke had left behind were all lost in deep sleep, their faces\u2014no matter the form they\u2019d chosen\u2014content. Only Indigo remained awake by the fire, her spine stiff, her wolf snarling inside her mind as she stared at the spot where Drew had disappeared into the dark, his arm curled around Maria\u2019s shapely form.</p> <p>Her eyes shifted without conscious control, until she saw everything with the wolf\u2019s piercing night vision. Furious with her lack of control, she went to the tent\u2014to be confronted by Drew\u2019s sleeping bag. He wasn\u2019t likely to come back here, and even if he did, she sure as hell did not intend to sleep next to a male who stank of another woman. Decision made, she rolled up his bag and put both it and his pack in a neat pile against a tree a small distance away, where he couldn\u2019t miss it.</p><p>Just being a good packmate, she told herself. It had nothing to do with the fact that an odd kind of anger was boiling through her system. She didn\u2019t want to sleep with Drew. Okay, yes, she did, but she wasn\u2019t going to do it, so she had no reason to be so savagely angry that he\u2019d gone off with another female. There was nothing worse than a woman who played dog in the manger\u2014it would be the worst kind of hypocrisy on her part.</p><p>Her mind snapshotted to an image of Drew\u2019s naked body as he dropped the towel the night of the storm, his muscled flesh inviting touch. Maria was probably in raptures\u2014Enough.</p><p>Stripping off her clothes, she pulled on a large tee over her panties and slipped in between the unzipped halves of her sleeping bag. She\u2019d ended up kicking off the top half last night, not needing it given the blazing heat of Drew\u2019s body. His heartbeat had been a slow, steady rhythm behind her, his breath warm against her temple. Sometime in the night, he\u2019d spread his hand out over her abdomen and intertwined his legs with her own, the hairs on his thighs rubbing rough and sensuous against her skin. It hadn\u2019t only been comforting to sleep like two tangled pups, it had been . . . more.</p><p>Gritting her teeth against the heavy impression of memory, she closed her eyes. Sleep continued to evade her like the most frustrating prey . . . and she was wide awake when she scented two familiar forms coming back to camp. Her hand fisted and she set her jaw, determined not to take a deeper breath, to peel apart the scents in a search for the musky taste of sex.</p><p>\u201cLooks like everyone\u2019s asleep.\u201d A feminine whisper.</p> <p>A pause and though Indigo knew it was impossible, she could\u2019ve sworn Drew\u2019s eyes were drilling into her skull. \u201cYou better get some rest, too.\u201d</p><p>Sounds, skin meeting. A kiss? \u201cGood night, Drew. That was really nice . . . thank you.\u201d</p><p>Nice? Not exactly a ringing endorsement. She hoped that burned Drew\u2019s ego.</p><p>The next sounds were of Maria moving about, heading to her tent. Drew\u2019s heavier tread didn\u2019t follow. Instead, Indigo felt him go to his pack . . . and then more quiet, determined sounds\u2014fabric being unrolled, boots being unlaced and dropped to the ground.</p><p>Unable to resist, she opened her eyes and twisted toward where she\u2019d left his gear\u2014to find him stripping off his T-shirt and throwing it on his pack in a way that shouted temper. His sleeping bag lay open beside him. She should\u2019ve closed her eyes and gone back to sleep, but her wolf\u2019s edgy temper prodded her to get up and confront him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in an almost subvocal tone, not wanting Maria to hear. The kids were too tired to wake.</p><p>Cool blue eyes met hers. \u201cGoing to sleep.\u201d</p><p>The cutting bite of his response took her aback for a second\u2014she\u2019d never really seen Drew angry before. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be sharing with Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think of me?\u201d he asked with a frost in his tone that made her want to wrap her arms around herself. \u201cThat I\u2019d take advantage of a girl who\u2019s just had her heart broken?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d She was a good lieutenant, but she hadn\u2019t seen anything in Maria\u2019s behavior to betray that kind of hurt. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His hands went to the top button of his jeans and he flicked it open. \u201cMight as well shift,\u201d he muttered, not undoing the zipper. \u201cSince it smells like rain, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be getting much sleep tonight if I stay in human form.\u201d</p><p>The way he said that, the way he looked at her, rubbed her temper raw. \u201cFine, I misread the situation.\u201d She folded her arms, curving her hands into fists. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He put his own hands on his hips, his chest a muscled plane only inches from her. \u201cI think I prefer a little rain to being frozen out by Lieutenant Indigo Riviere for daring to ask her to step outside of her safe little worldview.\u201d</p><p>She saw red. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d It was sheer breath-stealing fury that kept her tone low.</p><p>\u201cHow about I ask a question instead?\u201d Closing the distance between them until they stood toe to toe, the heat of his body a silent challenge, he said, \u201cWhy are you out here, sniping at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not \u2018snipe.\u2019\u201d Her wolf growled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure sounds like you\u2019re being snippy to me.\u201d And then the damn male did that thing he did\u2014he kissed her. As if he had every right to just take her mouth with the wild heat of his, to cup the back of her head, to bite down on her lower lip and suck her upper one into his mouth.</p><p>Her toes curled, the rage in her bloodstream translating into pure wild heat as the touch-hungry wolf took control. She hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d unfolded her arms until her palms met the hard wall of his chest. Hot. Strong. Beautiful. Overwhelmed by the sudden blaze of the sexual inferno, Indigo wanted to push him to the ground, claim every solid male inch with her mouth, her hands, and finally, her sex. The hunger was a fever inside, a spiking, thudding pulse.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Drew lifted his head, his chest heaving. \u201cI can scent Hawke and the others.\u201d</p><p>The words poured cold water on the flames of passion. She realized she still had her hands on his body, the fingers of one curved slightly into his flesh, as if she wanted to prick at him with her claws\u2014as if she was in heat. Shoving away, she stumbled a little. \u201cYou lied,\u201d she said, taking out her own stunned confusion on him. \u201cAll that bullshit about everything being back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you.\u201d His eyes gleamed, hard and bright. \u201cYou want me, and if you\u2019d stop fucking lying to yourself for one second, you\u2019d realize we could have something good.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf, no longer caught in the sexual inferno, snarled at the challenge, at the arrogance of this male who thought he could bring her to heel. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. Yeah, you can kiss\u2014but I need a little more in my man.\u201d Harsh, angry words, torn from the part of her that hated how he\u2019d made her feel earlier when he\u2019d gone off with Maria\u2014so vulnerable, so weak. She was never weak. She refused to allow it. \u201cI might play with boys, but I don\u2019t keep them.\u201d</p><p>Drew flinched, and she knew she\u2019d drawn blood. Somehow, it didn\u2019t feel as good as it should have. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to take it back, too proud, too confused, too fucking scared of what Drew was asking from her. She knew how it would end. She\u2019d seen how it would end. The hurt, the pain, the constant effort to make herself less so that he would feel better as a man.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t worth it. Not even if it hurt like a bitch to walk away.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Henry looked at his man. \u201cIt can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d An unequivocal answer. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ll have to be quick to get the rest of the operation in place now that they\u2019ve detected us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you have that under way.\u201d Henry had chosen this man because of his intelligence and dedication to Silence\u2014and, unlike Shoshanna, he wasn\u2019t about to squander that resource by killing him simply because he happened to be strong enough to be a threat.</p><p>A nod. \u201cEven if they somehow discover the first element, the second should give us what we need.\u201d</p><p>And the war to uphold Silence, Henry thought, would claim another victim.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Andrew dumped his pack in his room and began to tug off his clothes for the shower. The hike down from the campsite had been undemanding in spite of the rain that had fallen overnight, and, for the juveniles, fun. Most had abandoned their packs for later retrieval halfway down and shifted, gamboling in the pools of water like four-year-olds, their howls of pleasure singing to his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no matter his wolf\u2019s joy at being with his pack, the trip down had cut at him, made him bleed\u2014because in spite of everything he\u2019d told himself about charm, about courtship, he\u2019d lost his temper the night before and it was still simmering. He\u2019d been in no mood to play\u2014and neither had Indigo.</p><p>They\u2019d spoken to each other only when necessary and kept their distance the rest of the time. For Andrew, it had been partly self-preservation and partly because he didn\u2019t trust himself around her. The hunger to touch, to caress, to possess, was a constant craving in his gut by now. He was fully capable of going after her with the intent to claim rights he didn\u2019t have, rights she refused to give him, notwithstanding the addictive musk of her own desire.</p><p>Throwing the last of his clothing on the floor, he walked into the shower cubicle and tried to rub away the need, the fury that had him losing his mind. Of course it didn\u2019t disappear, but the time he spent under the deliberately cool spray did calm him down a fraction. He\u2019d made a mistake in challenging Indigo that way\u2014but he wasn\u2019t sorry. Because when it came down to it, he was a dominant same as her. He wasn\u2019t going to lie to her about that. But that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t also going to use his other skills to burn through the ice of her temper.</p> <p>I might play with boys, but I don\u2019t keep them.</p><p>He clenched his jaw at the memory of her razor-sharp words, refusing to let them push him away. That was what she wanted\u2014it would be the easy way out. And no matter how mad he was at her for what she\u2019d said, he wasn\u2019t going to give her that out. No fucking way.</p><p>Switching off the shower, he got dressed, then scrawled something on a small piece of paper that he slipped under Indigo\u2019s door on his way down to the garage. He wasn\u2019t exactly fit company right now. Better he redirect his anger into something useful, like fixing one of the malfunctioning vehicles. Fact was, he was good with cars, but no expert\u2014which meant he\u2019d have to concentrate.</p><p>However, he\u2019d barely reached the underground area that was home to all their vehicles when someone pulled him aside and whispered that he\u2019d been hearing rumors to do with \u201cpurity.\u201d Freezing, Drew asked for further details, but the mechanic shrugged. \u201cI think it\u2019s something nasty, but no one\u2019s sure quite what.\u201d</p><p>His anger tempered by the need to protect the pack, Andrew began to do what he did best\u2014talk to people. Over the next few hours, he moved from group to group, eating lunch with the soldiers, playing chess with a few of the elders, hanging out in the infirmary and in the training rooms.</p> <p>His gut was a knot at the start. The last traitor within the pack had almost killed SnowDancer, stabbing a knife straight into its heart. He wasn\u2019t sure they could bear it a second time.</p><p>The pack was too tight a unit, their loyalty to each other the bedrock on which they built their worlds. But what he found was something else, something unexpected.</p><p>\u201cAn e-mail,\u201d he said to Hawke later that day, after managing to get his hands on a copy at last. \u201cSent from an anonymous account but, from the content, it\u2019s connected to Pure Psy, that group all about maintaining Silence. No one knows where it originated\u2014and a few of the people who received it had enough skill to attempt a backtrace. Nada.\u201d</p><p>Hawke held his hand out for the e-mail. Andrew passed it across, having already memorized the poison.</p><p>We invite our brothers and sisters in SnowDancer to help us achieve our aim of a world of absolute Purity. Surely you do not want your blood polluted with those of the other races\u2014surely you do not want your pack weakened by humans.</p><p>Hawke threw down the piece of paper, his jaw a brutal line. \u201cDo we have a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Andrew was happy to say, his wolf\u2019s relief a powerful beat against his skin. \u201cEveryone I ran into who\u2019d had contact with the thing found it ugly and malicious and deleted it immediately. I got this copy from someone\u2019s recycle bin.\u201d</p><p>Hawke rubbed at his forehead. \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t they e-mail it to me? I need to know about shit like this.\u201d When Andrew said nothing, his alpha sat back in his chair. \u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s why I have you.\u201d</p><p>Andrew gave him a wry smile. \u201cMost people just didn\u2019t think it was that important\u2014figured it was a nasty e-mail campaign by some crackpot group but nothing more.\u201d Relaxed now, but with a different tension thrumming in his blood, he nodded at the e-mail. \u201cThat was a miscalculation on the part of Pure Psy. Almost everyone in the pack has someone human in their family, and they\u2019ve come to see the Lauren children as pups to protect.\u201d And wolves, changeling or feral, would give their lives to protect the young. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the fact the sender seems to have targeted people lower down in the hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans they\u2019ve made enough of a study of us to get a handle on at least a little of how the pack functions.\u201d Hawke tapped a finger on his desk. \u201cWe need to figure out if they\u2019re trying to recruit outside the den as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got my team on it,\u201d Andrew told him. \u201cSo far, it looks like it was a concentrated e-mail blast to our people in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The other thing we need to consider is whether they targeted other groups within the city\u2019s population. Something like this could generate serious friction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put some feelers out, see if that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p><p>The wolf apparent in his gaze, Hawke picked up the e-mail again. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get inside this pack,\u201d he said with cool finality. \u201cBut we need to know how strong they are in the PsyNet.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew didn\u2019t need Hawke to explain why. Given the Psy race\u2019s influence on economics and politics, whatever happened inside the Net had the potential to affect them all. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Judd after this. I\u2019ll see what he can dig up. Last we heard, Pure Psy was mostly a splinter faction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings change fast in that bloody hive mind.\u201d Lines marred his brow. \u201cMaybe we should talk to the cop as well,\u201d Hawke said, referring to Nikita\u2019s new security chief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Andrew said, taking the e-mail and folding it into a square he could slide into the pocket of his jeans. \u201cAs an aside, Nikita can\u2019t exactly be popular with Pure Psy if she\u2019s got a human security chief.\u201d</p><p>That in itself, the fact of a human in a Councilor\u2019s domain, had to be one hell of a story. Andrew had heard bits and pieces of what had gone down with Max Shannon and the J-Psy who was his wife, but he\u2019d been away in another area when most of it was taking place. However, he\u2019d made it a point to get in touch with Max when he returned to the den, knowing the cop\u2019s position meant he\u2019d be privy to some very useful information. Max, too, had seen the benefit of having a direct point of contact with SnowDancer.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a Councilor,\u201d Hawke said, his tone grim. \u201cBe careful what intel you share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much sharing going on right now.\u201d Andrew knew true trust would take time. Hell, it had taken over a decade with the leopards. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling each other out.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s eyes gleamed with unexpected humor. \u201cSo, feel anything out with a certain lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>Andrew didn\u2019t even bother to swear. He just got up and stabbed a finger in his alpha\u2019s direction. \u201cNo interference.\u201d He\u2019d court, seduce, and tangle with Indigo his own way.</p><p>Hawke held up his hands, palms out, but the glint in his eye didn\u2019t disappear. \u201cIs she playing with you?\u201d</p><p>Andrew thought of the silence that had been her response to the note he\u2019d slipped under her door. \u201cNot yet. But she will.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t accept any other outcome.</p><p>Coming in to change for a session with the novice soldiers, Indigo couldn\u2019t keep from staring at the piece of paper sitting on her bedside table. It wasn\u2019t as if the words would\u2019ve changed from this morning, but she picked it up, bringing it close to her face\u2014as if that would make her understand it better.</p><p>Have dinner with me tonight.\u2014Drew</p><p>P.S. Don\u2019t you want to know?</p><p>It was the last thing she\u2019d have expected him to do after the bitterness of their fight. Because, all charm aside, Drew was a dominant predatory changeling male. He\u2019d been in charge of the volatile San Diego sector until Hawke assigned him to his new position as a roaming liaison/spy across SnowDancer territory. And he was their tracker.</p><p>Men like that had tempers. They brooded and simmered. They did not extend olive branches . . . if that was what this was. Her eyes narrowed. Cunning, she thought; Drew wasn\u2019t only smart and strong, he had a whole streak of sneaky running right through him.</p><p>As to the P.S., she could\u2019ve told herself she didn\u2019t understand, but that would\u2019ve been disingenuous when the truth was beating her over the head with the subtlety of a hundred-pound hammer. A hammer wielded by an obstinate male with a wicked, wicked smile and a way of moving that made her want to sit back and simply admire.</p><p>It would be so easy to say yes, far easier than she could\u2019ve ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cBut then what?\u201d she whispered out loud, knowing that the disparity in their ages and\u2014more crucially\u2014positions in the hierarchy meant that any relationship would be a fleeting thing. It already tore her to shreds that they\u2019d lost some of what had always been between them. No matter what, she\u2019d never be able to touch Drew with the joyful familiarity of Pack again, never be able to sleep with her body tangled in his.</p><p>Frustrated and angry at him for doing this, for changing a relationship she hadn\u2019t known she relied on until it was yanked out from under her feet, she scrunched the piece of paper into a ball and threw it into the corner. But though it was out of sight, it refused to leave her mind.</p><p>Having just had an interesting discussion with Judd about Pure Psy, as well as about another matter his brother-in-law wanted him to pursue, Andrew stopped by Brenna\u2019s, knowing she had the day off. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, giving her his most winning smile, \u201cwhat\u2019s for lunch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cI got immune to that look around about when I turned five.\u201d But she hugged him before supplying him with a large piece of leftover lasagna, fruit, and even a slice of almond-orange cake.</p><p>He ate fast, kissing her on the forehead in thanks before using the privacy of her apartment to make a call to Nikita\u2019s security chief. Max was tied up all day today and tomorrow, so they set up a meeting for the morning of the day after.</p><p>\u201cAbout the rumors Judd\u2019s heard?\u201d Brenna asked after he hung up. \u201cPossible dead Psy in the city?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d Reviewing everything he had on his to-do list, Andrew realized he\u2019d cleared it.

His target, the outdoor nursery, was tucked in one well-guarded corner of the designated safe area, and he wasn\u2019t more than a foot inside when he was accosted by a determined two-year-old.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d she said, raising her arms imperiously.</p><p>Being the sucker that he was, he obliged, throwing her into the air. \u201cAgain!\u201d she ordered when he caught her, the morning light blazing off the thick brown of her curls.</p> <p>He obeyed. Four more times\u2014to her squealing delight\u2014before her chubby little arms hugged his neck. \u201cDown.\u201d As he bent to put her on the ground, she smacked his lips with her own in a silent thank-you.</p><p>\u201cSo the charm works on two-year-olds, too?\u201d A gentle comment from the woman who stood watch over the littlies as they played in the secure playground area\u2014fenced off with stone walls to ensure no harm could come to the smallest of SnowDancers.</p><p>He rose to his full height. \u201cThe only one it doesn\u2019t seem to work on,\u201d he said, well aware that her acute gaze would see through any attempt at prevarication, \u201cis your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Tarah Riviere\u2019s smile deepened, and there was such serenity in it that his own wolf turned calm, unwilling to disturb her with its chaotic emotions. \u201cYour mate is a lucky man,\u201d he said without artifice. Such peace would never suit his own wild nature, but there was no denying the beauty and grace of it.</p><p>\u201cCharming me won\u2019t do you any good with my daughter.\u201d Bending down, Tarah kissed a boo-boo, then sent the little boy toddling happily away.</p><p>Andrew shoved his hands into the pockets of his pants, rocking back on his heels. \u201cI adore her,\u201d he said, figuring honesty would only help his case. \u201cAnd if nothing else, she\u201d\u2014he couldn\u2019t say \u201cwants me\u201d to Indigo\u2019s mother\u2014\u201cis attracted to me, but I can\u2019t even get her to talk to me about it because I don\u2019t fit the image she has in her mind of the men she ought to date.\u201d His frustration punched through in spite of himself.</p> <p>Tarah scowled. \u201cNo criticizing my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Shoving his hands through his hair, he caught a pup in wolf form as the boy tried to make a daring escape, and tapped him gently on the muzzle before setting him back on the right path. \u201cShe\u2019s making me crazy.\u201d He remained hunkered on the ground, playing with the pup, who\u2019d circled back to growl and bat at his hands with little paws.</p><p>Tarah\u2019s fingers touched his hair. \u201cMy Indigo is willful. Always has been, always will be.\u201d Affectionate words. \u201cShe knows what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s wrong,\u201d he muttered, growling back at the pup when the little one tried a dominance display.</p><p>The pup froze.</p><p>Reaching out, Andrew picked him up, nipped him on one ear, and sent him on his way.</p><p>\u201cVery well done,\u201d Tarah murmured. \u201cThe babies are always trying things like that. They need to know their boundaries at this age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wolf,\u201d Andrew said, remaining where he was . . . because it was nice to have a mother\u2019s fingers playing through his hair. He only had a few precious memories of his own lieutenant mother, but he missed her\u2014the way she\u2019d pepper his face with kisses, the way she\u2019d brush his hair, the way she\u2019d smell after coming in from duty. Small moments, fleeting whispers, those were the things he remembered. \u201cIt needs the certainty of the hierarchy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change with age.\u201d Sighing, she tugged a little at his hair, making him look up. \u201cYou don\u2019t fit the hierarchy, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Almost no one called him Andrew. He felt like a little boy again. \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d An arch sound. \u201cYou knew exactly what you were doing from the instant you learned to walk. What that pup just tried? The Great Escape? Well, you succeeded nine times out of ten, and you did it by being so completely sweet and well behaved that no one thought to keep an eye on you.\u201d Another tug, a little harder. \u201cDo you know how many times I had to go chasing after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Making a contrite face, he finally got to his feet, Tarah\u2019s hand sliding away to curl around his upper arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d A small laugh, but her eyes had turned solemn. \u201cI like you, Andrew,\u201d she said, \u201cand I like the way you sound when you speak about my girl.\u201d</p><p>Andrew touched the hand she had on his arm. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for her.\u201d</p><p>Tarah looked at him for long moments. \u201cYour mama used to call you her \u2018loving baby.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Andrew\u2019s throat grew thick. \u201cWhat was Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer stubborn baby.\u201d Tarah smiled. \u201cBrenna was her sunny baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had us pegged.\u201d Andrew couldn\u2019t hold Tarah\u2019s gaze anymore, his own misting over. Turning his head, he stared unseeing at the children.</p><p>Tarah didn\u2019t speak for long moments, but when she did, it wasn\u2019t about his mother. \u201cDo you know my Evangeline?\u201d</p><p>Glad for the change of subject, he said, \u201cSure.\u201d He had an impression of long black hair, deep gray eyes, and the slender body of a ballerina. \u201cShe used to play with Bren when they were young.\u201d The two girls had drifted apart as their interests diverged, but they still went to the occasional movie together when Evie was in the den. \u201cShe\u2019s away at college at the moment, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she\u2019ll be visiting in a couple of weeks.\u201d Squeezing his arm, she looked up. \u201cEvie was a fragile child\u2014spent weeks at a time in the hospital. She didn\u2019t really come into her own until she was about thirteen.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Indy as he did, Andrew immediately saw what Tarah was trying to tell him. Indigo, with her strength and her will, would\u2019ve tried to take as much of the burden off her parents\u2019 shoulders as she could\u2014but Tarah\u2019s expression said it was more than that. \u201cWas Evie ever in danger of dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than once.\u201d Solemn words. \u201cAnd my Indigo, she loves her sister. It tore her apart each time Evangeline was taken to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Out of that fire had been forged the steel of Indigo\u2019s nature. She loved her sister, her family, but she wouldn\u2019t easily allow anyone else close enough to create that depth of vulnerability in her heart. \u201cThank you, Tarah.\u201d Because he and Indy, it wasn\u2019t only about sex. They\u2019d been locked together by the bonds of friendship long before he\u2019d dared reach for her heart. And maybe, just maybe, she was running scared because somewhere deep within, she understood that he\u2019d never be a lover who\u2019d allow her to keep a safe emotional distance.</p><p>Tarah brushed a leaf that had fallen onto his arm with the absentminded touch of a mother. \u201cI think you need to meet another member of our family, too.\u201d</p><p>He caught something hidden in that statement. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tarah said after a thoughtful pause, releasing his arm. \u201cPass the first hurdle, then we\u2019ll talk about the second.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to pursue the oblique hint, but Tarah\u2019s tone made it clear she wouldn\u2019t be pushed. However, reaching up, she cupped his cheeks and, when he bent his head, brushed his hair off his face with a maternal hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Andrew.\u201d A finger tapping on his nose. \u201cJust don\u2019t drive my girl too crazy.\u201d</p><p>Andrew grinned, suddenly lighthearted. Indigo was very close to her mother; Tarah could\u2019ve put a serious spanner in the works. Instead, she was looking at him with exasperated affection. \u201cYou know me too well, Tarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScamp.\u201d Shaking her head, she commandeered him to play with the pups.</p><p>Delighted with the whole world at that moment, with hope a blinding brilliance inside of him, he obeyed without protest.</p><p>Indigo couldn\u2019t believe she was considering Drew\u2019s invitation. Staring at the piece of paper she\u2019d retrieved minutes after she\u2019d crushed it and that had been taunting her since, she shoved it into her pants pocket for the umpteenth time. \u201cAgain,\u201d she said to the small group of novice soldiers she was putting through their paces in one of the less utilized gyms in the den.</p><p>They groaned but restarted the circuit. She watched, making note of weaknesses, strengths, things that needed to be corrected. Unfortunately, that still left her plenty of time to think about a certain wolf who was turning out to be mule stubborn beneath his playful exterior.</p><p>\u201cGood group.\u201d Riaz\u2019s deep voice came from behind her.</p><p>She\u2019d caught the dark woodsy scent of him, so she didn\u2019t startle. \u201cYes, they are\u2014our best.\u201d At least one future lieutenant, most likely two.</p><p>\u201cIs that Sienna Lauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d The girl might be spending a lot of time with the DarkRiver leopards, but she was a SnowDancer soldier\u2014and she never failed to put in the required hours in training, further honing the skills Indigo had all but beaten into her.</p><p>At the time they began, Sienna had been a belligerent seventeen-year-old determined to rely only on her psychic abilities. It had taken Indigo almost six months to break through that prickly exterior . . . and glimpse the ravaging fear within. Sienna Lauren was more afraid of her own power than she was of any real or imaginary monster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very, very good.\u201d Riaz walked to stand beside her, his arms loosely folded as he watched the group complete one section of the circuit and move on to the next. \u201cI might have a go at the course myself\u2014haven\u2019t had the chance to do this kind of thing for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll be too easy for you,\u201d she said, fully confident that he would\u2019ve continued to further develop his skills during his absence from the den. \u201cYou should run the outdoor one.\u201d</p><p>A stirring of interest. \u201cIs it the same as when I left?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few changes but nothing drastic.\u201d Remembering something, she smiled and nudged him with her shoulder. \u201cI think you still hold the record for running the old course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Obviously pleased, he gave her a lazy smile that turned his looks from handsome to devastating. \u201cDo it with me?\u201d</p><p>Woman and wolf both read the hidden invitation behind the obvious one, hesitated, then shoved forward. Because he was perfect. There would be no games of one-upmanship with Riaz, no drain on her emotions or her self-confidence as she worried about whether her dominance was hurting him, no having to catch herself before she did something that might dent his pride. \u201cSure. You free after this lot is done?\u201d</p><p>He started to nod, then frowned. \u201cNo, I have a videoconference with some of my European contacts. Can we do it around four instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d Even as she spoke, Drew\u2019s note burned a hole in her pocket.</p> <p>Andrew had just put down the phone after getting hold of the last of the small group of men and women under his direct command scattered throughout the pack\u2014to warn them to keep an eye out for further attempts by Pure Psy\u2014when his wolf caught the burgeoning wave of excitement in the den. It was an almost physical push against his fur\u2014though he was in human form.</p><p>Poking his head out the door of his room, he hailed one of the soldiers heading down the corridor. \u201cEli, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndigo and Riaz are running the outdoor course.\u201d Elias\u2019s words carried a hum of anticipation. \u201cYou know how fast she is, and he holds the record. No way to tell who\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>Andrew felt his spine knot with tension, a freezing chill spearing through his veins. \u201cThey starting now?\u201d Somehow, his voice sounded normal, ordinary, when all he wanted to do was to hunt Indigo to ground and demand she fucking stop running from him. Because he knew exactly what was going through her head at this moment, knew exactly what her wolf would see in Riaz.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You coming?\u201d</p><p>Andrew was already shutting his door behind him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d His wolf was beyond agitated, but he\u2019d always been good at keeping his emotions off his face. His current work for Hawke had only refined that skill. As he exited the den with Elias and jogged out to the training ground, no one would\u2019ve been able to tell that he was walking the sharpest of knife edges.</p> <p>\u201cYou going to take bets?\u201d Elias asked with a grin.</p><p>Since Andrew had been known to do just that on occasion when packmates challenged one another, he couldn\u2019t fault the question. \u201cNot this time. Indigo might skin me.\u201d It was difficult to keep his voice light, to act as Elias expected him to act. He\u2019d always known this courtship wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but he\u2019d never expected Indy to kick him this hard in the guts.</p><p>Then they were on the edge of the run and the kick turned brutal. Indigo and Riaz stood side by side, both of them shoe-less and clearly pumped. Indigo was wearing thin black exercise pants with white stripes down the sides, as was Riaz. The male lieutenant was shirtless, the tattoo on the back of his left shoulder striking against the naturally bronzed tone of his skin.</p><p>But it was Indigo who caught not only Andrew\u2019s but Elias\u2019s attention as well. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d It was a quiet comment.</p><p>The wolf bared its teeth inside Andrew. \u201cYou\u2019re mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like appreciating a beautiful piece of art,\u201d Elias murmured. \u201cYuki would say the same if she was standing beside me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew understood what Elias meant. Dressed in those practical pants and a black tank that clung to her body like second skin, her hair pulled off her face in a tight ponytail, Indigo was beauty without ornamentation\u2014strong, lethal beauty. And an instant later, she was beauty in motion as someone\u2014Judd\u2014set off the starter bell.</p><p>Indigo was liquid lightning as she scrambled up the massive first wall. Riaz, his body heavier, was slower in getting up. But he had the advantage in the next section, which was all about upper-body strength. They were neck and neck as they crawled under the rope-mesh maze, their bodies muddy when they shot out the other end\u2014to run straight up a steep, steep climb where use of claws to ensure stability would get you disqualified.</p> <p>Indigo slipped, fell back on the slick log, but managed to break her fall with her hands.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wolf urged her to get up. She did.</p><p>And Riaz slid back down.</p><p>That was when Indigo turned to glance at her competitor. She was laughing, her wolf obviously exhilarated. Andrew\u2019s blood turned to ice. That look in her eyes, that joy . . . He swallowed, forced himself to watch as Riaz got back up the rise and joined Indigo in swinging over a water hazard before they clasped their hands over the bars of the \u201cjungle gym\u201d that had undone many a SnowDancer.</p><p>Created with interlocking pieces that were shifted around before each run, it was by nature unpredictable\u2014and had more than its share of booby traps. Indigo set off one, swore as she was thrown to the ground and had to go back to the start of the confusion of metal. This time, she managed to swing herself on top of the whole thing and began to pick her way through with nimble sure-footedness. Riaz, who\u2019d gotten ahead, turned the air blue as part of the metal structure gave away, almost dumping him on the earth.</p><p>He caught himself by flipping up his body, but the delay had given Indigo time to close the gap, and they were moving beside each other once more as they dropped from the gym and shot through into the underground tubes that required both speed and strength. Riaz exited first, but Indigo was hot on his heels, and she was the faster runner. She flew past him on the last stretch of the curving run that brought them back to the start.</p><p>Laughing, she collapsed into a sitting position just over the finish line. \u201cToo many baguettes, I think.\u201d She waved a finger at Riaz.</p><p>Riaz, his chest heaving, hands on his knees, grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten faster since the last time I did this with you.\u201d</p><p>The shared history between the two of them didn\u2019t need to be stated; it was all the more painful for being so casually understood. Andrew watched as Riaz held out a hand, as Indigo took it and let her fellow lieutenant pull her to her feet. No hesitation, no worries about dominance\u2014because they knew they were equals, were comfortable with that.</p><p>In a way Indigo might never be comfortable where Andrew was concerned.</p><p>As everyone clapped and congratulated both Riaz and Indigo\u2014they\u2019d run the course in an incredibly fast time\u2014Andrew hung back, his eyes on Indigo\u2019s glowing face. No matter the mud on her cheek, the dirt that tangled her hair and streaked her clothing, she looked amazing. Stunning. And it wasn\u2019t Andrew who\u2019d put that look on her face.</p><p>She turned right then, and her eyes locked with his.</p><p>A furious mix of anger and pain threatened to blind him, but he forced himself to walk forward, to keep his tone even as he said, \u201cThat was some run,\u201d directing his comment to both of them.</p><p>Riaz grinned, and his next words were good-natured. \u201cShe ran me to the fucking ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do it with Judd next time,\u201d Indigo said, a tiny frown between her brows as she looked away from Andrew. \u201cHe can do weird things with his speed\u2014and he never slips on the climb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>Indigo shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMight have to take him on, then.\u201d Glancing at his watch, the male lieutenant met Indigo\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m starving. You want to grab dinner together after we shower?\u201d</p><p>Time froze. Indigo glanced at Andrew for a fleeting second, and he saw her decision in her eyes before she turned to Riaz. \u201cYeah, that sounds good.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Indigo looked up after she accepted Riaz\u2019s offer, expecting to meet Drew\u2019s angry gaze, but he was gone, having melted into the crowd of packmates who\u2019d come out to see her and Riaz run the course. Her stomach turned heavy, as if it was full of rocks\u2014though she told herself she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>Whatever it was that had blazed between her and Drew, it wouldn\u2019t have lasted\u2014and more, it would\u2019ve hurt them both in the process. Better to nip it in the bud, to focus on a relationship that had the possibility of going somewhere. Except that she found herself looking for Drew again, her wolf pacing this way and that.</p><p>There was no sign of him.</p><p>At that instant, she knew he wouldn\u2019t ever slip another note under her door. Because Andrew Liam Kincaid might be charming, he might laugh with ease and tease with smiling joy, but he was also a dominant male. He had pride in spades.</p><p>That pride would not allow him to approach her again when she\u2019d openly\u2014publicly\u2014made another choice.</p><p>There would be no more presents of fossils or bribes of sweet desserts, no more ambushing kisses, no more challenges, no more Drew. The rocks in her gut turning to blocks of ice, she took a step toward the den, intent on following his fading scent.</p><p>\u201cThat was great!\u201d A packmate slapped her on the back. \u201cI knew you were fast, but that was something else.\u201d</p><p>There was no way to make a graceful exit, not with everyone around her\u2014and she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d say to Drew if she caught up with him. Because her decision was the right one. It was.</p><p>Having just watched Riaz and Indigo drive off for their dinner, Andrew slung a light backpack over his shoulder and walked to Hawke\u2019s office. His alpha was marking something on the territorial map hung on one of the stone walls. \u201cDrew,\u201d he said, shooting a penetrating look over his shoulder, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need tonight and tomorrow off.\u201d The words were forced out past the violent emotions still choking his throat.</p><p>Hawke frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re already going to be down a few people with Eli and Yuki taking Sakura to Disneyland tomorrow. Sing-Liu and D\u2019Arn headed out an hour ago to visit her parents for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night, one day,\u201d Andrew repeated. It was all he trusted himself to say.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s pale blue eyes drilled into him, tiny lines flaring out at the corners. \u201cGo,\u201d his alpha finally said. \u201cAnd if you need Pack, don\u2019t be a dipshit and try to hack it alone. Call me.\u201d</p><p>Pack was One. Pack was family.</p><p>Andrew knew that, but right now, he wanted to be alone. It fucking hurt that Indigo had chosen someone else over him. But he\u2019d have shrugged that off and continued to court her, to challenge Riaz for the right to her, if he hadn\u2019t seen that glowing expression on her face during the run, heard her laughter after it.</p><p>Riaz made her happy.</p><p>Really, truly happy, with none of the worry or anger that colored her relationship with Andrew.</p> <p>And though the knowledge had his wolf clawing violently at the inside of his skin, Andrew would slit his own throat before he did anything to savage her happiness\u2014as would inevitably happen if he saw her touch the other male. So he had to get out of here, find some way to gain control over the violence of his emotions, burn off the rage until he was in no danger of using his abilities as the pack\u2019s tracker to spill SnowDancer blood.</p><p>Most people tended to forget that the tracker was also trained to kill the rogues he tracked. Andrew never did. It was why he hadn\u2019t shifted, didn\u2019t intend to shift until he had a handle on himself\u2014he didn\u2019t trust what he might do once he gave in to the much more primal mindset of the wolf.</p><p>Leaving Hawke\u2019s office without another word, he walked down the tunnels with his head bent, not inviting conversation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t count on Ben.</p><p>The five-year-old barreled around the corner and wrapped his baby-soft arms around Andrew\u2019s legs. \u201cDrew!\u201d A shining face lifted up to his, absolute trust in those dark, button brown eyes.</p><p>Andrew could no more squelch that joy than he could cut Indy out of his heart. \u201cMr. Ben.\u201d Bending, he picked the sweet-natured boy up and turned him upside down.</p> <p>Ben\u2019s delighted laughter attracted the attention of passing packmates, made smiles break out on their faces. Andrew smiled, too, but his heart was too bruised to make it real. Turning Ben right side up, he settled the boy on his arm, his eyes on Ben\u2019s soft fleece pajamas. \u201cDid you escape bedtime?\u201d He began heading toward Ben\u2019s home.</p><p>A nod, one arm companionably around his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>A sigh, then he snuggled his head into the curve of Andrew\u2019s neck, sitting patiently until they reached the open doorway of his home. \u201cKnock, knock,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI have an escapee to return.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s mother walked out, shaking her head. \u201cSlippery little monkey. I thought you were in bed.\u201d Taking Ben, she sent Andrew a smile as bright and open as her son\u2019s. \u201cThanks for bringing my little man back.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded and was about to leave when Ben said, \u201cWait! I wanna give Drew something.\u201d Wiggling out of his mother\u2019s arms, he ran to the back of the apartment.</p><p>His mom went to say something when there was a cry from somewhere in the living area. \u201cOh, that\u2019s the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI better go pick her up.\u201d</p><p>Andrew stayed in the doorway as she did so. \u201cHow\u2019s Ben with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe plays with her for hours.\u201d Ava\u2019s cheeks dimpled with maternal pride as she glanced over her shoulder. \u201cSuch patience my Benny has, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Ben tumbled out of his room then, running as fast as his little legs would take him. When Andrew crouched in front of him, the boy handed over a tiny object. It was an action figure of a man in a blue jumpsuit sporting improbable muscles. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me happy when I play with it.\u201d Ben tapped him on the cheek with one baby-soft palm. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looked into those shining eyes and wondered who Ben was going to grow into. Whoever that man was, Andrew had a feeling the whole pack would be damned proud of him. \u201cYeah? Okay.\u201d</p><p>A smile full of sunshine.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Benny,\u201d Ava called. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>Leaving with a wave, Andrew put the little action figure in a side pocket of his pack. Ben had seen. Hawke had seen. Andrew didn\u2019t want anyone else to see. So he made sure he wasn\u2019t stopped again as he headed out and away from this den where Indigo would return on the arm of another man. The rest of what might happen . . . he couldn\u2019t think about it without unleashing the wolf\u2019s tormented rage.</p><p>Indigo sat across from Riaz on the open patio of a roof-top restaurant you usually had to book weeks in advance, the glittering lights of the city spread out in shimmering ropes far below. And beyond that, the dark lap of the bay. It was a stunning view, and the man across from her was undeniably handsome, but she couldn\u2019t focus, her entire body tense as if for battle. As for her wolf\u2014it was agitated, unable to sit still.</p><p>Riaz stirred across from her. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>It was an effort to smile, to pretend everything was as it should be. \u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d she said, turning her gaze from the view to him. \u201cHow did you get reservations so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called in a favor. Wouldn\u2019t do to disappoint you.\u201d A slow smile that should\u2019ve made her senses leap. \u201cDid you notice how civilized I\u2019m being?\u201d</p><p>It was a reference to their past, when Riaz had been a wild, wild young male and she\u2019d been coming into herself as a dominant female. \u201cI almost don\u2019t recognize you.\u201d She tipped her wineglass toward him in a salute, though part of her missed the wild boy he\u2019d been. He was almost too mature these days.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s smile deepened at her comment, but she thought she glimpsed something hidden behind it, a sharp echo of her own confusion. However, when he spoke, his voice was steady. \u201cYou ready to order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><p>Riaz raised an eyebrow. \u201cTesting how well I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She took a sip of the excellent wine and watched him over the top of her glass.</p><p>Amazing dark gold eyes, the eyes of a man who\u2019d seen the world and knew exactly what he wanted. But since his return from Europe, those eyes were more often shuttered and introspective than laughing, and the only time she\u2019d really seen him playful was when they\u2019d done the run. Even when he\u2019d been young, he\u2019d been . . . intense.</p><p>Not that it mattered, she told herself. Play was for boys and children. Riaz was a strong male in the prime of his life. Both sides of her nature found him more than acceptable . . . except, the wolf thought wistfully, a little more playfulness would\u2019ve been nice. After all, he was a wolf, too. Play was part of their life. Shouldn\u2019t he want to play with a female who attracted him?</p><p>As she listened, he placed their order. All perfect. Until he said, \u201cNo dessert. We\u2019ll go for coffee instead.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf sniffed. No dessert? Drew would\u2019ve never made that mistake.</p><p>She caught that thought as soon as it rose, nipped it before it could take root. Drew wasn\u2019t only too young; he wasn\u2019t dominant enough to be able to handle her wolf, despite what he thought. And as she\u2019d seen up close and personal, such an imbalanced relationship couldn\u2019t work\u2014the emotional devastation would destroy them both, obliterating what friendship remained. There might even come a time when he\u2019d look at her with barely concealed hate.</p><p>Shoving aside the painful images evoked by those thoughts, she turned her attention very deliberately to Riaz. \u201cTell me more about what you did while you were away.\u201d</p><p>The other lieutenant began to speak, his voice low, deep, smooth as caramel. As he spoke, she let herself truly look at him. His skin glowed a burnished brown in the light from the candles, his near black hair sparking with auburn highlights. The stunning blonde three tables over was giving him the eye when she thought Indigo wasn\u2019t watching, while the two gorgeous black women one table to the right didn\u2019t even try to hide their admiration.</p><p>Meeting Indigo\u2019s gaze, they gave her a discreet thumbs-up. Indigo smiled back at the friendly appreciation, returning her focus to Riaz\u2019s strong jawline, those beautifully shaped lips she\u2019d once felt on her own. They\u2019d been good as lovers, very good. But they\u2019d parted as the best of friends. No broken hearts. No torn souls.</p><p>It made her wolf halt in its thoughts, consider.</p><p>Changeling wolves mated for life.</p><p>Her parents\u2019 relationship might not make sense to Indigo, but there wasn\u2019t a shred of doubt in her mind that they loved each other to the core of their beings. More, that they fit together like two pieces of a separated whole\u2014as if without one, there would be no other.</p><p>She wanted that, she realized as she sat across from this incredible man who ticked all the right boxes, who\u2019d make a good partner, but who would never be her heartbeat. She wanted the agony and the ecstasy, craved the ferocity of the bond that tied male to female in the most visceral way. Fear bloomed at the idea of the vulnerability that would accompany such a relationship, but it wasn\u2019t enough to overwhelm the hunger in her soul.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Blinking, she found Riaz watching her with a disconcertingly intent look. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, her cheeks burning with cold heat. \u201cMy mind drifted away for a second.\u201d</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t let her off the hook. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other too long to play games, Indigo.\u201d Lifting his wineglass, he took a sip of the golden liquid. \u201cWe know this isn\u2019t going to work\u2014but we\u2019re trying to pretend that it will because it\u2019s easier, safer.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the echo of pain in his words, she reached out to touch his free hand\u2014no matter what, he was her friend. He was Pack. \u201cWho?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mate.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s hand clenched on his. \u201cYou found her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d It was torn out of him, eyes gleaming amber in the flickering candlelight. \u201cShe\u2019s another man\u2019s wife, a good man.\u201d Raw hurt in those words. \u201cNot touching her, not simply taking her, was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2014but she would\u2019ve despised herself for cheating.\u201d</p> <p>So he\u2019d walked away, Indigo thought, though it was clear doing so had savaged him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Riaz.\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine the nightmare he was living, knowing his mate belonged to someone else. Predatory male changelings were possessive beyond belief\u2014it had to be torture to know that another man had the right to touch his mate, to build a life with her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t playing games with you, Indigo,\u201d he said, turning his hand over so their fingers intertwined, his tone raw. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted with all the gentleness she had in her. Hurting and broken, he\u2019d needed Pack, and she was someone he loved as a friend. It would\u2019ve been instinct to turn to her, to try to find some kind of hope. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for apologies between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been so much easier if it was you.\u201d He gave a small smile, the pain in his eyes filmed over by the fist of control. \u201cDrew\u2019s the one, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She went to tug back her hand but he held it. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt confuses me, confuses my wolf, what he makes me feel.\u201d Exhilaration and joy . . . and utter, utter terror. Because what if she was right? What if being with Drew would eventually mean a corrosive pain that would destroy them both, drop by slow drop?</p> <p>Riaz leaned forward and lifted her fingers to his mouth, brushing a tender caress across her knuckles. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d In his gaze, she saw a fierce want, a hunger that told her he\u2019d give anything to have the right to court, to claim the woman who sang to his heart. The woman, Indigo thought with an insight born of her own turmoil, for whom he might just play.</p><p>\u201cTake me home, Riaz.\u201d There was no use in pretending she wasn\u2019t aching to return to tangle with a wolf who shouldn\u2019t have made her feel this way. But he did. And she\u2019d been a coward long enough.</p><p>It was time to come face-to-face with what might very well be her destiny.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Indigo kicked off her heels, shimmied out of her dress, and washed the makeup off her face. Brushing her hair out of its fancy knot and into her more usual ponytail, she pulled on some jeans, topped them with a sleek black turtleneck, stuffed her feet into boots . . . then took a deep breath.</p><p>Butterflies flitted here and there in her stomach, while her blood pumped jagged and erratic through her veins. Lifting her hands to her face, she rubbed. Her skin flushed hot, then cold, before the cycle repeated. \u201cStop stalling,\u201d she ordered herself and wrenched open the door.</p> <p>The corridors were quiet, most of the den having bedded down for the night. Only those on night shift were up\u2014they waved hello to her as she passed by. Waving back, she carried on. Drew\u2019s quarters were near the end of the passage, and she was raising a hand to knock when the soldier next door poked out his head. \u201cHey, Indigo. Thought I scented you. You looking for Drew?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe left a couple of hours ago,\u201d the other male told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a backpack,\u201d was the response. \u201cI figured he was heading out on one of his trips.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dropped. Had he left? Had he finally given up and left? Her wolf went quiet, unsure, even as anger spiked. That wasn\u2019t how the game was played\u2014the male didn\u2019t leave. He chased and he tangled and he fought. Except . . . she\u2019d chosen someone else in front of him. She might as well have taken a buzz saw to his pride, the one vulnerable spot in a predatory changeling male\u2019s armor. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, the other soldier ducked back inside. Indigo forced herself to walk down the corridor and away from the quarters used by the single dominants in the pack. She didn\u2019t even realize she was heading for Hawke\u2019s office until she got there and found it empty. Frustration churned, but she turned back around and arrowed toward the training rooms. Their alpha slept very few hours a night, haunted by things that had marked him since childhood\u2014and perhaps, right this moment, more than a little sexual frustration.</p><p>She tracked him down in the weight room, where he was sitting on a bench doing arm curls with free weights while reading what looked like stock-market reports on a transparent comm screen on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cThere goes your image as all brawn, no brain,\u201d she said, turning her back to the reports.</p><p>Grunting, he put down the weight he\u2019d been using. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone. It\u2019s my secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>She passed him a towel when he nodded at where it was slung over another machine. Waiting until he\u2019d wiped off his face and put down the towel, she took a seat on the bench opposite. It gave her a good view of his naked chest, and yes, gleaming with sweat and lightly furred with pale silver-gold, it was a damn nice view, the kind of view that would have made most women drool and beg for a chance to stroke him until he growled and took over.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Hawke muttered, but the wolf\u2019s laughter was apparent in his gaze. \u201cHere I sit in all my glory, and she\u2019s comparing me to another man.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, Indigo fell back on the bench, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first step toward recovery is admitting that.\u201d</p><p>She showed him the middle finger of her left hand for that pithy statement. \u201cAm I a stubborn fool?\u201d As evidenced by the fact that she might just have driven away the only man who\u2019d ever threatened to breach her defenses . . . who\u2019d made her feel vulnerable enough that she\u2019d struck out in self-protective panic.</p><p>\u201cYour determination is part of what makes you a good lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back up, she stared at him as he began to do curls again, the muscles of his upper arm bunching and flexing in all sorts of interesting ways. It was nice eye candy\u2014but she still didn\u2019t want to bite. \u201cDominant female, equally dominant or more dominant male, that\u2019s the equation. That\u2019s how it always goes.\u201d</p><p>Ice blue eyes, shimmering with flickers of color from the screen opposite, met hers. \u201cYou already know that\u2019s not how it always works so why are you wasting time repeating the same argument? Just go find Drew and sort it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s annoying, you know, that habit you have of knowing everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m bigger than you and you can\u2019t beat me to a pulp.\u201d Placing the weight on a rack, he got up and moved to an exercise mat. \u201cStand on my feet,\u201d he said, lying on his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing boots.\u201d But she walked over and pressed down with her palms on his raised knees as he did sit-up after sit-up without so much as his breathing altering. \u201cYou know about Adria.\u201d</p><p>Hawke curled his lip. \u201cFor a smart woman, you\u2019re being amazingly dense.\u201d When she glared, he deigned to explain himself. \u201cYou\u2019re not Adria, Indigo.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought, she wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d never let a man treat her the way Martin treated Adria\u2014had always treated her. Drew, by contrast . . . no, he wasn\u2019t Martin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still thinking?\u201d Hawke asked, abdomen muscles crunching as he continued to exercise while they spoke. \u201cYou need to work this out face-to-face with Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Hawke. I think I might\u2019ve really messed up.\u201d Tangling with each other, fighting with each other, that was all fine. But she\u2019d crossed a line when she\u2019d brought a third player into the equation\u2014it had been done in that same self-protective panic, but it had changed the equilibrium between them in a sickening way.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you might have, too.\u201d Brutally honest words. \u201cBut he\u2019s only got about three hours\u2019 head start, so you can catch him if you leave now.\u201d</p><p>She looked down into his face as he stopped doing the sit-ups to watch her with those eerily piercing eyes. \u201cWill he welcome me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Flowing up into a standing position when she released his knees, he picked up the remote to change the channel from stock reports to a roundup of the day\u2019s sports news. \u201cBut you\u2019re not the giving-up type. Of course,\u201d he added as she turned to leave, \u201cthat\u2019s your biggest weakness, too.\u201d</p><p>Indigo tested the straps of the pack on her back as she stepped out of the den and into the cool night air. She could\u2019ve run up in wolf form, hunted to keep herself fed, but she was already going to be plenty emotionally exposed when she reached Drew. No use being naked on top of that.</p><p>Hawke had no idea which way Drew had gone, and the rain-laced wind had made a mess of the scent trail, so she was going to have to do this the hard way\u2014using her tracking skills. Which would have been easier if the wind hadn\u2019t decide to swirl up and merrily throw around the leaves, erasing any trace of Drew\u2019s passage.</p><p>Something rustled to her left just as she bent down to check for more subtle evidence that might indicate a male of his height and weight had passed this way. Jerking up her head, she realized she\u2019d been so deep in thought, she\u2019d left her flank unprotected. Of course, this was SnowDancer land, and the man who walked out was a fellow lieutenant, but still . . . \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing lurking in the dark?\u201d</p><p>Judd came to crouch beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural gift.\u201d He was dressed all in black, the quintessential assassin. He\u2019d given up his former career, but she knew he continued to be involved with the Psy\u2014and more particularly, with the Ghost, the most dangerous Psy rebel of them all.</p><p>\u201cOff to see your lethal buddy?\u201d</p><p>Judd shook his head, dark brown hair gleaming black in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m not here to chat\u2014I\u2019ve got a meeting in an hour.\u201d Unspoken was the fact that the people he met with would be unlikely to wait. \u201cDrew went in that direction.\u201d He pointed straight in front of him and up. \u201cI tracked him for a while to make sure he wasn\u2019t doing anything stupid. Last I saw, he was at the Serpent Pass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Indigo got to her feet as Judd rose. \u201cThanks.\u201d She tugged a little uncomfortably on a strap. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Judd faded back into the darkness. \u201cBecause I was you, once.\u201d</p><p>As she shifted on her heel and began to trek to the Serpent Pass, Judd\u2019s words reverberated in her skull. The other lieutenant was Psy, had been an ice-cold bastard when he first joined the pack, as emotionless, as harsh as the rock faces in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>She was changeling. Touch was her lifeblood, and she was tied to the pack by countless threads. There were no similarities between them.</p><p>Except . . .</p><p>A flicker of memory, of holding back tears after a bad fall because she didn\u2019t want to cry and give her parents something else to worry about. It had been instinct\u2014she\u2019d known they needed all their energy to care for Evie. Loving her sister as Indigo did, that choice, and the ones that came after, weren\u2019t anything she regretted\u2014her independence and strength were qualities she was proud of.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with being steel, nothing wrong with being strong. It was expected with men. Just because she was a woman . . . But right when she was working up a good head of steam, she remembered who\u2019d said the words that had begun this tumble of memories and thoughts.</p><p>If anyone knew about being ice, about being steel, it was Judd.</p> <p>Her foot caught on a twisted root and she almost went flying. \u201cShit.\u201d Steadying herself, she wrenched her focus firmly back to the present. The past and how it had shaped her could all come later. Much later.</p><p>Four hours after she began, in a rugged area lightly sprinkled with patches of snow, she caught the first hint of Drew\u2019s scent. Her instinct was to move at a faster clip, catch up to him as soon as possible, but she forced herself to slow down, consider what she was going to say when she reached him.</p><p>A blank.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just great, Indigo,\u201d she muttered under her breath, unscrewing the water bottle she\u2019d refilled at a spring a couple of hours earlier and gulping down half of it without pause. Thirst quenched, but mind no more forthcoming, she slid it back into its spot along the side of her pack and began to climb the jagged pathway in front of her. In truth, it wasn\u2019t really a path, more like a rock slide that had solidified over time and that the pack used as stairs when in wolf form.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as straightforward in a human body. Her hands got banged up a little on the sharp edges, and she whacked her knees a couple of times, but she hardly noticed the small hurts as she crested the rise. Because Drew had stopped\u2014on a small plateau bare of snow that would catch direct sunlight when the sun rose, though the area beyond it was thick with trees, their arms reaching into the clouds.</p><p>He\u2019d set up a portable laz-fire and unrolled his sleeping bag on top of a groundsheet that would keep the damp from soaking in. It would\u2019ve still been too cold for most humans\u2014probably a lot of changelings, too. But she\u2019d felt Drew\u2019s body against hers, knew he burned white-hot. Taking a deep breath, she made her way down to the campsite.</p> <p>Above her, the night was a crystalline darkness, the stars as bright as shards of diamond; below her, only silence. Halfway down, she glimpsed Drew\u2019s pack lying against a tree not far from the fire, but there was no sign of the man she\u2019d come to find. It was only when she was almost at the plateau that she heard the gurgle of water in the distance. Shrugging off her own pack along with her jacket, she left them by Drew\u2019s and followed that sound to what turned out to be a stream.</p><p>Swollen from the rains and melted snow, it crashed down into a natural pool formed by the long passage of water against rock, where it turned quiescent at last. The pool was black beyond the foam of the falling water, but she didn\u2019t need anything other than the starlight\u2014her eyes went unerringly to the muscled body of the man cutting through the dark surface.</p><p>Scrambling down to the side of the pool, she saw the rock where Drew had abandoned his clothes. Sweat soaked her own clothes in spite of the chill air, and she looked longingly at the water. Drew hadn\u2019t noticed her yet, and when he did, she knew it wasn\u2019t going to be pretty. \u201cHell with it,\u201d she muttered and reached down to pull off her boots.</p><p>She\u2019d just taken off her turtleneck and dumped it on the rest of the pile when Drew\u2019s head snapped up out of the water. Their eyes met and it felt as if the universe itself was holding its breath.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Andrew would\u2019ve thought he was hallucinating, except that Indigo\u2019s scent surrounded him on every side, the air currents cruel and capricious. Staring at her standing there so proud and so beautiful\u2014so goddamn beautiful\u2014he had to fight with every ounce of his strength not to power through the water and pull her down so he could slick his hands over her breasts, claim her mouth with his own.</p><p>Continuing to hold his gaze, she reached up and released her hair from its ponytail. The dark mass rippled down her back, over her shoulders. She swept it away, baring the black curves of the bra that shaped her body. Even from this far away, he could tell it was no flimsy, lacy thing. No, it was functional, supported her . . . and cupped her with breathtaking intimacy.</p><p>He\u2019d held her when she was naked, even kissed her when she was naked. But no moment had felt as intimate as this. As he watched, his body rock hard with a sudden, furious arousal that made him burn, she reached behind herself and unhooked her bra.</p> <p>No.</p><p>He dove under, deep enough that there was nothing but silence, nothing but darkness, the water gliding over his body in a caress of liquid satin, cold and sweet. Emerging only when his lungs protested, he shoved the hair out of his eyes to see that the shoreline was empty, Indigo\u2019s clothes abandoned beside his.</p><p>A ripple of water against his side and he knew she was in the stone pool with him, her body as sleek and fast as that of a fur seal as she dove under and came up a few feet to his left. Body gleaming wet, she made her way to him, her movements slow and easy\u2014as if she was afraid he\u2019d disappear.</p><p>Her caution made him bare his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a pissed-off male wolf,\u201d Indigo answered, her pulse hammering double time. \u201cRule of thumb there is to move slowly and try not to get your throat ripped out.\u201d</p><p>A low snarl vibrated in the sudden silence around them as the forest creatures froze. \u201cI don\u2019t need my ego stroked, Indigo. You made your decision. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Blunt words, with none of the charm she\u2019d come to expect. \u201cWere you worried that one of your chicks was in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not lettin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as you can see, I\u2019m fine. So you can go back to the den with a clear conscience.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d cut through the water and was pulling himself out before she could stop him. Used to giving packmates privacy, she went to close her eyes, then thought, to hell with it, and kept them open. He was built gorgeously, all fluid lines and supple muscle that hid a ferocious power and strength.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her as he picked up his dirty clothes and left, but she knew he was aware she was watching. As he disappeared into the forest, she blew out a breath and, floating on her back, stared up at the jewel-strewn sky. \u201cWell, that went well.\u201d No one answered her, the forest denizens going about their business once more, uninterested in the fact that the rules she lived her life by were crumbling around her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she remained in the pool, but when shivers began to crawl over her skin, she finally hauled herself out . . . to find a clean T-shirt and towel placed where her dirty clothes had been. Her heart gave a little beat of hope. Toweling herself down as fast as possible in an attempt to rub heat into her skin, she pulled on the T-shirt.</p><p>Earthy warmth and sunshine and laughter.</p><p>It was Drew\u2019s T-shirt. Nuzzling her face into the shoulder, she inhaled deeply of his scent before wrapping the towel around her hair and making her way back to the campsite. The scent trail Drew had left behind led her up an easier path than the one she\u2019d used to come down, and she reached the warm light of the laz-fire not long afterward.</p><p>Drew was lying on his back on top of his sleeping bag when she arrived, his arms folded behind his head, his body clad in faded jeans and nothing else. He\u2019d made no effort to roll out her sleeping bag. In fact, even her dirty clothes had been packed away. The hint was as clear as a billboard sign.</p><p>Growling low in her throat, she ripped off the towel and dumped it on his pack. Then, driven by anger and the stubborn will that had created this mess in the first place, she walked over to straddle his fake-sleeping body. His eyes snapped open as her weight came down on his hips, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>She glimpsed a furious mix of raw hunger and pure rage in the blue of his eyes in the split second before he propped himself up on his elbows and said, \u201cWhat? Riaz doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing in bed?\u201d in a voice harsh enough to strip paint.</p><p>\u201cIs that an offer?\u201d It was a sweet question as she shifted to cradle the powerful jut of his arousal between her thighs. He felt . . . Her stomach went all tight and twisty, her skin shimmering with a sudden, blinding heat that had nothing to do with the fire to her left.</p><p>His face was pure scowl when he responded. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to be the fucking booby prize, so no, it\u2019s not an offer.\u201d</p><p>Unfolding her arms, Indigo leaned down to brace herself with her palms flat on either side of his head. Drew fell back, his hands coming to close over her hips. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Gritted out through clenched teeth.</p><p>Those hands, those fingers, they felt like brands on her skin, burning through the fabric of the tee to imprint her skin. \u201cTrying to figure out why the hell I came all this way to get abused.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened. \u201cYeah, why did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because I wanted to do this.\u201d She nipped sharply at his full lower lip. \u201cAnd this.\u201d Sucking his upper lip into her mouth, she released it with slow pleasure. \u201cAnd this, too.\u201d Pushing her fingers into his damp hair, she swept her tongue inside his mouth in a brazen kiss that held nothing back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A growl vibrated in his chest and it made her shiver. \u201cThat felt good,\u201d she said, breaking the kiss to gasp in a breath. \u201cDo it again when I\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid down, then back up her thighs to close over her bare buttocks. \u201cWhat are you doing, Indigo?\u201d</p><p>But she stole the question with her mouth, raising one hand off the soft cushion of the sleeping bag to stroke against his cheek. The stubble of his unshaven jaw rasped over her palm, and she wanted to feel that same sensation on softer, far more delicate skin. Her thighs clenched around him, and he felt it, if his response was any indication.</p> <p>Squeezing the flesh he\u2019d palmed, he slid his hands down to her upper thighs, played his fingers along the highly sensitive inner faces just enough to make her gasp . . . then slid his hands right back to where they\u2019d been. \u201cTease.\u201d She broke the kiss, looked down at him. And saw something that made her bury her face in his neck as she stretched out her legs until she lay on top of him, his hands still on her bare flesh, his erection rigid beneath her thigh, his chest rising and falling in a jagged rhythm.</p><p>Her own breathing wasn\u2019t exactly steady either, but she licked her lips, tried to talk. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d It came out soft, husky.</p><p>But Drew was a wolf, his ears predator-sharp. Shifting, he rearranged her with possessive hands until she lay on her back, with him braced on one elbow above her. His damp hair was messy from her hands, tumbling over his forehead, making him appear even younger than he was.</p><p>Yet the firelight flickering over his eyes told a different story. There were shadows there, echoes of pain and sorrow, loss and hope. He\u2019d lived, this wolf, fought and bled for the pack, and she had no right to devalue that simply because she had four years on him. \u201cNo games,\u201d she said again, daring to raise her hand to stroke his hair off his forehead.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d he asked, allowing the touch, continuing to pin her with one leg thrown over her own, but still so coolly distant, still not the Drew she knew.</p> <p>She ran her fingers down his cheek, along his jaw, stroking the heated silk of his shoulder. Her thighs clenched in silent, sensual response as the muscles flexed under her touch. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Hard words, his jaw a brutal line.</p><p>Her wolf growled at the challenge. Drew stared back in unflinching demand. \u201cI want to try,\u201d she said when he refused to break the deadlock. \u201cI want you. But I don\u2019t know if my wolf will accept what it is you want from me.\u201d</p><p>It remained uncertain about a male who simply did not fit into what it considered the acceptable parameters for the mate it would take as its own\u2014no matter how much he called to both woman and wolf. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d What she didn\u2019t add was that she was terrified he\u2019d hurt her, that he\u2019d be unable to accept the truth of who she was. That would betray too big a vulnerability. But one thing she did have to say. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make promises I may not be able to keep.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his hand, Drew took the one she had on his shoulder and pressed a kiss to her palm. Her heart twisted sharply inside her chest, and it might\u2019ve made her panic if he hadn\u2019t shifted his leg at that moment\u2014the rough caress of denim across her thighs made her hiss out a breath. \u201cDrew.\u201d</p><p>No smile, but he released her hand and placed his own on her ribs just below the curve of her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cYou let me worry about myself,\u201d he said into the charged silence. \u201cBut you have to be sure, Indigo.\u201d She opened her mouth to reply, but he pressed a finger to her lips, silencing her. \u201cI let you walk away with Riaz because I thought he made you happy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she thought, even as he continued with an unfamiliar ruthlessness in his tone, \u201cI won\u2019t have the nobility to walk away a second time if you decide you prefer another man. I\u2019ll fight to the fucking bitter end and I won\u2019t care about the consequences. I\u2019ll take him, bloody him if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf flexed its claws inside her mind. \u201cIf I decide against you,\u201d she said, raising herself up on her elbows and tightening her stomach muscles against the impact of his thigh sliding between her legs, \u201cI\u2019ll fight my own battles.\u201d She\u2019d come to him because she\u2019d fucked up, but that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t who she\u2019d always been. \u201cI don\u2019t need another man to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Exquisite.</p><p>\u201cJust so we understand each other.\u201d A nip to her lower lip. Another to the curve of her neck and shoulder as he used his weight to press her down into the softness of the sleeping bag.</p> <p>More than ready to dance with him, she wove her fingers through his hair. But he pulled away and was crouching on his feet several feet from her before she knew he\u2019d gone. His eyes glinted night-glow in the darkness. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline pumped through her. Shifting into the same position opposite him, she angled her head. \u201cFeeling frisky?\u201d</p><p>His eyes, gone that beautiful, strange, wolf copper, followed her every minute stir. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>The tiny hairs on the back of her neck rose up, but it was a sign of anticipation, not fear. \u201cYou\u2019ll never catch me.\u201d It was a lazy taunt as she feigned right . . . then jumped over the fire in a leap no one but a changeling would ever make.</p><p>She heard him growl behind her, but she was already in the forest and doing everything she could to mess up her scent trail. She went through a shallow portion of the stream twice, doubled back, then retraced her steps before heading downwind. Cheeks pulsing with color, her heart thumping in her chest, she looked around.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Too much silence.</p><p>He was close and the forest knew it.</p><p>Grinning, she messed up the trail some more, then found herself a hiding place on the other side of the stream\u2014behind a bush hung with tiny red winter berries that were so inedible, even the birds passed them by. Looking over the top, she tracked the other side of the river using the wolf\u2019s night vision.</p><p>There.</p><p>He flowed out of the dark, a wolf in human form. She saw him scent the area around the stream and disappear back the way he\u2019d come. What was he doing? She knew he wouldn\u2019t have fallen for that little trick\u2014she wasn\u2019t really trying to lose him. They were playing. The fun was in the chase.</p><p>And Drew was cunning.</p><p>Realizing what he\u2019d done, she spun around just in time to see him streak out of the trees behind her. Her chest filling with laughter, she managed to get on the other side of the bush as he came to crouch opposite her and said, \u201cI found you,\u201d in a very wolfish tone.</p><p>She widened her eyes, looking beyond him. \u201cOh, no!\u201d</p><p>Protectiveness built into his makeup, he turned to check on the threat . . . and she was gone, hopping across the rocks that forded the stream and up on the other side, her wolf laughing all the while.</p><p>Andrew hadn\u2019t had this much fun in . . . ever. Chasing after Indigo as she took off, he let her get ahead then circled around to wait in ambush behind a small tree. She scented him, stopped, but they\u2019d passed through this area so many times, she had no way of knowing if he was actually there or if it was only his scent that lingered.</p><p>He saw her bite her lower lip and knew the instant she decided to go for it. Snapping her back against his chest as she padded past his hiding spot, he nipped at the place in her neck that fascinated him and spun her free. He wanted to play some more.</p><p>She understood.</p><p>Throwing him a grin filled with pure delight, she pointed behind him. He turned, giving her a head start. He waited almost five minutes before beginning to look for her. She was hiding, not running this time. He couldn\u2019t feel the vibrations of her flight beneath the pads of his feet, and the forest creatures were chattering quietly once more, her willing accomplices in offering a cover of noise.</p><p>Prowling over the ground in a swift half run that was so fluid it would\u2019ve appeared impossible to human eyes, he caught a hint of steel in the air, a hint of spring rainstorms . . . and was ready when she \u201cattacked.\u201d Spinning while she was in midjump, he caught her against his chest, let her take him to the pine-needle-strewn earth in a tangle of limbs and hair. When she nipped at his jaw, he growled, but she laughed and repeated the provocation.</p><p>Pushing her hair off her face, he tugged her down until they were nose to nose, their wolves staring into each other\u2019s eyes. When he snapped his teeth at her, she snapped back. His smile spread until it felt as if it might crease his face forever. Their kiss was as wild as their chase, as playful as their game.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and didn\u2019t protest when he rose with her in his embrace, unwilling to do this on the cold earth, no matter that the pine needles provided a thick mattress. Bold and unashamed, she took his mouth with the passion of a woman who knew what she wanted . . . and the man she wanted it with. It was becoming impossible to have any kind of a rational thought, but he broke the kiss, put her on her feet by the fire. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Stretching her arms above her head, she teased him with the promise of her body as he pulled her sleeping bag open, unzipped it, and laid it on top of his. There, he thought, that would be softer on her back. She jumped to crouch on it even as he finished, having used the discarded towel to clean off the bottoms of her feet. Her playful mood still apparent, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing too many clothes,\u201d and reached for the button at the top of his fly.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop her, though the sight, the touch of her fingers so close to his aching cock was torture. Button undone, she tugged him forward, pushed. He sprawled backward onto the sleeping bags, spreading his legs to give her room as she came to kneel in between. But she didn\u2019t lower his zipper.</p><p>No, she bent her head, and\u2014continuing to hold the searing eye contact\u2014pressed her lips to the very top of his groin, a bare centimeter above the pulsing thickness of his erection. Groaning, he clenched his hand in her hair and tugged her up. She came . . . to give him a bone-tingling kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s overdressed,\u201d he said against her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow remiss of me.\u201d Her smile was full of pure sensual temptation as she reached down and pulled the T-shirt he\u2019d given her\u2014the T-shirt that had covered her in his scent\u2014off over the top of her head.</p><p>His mouth dried up, his brain cells scrambled like so much spaghetti.</p><p>Dear God but she was stunning, her breasts lush against the toned and sleekly muscular build of a woman who was a SnowDancer lieutenant. Her skin was lightly tanned, her nipples darker, the plane of her abdomen having the slightest curve that he had every intention of laving with his tongue before moving lower to nuzzle those dark curls that hid the moist, earthy scent of her desire. He\u2019d part her delicate folds and stroke and lick and pet until she screamed his name.</p> <p>As he watched, entranced, she shifted back to her position between his knees and began to tug at the tab of his zipper. He sucked in a breath, sucked in his abdomen, and hoped he wouldn\u2019t fucking embarrass himself. Lights flashed behind his closed eyelids as his erection sprang mercifully free, and he felt more than heard Indigo urge him to lift up his body so she could tug off his jeans.</p><p>Opening his eyes, he obeyed, and the jeans went flying somewhere to the side. Indigo put her hands on his thighs, her gaze on his erection. \u201cI want to . . .\u201d she began, but he reached down and pulled her up.</p><p>The damp heat of her stroked over his abdomen and he had to grit his teeth to keep from blowing like the Fourth of July. \u201cI get to taste you first.\u201d He squeezed her hips. \u201cThen I get to do it again.\u201d</p><p>She was straddling him, her knees on either side of his chest. When he urged her higher, her eyes went huge. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle broke its way through the sensual haze. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019ve shocked the unshockable lieutenant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should\u2019ve expected you\u2019d know all sorts of debauched things.\u201d But she obeyed him and shifted up . . . until all he had to do was hold her in place with his grip on her thighs, draw in the dark heat of her passion, and lap at what he\u2019d been aching to taste.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s spine arched at the first touch, and she realized the damn wolf had her in a steely grip, would not allow her to wriggle away. The pleasure was excruciating. Her claws sliced out of her skin. She fought to pull them back in, failed.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d She\u2019d been hungry too long, and it only took a few wicked caresses to have her body riding a near-painful edge. \u201cDrew.\u201d</p><p>He let her escape with one final lick. His eyes were pure wolf. \u201cNext time,\u201d he said in a voice gone husky and deep and in no way human, \u201cyou\u2019re going to lie still until I\u2019ve finished tasting you.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in the back of her throat. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair\u2019s fair.\u201d</p> <p>Her wolf didn\u2019t understand his logic, its mind too torn with the hunger for the most intimate, most luscious, of skin privileges. \u201cWhat?\u201d Sliding down his body, she brushed herself against the velvet steel of his arousal.</p><p>Drew\u2019s abdomen was taut as rock under her palms, his cock even more rigid. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said in that gravelly, inhuman voice, \u201cI\u2019ll lie here and let you do whatever you want, too.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf froze, looked at him, licked its lips. Big and gorgeous and dangerously aroused, he made her want to . . . The words wouldn\u2019t come, her body too hot, too needy. Ending the teasing play of her body against his, she said, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on her hips, and then he was flipping her so she lay beneath him, her legs spread wide to accommodate his bigger, heavier body. His skin shimmered with perspiration, and the tension in his muscles had turned them to steel. But though he nudged at her with the blunt head of his erection, the shaft pushing eagerly at the entrance to her body, he stopped long enough to give her a wet, openmouthed kiss that was all licks and little bites, tender and affectionate and sexy all at once.</p><p>And then, as her body arched up, he thrust into her in a single hard push.</p><p>Her scream fell into his mouth, her fingers clenching on his biceps.</p><p>Neither of them moved for the next few seconds. She could feel his heart pounding beneath her palms, and it echoed the frantic pace of her own. Realizing her claws were out just a tiny bit, just enough to blood him in the throes of passion, she went to pull them back.</p><p>He bit her lower jaw. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p> <p>Taking him at his word, she scratched lightly at him as she tried to get used to the feel of him inside her. Hard and thick and deliciously long, he stretched her to the limit, but they fit. Oh, they fit very, very nicely. \u201cGuess,\u201d she managed to gasp out after several seconds, \u201cthe rumors weren\u2019t exaggerations.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, his entire body trembling with the effort it was obviously taking for him not to pound her into the earth.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d she whispered, nipping at his ear, \u201cI\u2019m not fragile.\u201d</p><p>Wolf-copper eyes met hers, nothing of humanity in them. \u201cNo, you\u2019re mine.\u201d Gripping her hip with one hand, he braced himself over her with the other, and then he rode her.</p><p>There was, Indigo thought as her senses exploded, no other word for it. It wasn\u2019t any kind of sophisticated mating\u2014it was raw and hard and primal, the power of Drew\u2019s thrusts sending shock waves through her entire body. She\u2019d have been shoved off the sleeping bags more than once if his grip hadn\u2019t pinned her to the earth, if she hadn\u2019t locked her legs around him and given in to the heat and strength and driving sexual hunger of him. She\u2019d never had a lover as abandoned in her life, and she loved it. Adored it.</p><p>Adored him.</p><p>Clawing at his back, she lifted her hips to meet his strokes, but his rhythm was too fast, too aggressive, and her body was already tightening into an explosive bow. It didn\u2019t matter\u2014it was impossible to halt the movements of her hips now, her flesh claiming and releasing his in an abandoned sexual rhythm that drove him impossibly deeper. Somewhere in between, she realized the fingers of his free hand were locked with hers as it lay palm up beside her head.</p><p>The tension built inside her. Tighter. Hotter. Agonizing. \u201cDrew!\u201d It was a scream as the pressure reached boiling point and exploded.</p><p>Her last thought was that Drew, too, had finally let go.</p><p>She roused some time later to find that he\u2019d flipped them again, so that she lay sprawled on his chest. Her right hand remained entangled with his, while her left hand was curved around the back of his neck. She\u2019d hooked one leg over his hip; the other lay stretched over one muscular male leg, the hairs on his skin deliciously abrasive against her sensitized flesh.</p><p>His own hand stroked up and down her back, a little rough, all perfect. \u201cWake up, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Shifting a fraction, she felt his renewed erection against the skin of her inner thigh. \u201cEven changelings can\u2019t recover that fast.\u201d Her heart was still pumping from the ecstasy of the first ride. She was fairly sure the stars dancing in her vision had nothing to do with the ones in the sky.</p><p>He turned her onto her back, one of his arms cushioning her head. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is what you get for choosing a younger lover.\u201d That cocky, teasing light was back in his eyes.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d missed it, missed him.</p><p>Swinging her leg back over his hip, she pulled him down until he was braced on his elbows above her. \u201cIs this where I have to lie still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pushed up her other leg so it was bent at the knee . . . and slid into her in a blunt thrust.</p><p>Her spine arched off the sleeping bag. \u201cDrew!\u201d</p><p>Freezing, he brushed her hair off her face. \u201cYou weren\u2019t ready?\u201d</p><p>She heard the naked concern, saw the wolf flicker in his eyes. Stroking her arms around his chest, she nipped at his jaw. \u201cOh, I was ready\u2014but a little warning might be nice.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across his face, the wolf continuing to glow in his eyes, but amused now in the most sensual of ways. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Taking her mouth before she could snap at him for that adorably arrogant statement, he began to move in her.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoyed the hell out of their first ride, expected hard, rough strokes again; he was a young (younger!) male and finesse wasn\u2019t exactly a strong point at that age. Except this was Drew\u2014unpredictable, wild Drew. His strokes were long and slow and deep this time, and her claws were digging into his shoulders by the fourth, her body undulating beneath his.</p><p>He closed his teeth over her lower lip in playful reprimand. \u201cYou\u2019re not lying still.\u201d One hand cupped her breast, fingers tugging at the taut peak of her nipple.</p><p>Inhaling a gasping breath, she opened her eyes to fire a retort . . . and saw the wolf looking down at her. \u201cHello,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His answer was to kiss her, his tongue pushing inside her mouth in audacious demand, his body strong and beautiful above her as he drove her stroke by slow stroke to another shimmering peak. This time, she held him as he shattered, his body going taut above her.</p><p>When he collapsed on top of her, she nuzzled him close, one leg wrapped around him, the other raised at the knee by his side. It felt sinfully luxurious to lie here so very, very sated with a man who made her body sing . . . and who apparently, she thought, licking her tongue over a few of the claw marks on his shoulders, had no trouble with the fact that she got more than a little wild during sex.</p><p>To be honest\u2014her grin was wide and bright\u2014it would be pretty much impossible to be too wild with a lover as unrestrained and as enthusiastic as Drew. Rubbing her cheek against the side of his head, she ran her fingers through his hair, massaging his nape.</p><p>Stirring a little, he relaxed even more heavily on top of her.</p><p>And with that much muscle, he was heavy. But she wasn\u2019t made of glass\u2014and there was something to be said for being covered by the hot blanket of a sated male wolf. Smile curving her mouth, she tugged the top of the sleeping bag over him so he wouldn\u2019t freeze, and then she continued to pet him, this wolf who\u2019d made every one of her preconceptions come crashing down around her ankles.</p><p>Now . . . now they\u2019d see what the future held. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They changed positions when he muttered he was \u201csquashing her\u201d and moved to tuck her by his side, one hand spread across her abdomen. Curling her body into his, she went to sleep, well pleasured, warm, and certain the area was safe. Her wolf wasn\u2019t ready to give up full protection of her body, her self, to him\u2014might never be ready to give that up to any man\u2014but it was content enough with his skill and strength to close its eyes and let sleep sweep them both under.</p><p>She woke to find her nose snuggled into the crook of a male shoulder. There was no disorientation, no moment of wondering who he was\u2014his scent was too familiar, too welcome. Allowing herself an uncharacteristic moment of laziness, she stroked her hand down his chest. He was asleep, his arms locked around her\u2014no doubt about it, it was a possessive hold. She wasn\u2019t quite sure how she felt about that, but being with a dominant predatory changeling male required some adjustments.</p><p>Adjustments.</p> <p>She thought of her aunt, Adria, thought, too, of the adjustments Adria made daily, and felt her muscles begin to lock. No, she whispered inside her mind, no. Hawke was right\u2014she wasn\u2019t Adria. She\u2019d kick Drew\u2019s ass out the door the instant he pulled shit like Martin pulled with Adria.</p><p>Not that she could imagine that kind of passive-aggressive behavior from Drew. For all his sneakiness, he wasn\u2019t subtle enough for that type of hostility, she thought with open affection. No, he was more likely to yell at her, and if that didn\u2019t work\u2014now that they were intimate\u2014strip her naked and try to win by drowning her in pleasure. Those kinds of dominance games, she understood and welcomed.</p><p>Cheered up by the realization, she pressed a kiss to the part of him closest to her mouth. He stirred but didn\u2019t rouse. Dropping another kiss on his skin, she pushed gently at him. He made a rumbling sound in his chest, the vibrations causing her nipples to tingle, pressed as they were against his muscular form, but he didn\u2019t let go. She bit him on the jaw. \u201cI need to get up.\u201d When he still didn\u2019t move, she pushed harder.</p><p>Grumbling, he loosened his hold enough that she was able to wiggle free. He immediately sprawled over the space she\u2019d vacated, his face on its side, hair all rumpled. She couldn\u2019t help it. She reached over and nuzzled a kiss into the warm curve of his neck. Another grumble. \u201cNot a morning person,\u201d she said, nipping provokingly at his ear\u2014that got her a sleepy snarl. \u201cI never knew that.\u201d It was a half-wondering statement. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d known everything about him, but she hadn\u2019t known this.</p><p>Startled, she kissed him one more time before trying to find a T-shirt. She finally located the one she\u2019d been wearing the night before hanging over the limb of a tree branch. How it had gotten that far up, she had no idea. Standing on tiptoe, she\u2019d just snagged it when she heard an appreciative wolf whistle.</p> <p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Smiling, she pulled on the T-shirt and glanced over her shoulder. A drowsy-eyed male\u2014a definite wolf\u2014watched her with obvious sensual intent. \u201cIndy.\u201d It was an invitation.</p><p>It was very, very tempting to go to him. So tempting that it made her wolf back off in sudden wariness. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d Heading into the forest, she walked down to the stream to throw some water on her face, her fingers trembling as she thrust them through her hair. This, with Drew, it fit none of the parameters of what she knew. For a woman as used to exercising control over all aspects of her life as she was, it\u2014</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be here doing this.\u201d A hand closing over the back of her neck, a kiss dropped on her parted lips before Drew bent down to throw some water onto his own face.</p><p>Dressed only in a pair of khaki cargo pants, he looked oh-so-touchable.</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Rising to her feet, she curled her fingers into her palms. This inexorable sensual pull she felt toward Drew, it unsettled her\u2014more than unsettled her, if she was honest. She was used to holding the reins in her dealings with the opposite sex.</p> <p>Shaking his head in a way that was distinctly wolfish, he curved one hand around her calf, looking up with those wonderful, changeable eyes. \u201cWorrying about all the things that could go wrong. Enjoy the moment, Indy. Enjoy what we are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I can do that,\u201d she said with a wry smile, some of her tension dissipating, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her leg. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I decided to haul myself awake at this ungodly hour and come rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at least a couple of hours past dawn.\u201d The forest was awash in the chatter of birds, the sky a pale azure with shimmering undertones of gold and pink that presaged a brilliant day.</p><p>Drew made a face, eyes on the play of sunlight dappling the water. \u201cA couple of hours past dawn? Are you insane? Noon is when rational people wake up.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she leaned lightly against him as he moved his hand over her leg in a lazy caress. \u201cHow do you function when you\u2019re on night watch or the early shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI function fine. I just prefer to lie in bed if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re a wolf?\u201d she teased. \u201cYou sound like a big ole lazy cat to me.\u201d</p> <p>He grumbled low in his throat. \u201cI\u2019d throw you in the pool for that, but I\u2019m feeling too mellow after the way you worked me over last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one with bruises on your back.\u201d</p><p>An unrepentant smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any\u2014I checked already.\u201d Rising when she made as if to push him into the water, he slid his hands under her tee to cup her naked bottom. \u201cHey, Indy?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by his oddly solemn tone, she looked up. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re avoiding touching me?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her hands to see that she\u2019d clenched them into fists again. Groaning, she pressed her forehead against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He didn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>A kiss on her temple, strong hands petting the globes they\u2019d palmed. \u201cHave you had enough after only one night?\u201d</p><p>She almost fell for that mournful voice\u2014but the fiend\u2019s eyes were dancing when she looked up. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed the flesh he\u2019d been stroking. \u201cFreak-out, huh? I told you, I kinda expected it.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around him, she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not used to being this . . .\u201d Close to addiction.</p><p>He dipped his head, met her gaze. \u201cDoes it help if I tell you I\u2019m already a junkie? And that I intend to indulge as much as possible\u2014and then do it some more? I can tie you to the bed if you like, so you can\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf swiped a paw at him at the outrageous teasing. \u201cI think it\u2019s you who needs to be tied up,\u201d she muttered darkly, but his complete ease with the hunger between them did go a long way toward making her more comfortable with the depth of her own need. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asked, suspicion in every syllable.</p><p>Her wolf laughed. \u201cFor a good-morning kiss\u2014I\u2019ve decided to let you live.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d He\u2019d slid down to his knees and pulled her sex to the voracious demand of his mouth before she could do more than gasp in a breath. Clenching her hand in his hair, she went to pull him back up . . . but then he did something with his tongue that made her toes curl, and she found herself spreading her legs to give him better access.</p><p>A pleased rumble against her, followed by pleasure upon pleasure.</p><p>Later, after he\u2019d teased her to the point that she\u2019d been driven to threats of murder, they took a dip and ate.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re both up at this ridiculous hour anyway,\u201d Drew grumbled afterward, \u201cdo you want to hike up to Wolf Point?\u201d</p><p>Wolf Point, so named by the first wolves who\u2019d settled in this region, offered a breathtaking view across the lakes that dotted the area. On a day like this, the sky up there would be an excruciating blue, the sun\u2019s rays bright and harsh. Her skin tingled in sensory pleasure. \u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake our packs so we can camp up there?\u201d</p><p>At her nod, he began to roll up the sleeping bags while she turned off and packed the laz-fire. \u201cWe should go back to the den tomorrow,\u201d she said as they finished.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Drew\u2019s gaze was serious. \u201cWe left Hawke short-handed. You think we should head back now?\u201d</p><p>Mentally reviewing who was in the den and able to fill in, she shook her head. \u201cI have my cell\u2014he\u2019d have called if he needed us.\u201d She wanted more time to explore this unexpected bond between her and Drew. Because there\u2019d be no hiding it when they returned to the den, not with the intimacies they\u2019d shared\u2014and would continue to share. Wolf noses would sniff it out in about one second flat.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hide it?\u201d Drew asked without warning.</p><p>Hearing the absolute neutrality of his voice, her spine went stiff. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. Us.\u201d</p><p>It startled her that he\u2019d guessed the direction of her thoughts, but her answer was immediate. \u201cNo.\u201d She was unsure and confused, but she was no coward\u2014not now that she\u2019d made the decision to dance with him. More, she was proud of the male she\u2019d chosen. Whatever happened, he was hers, and other women would do well to keep their paws off him. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one phone call to warn your harem you\u2019re now off-limits.\u201d</p><p>A surprised expression . . . that segued into pleased arrogance. \u201cNo one\u2019ll dare come near me now that you\u2019ve made a claim.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about the nosey parkers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll have worked it out of their system with Riley and Mercy,\u201d she said in a burst of hope. \u201cWe\u2019re two wolves\u2014no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Drew snorted, leaning over to pat her ass with casual proprietariness. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re deluding yourself.\u201d Easily dodging her responding punch on the arm, he grabbed her pack and handed it to her. \u201cThey\u2019ll have a field day\u2014the lieutenant who can drop a man in his tracks with nothing but the ice in her gaze, and . . . Drew?\u201d He made a confused, disbelieving face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Snorting, Indigo put her arms through the straps of her pack. \u201cI\u2019ve known you forever, and I still don\u2019t understand that thing you do.\u201d</p><p>A questioning look as he went to pick up his own pack.</p><p>\u201cMaking people think you\u2019re harmless.\u201d She clicked the support straps across her hips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Mr. Harmless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d Pack on, he walked over to click the second support strap above the UC Berkeley emblem on her sweatshirt as she did the same for him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Indy.\u201d A casual comment, but right then, the blue of his eyes hit her in the heart.</p><p>He could hurt her. Really hurt her. And they\u2019d barely taken the first step into this unexpected relationship. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, fighting the wolf\u2019s wariness with the memory of how he\u2019d teased her earlier by the stream.</p><p>Taking care of her.</p><p>Her wolf froze at the realization, and she had to consciously kick herself into gear as Drew turned to lead the way out of camp. She\u2019d never have allowed him to care for her if he\u2019d tried to do it straight out, but she\u2019d been fooled by his playfulness into missing the protective drive beneath.</p> <p>You\u2019d think she\u2019d know better by now, she thought with an inward shake of her head, but he continued to surprise her with that quicksilver mind. If she was being honest, his keen intelligence was one of the most attractive things about him\u2014even if it did mean he had a way of catching her off guard. The thought made her frown, consider something else. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>When he looked over, she said, \u201cIs it because you\u2019re the pack\u2019s tracker? That you make such an effort to appear harmless?\u201d It was a question she\u2019d never thought to ask before\u2014because he was so very good at making people forget what he was.</p><p>Drew\u2019s hand tangled with her own, his expression solemn. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about it consciously when I was growing up,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as an adult, yeah, that\u2019s part of it. I\u2019m wolf\u2014I need to be a full part of the pack.\u201d</p><p>And, she understood, he couldn\u2019t be that if everyone was afraid of him.</p><p>Nodding, she let it go at that\u2014this relationship was too new to push him to share such an intensely private aspect of himself. But Drew squeezed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Indy. I don\u2019t mind talking about it. Hawke and Riley make me do it on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d She blinked.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d A grin. \u201cI think they want to make sure I\u2019m not going to crack under the pressure.\u201d</p><p>It was then, looking into those amused eyes, that she realized the incredible depth of strength inside him. \u201cIt must be beyond hard to know that you could be called upon to track and execute a packmate at any time.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cThe thing is, I was born with this uncanny ability to track my packmates, better than even Hawke\u2019s\u2014so it was obvious what role I was meant to play in the pack. I had to either learn to deal with it or, once I was old enough to understand, give over the mantle so someone else could be trained.\u201d</p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t understood until today why he cultivated that air of irresponsibility, she\u2019d known him far too long not to have seen beneath the surface years ago\u2014and to the wolf who was one of the most trusted in the pack. \u201cYou never even thought about giving it up, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen wolves go rogue\u201d\u2014quiet words, powerful words\u2014\u201cthey do things they\u2019d never have countenanced had they been thinking. They attempt to hunt, to slaughter their packmates, children included. If that happened to me, I\u2019d want someone like me on my trail, someone who could find me before I did harm, and offer mercy.\u201d</p><p>Emotion a knot in her throat, Indigo stopped and reached up to cup his cheek. He rubbed against it. \u201cDon\u2019t look that way, Indy.\u201d Fingers on her temple, tugging at a flyaway strand of her hair. \u201cSnowDancer is a strong, coherent pack. You know that while I\u2019ve tracked a lot of people, I\u2019ve only had to execute one wolf once I found him\u2014and I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve judged me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was old,\u201d Indigo said, remembering the sorrow in the den at the elder\u2019s passing. \u201cHe had a disease of the mind that somehow evaded the health checks.\u201d But he\u2019d lived a long and happy life before that, been a great-grandfather three times over. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to harm those he\u2019d spent his life protecting.\u201d</p><p>Drew tugged at her hand, his touch warm and solid. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>As they walked hand in hand, she considered the titanic shift that had just occurred inside her when it came to this man. Always before, she\u2019d simply not understood a large part of what made him who he was\u2014but now she knew . . . now her wolf knew.</p><p>A glimpse of color, woman and wolf both stilling in wonder.</p><p>\u201cLook up,\u201d she said to Drew, \u201cvery, very slowly.\u201d</p><p>When he obeyed, she said, \u201cTo your left a little. Do you see it?\u201d</p><p>A long, slow exhale was her answer. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>The blue-gray bird sat proud and imperious on a snow-dusted branch, its claws providing a firm grip. \u201cNorthern goshawk?\u201d</p><p>Drew hummed in agreement. \u201cHas the eyebrow stripe, tail looks to be the right size\u2014would love to see that beauty fly through the trees.\u201d</p><p>As they watched, the bird angled its head to tell her and Drew it saw them, but that they were beneath its notice. Laughing softly, she was startled when Drew brought their clasped hands to his mouth, dropped a kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>It was an affectionate act, a possessive one, too. Her wolf considered it alongside all else she\u2019d gleaned about his nature. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m not noticing all your \u2018mine\u2019 gestures,\u201d she said to see what he\u2019d do.</p><p>His lips were on hers an instant later, his free hand cupping her cheek as he made a thorough exploration of her mouth. \u201cThat was one, too.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. Jerking up a hand before he could avoid it, she slashed a very careful line on his cheekbone. His wolf flared in his eyes in a blaze of wild copper before the human smiled, touched the small hurt. \u201cIt\u2019ll heal before we return to the den.\u201d A complaint.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t.\u201d She almost couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done that, marked him so openly\u2014there\u2019d be no end of ribbing from her packmates now. \u201cAnd if it does, I\u2019m sure all the claw marks on your back will do the job.\u201d Predatory changeling men were terrible exhibitionists when it came to flaunting their claim over a woman.</p><p>Satisfied by that, Drew moved back and they continued on their trek. \u201cLook,\u201d he murmured almost half an hour later, pointing out a delicate white blossom where it peeked out from between two rocks.</p><p>She was about to draw his attention to a fossilized shell in one of the slabs of rock when he froze to predator stillness. Indigo went quiet with him, tilting up her chin in a silent question mark.</p><p>Eyes gone wolf-copper crashed into hers as he mouthed, \u201cPsy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Indigo let her own wolf rise to the surface, her senses expanding. A moment later, she caught it, the faintest whisper of scent, borne to them on cool mountain air currents. Touching Drew\u2019s hip, she caught his attention and tugged on the straps of her pack.</p><p>He nodded, and they helped each other remove their packs in silence. Stowing them in the hiding spot created by the gnarled roots of an ancient tree, they stripped; their wolves would be quieter, the pads of their feet made for the snow and leaf-strewn terrain of the rocky ground.</p><p>Her eye caught by the flexing muscle of Drew\u2019s back as he pulled off his clothing, she gave herself a fleeting second to drink in the sight. He was her lover, she thought, her claws beginning to slide out of her skin as she gave in to the shift\u2014she had the right to watch him. And if there was a little possessiveness mixed in with her visual stroking . . . well, he\u2019d chosen her. Now he\u2019d have to deal.</p><p>It was her last thought before the shift took over.</p><p>Bone-deep pleasure spliced with electric pain as her body turned into a thousand sparks of light before re-forming into a new shape that was lower to the ground, the wolf\u2019s sense of smell so clear, so crisp, she could almost see the signs of the Psy trespassers as glittering metallic strands in the air.</p><p>Coming to her feet, she found that Drew, too, had completed his shift. He was bigger than her, but no less graceful, his ears pricked to catch the slightest sound. Nudging at her with his shoulder, he began to pad toward their prey. They went at a light trot until they were almost on top of the scent, and then, without speaking, they split to circle around the target.</p><p>Indigo crept up to the spot on her belly, not wanting to alert the Psy male at the center of the small clearing. She glimpsed Drew\u2019s silver fur appear between the dark trunks on the other side, but knew their target had no idea he\u2019d been flanked. He was intent on whatever it was he was doing to the earth at his feet.</p><p>As she watched, he dusted off his hands and rose\u2014as if he was waiting.</p><p>Given that SnowDancer security would\u2019ve detected any unauthorized airborne or ground vehicle, that could only mean he\u2019d telepathed for a telekinetic pickup. They had maybe a second or two to take this man down before the Tk arrived . . . but Indigo decided against it.</p><p>A little worm of worry wriggled into her mind as she wondered if Drew would follow her lead or go in himself. In any other operation, that wouldn\u2019t have been a question\u2014as the most senior member of the pack in the area, she had automatic authority. But men\u2014even the most intelligent\u2014sometimes had a way of seeing things differently after they slept with a woman.</p><p>Even as the thought passed through her head, the Tk appeared in the circle. Thirty seconds after that, both Psy were gone, that grating metallic scent the only sign of their recent presence.</p><p>Thirty seconds. She made a mental note to check with Judd, but to her, that indicated the Tk had been one of the less powerful ones. Judd himself only needed to concentrate for a couple of seconds before teleporting, while he\u2019d told her that the most powerful took literally no time at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Waiting a full ten minutes to ensure the Psy didn\u2019t intend to return, Indigo glided out of her hiding spot as Drew appeared out of his. He stayed in wolf form as she shifted; he\u2019d be more lethal that way should the Psy reappear without warning. Releasing her claws, Indigo began to scrape away the dirt on top of whatever it was the Psy operative had buried. Her hand touched metal about thirty centimeters down.</p><p>Her senses didn\u2019t alert her to any explosives, but she waved Drew forward. \u201cDo you scent anything dangerous?\u201d He came, his paws silent on the leaf-strewn ground. Waiting until he shook his head, she reached in and kept digging until the earth was loose enough to allow her to see most of it. \u201cIt looks identical to that metal ball Silvia found.\u201d Except this one was clearly still in one piece. Gleaming steel once she brushed off the dirt, it appeared inert except for a red light blinking at the top.</p><p>Scent or no scent, instinct told her this augured danger, but she was no tech. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should move it until we know what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Drew, having come to stand by her shoulder, growled in agreement. Then, padding around to take a position opposite her, he shifted. It amazed her to watch him dissolve in a shimmer of multicolored sparks before re-forming into the muscled human male she knew so well. \u201cWe need a tech to do a full evaluation.\u201d</p><p>Indigo pushed the dirt back into the hole. \u201cJust in case they come back to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Drew patted it down as the Psy operative had done, hiding all evidence of interference.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get my cell.\u201d But when she did, she found she had no signal either at the spot where they\u2019d stashed the packs or at the clearing itself. \u201cDamn, the storm must\u2019ve damaged the cell transmitter up here. I\u2019ll have to run to lower ground.\u201d The phone had worked fine at the campsite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any huge urgency,\u201d Drew said. \u201cThey\u2019d have had no need to hide the object if it was meant to do something soon.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo agreed. \u201cThen one of us might as well head all the way back to the den. It\u2019ll be easier to lead the techs up here than try to direct them to the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re faster,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do the run. I\u2019ll shift and stay in the trees.\u201d</p><p>Stashing the phone in the hollow of a fallen tree, Indigo shifted. Drew waited until she was in wolf form before stroking his hand down her back in a long, slow caress. \u201cBe careful.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou belong to me now.\u201d</p><p>He was pushing. That\u2019s what predatory changeling men did\u2014and it was something she could handle. Biting lightly at his arm in mock reproof, she streaked out from under his touch, his fingers trailing warm and heavy through her fur.</p><p>It was only when she was almost halfway down that she realized Drew hadn\u2019t even hesitated before stating that she was the faster runner. In spite of the fact that he\u2019d followed her lead earlier, part of her had still been expecting some stupid male act, but again, he\u2019d surprised h\u2014</p><p>She yipped, having almost missed a jump.</p> <p>Taking that as a sign, she pushed all human thought out of her mind and let her wolf take over. The den appeared out of the forest just as she was starting to tire from the intensity of the run, a welcome sight. Inside, she followed Hawke\u2019s scent to his quarters in the area set aside for unmated soldiers. As alpha, he could\u2019ve commanded a far bigger space, but he had a room almost identical to Drew\u2019s. The sole difference was that he had another, slightly bigger, connected room\u2014with an attached galley\u2014where he could hold private, relaxed meetings with the senior members of the pack.</p><p>Scraping her paw on his door, she waited for him to open it. He did so almost at once. \u201cIndigo,\u201d he said, his tone sharp. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, grateful. Nudity with her alpha was no big deal, but she\u2019d just come from Drew\u2019s arms\u2014something Hawke had obviously scented\u2014and it would feel odd to be naked in front of another man when things between her and Drew were so new, so fragile. Moving behind one of the armchairs in the front room, she shifted.</p><p>Hawke threw a large plain black tee to her on the heels of the shift and she pulled it over her head as she rose to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation,\u201d she said and laid out the facts. \u201cBrenna\u2019s worked with Psy technology. She might be able to figure this thing out.\u201d</p><p>Hawke gave an immediate nod. \u201cDorian\u2019s here. He brought up something his mate wanted Bren to look at.\u201d</p><p>A year ago, Indigo would\u2019ve been stunned at the idea of bringing a leopard into pack business, but now the leopards were, in a sense, Pack. Her wolf continued to find that odd, but even it accepted that the cats had proven their mettle, earned SnowDancer\u2019s trust. \u201cGreat,\u201d she said, knowing that though the DarkRiver sentinel was an architect by trade, he had both a keen interest in and experience with complex computronic systems. \u201cThe two of them together should be able to figure out what it is\u2014and they can rope in Ashaya\u201d\u2014Dorian\u2019s mate\u2014\u201cif necessary.\u201d</p><p>Hawke was already making the calls. While he did so, she went into the well-stocked galley and made herself a huge sandwich to offset the calories used up during her high-speed run. She was chewing the final bite when Hawke walked in. \u201cDorian and Brenna will meet you out front in five. They\u2019ll have to come up in human form\u2014with equipment to test the object.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d She gulped down a glass of milk fortified with a protein mix, then made a second\u2014larger\u2014sandwich, which she sealed in a lunch bag. \u201cI\u2019ll grab one of the all-wheel drives.\u201d They\u2019d still have to do the last part of the trek on foot, but they could always return to the vehicle for the heavier equipment if necessary.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s face was grim when she looked up. \u201cI\u2019m not letting the Psy poison our pack again, not with those e-mails about \u2018Purity\u2019 and not with this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stronger than we were before.\u201d They rarely spoke of the dark years when Hawke had been only a child, but those years had shaped so much of what SnowDancer was today. \u201cAnd we\u2019re no longer alone.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Her energy levels back to full strength after the snack, she walked over to pat him affectionately on the cheek. \u201cYou and Riley, no wonder you\u2019re best buds. You both hold things too tight, too close.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t shake off her touch, their friendship old enough, deep enough, that such skin privileges were an accepted part of their relationship. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d he pointed out, tapping her on the nose.</p><p>Shrugging, she dropped her hand but didn\u2019t move away. \u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me what\u2019s happening between you and Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was too new, too private, to expose to the light of day.</p><p>Hawke raised an eyebrow. \u201cWord of advice\u2014Drew and Riley are more similar than people realize.\u201d</p><p>Indigo thought of the way Drew pushed at her, the way he tried to steamroll in his own charming fashion. \u201cYou could\u2019ve warned me earlier.\u201d It was a disgruntled statement.</p><p>\u201cAnd miss all the fun?\u201d A tug at a curling strand of her hair. \u201cNow why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she comforted herself with the thought that his time would come. Boy, would it come. \u201cI better go put on some proper clothes for the drive.\u201d Borrowing a pair of his sweats\u2014way too large for her frame\u2014for the short walk to her quarters, she quickly shimmied into jeans and a longsleeved sweatshirt for the drive back.</p><p>Even with that detour, she was the first person at the vehicle, Dorian and Brenna having stopped to assess and grab the necessary gear from SnowDancer\u2019s tech lab. After placing the cases in the back, Dorian took the front passenger seat while Brenna ducked into the back where she could fiddle with one of the scanners.</p><p>\u201cOlder model,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt switched on okay, but I want to check that it\u2019s fully functional. Haven\u2019t had cause to use it for a while.\u201d</p><p>The drive passed by in a flow of technical dialogue between Dorian and Brenna, and they were soon stepping out for the final part of the journey\u2014with only the essential gear. \u201cBren,\u201d Indigo said, picking up the sandwich she\u2019d made from the dash, \u201ccan you stow this in your bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Leading them to where she and Drew had left their packs, she stopped just long enough to pick out a sky blue T-shirt and jeans. Going commando, she thought with a hint of amusement, wouldn\u2019t be a problem for Drew. He was the least self-conscious male she knew, and that was saying something in a pack of wolves. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived, Drew padded out of the trees to greet them\u2014it was clear from his relaxed state that the Psy hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>Her wolf wanted to nuzzle at him, but she kept her tone professional. \u201cClothes,\u201d she said, placing them behind a tree.</p><p>As she returned to join the others, Drew brushed past her close enough that her fingertips stroked over his fur. Fighting the urge to follow him, to stroke him a little more, she came down on her haunches beside Bren and Dorian. \u201cAny idea what it might be?\u201d</p><p>Brenna tapped something on the little computer connected wirelessly to a device Dorian was running over the ground. \u201cNothing unusual about the metallic compound,\u201d she muttered. \u201cDevice is computronic without a doubt, and functional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to have a power source,\u201d Dorian said, putting down the scanner. \u201cBattery of some kind.\u201d</p><p>Brenna brushed her bangs out of her eyes. \u201cTime to dig, I think.\u201d</p><p>Indigo helped, and it took only a minute to unearth the metal ball. Instead of lifting it out, Brenna and Dorian put their heads together and muttered more technospeak. Having felt Drew come to stand at her shoulder, Indigo retrieved the sandwich from Brenna\u2019s bag and got to her feet. \u201cEat,\u201d she said, knowing he wouldn\u2019t have left the device unattended in order to hunt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As he took a big bite, she realized she\u2019d forgotten to pick up his drink bottle. \u201cIs there water nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but it\u2019ll be faster to run down to the packs.\u201d He\u2019d already demolished half the sandwich. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d</p><p>Aware Brenna and Dorian had matters in hand, she walked to the edges of the clearing after Drew left and began to do a detailed quadrant-by-quadrant search, just in case the Psy had left something else behind. Nothing in the immediate area. And more nothing in a radius of several meters from the site of the device. She was about to turn back when she caught Drew\u2019s scent on the breeze.</p> <p>He found her a few seconds later. \u201cHey, Lieutenant.\u201d His mouth was on hers before she could do more than part her lips to respond.</p><p>She should\u2019ve been used to the way he had of doing that, but she staggered back a little, gripping at his waist to keep herself upright. Not that it was necessary; his arms were already locked tight around her, his mouth exploring hers with a lazy sensuality that made her want to purr like a damn cat.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she said on a breath, \u201cis hardly the time.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss, one big hand moving down to shape her buttocks. \u201cI\u2019m behaving,\u201d he told her, all innocence. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it in front of Dorian and Bren, did I?\u201d</p><p>Her wolf laughing, she wiggled her arms out from around him and reached up to cup his face. Then she kissed the hell out of Andrew Liam Kincaid.</p> <p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Andrew was sure he\u2019d had a rational thought a minute or so ago, but it was a distant memory. The lieutenant was making his brains leak out his ears, her tongue a fast, sleek dart in his mouth, her teeth sharp little accents on his lips, her hands brands against his skin. Groaning, he gripped her hips and gave in.</p><p>His reward was a kiss so hot, it turned his jeans uncomfortably tight. Unable to keep his hands still, he stroked up over her sweatshirt to close his hand around one lush breast. Her nipple was already pebbled behind the soft fabric of her bra, and he played with it through the clothing, wanting to learn each and every facet of what drove her crazy.</p><p>The sound took time to filter into his consciousness, the voice recognizable. Dorian, calling Indigo\u2019s name. \u201cTime to go back,\u201d he murmured against those lush lips that had turned him into a willing slave.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a very good boy,\u201d Indigo murmured in a sexy, husky tone as she reached down to cup his straining cock for one electric second, \u201cI might kiss you other places, too.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a very blue word as she withdrew her hand and stepped back. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to go back and face my little sister if I have a raging hard-on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Except her eyes were dancing with unfamiliar wickedness. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\u201d She walked away, her hips swiveling in a fashion that he knew was meant to shoot his already boiling temperature through the roof. Sexual frustration was a bitch, but his wolf smiled\u2014because the lieutenant was playing with him again. And Indigo Riviere was a woman who played with very few.</p><p>Blowing out a breath, he gritted his teeth and counted to a thousand, somehow managing to get his body under control. \u201cSo, what did I miss?\u201d he asked, rejoining the others where they crouched around the object.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a transmitter,\u201d Dorian said, holding the steel orb in hand.</p><p>He met the leopard sentinel\u2019s surfer blue eyes. \u201cYou sound very sure.\u201d</p><p>But it was his sister who replied. \u201cThe tech is pretty common once you strip away the fancy exterior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRange isn\u2019t huge,\u201d Dorian added. \u201cMaybe five hundred meters or so.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s eyes met Andrew\u2019s, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth that augured trouble\u2014but her words were practical. \u201cWe think it\u2019s meant to act as a locator beacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocator for what?\u201d Indigo murmured. \u201cThis area is wilderness. Aside from the forest creatures, only wolves come\u2014\u201d</p> <p>A pointed cough from Dorian.</p><p>\u201cWolves and leopards,\u201d Indigo said, shaking her head at the blond sentinel\u2019s smirk, \u201care the only ones who come up here.\u201d Lines formed between her brows. \u201cThe only ones who should. I wonder if the Psy we scented when we were with the juveniles were scouting for places to put these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould make sense,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou were a bit more east of here, but not that much lower down in terms of the elevation.\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s hair flashed almost white in the harsh sunlight as he lowered his head to the device once more. \u201cWe can sweep the ground with high-strength scanners, but we have a logistical problem\u2014den territory covers too wide an area.\u201d A glance at Brenna.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s sister nodded in confirmation. \u201cWe need to figure out some sort of specific region to search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long would the batteries last in those things?\u201d Indigo asked. \u201cBest guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll confirm when we dismantle one, but three months would be the outer limits,\u201d Brenna said, looking at Dorian.</p><p>He nodded and added, \u201cThe transmitting function sucks juice. Three for safety, but I\u2019d say two months would be a more realistic estimate.\u201d</p><p>Andrew saw where Indigo was going. \u201cSo we can probably eliminate all the areas where the snowpack has been pretty much solid for over two months.\u201d That would take care of a good chunk of their territory.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brenna\u2019s eyes sparked. \u201cA telekinetic could have moved the snow, but one, it\u2019s a massive waste of power, and two, against all that white, any intruders would have stood out like sore thumbs to our satellite.\u201d</p><p>Indigo nodded. \u201cI agree\u2014we can safely eliminate the snowpack areas for now. We can also eliminate all those areas that get a high amount of traffic.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looked at his sister. \u201cYou got a piece of paper, Bren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a pad in this bag . . .\u201d Turning to rummage in it, she made a sound of success. \u201cHere it is. And a pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby sis.\u201d Grinning at the kiss she blew him, he flipped open the pad and sketched the basic outline of their territory. \u201cOkay, so this is here.\u201d He made an X on the map. \u201cThe other one\u2019s useless as a marker since it could\u2019ve come from anywhere, but how about this?\u201d He drew a rough semicircle, using their current spot as the center of the arc.</p><p>Indigo looked over his shoulder. \u201cThe entire area\u2019s equidistant from the very edge of den territory.\u201d She took a moment to think about it, nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough light that we can test the theory at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have two scanners,\u201d Brenna reminded them, \u201cso we can go in both directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d Indigo said, her tone crisp as she slipped into full work mode, \u201cyou go with Bren. I\u2019ll work with Dorian.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was doing\u2014pairing each tech expert with someone who could keep an eye on security, but he found he didn\u2019t want her alone with the good-looking leopard male. Her eyes met his at that moment, and from the sudden frost in them, he knew she\u2019d accurately read the hotly possessive urge. Gritting it back with sheer strength of will\u2014and having to fight his wolf to do so\u2014he turned to Brenna. \u201cYou need all the gear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the scanner pack.\u201d She slid the little computer into a carry bag and swung it crosswise over her body, the scanner itself held in her hand. \u201cDorian, are you okay using the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, sweetheart.\u201d Setting the computer over his body the same way as Brenna, Dorian picked up the somewhat bulkier scanner. \u201cIt\u2019ll do the trick, but the range is shorter,\u201d he said to Indigo, \u201cso we might cover less distance.\u201d</p><p>Brenna began to move out. Andrew followed, forcing himself to keep his attention on his sister and not on a woman who was quietly furious with him. Brenna didn\u2019t say anything until they were well out of earshot. \u201cJudd told me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew grunted, not in the mood to be teased.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lieutenant, dumb-ass,\u201d Brenna muttered. \u201cGoing all he-man on her isn\u2019t exactly going to put you in her good book.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou have eyes in the back of your head now?\u201d</p><p>A beatific smile. \u201cI have experience with hardheaded men\u2014though I never thought I\u2019d be giving you this little talk. I always thought Riley was the one who\u2019d have trouble. And he went and got himself happily mated to a sentinel.\u201d</p><p>Checking the area for threats and making the assessment that they were the only two out there, he allowed his attention to return to the subject of him and Indigo. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d he muttered, feeling sulky and grumpy\u2014though he\u2019d have shown that to no one but the sister he\u2019d watched over since she\u2019d been but a babe. \u201cMy brain knew I was doing something stupid, but my hormones tell me to protect her\u2014and right now, instinct is kicking reason\u2019s whiny ass.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head, the late afternoon sun making the fine strands of her hair shimmer like spun gold. \u201cThe easy fix is that you grovel and she forgives you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d He nudged her shoulder with his, his wolf willing to listen to her even if she was younger and far less dominant.</p><p>\u201cBut this is who she is,\u201d Brenna murmured, her eyes troubled when she looked up. \u201cYou stood in front of a bullet for me, Drew.\u201d Her voice hitched. \u201cThat\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He hugged her to him, kissing the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Holding on to him for a couple more seconds, Brenna stepped back and started scanning again. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that you protect\u2014do you think you can handle, really handle, being with a woman who not only doesn\u2019t need your protection, but for whom it would be an insult that you\u2019d even offer?\u201d</p><p>The words hit hard, cut deep. But the truth had nothing to do with his acceptance of Indigo\u2019s rank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous,\u201d he admitted bluntly, to the one person with whom he could admit the vulnerability. \u201cI know I don\u2019t fit the image she has in her mind of her perfect partner, and it rubs me the wrong way whenever she interacts with another male who does fit that image.\u201d A male who was probably far more acceptable to her wolf, for all that that wolf had accepted him on a certain level.</p><p>\u201cEven though Dorian\u2019s mated and a leopard to boot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stupid, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all a little stupid when we\u2019re in love.\u201d Her machine beeped on the heels of her statement. \u201cHold up.\u201d</p><p>He waited patiently while she did a deeper scan.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said after a minute. \u201cIt was set off by some metallic content in the rocks, I think.\u201d</p><p>Dorian, Indigo thought, moved like the cat he was. All fluid and graceful. She\u2019d have pegged him for a leopard even if she hadn\u2019t known his changeling affiliation. Hamilton, the leopard she\u2019d dated a couple of times a few months back, had moved with that same feline grace.</p><p>Sexy . . . except that it wasn\u2019t for Indigo.</p> <p>Of course, in human form, Dorian was also ridiculously attractive with his white-blond hair and eyes of electric blue. In the sharp mountain sunlight, his hair burned with pure white fire, drawing the eye. Hamilton, too, had made every female head turn when they\u2019d gone out together in public.</p><p>Indigo had appreciated the visual impact\u2014the same way she appreciated Hawke and Riaz. Her lungs had functioned just fine, her heart continuing to beat in a steady rhythm even when Hamilton kissed her. She\u2019d allowed the caress, allowed him to slide his hand to her nape and hold her in place as he explored her mouth\u2014because she\u2019d wanted to know if there was any chance of chemistry. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.</p><p>In comparison, Drew only had to\u2014</p><p>\u201cEarth to Lieutenant Legs.\u201d</p><p>Indigo snapped her attention to Dorian. \u201cYou pick up something, Blondie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d A feline smile that made her instincts prickle in warning even before he said, \u201cIs that a love bite I see on your neck?\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t gullible enough to fall for that. \u201cI know that\u2019s a great big bunch of baloney I see on your face.\u201d</p><p>The leopard male laughed, utterly unashamed of his blatant fishing as he returned his attention to the scanner. \u201cI was trying for subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Needing to burn off this restless energy, she looked at him. \u201cCan you keep an eye around you while you scan?\u201d He was one of the strongest cats in DarkRiver, and he trained in hand-to-hand combat with a former assassin\u2014she was pretty sure there were very few things Dorian couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p>He gave her a curious look. \u201cSure. You going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do a bit of a scout around\u2014might see evidence of places being dug up.\u201d</p><p>Dorian didn\u2019t tell her that was a crapshoot, simply nodded. \u201cHey, Indigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can run,\u201d Dorian said in a neutral tone that did nothing to lessen the intensity of his expression, \u201cbut sooner or later, you run out of places to run to.\u201d</p> <p>Already loping up the slight incline to her right, she didn\u2019t answer. But his words circled around and around in her head as she sliced through the cold mountain air. Was that what she was doing? Running? It made her wolf shake its head in violent rejection; she\u2019d always stood her ground, taken the hits as they came. Dorian was talking out of his ass. He was a cat, so really, why was she surprised?</p><p>That kept her going for a few more minutes, until her practical nature pointed out that it wasn\u2019t the cat she was mad at. It was Drew. She\u2019d seen that look, seen the way his hackles had risen when she\u2019d given him the assignment. Though, to his credit, he\u2019d kept his mouth shut. \u201cNot too much credit, though,\u201d she muttered under her breath. Because the fact was, he was a dominant predatory changeling male. The words \u201cpossessive,\u201d \u201cprotective,\u201d and \u201cannoying\u201d were indelibly etched into his profile.</p><p>Just as independence, control, and stubbornness were etched into hers.</p><p>There.</p><p>She was almost fifty meters away in the time it took her to realize what she\u2019d seen. Stopping, she circled back to the clearing that bore several patches of spring green grass that were starting to brown\u2014where the blades had been crushed . . . as if by the tread of heavy boots. She could see nothing that indicated a device might\u2019ve been buried there, but she didn\u2019t like the look of the place. Trusting her instincts, she marked the location in her mind, then ran back to get Dorian.</p><p>It took him less than ten seconds to find the transmitter. \u201cBeen here awhile,\u201d he said as they began to dig using their claws. \u201cGrass has grown up over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these patches of crushed grass say the Psy returned recently, maybe to check up on it.\u201d Narrow eyed, she felt her claw tap the edge of the device. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusted a little, but otherwise in good condition,\u201d Dorian said after they unearthed it, \u201cand identical to the other one we found.\u201d His gaze met hers. \u201cWhat the hell are they planning?\u201d</p><p>They met back at the starting point an hour later. Drew and Brenna had come up empty, but with the second device Indigo had found, they now had a better idea of how to structure the search radius.</p><p>\u201cThese objects can\u2019t go anywhere near the den,\u201d Indigo said. They\u2019d spent too much time and effort hiding the exact location of the pack\u2019s true home to give it away so easily. \u201cCan you deactivate them?\u201d</p><p>Brenna conferred with Dorian, then nodded. \u201cNo problem. Like I said, they\u2019re fairly basic at the tech level. To be safe, I won\u2019t even take the components down, but do all the work up here\u2014the one Silvia found was a husk, so we\u2019re safe on that front.\u201d</p><p>Drew rubbed at his jaw, his eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should deactivate them, not yet.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>When they all looked at him, he put his hands on his hips, the glossy brown strands of his hair lifting in the early evening breeze. \u201cIf we switch off two in such close proximity, the Psy might come out to check\u2014and we haven\u2019t got the numbers to cover them if a whole lot arrive at once.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s wolf was still irritated at him in spite of her acknowledgment that he almost certainly hadn\u2019t done what he had on purpose, but she could see the logic of his suggestion. \u201cWe should find as many of these things as possible before we start disabling them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we put all the soldiers and trainees from both packs to searching,\u201d Dorian said, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably find the majority of the transmitters, but as soon as we start deactivating them en masse, the Psy will know they\u2019ve been discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we lose our chance to collar them.\u201d Indigo blew out a breath, frowned. \u201cI think we take that hit; get these things off our land and worry about the why later.\u201d She pulled out the cell phone she\u2019d retrieved earlier. \u201cI need to discuss this with Haw\u2014Damn.\u201d She looked at Brenna. \u201cThe cell transmitter up here needs to be checked.\u201d That made her wonder\u2014\u201cAny chance these devices are affecting it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll oversee the maintenance myself to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably just storm damage.\u201d Dorian was taking something out of his pocket as he spoke. \u201cSatellite phone,\u201d he said, passing it over. \u201cI thought you guys switched over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Brenna said as Indigo stepped away to make the call. \u201cBut there was a problem with the batteries in the shipment. We\u2019re waiting for replacements.\u201d</p><p>Indigo returned to their side less than a minute later. \u201cBren,\u201d she said, \u201cyou and Dorian go down, gather up as many techs as you can. Hawke\u2019s already organizing the soldiers. Drew and I will stay up here, keep an eye on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the phone with you two,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>Thanking the cat, Andrew borrowed it long enough to call Max and reschedule their meeting before handing it to Indigo. She took it and left to camp out at the second site\u2014just in case their actions had alerted the Psy.</p><p>\u201cBest-case scenario,\u201d Hawke said at daybreak the next morning when everyone converged at a central meeting point, \u201cthey take the hint and stay out of our territory.\u201d His voice shifted, turned wolf-rough. \u201cBut somehow, I doubt that\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>Indigo nodded. \u201cWe need to extend our patrols even farther than we\u2019ve already done. It might be an idea to ask units of men to spend a few days roaming the more far-flung areas in rotating shifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrganize it,\u201d Hawke said before turning his attention to Riaz. \u201cCan you pick up some of Indigo\u2019s normal duties?\u201d</p><p>The male lieutenant gave a quick nod. \u201cHas Judd got anything yet?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s breath was white in the early morning chill. \u201cThis smells like Council, but he\u2019s confirmed the Council is no longer functioning as a cohesive unit so it could be any one of them.\u201d</p><p>That, Andrew thought, was very, very interesting. He\u2019d have to bring it up with Max when he met with Nikita\u2019s security chief.</p><p>Hawke turned to Indigo. \u201cDo we need to ask Riley and Mercy to cut short their trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that serious yet.\u201d Indigo\u2019s eyes were almost azure in the light up here, vivid against her golden tan. \u201cWe can handle it for the time being\u2014some of the soldiers can pull a few extra shifts to cover.\u201d</p><p>Andrew leaned up against the trunk of a nearby pine, folding his arms to keep from reaching for Indigo and making his claim clear to the other dominants\u2014especially Riaz. \u201cThey both need the break.\u201d His brother had been shattered when Mercy was injured just after they had mated. The couple had come through the trial with their bond even stronger but\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had much of a chance to honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s lips curved upward. \u201cI wonder if Riley considers his current situation a honeymoon or purgatory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone laughed, but the sound was muted, their instincts on alert for any sign of intruders. As soon as there was enough light, they split up into their assigned groups and headed out to comb for needles in haystacks.</p><p>\u201cWe found ten devices located on the northern edge of our territory,\u201d Andrew told Max over a beer that night in a dark little Chinatown tavern that served the best microbrew in the city. \u201cWe did a fairly comprehensive sweep along the other sides, but got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s an enormous area,\u201d Max said, \u201cand these devices sound small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Watching the condensation run down the glass of his bottle, he met the cop\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut whatever they were up to, we\u2019ve put a dent in their plans by increasing security across all the isolated sections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d He left it at that.</p><p>\u201cI can confirm it\u2019s not Nikita,\u201d Max said, without waiting for Andrew to ask.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo reason to hire me if she\u2019s got someone capable of organizing that kind of an operation.\u201d A shrug. \u201cAnd, given the access she\u2019s handed me to Psy data, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some kind of a massive double cross.\u201d</p><p>The only other Councilor in the area was Anthony Kyriakus, whose daughter, Faith, was mated to another DarkRiver sentinel. The cats had already sent through word that Anthony wasn\u2019t involved. It wasn\u2019t like SnowDancer to accept anything on face value, but this time, Hawke had. Which said a hell of a lot about the SnowDancer-DarkRiver alliance.</p><p>\u201cDid Nikita have anything else to say about this?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Max took a sip of his beer, making an appreciative noise at the back of his throat. \u201cShe paid attention when I told her, but something else is keeping her distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to share?\u201d He drank some of his own beer.</p><p>Max leaned back against the maroon leather of the booth. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work for a Councilor, but now I do\u2014and as long as she doesn\u2019t break the deal we\u2019ve got going, I\u2019m loyal.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew didn\u2019t ask what the deal was. He could guess. \u201cFair enough.\u201d It would make his task harder, but at the same time, it solidified his wolf\u2019s respect for the cop. \u201cBut does it have anything to do with dead Psy in the city?\u201d</p><p>Max tilted his beer bottle at Drew. \u201cI wondered how long it would take for you lot to twig to that.\u201d Putting down the bottle, he braced his forearms on the table. \u201cFour suspicious deaths, all psychic hits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the media. You covering up for Nikita?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s skin pulled tight over his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll allow that only because I would\u2019ve come to the same conclusion six months ago.\u201d His anger was a cool flame in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s no cover-up. Enforcement\u2019s fully aware of the situation, just keeping its mouth shut for once.\u201d</p><p>Andrew heard the ring of truth in that. \u201cSorry, man. I had to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t do it again.\u201d The cop blew out a breath. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve warned the targeted group\u2014low-Gradient Psy\u2014but we\u2019ve done so quietly because there\u2019s a good chance the kills are politically motivated, meant to cause unrest in the civilian population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard rumors of trouble in the Council ranks.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cProbability the murders are part of that is very high.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Andrew shared the e-mail Pure Psy had sent to SnowDancer wolves. \u201cConnected, you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet on it.\u201d Max handed back the ugly e-mail. \u201cI have to keep an open mind about the murders in case some other crazies were \u2018inspired\u2019 by Pure Psy, but my gut says Henry Scott and his fanatics are knee-deep in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Andrew said, watching the cop\u2019s face, \u201cshe was erased.\u201d</p><p>Lines flared out at the corners of the cop\u2019s slightly uptilted eyes. \u201cYou have very good intel. That was done without my knowledge; the other sites are being processed as they should be.\u201d</p><p>Andrew knew without asking that whoever had given the order for erasure wouldn\u2019t be doing so again. It made him very curious as to exactly what kind of a deal Nikita had struck with the cop that allowed him that much power, but he knew that wasn\u2019t a question Max would answer. So he asked another. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like, working for a Councilor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the time I\u2019m rubbing my hands in insane glee at the information I have access to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other half?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to fucking murder someone myself\u2014usually Nikita.\u201d Max\u2019s phone beeped on the heels of that comment. The cop glanced at the readout with a smile. \u201cMy wife wants me home for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Andrew didn\u2019t have to be psychic to sense the other man\u2019s unadulterated pleasure. Feeling bad tempered for no other reason than that Indigo was mad at him, he said, \u201cHave you ever made her angry?\u201d If the cop said that he and his wife lived in a state of constant connubial bliss, Andrew decided he\u2019d have full cause to throw a punch.</p><p>Max raised an eyebrow. \u201cSure, I\u2019m human.\u201d He slid the phone into the pocket of his suit pants and rose to his feet with a distinctly amused glint in his eye. \u201cMaking up is the fun part, in case you haven\u2019t figured that out yet.\u201d</p><p>Indigo sank into what she thought was a well-deserved bath late that night, having only now finished updating the other lieutenants as to the situation with the Psy incursions. Tom\u00e1s had had further disturbing news to share\u2014more dead Psy, this time on the edges of the state and left in public areas where they couldn\u2019t be missed.</p><p>Judd, having taken charge of keeping track of that situation earlier, had volunteered to continue to handle it, and Indigo was so grateful, she could\u2019ve kissed him. She was tired from the search, her muscles tense, but mostly she had an itch and no one to scratch it. Hissing out a breath, she sank deeper into the hot water, damn glad she\u2019d chosen one of the rooms with a bath rather than a shower. She\u2019d just picked up the loofah to run it down her leg when she heard someone enter her apartment.</p><p>Very, very few people would\u2019ve felt they had the right to waltz on in.</p><p>Then she caught the scent of wild, wicked male and the liquid heat between her legs had nothing to do with the bath. \u201cHow did the meeting go?\u201d she asked as Drew appeared in the doorway, his eyes skating over the bubbles that covered her from neck to toe.</p><p>\u201cDead Psy might be connected to Pure Psy. Looks like they\u2019re collateral damage in a political showdown.\u201d</p><p>The Psy were the enemy, but today, she felt pity for those who had no choice but to remain in the PsyNet. \u201cGod, imagine having sociopathic bastards like that as your leadership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about the Council right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What would you like to discuss?\u201d She raised an arm out of the tub and began to run the loofah down it, wanting to torture him in revenge for her keening sexual frustration.</p><p>Closing the distance between them, he perched on the edge of the tub, dipping his fingers into the foam, his eyes on her face. \u201cIndigo.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, raised an eyebrow.</p><p>And held his gaze as he shifted his hold so that one of his hands was on either side of the tub, enclosing her in a prison of steely male muscle. \u201cI,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cam a dominant male. You need to learn to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>His tone made her claws prick the insides of her skin, but she kept her own tone neutral. \u201cI\u2019m more than used to dealing with dominant males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. Shit.\u201d Quiet. Intense. \u201cYou\u2019ve had lovers, but never one whom you\u2019ve let in enough that you actually had to deal with the implications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re about to break the pattern?\u201d</p><p>Water sloshed over the edge and onto the tile floor as Drew got into the tub, jeans and all, and knelt to straddle her. In spite of her shock, she was ready for him when he cupped her face in his hands and swept his tongue into her mouth. She tasted an earthy masculine sensuality, a hint of beer\u2014smooth and dark\u2014and something that licked at her senses like fire. Drew. His tongue stroked and licked, while his hands kept her in place for his delectation, his teeth biting on her lower lip, teasing her upper one.</p><p>Heat uncurled in her abdomen, though she recognized exactly what he was doing. It was another display of possession. Her wolf bared its fangs at the idea, giving her enough strength of will to break the kiss, push at his shoulders with her claws. He refused to move, but he put his hands on the edge of the bath behind her.</p><p>She was sucking in a breath to speak when he simply bent his head and kissed her again. All hot and warm and sexy and demanding. Sex, she thought, wasn\u2019t going to solve anything . . . but then he slid one hand down to squeeze her breast and a surge of blinding passion eclipsed every other thought. Biting down on his lower lip, she tugged up his head with a hand fisted in his hair. \u201cTake off the T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he didn\u2019t argue, reaching down and pulling the half-sodden material over his head. It landed soundlessly on the fluffy bath mat as he threw it over the side. She was stroking her hands up his chest, delighting in the heated silk of his body, when he kissed her again\u2014and this time, there was no buildup. No, he just continued on from where he\u2019d left off, fondling her breast with a proprietary touch that made her want to moan and to bite him at the same time.</p><p>His free hand, he stroked down to press against her abdomen.</p><p>As she went to reach for his erection, he angled that hand down, spearing his fingers through her curls to\u2014</p><p>She screamed into his mouth as he thrust two fingers inside her. \u201cDamn it, Drew,\u201d she gasped, \u201cthat is not foreplay.\u201d</p><p>He bit at her neck, smoothing his other hand down her ribs, then back up to squeeze and caress her breasts, rubbing his thumb over one tightly furled nipple. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Another kiss, another tangling of lips and teeth and tongue. \u201cI can feel you all silky and luscious\u201d\u2014two fast thrusts that threw her shockingly close to orgasm\u2014\u201cand ready, so hot and ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Groaning, she reached down to struggle with his soaked jeans. The stupid button refused to come undone\u2014and he refused to help, intent on driving her to madness\u2014so she flicked out her claws and shredded the denim. Her hand met more sodden fabric, hiding the hot, throbbing ridge of his impressive arousal. \u201cYou decide to wear underwear today of all days,\u201d she muttered when he gave her a second to breathe.</p><p>Drew, she\u2019d learned, liked to kiss. And she was becoming addicted to his brand of it.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, Indy.\u201d A husky request against her mouth.</p> <p>Oh, God, that voice.</p><p>She shivered in pure sensory pleasure. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing and petting him through the fabric, she was gratified to feel his fingers lose their rhythm inside her body.</p><p>But he recovered fast, sliding his free hand up to clench in her hair so he could tug back her head and devour her mouth while his fingers began pumping harder, faster. Stars flickered at the corners of Indigo\u2019s vision, but she gritted her teeth and held on\u2014she wanted the damn wolf inside her. Shredding the underwear\u2014with considerable care, because she so did not want to damage him\u2014she shoved at his chest with all her strength.</p><p>He broke the kiss, removing his fingers from her with a lingering stroke, and let her push him back until she could straddle him. That was all the control he gave her. An instant later, his hands were on her hips and his erection was nudging at her, and he was thrusting into her with blunt promise.</p> <p>Crying out, Indigo gripped the edges of the bath, her breasts damp and gleaming above him as their bodies danced slick and hot beneath the water. The joining was a little rough, all raw. And then he closed his teeth over the delicate flesh of her breast and her body went taut in an explosion of pleasure, her muscles squeezing him tight as he crushed her to him and came with a hard, explosive grunt.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Having received a call from Drew after he spoke to Max, Judd made a call of his own. \u201cThe Council split,\u201d he said, \u201chow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad. The Scotts are determined to get rid of Nikita for one. She\u2019s made some provocative statements against Silence\u2014and acted on them.\u201d</p><p>Judd considered what he knew of Councilor Nikita Duncan, wondered what was in this for her. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill them all,\u201d he said, remembering the Ghost\u2019s statement the last time they\u2019d spoken.</p><p>\u201cThey are a disease, a virus that feeds upon our people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you considered how close you are to the Net?\u201d Dark patches, dead patches, that was the information he had about the sprawling psychic network that fed the minds of millions of Psy on the planet\u2014as if part of its psychic fabric was rotting away. \u201cThe degeneration could be affecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Ghost said. \u201cI am quite sane.\u201d</p><p>Judd wasn\u2019t certain the Ghost had ever been truly sane\u2014no one with that much power could be. But he\u2019d always been logical. \u201cThe Council\u2019s collapse, with no new system in place, will destabilize the Net, kill hundreds of thousands of innocents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I have a heart?\u201d the Ghost asked curiously. \u201cTo be affected by such a fact?\u201d</p><p>Judd knew the Ghost was getting closer and closer to slipping over the edge\u2014and he knew he couldn\u2019t let him. Not simply because of the rebel\u2019s lethal power, but because Judd considered him a friend. \u201cOne person,\u201d Judd said. \u201cThere must be one person who you do not want to die.\u201d</p><p>A long, long pause. \u201cIf there is?\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s relief was crushing. \u201cConsider that person each time you make a decision.\u201d</p><p>This time, the pause was longer, thicker, darker. \u201cI will consider. For now.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>Indigo wasn\u2019t entirely sure how they made it from the bath to the bed, but she surfaced to find herself warm, dry, and sprawled on her front on the bed, with an equally relaxed Andrew on his back beside her. Of course, one of his hands was on her butt, stroking in a way that said \u201cmine\u201d more strongly than words ever could.</p><p>Finding strength from somewhere, she poked him in the arm. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed the globe he was caressing. \u201cReally excellent sex.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf growled, but it was all pretend. Drew had wrung the mean out of both of them. \u201cYou were trying to sex me into submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d A lazy grin as he turned to look at her. \u201cI was just being me.\u201d</p><p>It was very close to what he\u2019d said at the start. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suddenly accept all the dominance bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ask you to?\u201d Blue eyes narrowing. \u201cBut if I\u2019m learning how to deal with a lieutenant with a milewide streak of stubborn and a tendency to put up walls of ice, you better fucking learn to deal with a tracker who isn\u2019t about to let you walk all over him.\u201d</p><p>That made her roll her eyes. \u201cThe only steamroller I see around here is about six feet two and two-hundred-plus pounds of muscle.\u201d</p><p>Instead of adding fuel to the fire of his anger, that made his eyes turn warm. He shifted to throw one leg over her, petting her exposed body with an even more possessive hand. \u201cYou broke my heart when you said I didn\u2019t know about foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cYes, you\u2019re terrible at sex. Terrible.\u201d That was why she was lying here with melted bones and an inner wolf who was so dozy, she was sprawled out in complete abandon.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d A kiss pressed to her shoulder. \u201cI guess I should work on that.\u201d</p><p>She was about to reply when he moved so that he was braced over her, supporting himself with one arm bent at the elbow, while he reached down to part her thighs with the other. The heat of his chest burned, and she sighed at the pleasure of having him so close. \u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re ready again after that, I\u2019ll have to call you a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, Lieutenant, I take that as a challenge.\u201d</p><p>She jerked as she felt the hard, silken heat of him nudging at her. \u201cDrew . . .\u201d Exhaustion forgotten, she raised her bottom a little, wanting him inside her. She loved the way he felt, loved the way he touched and stroked and petted.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Still teasing her with the barest touch of his cock, he kissed the back of her neck, the top of her spine, stroking a single maddening finger around the place that was damp and hot and ready for his penetration. \u201cI need to regain my pride.\u201d More kisses down the line of her vertebrae, his hands gripping her hips. \u201cGive you that foreplay.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as his unshaven chin brushed against her lower back, as his lips touched the dip of her spine, his tongue flicking out to wet the spot before he blew a hot breath on it. \u201cMmm.\u201d It was a sound of lazy pleasure as he shifted his body farther down the bed . . . and then he was gone.</p><p>Confused, she was about to turn when he gripped her ankles and tugged her until her hips were on the edge of the bed, her feet touching the floor. His hands moved again\u2014to the backs of her thighs. Spreading them, he blew a breath against her. \u201cWhat do you like, Indy? Licks\u201d\u2014quick, catlike flicks against her screamingly sensitive flesh\u2014\u201cnips\u201d\u2014the feel of teeth on her clitoris, her brain hazing over\u2014\u201ckisses?\u201d Wet and hot and all consuming, his mouth claimed her, his tongue sliding into her in a teasing thrust before withdrawing.</p><p>She was trying to find air when he stopped, said, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she managed to gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me what you liked. I wouldn\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him laughing, the demon. \u201cYou have no idea who you\u2019re messing with.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the roughness of his chin against the soft skin of her inner thighs, licking and nipping in a way that tormented without offering relief. \u201cI think I like this kind of foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Indigo went to pull away, determined to grab him and ride him to exhaustion. But he felt the tenseness in her muscles and tightened his hold. Then his mouth delivered on the teasing. She hadn\u2019t thought he could wring more pleasure from her already sated flesh.</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>He seduced her with that wicked, laughing mouth, licking and stroking and teasing until she was on the very edge.</p><p>When he pulled away this time, she arched her back, inviting his possession. His thighs met the backs of hers an instant later, his body entering hers in a tight, slow push. Biting back a cry at the intensity of the sensation, she clenched her fists on the sheets.</p><p>He pulled her up until she could brace herself with her palms flat on the bed. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Never.</p><p>Then there was only the slick glide of flesh on flesh, heated, sensual murmurs, and the most searing pleasure.</p><p>Indigo came to wakefulness close to dawn, not the least surprised to find herself all but buried beneath heavy, warm male. Drew, she\u2019d learned during the night, was a shameless bed hog\u2014but he liked to keep her with him, so instead of being pushed off the bed, she was instead pulled under him, his thigh between hers, his hand on her breast, his face nuzzled into her neck.</p><p>She\u2019d never had a lover attempt to claim her so totally. But, she thought, opening her heart a fraction, she could get used to this kind of affection. Because whatever he took, he gave back with staggering generosity.</p><p>Stroking her fingers into his hair, she thought over what he\u2019d said. Because he wasn\u2019t just affection and laughter and play\u2014as she\u2019d understood for the first time on the mountain two days ago. He was the pack\u2019s tracker, with all that denoted. He was also a very, very strong dominant. He was absolutely right to demand that she learn to deal with him as he was learning to deal with her.</p><p>Her wolf growled, unhappy at the idea of bending for any man.</p><p>But was it really submitting, Indigo dared ask for the first time, if the man was bending toward you in return?</p><p>Having been wide awake since around three a.m., Hawke finished reading the latest draft of the proposed new building/ land agreement in which SnowDancer was to be a silent partner and was about to push away from the desk when his phone beeped. Seeing the caller ID, he reined in his impatience. \u201cLucas, what is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe got hit with the Pure Psy e-mail last night,\u201d the DarkRiver alpha said, \u201cand a couple of our juveniles came to me with stories of being approached in online chat rooms.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf peeled back its lips at the boldness of the group. \u201cJuveniles okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust insulted,\u201d Lucas said, a thread of pride in his tone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Dorian watching the chat rooms in case they try again. We might be able to get something out of it. I\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up after a few more words, Hawke fired off a quick note to Drew with the new information, then strode to the door. He enjoyed being inside less than even most changelings, but this work was as important to the health of the pack as his more physical protection. So\u2014his lieutenants by his side\u2014he\u2019d learned to do it well.</p><p>But, having cleared his desk, and with Indigo more than capable of holding the fort\u2014and Riaz in charge of the security/ search patrols in the mountains today\u2014he surrendered to the wild hunger within and headed out for a run in wolf form. Several early risers among his pack saw him but none broke into his solitude. They all understood that, sometimes, a wolf needed to roam on its own.</p><p>However, he\u2019d barely cleared the doorway when he caught a scent that instantly ruffled his fur the wrong way. She smelled like autumn fire and some rich, exotic spice. Far too potent a scent for someone so young, someone from whom he should keep his distance. Instead, he drew the spice-laced air into his lungs and ran at a ground-devouring lope that brought him to a small rise from where he could watch his prey.</p><p>Wearing a small pack and carrying what looked like a sleek holographic camera, she walked down the track that would eventually bring her to one of the midway areas in den territory, where he knew she\u2019d parked the car she\u2019d signed out of the garage for her trips to and from DarkRiver land. But it would still take her a couple of hours to reach that spot at her current pace.</p> <p>When she stopped and raised her face to the dewy morning sunlight, releasing her breath in a long, slow exhale, he went motionless. Her unhidden joy at being in the stark, stunning beauty of the Sierra Nevada sang to him, and it was a dangerous pull. He should step back, should move in the opposite direction.</p><p>He should.</p><p>He turned and angled down through the trees until he appeared on the path beside her instead. Jerking back in surprise, Sienna stared at him with wide eyes. When he did nothing but wait for her, she continued on the trail, shooting him small looks filled with suspicion until it became clear he was intent only on keeping her company.</p><p>Then her stride relaxed, and they walked.</p><p>In silence.</p><p>It had been over a week since the day Andrew had ambushed Indigo in her bath, and he was feeling cautiously optimistic. The lieutenant wore his scent in her skin and, from what he could tell, wasn\u2019t worried about it. Aware how long it had taken his brother to gain the same concession from Mercy, Andrew allowed himself a little swagger\u2014because that acceptance meant Indy\u2019s wolf was starting to get over its uncertainty when it came to him.</p> <p>Of course, part of it likely had to do with the fact that the lieutenant was turning out to be as possessive as any male changeling. He wore her scent in his skin, too\u2014along with more than a few marks. And he was very, very happy\u2014no, delighted\u2014with the whole state of affairs, he thought, grinning as he touched the love bite on his neck.</p><p>Their packmates, of course, found the whole situation highly entertaining, a welcome break from the constant vigilance of the security patrols in the mountains. The techs had found only three more transmitters after the main sweep, and it was looking like they might have unearthed most if not all of them, but SnowDancer wasn\u2019t about to lower its guard when the Council had dared invade the very heart of the pack\u2019s territory.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean wolves stopped being wolves.</p><p>Andrew dealt with the ribbing with a grin and a shrug, while Indigo scowled. Neither response had any effect on the gossip\u2014or the good-natured advice Andrew began receiving from the women in the pack.</p><p>\u201cGive her her space,\u201d a dominant female advised him, \u201cbut not too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t treat her like a girl. She\u2019s a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew, I love you, but you\u2019re the most sneaky, cunning wolf I\u2019ve ever known\u2014use it.\u201d</p><p>After several days of this, Andrew cornered one of the ladies. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not grateful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut why are you all being so helpful?\u201d</p> <p>That got him a chuckle, the touch of warm, capable hands on his face, and a smacking kiss. \u201cSilly boy. She\u2019s ours and we love her\u2014and we\u2019ve all worried at how hard she rides herself on behalf of the pack. You make her happy.\u201d</p><p>The simple words were a revelation.</p><p>So he was ready to handle the next stage in their courtship when Indigo invited him to an official family event.</p><p>\u201cDinner with my parents at their place,\u201d she said casually, as if it wasn\u2019t a major deal. \u201cEvie isn\u2019t back yet, but my aunt, Adria, and her lover, Martin, will also be there. They\u2019re flying in from near the Oregon border.\u201d</p><p>Having a vague memory of Tarah\u2019s sibling being much younger, he asked, \u201cAre you close to Adria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A smile. \u201cShe\u2019s nearer to my age than my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Instinct whispered that there was more at play here than a simple familial relationship, but he kept his silence. It would be far easier to get Indy to talk once he\u2019d met her aunt, gained an idea of what it was that had caused Indigo\u2019s wolf to . . . almost shy away at the mention of her name.</p><p>As it was, he found himself surprised by the reality of Adria. The physical resemblance between the three women was startling; standing side by side, Tarah, Indigo, and Adria were almost mirror images of each other at different stages of life. But where Tarah was submissive, Adria was dominant. Where Tarah kissed him on the cheek in maternal affection, Adria gave him a narrow-eyed, assessing glare. And where he knew Tarah relied with open contentment on her mate, there was a real push-pull vibe going on between Adria and her lover, Martin.</p><p>Indigo, he realized at once, was far more like her aunt than her mother.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Adria said after they shook hands, \u201cyou\u2019re the one.\u201d</p><p>He liked her\u2014but then, he had a thing for cool-eyed, stubborn women. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Lines formed on her forehead, her eyebrows drawing together. \u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>He knew that wasn\u2019t a compliment. \u201cI have a way of surprising people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The wolf prowled behind eyes a shade lighter than Indigo\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in our sector, but we haven\u2019t spoken. Tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>As he obeyed the brusque order, his wolf more amused by her bristling protectiveness than anything else, he noticed something. Martin, while standing beside Adria, didn\u2019t join in the conversation. That, on its own, meant nothing\u2014Riley had a way of standing silent as a sphinx beside Mercy. There was, however, never any doubt in people\u2019s minds that Riley was a hundred percent tuned in, not only to the conversation but to every tiny aspect of his mate\u2019s presence.</p><p>Something was disturbingly different here.</p><p>The stiffness of Adria\u2019s spine when her lover\u2019s shoulder brushed her own, the white lines around Martin\u2019s mouth, the way neither of them made eye contact with the other\u2014the two were pissed at one another. Andrew took that in his stride. Being with a strong woman occasionally meant some fire-works. He couldn\u2019t imagine Indigo without her sass.</p><p>His wolf growling in agreement, he continued to talk with Adria until Tarah came over to catch up with her sister. Moving to where Indigo was standing against the wall finishing off an apple, he tugged on her ponytail. \u201cWhat\u2019s with abandoning me to your aunt the inquisitor?\u201d</p><p>She bumped her hip to his. \u201cDon\u2019t say your smile didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d Reaching behind her, he patted that ass.</p><p>\u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to\u2014later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Indigo threw him a quelling glance, but he caught the laughter behind it. \u201cWhat did you think of my aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like an older version of you,\u201d he said with complete honesty. \u201cShe\u2019s got her \u2018death stare\u2019 honed to perfection.\u201d</p><p>Holding her apple core in one hand, Indigo put her other one on his shoulder. \u201cGive me a few years.\u201d</p><p>Deeply content at the thought of watching her grow further into her skin, he stood beside her as the others spoke. It took him a little while to realize that in spite of his skill at reading the undercurrents in any given situation, he\u2019d missed something here. Martin and Adria weren\u2019t pissed at each other\u2014only one of them was angry.</p><p>Adria put her hand on Martin\u2019s arm . . . only to have it shaken off. Adria\u2019s face betrayed a stark heart pain in the terrible moment before she brought up her shields, cool and controlled once more.</p><p>Fighting the urge to punch Martin for putting that expression on the face of such a strong woman, Andrew thought back to the other little things he\u2019d noticed, the way Martin had almost pointedly walked into the room first, saying, \u201cStrongest should bring up the rear, right?\u201d</p><p>At the time, Andrew had taken it as a joke between lovers, but now . . . \u201cWho\u2019s more dominant?\u201d he asked, feeling a chill whisper through his veins. \u201cIt\u2019s Adria, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Indigo\u2019s body went motionless beside him. \u201cYou know it is.\u201d</p><p>Andrew realized at once that he\u2019d have to fight one hell of a battle to wipe the impression this toxic relationship had to have left on Indigo, but there was no time to follow up on the topic, because Abel walked in then, having been delayed at work\u2014as training and resource coordinator for SnowDancer soldiers across the entire state.</p><p>First Abel kissed his mate. Then he tapped his cheek so his daughter could brace herself with one hand on his shoulder and kiss him. After that, he hugged Adria and shook Martin\u2019s hand. Then he walked over . . . and Andrew found himself being taken outside for a \u201clittle chat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be blunt,\u201d Abel said as they stood in the crisp night air, drinks in hand, \u201cIndigo\u2019s a grown woman who knows what she wants. She\u2019ll choose who she\u2019ll choose.\u201d</p><p>Since Abel paused for a response, Andrew said, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Where his wolf had handled Adria fine, it was wary of Abel.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question of dominance, as Andrew outranked him, but of family.</p> <p>Abel took a sip of his whiskey. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking about you.\u201d</p><p>Andrew waited.</p><p>\u201cWomen like you.\u201d A gleam in those deep gray eyes he\u2019d bequeathed his younger daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about my loyalty,\u201d Andrew said, wanting no mistakes or misunderstandings on that point. \u201cIndigo\u2019s the only woman I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Abel said to his surprise. \u201cWhen we first met, I looked at Tarah the way you look at Indigo.\u201d A chuckle. \u201cStill do, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew relaxed.</p><p>Too soon.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d Abel said in that same warm tone, \u201cyou hurt her and I\u2019ll break every bone in your body. Twice.\u201d</p><p>Having survived both Abel and dinner, Andrew walked into the kitchen and went to stand at Tarah\u2019s shoulder while she cut the dessert cake into slices. \u201cTarah?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Tarah picked up a sliver of cake and turned to feed it to him. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He chewed, savored the burst of brandy and chocolate, swallowed. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p> <p>That got him a twinkling smile. \u201cWhat is it you want to know, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Utterly melted by her, he didn\u2019t bother to pretend he hadn\u2019t followed her in here with an ulterior motive. \u201cYour sister is much younger than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur parents were very happily surprised when I was almost twenty.\u201d</p><p>Drew took a moment to think about that. Changelings were less fertile than humans or Psy, so while this kind of thing did happen, it was rare. \u201cIt must have been some celebration.\u201d</p><p>Having placed the cake on the tray, Tarah motioned for him to lift down the cups and saucers from an upper cupboard. \u201cOh, it was,\u201d she said as he obeyed. \u201cEveryone thought I\u2019d be jealous, but I thought she was the cutest, most adorable thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d A laugh husky with memory. \u201cI used to steal her from my mother all the time and show her off like she was my own.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, thinking back to how Riley had treated him and Brenna when they\u2019d been younger. \u201cAdria can\u2019t be much older than Indigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found my mate early\u201d\u2014a dazzling echo of memory\u2014\u201cand we had our beautiful Indigo soon afterward. Adria was only four at the time, so they grew up more as sisters than anything else.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged by her openness, he asked a question on a subject many would have said was none of his business. \u201cHow long has Adria been with Martin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen years, on and off.\u201d Having arranged everything on the tray, Tarah went to pick it up.</p><p>He slid his hands past hers. \u201cI\u2019ll get that.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, she stopped him with a hand on his upper arm. \u201cYou were a wonderful boy, Andrew. I\u2019m so glad to know the man you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>Feeling the love in that touch, in those words, he asked the final, most important question. \u201cHow long has it been like that between them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the start.\u201d Pain pinched her expression. \u201cThey love each other, but Martin\u2019s never quite been able to handle Adria\u2019s strength . . . and it breaks her heart each time he makes that clear.\u201d</p><p>As Andrew lay naked in bed and watched Indigo get ready to join him, he thought over the implications of what he\u2019d learned tonight. He didn\u2019t have to be a shrink to see that Indigo\u2019s views on relationships had to have been shaped by the two closest to her.</p><p>Her parents\u2019 mating, while unsuitable to her own situation, fit the accepted parameters and was very, very successful. Adria, by contrast, had broken the mold, thrown in her lot with a less dominant man\u2014and the results weren\u2019t exactly inspiring.</p><p>\u201cDeep thoughts?\u201d Indigo asked, brushing her hair in front of the vanity across from the bed.</p><p>He ran his eyes over the silky little boxers in a color that echoed her eyes that she\u2019d paired with a thin black camisole, her hair a waterfall of shining ebony over her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, you make my heart stop.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze in its smooth strokes and she stared at him across the length of the room. \u201cDrew . . . you can\u2019t go around saying things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Putting the brush on the vanity, Indigo walked over to crawl onto the bed, straddling his body. \u201cBecause then it makes me adore you even more\u2014and I\u2019m not sure I can handle it.\u201d A teasing statement, but he heard the whisper of truth beneath. His lieutenant was afraid of the growing depth of the bonds between them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t blame her. It had knocked him for six, too, when he\u2019d first realized that she was it for him. Forever. \u201cIn that case\u2014your eyes are funny and your teeth are crooked.\u201d</p><p>Her entire face sparkled. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Letting the emotion in his heart translate into a slow smile, he stroked his hands up her thighs and under the edge of her camisole. \u201cI have this fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d An arch comment. \u201cDoes it involve me naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that hard to read, mister.\u201d She rubbed her body over the pulsing ridge of his erection. \u201cOr should I say . . . your hardness is easy to read?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath, inhaling the lush, earthy warmth of her arousal. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d She stroked her palms down his chest, her claws pricking just enough to incite his wolf to snarling life. \u201cI see someone\u2019s come out to play.\u201d Her own wolf in her eyes, she bent her head and ran her teeth over his nipple, her hair a thousand teasing fingers across his skin.</p><p>Fisting one hand in the silken mass, he clenched the other on the sheets. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>A gleam of indigo blue between slitted lids, and then she rubbed her barely covered breasts oh-so-slowly against his chest, snaking her hand down to close over his erection in an openly possessive grip.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d It was gritted out between clenched teeth. When he went to grab her shoulders and pull her up, she tightened her hold, letting him feel her claws. Swearing, he dropped his hands. \u201cDo your worst then, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>Stroking and squeezing the rigid length of his erection with warm, strong hands, she wiggled down over his thighs . . . lower. \u201cOh, I intend to.\u201d A hot, damp breath on the blunt tip of his cock, his body arching toward the warm wetness of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cPatience.\u201d It was a laughing admonition as she rose back up, releasing him to press her palms against his thighs.</p><p>It took everything he had to keep himself in position, to let her play as she would. But he was still a predatory changeling male with a woman he considered his. \u201cTop. Off.\u201d It came out husky, rough.</p><p>She flicked a finger at the strap of her camisole. \u201cYou mean this?\u201d</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he swiped up with a single precise claw.</p><p>Indigo jerked back, but not fast enough. Her mouth fell open as her camisole parted in two neat halves in front. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He traced the bared curves of her breasts with his eyes. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>Ripping off the camisole and throwing it to the side, Indigo prowled up his body, bracing herself with her palms on either side of his head. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so clever.\u201d</p><p>It was the most blinding pleasure to stroke his hands over her buttocks and lower back, to touch her as he would. \u201cYep.\u201d Nudging her down just enough, he gripped a nipple between his teeth. When she thrust her hand into his hair, he released it before sucking it back in and tugging hard.</p><p>She shivered against him. \u201cMore.\u201d It was an order and a demand in one.</p><p>Andrew smiled and bestowed the same caress on her neglected breast, bringing up a hand to fondle her with a proprietary pleasure he\u2019d never bothered to hide.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she murmured against his mouth as she pulled away, \u201chave a way of taking over in bed, but I have intentions of my own today.\u201d</p><p>Dropping his head back on the pillows, he watched without breathing as she finger-walked her way down his chest and back to the raging hardness of his cock. This time, her fingers circled him with purpose, and there was no warning; one minute she was straddling him, the next, she\u2019d shimmied down to take him into the wet heat of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d It was torn out of him as pleasure short-circuited his senses. Reaching down, he thrust one hand into her hair.</p><p>When she pulled away, teasing him to madness, he nudged her forward. She let him feel her teeth. He growled. Laughter in the eyes that met his. And he knew he was sunk.</p><p>Groaning, he took everything she had to give, and he gloried in it. Mine, he thought as she laved pleasure upon pleasure, as she gave the wolf within her control, you\u2019re mine.</p><p>Indigo brought Drew to the edge again and again, backing off a split second before he would\u2019ve lost control. Her own need was at a keening pitch when she gave one final lick, got rid of her boxers, and straddled him once more.</p><p>His wolf was in his eyes, in the claws he\u2019d dug into the bed, shredding the sheets. \u201cI\u2019d apologize,\u201d he growled, following her gaze, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Even now, with hunger a voracious beast between them, he could make her smile. \u201cIn that case . . . maybe I\u2019ll just do this for a while.\u201d Lifting herself, she brushed her core against the tip of his cock.</p><p>It was meant to be a teasing punishment.</p><p>It drove her wild.</p><p>Drew\u2019s hands clamped on her hips. \u201cDown!\u201d He pulled.</p><p>Sliding onto him in a hard rush, she cried out at the almost painful fullness. His hands flexed on her, and she realized he hadn\u2019t sheathed his claws. That was alright. Hers were pricking into his chest as she braced herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndy?\u201d A word so hoarse, she knew it had been a struggle for him to get it out.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, she squeezed her inner muscles, saw his eyes roll back in his head, and still his hands stayed her hips, keeping her from moving. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, knowing his protective streak had risen to the fore with her cry. \u201cYou\u2019re just a little more . . . significant in this position.\u201d</p><p>A tug of his lips, a playful arrogance that made her want to tease and delight him in equal measures. Stroking away his hands, she clasped them with her own, and then she rode her wolf. The slick glide of flesh against flesh, the rich musk of their combined scents, the blazing fire of the heat in her belly, it all added to the exotic, erotic dance. But the most powerful sensation of all was seeing Drew\u2019s eyes flicker from blue to copper and back again as both wolf and man surrendered to the inferno between them.</p> <p>As he took her with him.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Henry picked up a transmitter similar to the ones he\u2019d had his men place in SnowDancer territory. A pity they had been discovered; they would\u2019ve offered him a small tactical advantage in the future\u2014but it was nothing close to game over. Blinded by the weakness of their animal natures, the wolves hadn\u2019t yet found the other pieces of technology.</p><p>By the time they did, it would be too late.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p> <p>Midmorning the next day, Andrew walked into Hawke\u2019s office just as his alpha finished a conversation with Judd via comm screen. Nodding to his brother-in-law before the screen blanked, he glanced at Hawke. \u201cWhere\u2019s Judd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere in South America.\u201d</p><p>The answer wouldn\u2019t have made sense to most people, given that Judd had been in the den until only a couple of hours ago. Only a limited few knew the man was a very powerful telekinetic. Not a true teleporter, but well able to teleport long distances.</p><p>\u201cStill nothing to confirm why the transmitters were there?\u201d he asked, grabbing a seat.</p><p>\u201cFour possibilities.\u201d Hawke raised a finger, his anger banked but no less lethal for it. \u201cTo act as locator beacons for teleportation or airborne vehicles\u201d\u2014a second finger\u2014\u201ca test to see how quickly we\u2019d detect that type of intrusion\u201d\u2014a third finger\u2014\u201cor as markers on where to place explosives.\u201d</p><p>Andrew blew out a breath. \u201cTrying to cause a massive rock slide?\u201d</p> <p>Hawke gave a nod, tapping the scrawled diagram in front of him. \u201cYou blow this section, you not only cut off a chunk of our land, any invading army has far less distance to cover to get to the heart of den territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said four possibilities. What\u2019s the fourth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found these so fast, you\u2019d think we were meant to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecoys.\u201d Andrew frowned. \u201cBut to what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of what Judd\u2019s hoping to run down. He\u2019s hearing whispers that say this might be linked to Pure Psy. I\u2019ve also sent the techs back up to scan for anything else that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d Shoving his hands through his hair, Hawke clenched his jaw. \u201cWhatever the truth, instinct tells me things are going to come to a violent head sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Judd does connect the transmitters categorically to Pure Psy,\u201d Andrew said, slotting in the other pieces in his mind, \u201cand we add the e-mails to the mix, then I\u2019m certain the packs haven\u2019t been targeted in isolation, but as part of a campaign against the city as a whole.\u201d</p><p>The wolf looked out of Hawke\u2019s eyes when he turned to Andrew. \u201cYou found something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeijan called me this morning. His people have noticed a steady stream of Psy slipping into the city and setting up house. Some of them don\u2019t appear to have jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cTrouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to what I got from Max after I spoke to Teijan. Seems like word\u2019s gotten out that Nikita has accepted a flawed Psy in her administration.\u201d Max\u2019s wife, Sophia, was still in the Net. And she was no longer Silent.</p><p>Hawke thought about the cold-eyed woman who\u2019d disowned her own daughter and knew there had to be something in the stance for Nikita. Either that, or the Councilor was simply waiting for a chance to turn on the poor souls who looked to her for hope. \u201cAre they making waves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax has an eye on them and says most are only trying to find sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to shift the balance of the city.\u201d And Hawke\u2019s first priority was the safety of his pack. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lucas, make sure our own people have the situation under surveillance.\u201d</p><p>Drew played a pen over his fingers. \u201cThe fact that San Francisco is becoming ground zero for Psy who are breaking Silence . . . well, it explains the dead Psy in the city and on the edges of the state, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor buggers got caught up in the crossfire between two Council factions.\u201d Picking up a small ball from the corner of his desk, Hawke threw it against the wall, catching it as it rebounded. \u201cYou think we\u2019ve been hit by the crossfire, too.\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded. \u201cJudd\u2019s intel is that Henry Scott is out to get rid of Nikita, and we already know Henry controls Pure Psy. And San Francisco might be a changeling city, but it\u2019s also Nikita\u2019s power base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychological warfare,\u201d Hawke murmured. \u201cHe wants the city in turmoil to undermine Nikita\u2014and . . .\u201d Hawke caught the ball as it rebounded again, held it. \u201cWhat better way to do that than by inciting the humans and changelings against each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me,\u201d Drew said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019d have heard\u2014sensed\u2014if that kind of ugliness was simmering.\u201d</p><p>Hawke threw the ball, bouncing it so that it rebounded toward Drew. \u201cWhat\u2019s the date?\u201d</p><p>Catching the ball, Andrew glanced at his watch and gave the ball to Hawke. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Cherry Blossom Festival in Japantown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on right now.\u201d He immediately realized what his alpha wanted him to do. \u201cCats will have a much better chance of getting information from the population down there.\u201d DarkRiver held the city, and they had held it long enough and well enough that they were a trusted part of its fabric. SnowDancer, by comparison, evoked a wary caution\u2014which was how they wanted it.</p><p>\u201cWork with them,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cbut I want you down there as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust the cats even now?\u201d</p><p>Hawke shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not about trust. It\u2019s about Pack.\u201d</p><p>Andrew understood. Hawke\u2019s job was to protect SnowDancer. No matter the blood bond between SnowDancer and DarkRiver, he would never place the lives of his people in their hands alone.</p><p>Indigo wasn\u2019t exactly pleased to be pulled off her\u2014considerable\u2014duties to come \u201cplay girlfriend,\u201d as Drew had put it. \u201cIf you needed a decoy,\u201d she muttered as they meandered through the bustling stalls that lined the street, offering goodies of every variety, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you pick one of your harem?\u201d</p><p>Tugging her close with the arm he had around her shoulders, he nipped at the tip of her nose. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said with a grin when she glared, \u201cyou would\u2019ve cut me to pieces with that ice glare of yours\u201d\u2014his hand slid down her back\u2014\u201cafter you kicked my bleeding, whimpering ass out of your bed. And I really like your mattress.\u201d</p><p>She would not laugh. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some whimpering going on very soon if you don\u2019t stop petting my ass in public.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand even lower and, cupping her face with his free hand, took her mouth in a laughing kiss that simply melted any temper out of her. God, she thought, she\u2019d have to watch him. He could charm himself out of any situation\u2014and make her a co-conspirator.</p><p>When he broke the kiss, he didn\u2019t pull away, but rubbed his nose affectionately against hers. \u201cThink of it as a date.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, for the first time in forever, Indigo decided what the hell. It was a beautiful, sunshiny day in San Francisco; she was with a gorgeous, sexy man who couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her; and, given their underhanded tactics to date, the group of Psy behind the current attempts to brew up trouble weren\u2019t about to come in guns blazing anytime soon. \u201cIn that case,\u201d she said, sliding her arm around his waist, \u201cyou have to buy me an ice cream.\u201d</p><p>It was only as they began walking again that she realized how much attention they\u2019d drawn despite the crowd. She glimpsed more than one smile directed their way, along with the odd wink. Her wolf sighed, but even it had to admit it was delighted by Drew\u2019s sense of play.</p><p>Just then, as Drew went to grab their ice creams, Indigo found herself being waved over by a tiny Japanese lady seated at a small stall. Intrigued, she went. When the yukata-clad lady urged her forward with a wrinkled little hand, Indigo bent across the trays of sweet mochi on the table until she could hear the woman over the buzz of the festival crowd.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d the elderly lady said in a soft but robust voice, \u201ctrouble.\u201d</p><p>Indigo grinned. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Laughing out loud, the woman picked up a mochi from the table. \u201cDoes my heart good to see a man who\u2019s not afraid of a strong woman.\u201d Putting the treat in Indigo\u2019s hand, she waved away her offer of payment and told her to get back to her \u201ctrouble.\u201d</p><p>Smiling her thanks, Indigo sank her teeth into the sticky rice concoction to discover that the center was liquid chocolate. \u201cMmm.\u201d Licking the syrup off her lips, she looked up to see Andrew in front of her, his eyes very much on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShare,\u201d he said, in a husky voice.</p><p>Deliberately misunderstanding\u2014because it was, she\u2019d realized over the past few weeks, fun to tease him\u2014she put the uneaten half of the mochi in his mouth. When he scowled, she grabbed her ice cream\u2014mango swirl\u2014and took a lick. \u201cWhat did you get?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s fingers tangled with her own as he swallowed the tidbit in his mouth and said, \u201cChocolate, rum raisin, and tutti-frutti.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Freezing, Indigo stared at his triple cone. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that taste weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Try.\u201d It was a relaxed gesture, but as she tasted his mix of flavors, their eyes met and suddenly the moment seemed far from lighthearted.</p><p>. . . a man who\u2019s not afraid of a strong woman.</p> <p>The elderly lady\u2019s words whispered through her mind as she pulled back, as she squeezed her fingers around his and they started walking again through the mingled scents of sugar and ice, and later, through seafood stalls redolent with hints of the most delicate sashimi. Farther down, in the area set aside for arts and crafts, she picked up scents as distant as cured wood and cherry blossoms in gloriously full bloom.</p><p>The day seemed even brighter than before\u2014and for the first time, the hope in her heart outweighed the fear. Because that elder had been right. While Drew challenged her, attempted to take over in his own charming way, and beyond a doubt liked being in control, he\u2019d never\u2014no matter what\u2014denigrated her strength or made her feel less feminine because of who and what she was. In fact, he\u2019d made it clear in countless ways that her capable, independent nature was part of the attraction.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she murmured, her heart feeling fragile and yet hugely powerful as she dared consider that this unorthodox\u2014and utterly wonderful\u2014relationship might just work after all.</p><p>When he dipped his head, she kissed him. \u201cHow do you like mango swirl?\u201d she murmured against those lips she knew so very well.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a second taste.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew could\u2019ve spent the whole day playing with Indigo, but aware of how important it was that they get a feel for the emotional health of the city, he worked the people they met, keeping his questions light, his comments innocuous. And piece by piece, word by word, he began to get fragments of information.</p><p>Indigo remained uncharacteristically silent.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked when they stopped to look at the parade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you do this kind of work before,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re very good.\u201d</p><p>Pride unfurled its wings inside him, and his wolf strutted.</p><p>An hour later, when they ran into a DarkRiver couple they both knew\u2014Emmett and Ria\u2014they ducked out of the rush of the crowds to grab seats at a wrought-iron table outside a small caf\u00e9. Drinks ordered, Andrew asked the couple if they\u2019d noticed anything, aware that all of DarkRiver\u2019s senior people would\u2019ve been briefed on the possible situation.</p> <p>Emmett nodded to his mate, a small, curvy brunette with eyes uptilted just enough to speak of ancestry from Asia. \u201cRia\u2019s family is in Chinatown, and they\u2019ve been worried about some of what they\u2019ve been hearing from their customers.\u201d</p><p>Ria picked up the thread of the conversation so smoothly, it was obvious the two had been mated long enough to learn each other\u2019s rhythms. \u201cThere are whispers around the city about \u2018Purity,\u2019\u201d she said, making a face as she shifted her body to lean against her mate. \u201cSome group is trying to get humans to believe they\u2019d be better off with \u2018untainted\u2019 blood.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Emmett played with strands of his mate\u2019s hair. \u201cIf they want to cause division, they\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\u201d He curved one hand around Ria\u2019s neck, fingers stroking gently. \u201cThis city and its people are loyal to DarkRiver; we\u2019ve helped them when the Psy wouldn\u2019t, and enough times that that loyalty is set in stone.\u201d</p><p>Andrew took a drink, his wolf fascinated by the couple\u2019s interaction. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess why\u2014he was just a little bit jealous. Not because he couldn\u2019t touch Indigo, but because they hadn\u2019t yet reached that depth of intimacy. No, that kind of love took years to settle, to grow and form.</p><p>And Indy hadn\u2019t yet committed fully to him. In spite of everything they\u2019d become to each other, he knew her wolf continued to see him as a younger male first, and everything else second. He wasn\u2019t an impatient man, but neither was he a saint. At times like this, when he saw what they could have, that subtle distance threatened to get to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what I picked up today,\u201d he said, forcing his attention to the matter at hand when he realized everyone was waiting for him to respond. \u201cPeople are disturbed, but more at the idea of Purity than because they subscribe to it.\u201d</p><p>Indigo put down her smoothie. \u201cThere are going to be pockets of malcontents. Nothing we can do about that except monitor the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Emmett agreed, his body angled toward his mate in a way that Andrew didn\u2019t think the other man was even aware of. \u201cBut my take? We don\u2019t have to worry about the population in general.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew agreed. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, figuring it\u2019d be silly not to mention it since he\u2019d guessed, \u201ccongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Ria glowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize changelings outside the pack would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost won\u2019t.\u201d Indigo\u2019s tone was dry even as she reached out to squeeze Ria\u2019s hand. \u201cBut Drew\u2019s made a lifelong study of the female form.\u201d</p><p>Emmett laughed and nuzzled a kiss to his mate\u2019s temple. \u201cTell them what Lucas said when he found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m Luc\u2019s admin assistant, right?\u201d At their nods, Ria continued, \u201cWhen he realized I was pregnant, he yelled at me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew blinked. \u201cSeriously?\u201d The cats adored kids as much as the SnowDancers did. He couldn\u2019t imagine the leopard alpha not being pleased about the event.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He asked me what the hell he was supposed to do when I went on maternity leave.\u201d Ria waited for a beat before delivering the punch line. \u201cThen he told me to put my feet up and wouldn\u2019t even let me pick up a stapler until I threatened to bash his head in with it.\u201d</p><p>Indigo burst out laughing. \u201cHow many times has she threatened you since you found out?\u201d she asked Emmett.</p><p>\u201cOnly twenty or so.\u201d Emmett gave a slow smile as he answered, and Ria jumped a little.</p><p>\u201cEmmett.\u201d</p><p>Andrew saw Indigo bite back a grin as the other woman\u2019s cheeks colored. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse Emmett,\u201d Ria said in a laughter-choked voice, \u201che\u2019s absolutely uncivilized. Can\u2019t take him out in publi\u2014Emmett!\u201d</p><p>Andrew dipped his head toward Indigo. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s doing under the table?\u201d he whispered in her ear, even as he slid his own hand up her thigh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ideas, hotshot.\u201d But her wolf flickered a shimmering gold in her eyes.</p><p>And later that night, when they lay entwined in bed, her eyes turned night-glow on him, and he knew that he danced with the wolf and the woman both. It wasn\u2019t quite everything, but it was close enough to soothe his own wolf.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Having just sent through an update to the other lieutenants on the situation in the city and in den territory, Indigo was heading to her office to read the report Riaz had filed after his shift when Brace came crashing into the den. He was scratched and bloody, his T-shirt ripped. Seeing Indigo, he began talking. It was obvious he was one step away from total panic. \u201cSilvia fell down a cliff. I tried to catch her but I couldn\u2019t grab her in time. I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Indigo put her hands on those lanky shoulders, made him meet her eyes. \u201cWhere?\u201d It was a question imbued with her innate dominance.</p><p>Giving her the location in a fast gallop, he heaved out another breath. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t respond when I called down. Indigo, she wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus, Brace.\u201d She squeezed his shoulders, anchoring him with the touch of Pack. \u201cHow far down is she and how accessible is the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u201d\u2014she could see him attempting to clear the cobwebs from his mind\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll need ropes, climbing gear. I tried to go down but it\u2019s almost a sheer rock face. She\u2019s trapped on a ledge so far down you can hardly see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll organize the rescue,\u201d she said and, knowing he\u2019d function far better if he had a concrete task, added, \u201cYour job is to track down Lara and bring her to the site. Understood?\u201d</p><p>A sharp nod, his wolf appreciating the direct order. \u201cI\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Making calls on her cell phone as Brace left, Indigo gathered the soldiers that she knew were in the den and available, updating Hawke on the situation as well.</p><p>He was driving away from the den but turned back at her call. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the site,\u201d he said in a terse voice.</p><p>Drew, Sing-Liu, and Tai took only minutes to answer her summons. They met at one of the pack\u2019s supply lockers and, working at rapid speed, picked up the ropes, climbing gear, and other equipment they\u2019d need to winch up Silvia\u2019s injured form.</p><p>No one even discussed the possibility of her being dead. She was Pack. She\u2019d be brought back, no matter what. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Indigo said, and it was the first words any of them had spoken since she\u2019d shared the details of the accident. Now they ran together, the location being impossible to reach by even the most rugged of vehicles.</p><p>Every second that passed brought Silvia closer to death, so they pushed and made it in under half the usual time. Dropping the gear she\u2019d carried in a pile a little ways back from the cliff edge, Indigo belly-crawled to the part that had crumbled until she could peer over it. Her eyesight was changeling keen, but Brace had been right. She could only just see the pale blue of Silvia\u2019s jeans, the red of her cardigan as she lay crumpled on a ledge at least a hundred meters down, one hand outflung. Her legs appeared to be twisted under her body in a way that they simply shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>Aware of Drew crawling up beside her, she turned her head. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She\u2019d done more than one climb with him, knew he was highly skilled.</p><p>\u201cOne of us will have to rappel down,\u201d he said and glanced over his shoulder, pointing to a sturdy pine. \u201cWe can use that tree to rig up the main anchor, set up a belay line for backup.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Indigo agreed. Waiting until they\u2019d both drawn back from the edge, she nodded at Sing-Liu to bring her the harness. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew put a hand on her arm. \u201cThat\u2019s one hell of a dangerous cliff face. I\u2019ll go\u2014I\u2019ve got more experience.\u201d</p><p>That first sentence irritated her, but she shrugged it off to focus on the practical reason why she was the better choice for the descent. \u201cIf something goes wrong, it\u2019ll be easier for the people up here to handle someone of my weight than yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot with Tai\u2019s strength added to yours and Sing-Liu\u2019s\u2014and if Silvia needs to be stabilized, I\u2019ve had more medical training than you.\u201d</p><p>Indigo had forgotten about the modules he\u2019d done with Lara. Added to the fact that he was the more experienced climber, it tipped the scales in favor of his descent. She was about to say so when he shook his head and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t waste time arguing, Indy. Sing-Liu, give me the harness.\u201d</p><p>It was a slap that made her head ring. \u201cI\u2019m the lieutenant,\u201d she reminded him with ice in her tone. \u201cI give the commands.\u201d Hell, she thought even as the words spilled out, she\u2019d deal with his actions later. Right now, Silvia needed them. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew got in her face before she could finish. \u201cYou might be the lieutenant,\u201d he bit out, \u201cbut I\u2019m a senior member of the pack, and you\u2019ve got no cause to fucking ignore my opinion just because you insist on seeing me as a less dominant young male to the exclusion of all else.\u201d</p><p>Indigo was damned if she was going to have this fight in public. Grabbing the harness, she slammed it onto his chest. \u201cGear up.\u201d</p> <p>He began to do so, moving at high speed, but his temper continued to flash. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t sleeping together,\u201d he muttered, \u201cyou would\u2019ve listened to me from the word go, instead of trying to go in half-assed because you think you have something to prove.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s hold on her own temper snapped, a snarl burning its way out of her throat even as her claws sliced out. That was when Hawke appeared out of the trees. \u201cEnough.\u201d It was a snapped order. \u201cDrew, check your harness. Indigo, do you need to take a walk?\u201d</p><p>Only a lifetime of control allowed her to rein back the wolf, to say, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll organize things on this end.\u201d As she spoke, she realized Lara and Brace had also arrived. The fact that they\u2019d witnessed Hawke slapping her down further increased her icy rage, but she kept it in ruthless check.</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t say a word as he double-checked everything and slipped a listening device in his ear while Sing-Liu clipped a mike to the collar of his tee. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we.\u201d Indigo had set up the anchor using the tree as a base, but she and the others would manually control the backup; they couldn\u2019t be too careful with two lives at stake. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Hooking himself up, Drew disappeared over the edge of the cliff, and Indigo\u2019s heart slammed bruisingly hard against her ribs for a long, still instant. Then the rope went taut and she knew he\u2019d started to rappel down.</p> <p>Having made the descent faster than would\u2019ve been safe for most, Andrew crouched down beside his fallen packmate, doing a visual check for injuries after he\u2019d ensured her airway was clear and felt for a pulse. \u201cBroken leg, broken ribs, it looks like,\u201d he said into the mike, \u201csevere bruising, a bad gash on the back of her head.\u201d He could feel her blood, wet and sticky. \u201cShe\u2019s unconscious, but breathing.\u201d</p><p>Lara asked him to assess the breaks more closely. \u201cDo you think you can move her onto a stretcher for us to haul up?\u201d</p><p>Andrew shifted his body carefully on the narrow ledge so he could get a better angle at Silvia\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her spine, Lara. The way she\u2019s twisted . . . there could be damage if I move her.\u201d In spite of the huge technological advances of the late twenty-first century, spinal injuries continued to be problematic. Most could be healed, but the recovery process was brutal.</p><p>Lara\u2019s voice faded a fraction, as if she was speaking to someone else. \u201cI need to go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back up, guide you down,\u201d Andrew said, because even a controlled rappel down this cliff face could prove dangerous for the inexperienced. \u201cI see some footholds. I should be able to climb up unassisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got you if you slip.\u201d Indigo\u2019s voice in his ear, calm and steady.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d It took him considerably longer to clear the cliff face than it had to come down. His muscles were screaming by the time he reached the top, but it was a burn he could live with.</p><p>Lara was ready to go when he arrived. As the healer took a deep breath and prepared to descend with him all but glued to her, Andrew fought the urge to search for Indigo\u2019s gaze\u2014that particular fight could come later\u2014and stepped back over the edge of the cliff.</p> <p>It took an hour for Lara to heal Silvia enough for the girl to be safely winched up, another quarter of an hour for Lara to ascend, with Andrew climbing behind her. In the chaos of stripping Lara of her harness and coiling the ropes, he didn\u2019t see Indigo leave, though he assumed she was helping carry the injured girl to the infirmary.</p><p>Just as well, he thought, teeth gritted. Putting his rope on the ground, he was coiling Lara\u2019s when Hawke returned. \u201cJesus Christ, Drew,\u201d his alpha muttered, gathering up the other abandoned gear. \u201cI thought you were good with women.\u201d</p><p>Andrew dumped the rope and turned on the other wolf. \u201cI was right. She wasn\u2019t using resources properly.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t growl back, simply raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, Andrew turned to stare out over the jagged mountainous vista. So fucking beautiful\u2014and so incredibly lethal when the mood took it. The description, he thought, fit his lieutenant to a T. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019re still pissed at Indigo?\u201d</p><p>Swiveling on his heel, he scowled at his alpha. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shook his head, sleek strands of silver-gold whipping across his face in a sudden wind. Pushing them back, he said, \u201cThen maybe you need to go cool off so your brain can function.\u201d</p><p>Andrew bent down and restarted coiling the second rope, his arms scratched and dirty. But he had no patience for the task. Throwing the whole lot onto the ground, he stood up again. \u201cShe was taking too long to come to a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, it took her maybe fifteen seconds, and it\u2019s her job to weigh up the risks and consider all options in any given situation,\u201d Hawke said, continuing to stack the gear. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t think with that kind of calm, you wouldn\u2019t have headed out here with every piece of equipment you needed.\u201d</p><p>Andrew stared at his alpha\u2019s back, knowing he was missing something. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>Hawke shrugged. \u201cYou could\u2019ve gotten exactly what you wanted with no problems if you\u2019d gone about it the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to dance with her on things like this.\u201d Everything else, but not this. \u201cI\u2019ve told her she needs to learn to treat me as what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you\u2019re doing such a good job of doing the same with her.\u201d The sarcasm was a razor across his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He paused, felt a chill creep up his spine. \u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t say a word until Andrew had gotten himself back under control.</p><p>\u201cI overrode her in front of the others.\u201d The reality of what he\u2019d done slammed into him like a body blow. \u201cI forced you to pull rank on her in front of subordinates.\u201d And her pride, Jesus, her pride.</p><p>Hawke nodded, lines carved around his mouth. \u201cYou should\u2019ve taken her aside, discussed your climbing skill and medical training. Hell, she acted reasonably even after you let your cock control your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I kept pushing until she almost lost control.\u201d Control was everything to Indigo, an essential part of how she saw herself. \u201cFuck.\u201d Shoving his hands through his hair, he picked up one of the ropes Hawke had coiled, and put it over his arm as Hawke took the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Tai back for the rest of the stuff,\u201d his alpha said as they began to walk. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to forgive you easily for this. To be quite blunt, I don\u2019t blame her. Anyone tried that with me, we\u2019d be wiping up blood now.\u201d</p><p>Andrew remembered how much it had hurt Indigo to witness her aunt\u2019s poisonous relationship, knew exactly the courage it had taken for her to trust in this relationship with him. And still he\u2019d fucked up. \u201cI blew it.\u201d Maybe she\u2019d been having trouble lowering her final barriers, but she\u2019d taken a thousand small steps toward it. This mess was all on him.</p><p>Hawke snorted. \u201cForget about blowing it. You nuked it.\u201d</p><p>Silvia safely in Lara\u2019s hands\u2014and thankfully stable\u2014Indigo sat on the edge of her bed. Her hair was damp from her shower, her palms bearing the slightest of rope burns. But she didn\u2019t feel any of that. All she felt was a crushing sense of humiliation . . . and hurt. Drew had pushed her, challenging her in front of less dominant members of the pack, until her wolf lashed out, going against every rule she lived by.</p><p>God, Hawke had rebuked her in public.</p><p>Red fire flamed across her cheeks, but while the embarrassment burned, it wasn\u2019t as important in the scheme of things. Everyone lost their temper sometimes. Sing-Liu, Tai, Lara, hell, even Hawke, none of them would think less of her.</p><p>It was Drew who\u2019d stabbed a knife right into her heart. It was one thing for them to tangle with each other in private, but . . . \u201cEnough.\u201d Picking up a comb, she began to run it through her hair. What was done was done. She\u2019d apologize to Hawke for letting her temper get the better of her, pick up her duties, and carry on.</p><p>As for Drew . . . Her heart twisted. Professional, she told herself, she\u2019d be professional. That was the only way to deal with this. Anything else and it would hurt too\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her head snapped toward her door as she caught the whisper of a very familiar scent. The knock came several seconds later. For a moment, she debated answering it, but then her wolf raised its head in steely pride and nudged her on. Glancing down, she checked that the belt of her knee-length terry-cloth robe was secure and padded to the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said to the man on the other side, having pasted an expression of professional disinterest on her face, though the hand hidden behind the folds of her robe was fisted so tight she was cutting half-moon circles in her palm.</p><p>Drew took one look at her and muttered something harsh under his breath. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p> <p>He looked so lost, so vulnerable that she blinked, taken aback, but only for an instant. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do. Hawke sorted us out on-site\u2014and for what it\u2019s worth, I apologize for bringing my temper into the situation.\u201d The words were sincere, though her heart was a cold rock in her chest. \u201cThat was neither the time nor the place.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes shifted to that brilliant, wild copper. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to us, Indy. Don\u2019t shut me out.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clenched on the door, but she kept her composure, aware of packmates walking by in the corridor outside. \u201cWas there anything in particular you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI messed up.\u201d Blunt words, unexpected and raw. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her resolve wavered, the strength of the bond between them pushing at her to open the door, to invite him in. But\u2014\u201cWhat you did, it was a dominance challenge.\u201d She held up a hand when he would\u2019ve interrupted. \u201cYou can\u2019t help it.\u201d He was a dominant, one hell of a strong one. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep happening, and I can\u2019t afford to let it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndigo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Drew. For the health of the pack, the hierarchy must be explicit.\u201d They were too strong, too wild at heart to accept anything else. \u201cIf we continue being lovers . . . you won\u2019t be able to stop yourself from challenging me again.\u201d As a predatory changeling male, Drew could no more have stopped himself from doing what he had than she could\u2019ve stopped her instinctive antagonistic response.</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t immediately respond, but there was a set to his jaw that she recognized all too well. Then he said, \u201cSo that\u2019s it? You won\u2019t even try?\u201d</p><p>Her wolf peeled back its lips, all hope of a rational discussion going down the proverbial drain. \u201cWhat the hell do you think I\u2019ve been doing all this time?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Drew pressed his palms against the edges of the door frame, blocking out the outside world. \u201cBut when push comes to shove, you\u2019re choosing the easy out.\u201d</p> <p>Gritting her teeth, Indigo stared straight into those eyes of wolf copper. \u201cI\u2019m choosing the good of the pack. It\u2019s what a lieutenant does.\u201d</p><p>Drew bent until his breath whispered over her lips, a sweet, hot, angry caress. \u201cYeah? Well, since you know predatory changeling men so well, you know exactly what I\u2019m going to do next.\u201d</p><p>She shoved a hand against his chest. \u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll slice you to shreds.\u201d</p><p>Instead of continuing on his set path as any other male she knew would\u2019ve done, he gave her a faint smile she didn\u2019t trust an inch . . . and pushed off the door. \u201cUntil next we meet, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>He was gone a second later.</p><p>Indigo stood there stupefied until a passing packmate called out a hello. Muttering back a response, she closed her door. Her wolf shook its head, attempting to figure out what had just happened. It had no idea, but it did know Drew was up to something.</p><p>She fisted her hands. Whatever it was, she\u2019d handle it. Because no matter how much he pulled at her, no matter how deeply interwoven he was in her heart, she\u2019d taken an oath to protect the pack when she became a lieutenant, and it was time to uphold it. That was what drove her.</p><p>Liar.</p> <p>Steeling her spine, she tried to ignore that voice, but it wouldn\u2019t shut up. Because it wasn\u2019t only about the pack. It was about her. Her pride . . . and her heart. He\u2019d hurt her. She\u2019d made herself vulnerable, opened up her heart . . . and he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>Andrew managed to keep himself under control only by sheer force of will as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cDominance challenge, my ass,\u201d he muttered under his breath as he stalked to his room. He had no desire to fight for a higher rank in the hierarchy. He was exactly where he needed to be. So he\u2019d lost his temper\u2014everybody lost their temper now and then. The situation had been highly stressful. Was it any wonder he\u2019d spoken before he\u2019d thought?</p><p>He was so involved in his internal monologue that it took a packmate three tries to get his attention. When Andrew finally looked up, the woman said, \u201cEr, Drew? You can\u2019t go to the nursery looking like you want to shred someone with your claws and then eat the bloody, dismembered pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNursery?\u201d Shaking his head, he looked around. \u201cShit.\u201d He turned on his heel, throwing a \u201cthanks\u201d over his shoulder.</p><p>But the interruption had reset his mind. Getting angry, he realized, would achieve nothing. Yes, Indigo was being stubborn in refusing to talk this through with him, but what he\u2019d done . . . yeah, okay, she was right to be pissed.</p><p>And hurt, his conscience whispered, remembering the pain he\u2019d glimpsed in the shadowed violet of her gaze. He\u2019d hurt her, and it made him feel like shit. He wanted to stalk to her apartment, bully his way in, and argue with her until the ice cracked enough that he could hold her close and convince her to listen. But of course, he thought with another flare of temper, she wouldn\u2019t fight with him like every other dominant female he knew did with her man when she was mad or hurting. No, Indigo had to go all dignified and silent, her emotions rigidly contained.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he muttered, pushing through his door, \u201cthen I\u2019ll just make it so fucking difficult for her to ignore me that she\u2019ll have to fight with me.\u201d</p><p>Indigo found the first rose the next morning\u2014in the locker she used to store her gear when training indoors. It was a deep, deep red. Scarlet, she thought, that was the right word. And it smelled like heaven. But beneath the lush floral bouquet lay the scent of male\u2014wild and playful.</p><p>Heat uncurled in her abdomen, but she doused it with cold reason. This wasn\u2019t some lover\u2019s tiff that could be smoothed over with a rose and an apology. This went to the heart of who they were, the choices they had to make.</p><p>Dropping the rose back inside the locker, she closed the door and went out to whip her current group of eighteen-year-olds into some kind of fighting shape. \u201cAll right, boys and girls, I want two reps of the set we practiced last time. Go!\u201d</p><p>By the time the session was over, more than one student was close to crawling, yet Indigo\u2019s own energy level remained high, her senses on alert for any hint of Drew\u2019s presence. But he didn\u2019t come to her. Which, she thought, ignoring the growling of her wolf, was exactly right. Maybe the rose had been nothing but a good-bye.</p><p>A chill slithered through her veins, and when she wrenched open her locker again, she was well on the way to hating roses. Stupid, she thought, she was being stupid, acting like one of those ninnies who didn\u2019t know her own mind. The decision was made. End of stor\u2014</p><p>Blooms tumbled out all over her. Soft and fragrant and exquisite.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Staring, startled, she realized her locker was stuffed to the brim with roses.</p><p>Red, red roses.</p><p>Behind her, Sing-Liu whistled as she closed up her own locker. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call an apology. Man\u2019s got style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have them.\u201d Indigo scowled, scooping out the roses and putting them on the bench between the lockers. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Sing-Liu took one perfect bloom and stuck it behind her ear, the color shockingly bright against the shimmering jet of her hair. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d the soldier said with a small smile, \u201cI know he was an ass, but he should get some credit for creativity. Most men just snarl and growl and try to sex their lovers into a good mood.\u201d A sensual smile. \u201cNot that I mind being sexed until my toes curl. You should try it.\u201d</p><p>Indigo snarled at the soldier. \u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I do.\u201d Lips still curved in that provocative smile, the small, lean human woman who was more lethal than a large number of the wolves in the den, disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Locker cleared, Indigo shut the door and turned to leave.</p><p>Her feet hesitated.</p><p>She stared at the dark red spill of roses, felt the vulnerable heart of her soften. But she built fences around that softening as soon as it occurred. If she accepted this apology, if she allowed their relationship to progress again, then what she\u2019d said would come to pass. Drew would attempt to dominate her wolf in unacceptable ways again, would force her to the point where her wolf would strike out. Over and over and over again.</p><p>Such a relationship would destroy them both, until the love that bound them was twisted and broken. Adria and Martin almost hated each other now. Not enough to separate, but any remaining love was tainted and pitted. Indigo didn\u2019t know why they continued to stay together\u2014they never laughed with each other, and there was so much dead air between them that Indigo\u2019s wolf was hurt by the piercing silence.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen to her and Drew.</p><p>Her hand reached out, touched the petals of a rose. Snapping it back before the velvety softness could seduce her into dropping her guard, she stalked down the corridor. No one stopped her, though there were a few interested glances thrown her way. In no mood to gossip, she slammed into her room . . . and came to a complete halt.</p><p>The damn wolf had drowned the room in silver-foiled chocolate kisses.</p><p>Thousands of them.</p><p>She growled.</p><p>And then she opened the closet door.</p><p>The treats started showing up the next day. A bowl of decadent champagne-soaked berries on the desk of her small office, passion fruit cheesecake with white chocolate swirls mysteriously in her fridge, crystallized fruit in the pocket of her jacket. And always, always kisses. Chocolate kisses. Everywhere she turned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By contrast, she never saw Drew, though she caught his scent every place she went. His shadowy presence served to ratchet up her frustration, even as it fed her ever-growing hunger for him. She\u2019d thought distance would lessen the need. Instead, it only seemed to be making it stronger\u2014until the ache was a constant pulse in her body, and she was starting to look for those damn chocolate kisses.</p><p>\u201cI swear,\u201d she muttered under her breath as another packmate grinned at her as she strode to a meeting with Hawke, \u201cI\u2019m going to wring his neck.\u201d Because the demon had gotten the pack on his side now.</p><p>\u201cHe just lost his temper, Indigo,\u201d Yuki had said to her a couple of nights ago. \u201cCan happen to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t give him a chance,\u201d Jem had offered, all the way from Los Angeles\u2014knowing everything, thanks to the pack rumor mill\u2014\u201chow will he ever learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi amigo is hurting,\u201d Tom\u00e1s had said not much later, all long face and soulful dark eyes that she didn\u2019t trust an inch. \u201cHow can you be so cruel to someone who adores you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut him a break,\u201d Lara had said only yesterday. \u201cHe looks so depressed it\u2019s breaking my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepressed, my foot,\u201d Indigo muttered. She knew him far too well. He was using that charm of his to fool everyo\u2014\u201cDamn.\u201d Realizing she\u2019d forgotten the little notepad on which she\u2019d jotted down a few things she needed to discuss with Hawke, she turned on her heel and headed back to her room.</p><p>The grins should\u2019ve warned her, but she just figured on another rose. And maybe her heart skipped a beat at the thought, but she was determined not to give in to this relentless pursuit. Andrew Liam Kincaid was not going to wear her down.</p> <p>Then she came within sight of her door. And froze.</p><p>It was a soft toy. A wolf, to be precise. A wolf with lush silver fur and blue, blue eyes. It was carrying an envelope in its mouth.</p><p>Glancing around the suspiciously empty corridor\u2014hah!\u2014her packmates were likely stacked up five deep around the corner\u2014she stared down at the furry thing. She should ignore it.</p><p>Opening her door, she walked inside and picked up the notepad, sticking it in a pocket. But as she went to walk back out, the wolf looked so adorably sweet that she couldn\u2019t leave it abandoned in the corridor. Growling, she picked up the toy and brought it inside, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Now that she had the cuddly thing in her hand, she couldn\u2019t stop from reaching for the envelope. Holding the toy by her side, she slit open the flap and withdrew a card embossed with a rose that someone had embellished with hand-drawn thorns\u2014big ones. \u201cCute,\u201d she said, her wolf flexing its claws inside her mind.</p><p>Opening the flap, she found herself looking at fine handwriting that couldn\u2019t be Drew\u2019s. Written in gold ink, it was an invitation to dinner that night at one of San Francisco\u2019s swankiest restaurants, for the occasion of . . . Indigo blinked, read the line again.</p> <p>. . . for the occasion of Andrew Kincaid\u2019s good-bye party. Indigo narrowed her eyes, her wolf motionless with suspicion. What was he up to now? Because no way did she believe that he was giving up. Predatory changeling men didn\u2019t have the word \u201csurrender\u201d in their vocabularies.</p><p>Or maybe, part of her whispered, she just didn\u2019t want to believe that. Because if he gave up, then this was it. Over and done with. Forever. Her wolf would never in a million years accept a quitter.</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d she said, shaking her head. He\u2019d done it again, got her thinking as if they were still courting. When, in spite of his persistence, they were not. But, she thought, glaring at the thorny rose, she would be accepting the invitation.</p><p>It was time she and Drew had this out face-to-face.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>Andrew gave a sigh of relief when the pack rumor mill informed him that Indigo had taken the toy inside, and not only that, she\u2019d looked pissed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said to Brenna as he sat bothering her while she tried to work. Putting his feet up on the table opposite him, he leaned his back against the console next to his sister\u2019s.</p><p>She glanced up from where she was doing something on the touch screen. \u201cGood? You\u2019re happy because the strongest, most lethal woman in the den wants to turn you into a shish kebab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does the ice thing,\u201d he said to his sister, his wolf growling at the mere thought of it. \u201cI hate the ice thing.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna paused, threw him a startled glance. \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d Stopping in her task for a second, she rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cJudd can\u2019t get away with the ice thing anymore.\u201d</p><p>Andrew remembered how cold the Psy male had been before his mating to Brenna. \u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d Maybe he could learn something.</p><p>\u201cNothing I\u2019d like to share with my brother,\u201d Brenna said with a saucy smile.</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her smirk made his wolf laugh. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing with Judd still away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came back a few nights ago.\u201d She scowled. \u201cI swore I\u2019d strip his hide if he did it again. Teleporting that far really wipes him out, even if he does it in stages. He was all but unconscious for hours.\u201d</p><p>Andrew knew without asking that Judd had left as quietly as he\u2019d arrived. The Psy male had sent them dispatches from various South American countries where he was following the scent of a Pure Psy operation. He was now certain that the group, with Henry\u2019s backing, was behind the transmitters on SnowDancer land.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Andrew said, turning his mind away from that situation for now, \u201cthat you can come to me for anything while he\u2019s away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d have to,\u201d she muttered, \u201cwhen somebody in the pack would rat me out to you the instant I even vaguely looked like I might be in trouble.\u201d But she leaned over and brushed a kiss on his jaw before beginning to work on the screen again, erasing and redrawing points of what appeared to be parts of a complex computronic design.</p><p>\u201cIs that your teleportation machine?\u201d The FAST project was, he knew, her most important long-term undertaking. If she could one day invent a way to send anyone\u2014not just Tks\u2014place to place with such speed, it would change the world.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Tiny frown lines between her brows. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve got the lieutenant\u2019s attention,\u201d she said, returning to their earlier subject, \u201cwhat\u2019re you planning on doing next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind.\u201d Shooting her a smug look when she gave a disgruntled scowl, he swung his legs off the table. \u201cI need to go have a comm-conference with my team, make sure there\u2019s nothing that needs to be brought to Hawke\u2019s attention around the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use the room through there,\u201d Brenna said, pointing to her right. \u201cNo one\u2019s booked it for now.\u201d A pause, laughing eyes looking up at him. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll let you hide from Indigo until you\u2019re ready to spring the ambush.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, Andrew kissed the top of his sister\u2019s head. \u201cI love you.\u201d It was a smiling statement, but no less true for it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Brenna said, \u201ceven if you are driving Indigo so insane, she\u2019s starting to snap at everyone in the den. Did you really steal her phone and record your voice howling her name as the ringtone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Deeply satisfied by the current state of affairs, Andrew strolled into the conference room, shut the door, and initiated the calls. He trusted Bren, but other techs could come in at any moment, and the information his team gathered was quite often sensitive. Having brought them all into the call, he sat back and listened, making notes as necessary.</p><p>Thankfully, things were very steady at present, partly as a result of Riley and Mercy\u2019s mating. A strong mated couple wasn\u2019t essential at the top of the hierarchy, but it did help steady the pack as a whole. \u201cWhat about that group of old ones?\u201d he asked one of the women on his team. \u201cThe ones you were worried were stewing over something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that they\u2019re just being grumpy old men.\u201d</p><p>Laughter, then a few more snippets of information before they wrapped up the meeting early and Andrew snuck through the corridors to update Hawke on some of the smaller matters. His alpha liked to keep his finger on the pulse of his pack.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Hawke said after Andrew finished, neither of them having elected to sit for the short briefing. \u201cExcept for these games the Psy are playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure Psy seems to have accepted defeat in its proselytizing efforts at least,\u201d Andrew said, having monitored the situation. \u201cNo new reports within the pack or in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve had no more detected incursions onto our land.\u201d Hawke folded his arms, staring at the territorial map on the wall. \u201cBut something tells me that\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Andrew agreed, \u201cthere was too much planning there for them to give up their aim\u2014whatever it is\u2014so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might, at some stage, have to give Councilor Henry Scott a little warning tap to let him know he\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Since SnowDancer, together with DarkRiver, had already taken down one Councilor, Andrew knew that \u201cwarning tap\u201d was a real possibility. \u201cAre you thinking sometime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We need more intel on the bastard. He\u2019s smart.\u201d Turning from the map, Hawke raised an eyebrow. \u201cAs of right now, you\u2019re off shift for the next forty-eight hours. Go play your favorite game.\u201d</p><p>Feeling the hum of anticipation in his belly, Andrew gave his alpha an innocent smile. \u201cI have no idea what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Hawke pointed a finger at him. \u201cI want my calm, collected lieutenant back by the end of the week, or I\u2019m packing you in a box and shipping you to fucking Siberia.\u201d</p><p>Andrew grinned. \u201cI hear it\u2019s nice there this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Indigo knew she looked good in the strapless little black dress that came to midthigh and skimmed over her body like a lover\u2019s caress. Feet encased in three-inch heels, hair cascading down to the dip of her spine, and lips plump and red, she intended to make Andrew Kincaid\u2019s eyes pop out in revenge for the relentless pressure she was under to \u201cforgive him.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter how many times she explained that it wasn\u2019t about forgiveness, but about the health of the pack; no one listened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d had enough.</p><p>Several men waiting at the bar went stock-still as she entered the restaurant. \u201cAndrew Kincaid,\u201d she said to the hostess, ignoring everyone else.</p><p>The petite brunette checked her sleek computronic organizer. \u201cThis way, Ms. Riviere.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo narrowed her eyes, but said nothing as she followed the woman through the carpeted center of the restaurant and up the small flight of stairs at the back. She heard several men suck in a breath as she passed, while one audibly moaned, \u201cOh, God, those are what I call legs,\u201d but none of it eased her temper.</p><p>Instead of showing her to a table on the upper level, the hostess took her to the door of a small private room. \u201cI hope you enjoy your meal, Ms. Riviere,\u201d the woman said, opening the door and waiting for Indigo to enter.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She heard the door close behind her, but her eyes were on the man who stood beside the table dressed in a tuxedo that turned him from gorgeous and deliciously sexy to devastatingly handsome\u2014but with the wicked still in his eye.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He ran his eyes down her body, back up, then down again. Slowly. Very, very slowly.</p><p>Every inch of her skin felt hypersensitive by the time those playful blue eyes met hers again. \u201cI\u2019m officially slayed,\u201d he said, placing a hand on his heart.</p> <p>She would not smile. \u201cI thought this was a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf two.\u201d Pulling out her chair, he inclined his head. \u201cWon\u2019t you take a seat, Indigo?\u201d</p><p>It felt strange to hear him use her full name. But deciding to take him up on his offer since the whole point of tonight was to talk to him face-to-face, she closed the distance between them and, placing her purse on the table, sat down. He eased the chair in behind her, his arms on either side of her body. \u201cYou smell . . .\u201d A long, slow breath, as if he was savoring the scent of her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, overwhelmed by the sensory impact of him. The warmth of his body lapped against her skin even as the wild male scent of him wrapped around her like an invisible caress. She almost expected him to bend his head and kiss her nape, so much so that her body tightened in anticipation, but he released his hold on the arms of the chair and moved around to sit across from her.</p><p>\u201cYou still carry my scent in your skin.\u201d</p><p>She closed her hands hard on the chair arms to get herself under control. \u201cIt\u2019ll fade.\u201d Pain and an untamed, unnamed emotion flared within her even as she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you in my skin, too,\u201d he said in a tone that she couldn\u2019t read, before pushing a code on the little touch pad sitting to the side. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I placed an order for both of us earlier. I wanted to be able to talk to you without interruptions.\u201d</p><p>Unsure how to read his behavior, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d and watched as the door opened to admit an attendant dressed in a smart black suit. Rolling in the serving cart, the slender man placed it quietly by the side of the table. \u201cYou\u2019re certain you do not wish for me to stay, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>The man left with a nod to both Drew and Indigo.</p><p>Rising, Drew lifted off a cover to place a plate of delicacies in front of her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like a choice of starters.\u201d</p><p>Starting to feel an odd prickling at the back of her neck\u2014as if she\u2019d walked unawares into a trap\u2014Indigo nonetheless picked up an artwork of a pastry and popped it into her mouth as he retrieved his own plate. The flavors exploded on her tongue in a burst of sweetness and spice. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s smile was sharp, satisfied . . . and something else, something she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on but that made her wolf growl in warning as he murmured, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Deciding to take the bull by the horns, she allowed him to pour the wine before saying, \u201cSo, what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving the pack.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat before she narrowed her eyes. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked smile. \u201cNo joke. I spoke to WinterFire in North Dakota. They\u2019re willing to welcome me into the fold.\u201d</p><p>WinterFire was a strong, but much, much smaller pack. \u201cAnd what will you do in WinterFire?\u201d She wasn\u2019t buying it, not for an instant.</p><p>\u201cSame thing I do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be bored out of your skull.\u201d The breadth of their territory suited his skills particularly well.</p><p>Drew shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take that risk.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she leaned forward and saw his gaze dip to her cleavage. He didn\u2019t even bother to pretend he wasn\u2019t checking her out as she said, \u201cCut the crap, Drew. What\u2019re you really up to?\u201d Her breasts suddenly felt too tight, too confined, her skin hot and aching.</p><p>Putting down his glass, Drew lifted his gaze to hers. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Indigo.\u201d Solemn words.</p><p>For the first time, she felt a hint of uncertainty. \u201cAre you insane? We can\u2019t afford to lose one of the strongest males in the pack! Not to mention our tracker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said with a blunt honesty that made her mind spin. \u201cAnd you want me.\u201d</p><p>Since her entire body was aflame at his proximity\u2014to the point where he had to be able to scent her arousal\u2014she could hardly deny that. \u201cI\u2019m not following your logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I can see,\u201d he murmured, stroking her flushed breasts with his gaze, \u201conly two things are keeping us apart. The first is the fact that you don\u2019t think our union would be good for the health of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemoving yourself from the pack won\u2019t exactly help the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his tone intent, \u201cit will. You won\u2019t have to worry about confusion when it comes to the hierarchy\u2014and WinterFire is happy for me to continue to work with SnowDancer as necessary.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the rational argument, she felt her wolf\u2019s claws dig into her skin, not in anger, but in a strange, wild panic. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought this out.\u201d</p><p>A muscle pulled taut in his jaw. \u201cYeah, I have. Because I\u2019m not walking away from us, Indigo. I don\u2019t care how hard I have to fight you.\u201d</p><p>She curled her hand into a fist under the table. \u201cYou said two things. What\u2019s the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mule-headedness.\u201d</p><p>Scrunching up her napkin, she threw it at him. \u201cMy mule-headedness? I\u2019m not the one who refuses to accept that we\u2019re over!\u201d</p><p>Having caught the napkin without effort, Drew put it down on the table. \u201cIs that what you really want, Indy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I don\u2019t go around saying things I don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>He got up, walking around and behind her while she remained in place\u2014courtesy of her \u201cmule-headedness.\u201d Putting his hands on the arms of her chair, he leaned down until his lips brushed her ear. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, I\u2019m in no mood\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kisses on her neck, slow, wet, coaxing. \u201cI can put you in the mood.\u201d Teeth, little nips and bites that made her entire body clench.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She put her hands on his but didn\u2019t push him away, too starved for skin-to-skin contact with him. God, but he\u2019d addicted her to him. The realization terrified her, but not enough to break the connection. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your foolhardy idea to leave the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecision\u2019s made.\u201d Another kiss.</p><p>Claws threatening to release, she pushed back her chair and rose to face him. He watched her without blinking. \u201cWhere\u2019s the zipper on your dress?\u201d</p><p>Indigo lifted a shaking finger, pointed. \u201cYou are not leaving SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecision\u2019s not yours to make.\u201d Cool words, dominance shimmering beneath the surface.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Moving out from behind the chair, she glared at him, one hand on the chair back, the other on her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re being an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m being smart.\u201d Taking a step toward her, he put his hand on the back of her neck and hauled her forward to meet his lips.</p><p>She was so shocked by the hard, fast move\u2014though why, she didn\u2019t know\u2014she didn\u2019t put up her defenses in time. Her hands flew to grip his waist, and she found herself not only giving him full access, but taking liberties of her own, her tongue tangling deliciously with his. He tasted of sin and temptation and all kinds of wicked. And her body, her body was starved for him.</p><p>When he moved both hands up to cup her face, she shivered and felt another barrier crumble. Because where the kiss ravaged, took, and demanded, his hold was almost unbearably tender. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn fool,\u201d she muttered against his mouth. \u201cBut I can\u2019t seem to stop adoring you.\u201d</p><p>He froze, his expression showing a sudden, unexpected vulnerability. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me like that, Indy.\u201d</p><p>This time, she kissed him, wrapping her arms around his neck and shoving one hand into the rich silk of his hair to pull his mouth down to hers. \u201cYou are not leaving SnowDancer.\u201d She bit him hard on his lower lip. \u201cYou do and we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Slits of blue gleamed beneath lowered lashes. \u201cI thought we were already done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d Fact was, she hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about him since the instant she\u2019d told him they were over\u2014and though she\u2019d never in a million years admit it, it would\u2019ve destroyed her if he had taken her at her word and backed off. That wasn\u2019t how dominant wolves courted, and somewhat to her surprise, she found she\u2019d still been tangling with him on that level. \u201cWould you like to argue, or would you like to go home and tear each other\u2019s clothes off?\u201d</p><p>The curve of his lips against hers. \u201cI never really liked North Dakota anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the wolf\u2019s laughter in that, she looked up, felt her eyes widen, her own wolf sitting up in shocked disbelief. \u201cYou played me!\u201d No one had ever fooled either woman or wolf to this extent.</p><p>He nibbled on her ear. \u201cI was serious about leaving, but I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d A look so guileless she knew it was the wolf attempting to appear innocent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaving, her foot, she thought. He\u2019d had no intention whatsoever of doing that.</p><p>For some reason, his wickedness made her own wolf shake its head and grin. \u201cJust for that,\u201d she said, nipping at his chin, able to feel the eager thrust of his erection against her abdomen, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you finish treating me to dinner.\u201d Her thighs tightened with anticipation, her skin shimmering with a touch-hunger only Drew could satisfy.</p><p>Taking her lips in a sweet, hot kiss, he slid his hand to her bottom, squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Lieutenant.\u201d</p> <p>The starters and the mains passed by relatively smoothly\u2014if Indigo disregarded the fact that Drew was eating her up with his eyes\u2014but then they got to dessert. \u201cOh,\u201d she all but purred as she saw what he\u2019d ordered.</p><p>A miniature triple-chocolate baked cheesecake with lime sorbet on the side.</p><p>When he put the plate in front of himself and crooked a finger, her wolf bared its teeth but decided to play along . . . and torture him a little. Walking over, she put one hand on the back of his neck and slid her fingers into his hair as she settled herself on his lap. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she murmured, flicking her tongue over her lower lip, \u201cwhat is that I feel beneath me?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s laugh was pained. \u201cWitch.\u201d Dipping the spoon into the sorbet, he brought it to her lips.</p><p>Holding her. Claiming her.</p> <p>As the cool silver touched her lips, her eyes locked with his . . . and all laughter leached away. He waited, patient. \u201cI can see your wolf,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>Her wolf saw him, too. And it decided that this male who confused, puzzled, amused, delighted, and pleasured them in equal measures was a worthy opponent. Parting her lips, she let him slip the spoon inside. \u201cMmm.\u201d It was a throaty sound of bliss as she savored the crisp taste of lime, tart and sweet at the same time.</p><p>Drew\u2019s hand spread on her lower back as he returned to scoop up a piece of cheesecake. When he put it to her lips this time, she opened without hesitation, holding his gaze the entire time, knowing her own had gone wolf on him. Then the chocolate flavors burst to life on her tongue and she decided that Drew Kincaid had earned the mind-blowing sex she was going to give him tonight.</p><p>Leaning down, she shared the taste of the cheesecake with him in the most intimate of ways. \u201cGood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She stroked her tongue lazily against his as his hand clenched on her hip.</p><p>The spoon clattered onto the plate, and Drew\u2019s hand was suddenly between her thighs, cupping her with shocking, raw intimacy. \u201cDrew.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet, so ready.\u201d The sound of something tearing, and then black lace was fluttering to the floor. \u201cStraddle me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014we can\u2019t\u2014what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was already maneuvering her body into position, his hands pushing up her dress to the edge of her butt. \u201cNo one will come in. I initiated the lock after the meal was delivered.\u201d</p><p>Indigo shivered as he moved his hands up to cup her buttocks. \u201cWe can\u2019t have sex in a restaurant.\u201d She was scandalized at the idea.</p><p>\u201cTake me out, Indy.\u201d Kisses on her neck, hot, passionate, earthy.</p><p>She could no more stop her hands from smoothing down his clothed chest to the buckle of his belt than she could stop her body from rubbing sensuously against his. Managing to undo the belt in spite of her suddenly clumsy fingers, she unbuttoned the top button of his pants before giving in to temptation and placing fingers over him. He sucked in a breath and seemed to freeze against her. \u201cZipper, Indy.\u201d The hoarse need in his voice further incited her own hunger as she lowered the zipper, her fingers brushing against the warm, stiff ridge of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have against underwear?\u201d Not that she was complaining. Not when he was so hard and beautiful in her hand. Thick and silky and pulsing with lust. For her. Only for her. Possessiveness made her stroke him slow and easy, taking her time, placing her mark.</p><p>He bit her nipple through the dress\u2014a short, sharp warning. \u201cUnderwear is overrated.\u201d In her hands, he pulsed hotter, and suddenly she couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>Changing position a fraction, she brought them into perfect sync. Feeling him push into her was . . . Shuddering, she clenched her hands in his hair and let him ease her down on that beautiful cock. \u201cMine.\u201d She nipped his ear. \u201cTouch any other woman and I\u2019ll cut it off.\u201d</p> <p>He tapped her lightly on the bottom. \u201cTouch any other man and I\u2019ll tie you naked to the bed and keep you that way until you realize the error of your ways.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his mouth. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal.\u201d And then he was sliding hilt-deep into her, and she couldn\u2019t contain her cry of delight.</p><p>Drew caught it with his mouth, moving up his hands to pull down the top of her dress until her breasts popped free of their confines. Murmuring rough, sexual words of appreciation and pleasure, he licked and kissed and petted as he let her set the pace. Bracing herself with her feet on the rungs of his chair, her hands on his jacket-covered shoulders, she went slow and easy . . . for the first few strokes. But it had been too long. She\u2019d missed him too much.</p><p>So when he dropped his hands back down to her hips and urged her to pick up the pace, she made no argument. Instead, she fused her mouth with his as he set a far more punishing rhythm, rocking them both to an orgasm that had been days in the making.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you talked me into sex in a public place,\u201d Indigo said later that night as they strolled down the corridor to the hotel room they\u2019d decided to take in the city. They needed to spend some time alone, apart from everyone. Things had changed, and they both needed time to accept and assess.</p><p>Drew stroked his hand over her bottom in that possessive way of his as he opened the door and ushered her inside. \u201cAs I keep telling you, there are advantages to dating a younger man.\u201d</p><p>She felt her lips twitch. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see that.\u201d It was a lighthearted comment, but there was an element of truth in it. Drew\u2019s sexuality was wild, open, exuberant. Of course, she thought, most of that was simply who he was. Age made little difference. He\u2019d probably be ambushing her with kisses well into his eighth decade.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that a thought . . . that they might make it, be together that long.</p><p>About to kick off her heels now that they were in the privacy of the room, she was halted by Drew\u2019s hands on her hips. \u201cKeep them on?\u201d It was a husky request, his body strong and hard behind hers.</p><p>Reaching back with her arms, she wrapped them around his neck. \u201cThe zipper is hidden along the side.\u201d</p><p>Andrew stroked his hand down Indigo\u2019s side, curving his fingers over her breast and smoothing them over her hip before stroking back up to find the cleverly hidden tag. One pull and the black material began to part in a sensuous whisper. She was naked beneath the dress, the remains of her panties stuffed in one of his pockets.</p><p>His wolf grinned as it remembered the way she\u2019d glared at him when he\u2019d teased her by suggesting they leave it behind to shock the waiter. \u201cI like this dress,\u201d he murmured. The zipper was almost to her hip now and the dress was all but falling off her body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it allows you easy access.\u201d Giving a little shimmer that was unalterably feminine, she dropped her arms from around his neck as the dress fell off her body. Stepping out of it, she nudged it delicately to the side.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything\u2014because his brain seemed to have deserted him. Still wearing those spiked heels, and unashamedly naked otherwise, she was a fantasy come to life, strong and sexy and so pettable that he couldn\u2019t keep his hands from roaming. When she shivered and leaned back into him, his wolf growled with pride. Mine, he thought, she\u2019s mine.</p><p>Sliding his hands up her rib cage to cup her breasts, he teased her nipples before caressing her with a slightly rougher touch. She made a low, throaty sound of pleasure but pulled away. As he watched, she walked to the bed and climbed on to lie on her front facing him. Bracing herself up on her elbows, she bent her knees up and crossed her ankles, those sexy heels in the air. \u201cStrip.\u201d It was a sensual order.</p><p>But more, Andrew realized with a leap of joy in his soul, it was an invitation to play. And the lieutenant rarely initiated their play.</p><p>\u201cYour wish. My command.\u201d Bowing with a theatrical flourish, he shrugged off his jacket and hung it carefully on a chair before moving his fingers to the bow tie at his throat. The strip of black fabric took bare seconds to slip out from around his neck, but he spent several more placing it over the jacket with care.</p><p>Only then did he move his fingers to his cuff links, aware of Indigo watching his every move, the perfume of her desire scenting the air in a rich musk that made his cock throb. Cuff links in hand, he walked to place them on the dresser, then returned to stand in front of her and began to unbutton his shirt. Halfway down, he said, \u201cShoes first, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Her nod was slow, her eyes on the strip of skin revealed by the open sides of his shirt. Masculine pride shot warmth through every part of him as he got rid of his shoes and socks.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she commanded, every inch the imperious female, when he rose back to his full height.</p><p>He obeyed, tugging his shirt out from his pants and beginning to undo the remaining buttons even as he used his gaze to caress the lush curves of her breasts, the sleek length of her legs, the sexy dip of her spine.</p><p>\u201cAn . . . drew . . .\u201d Indigo drawled out his name and only then did he realize he\u2019d finished with the buttons.</p><p>Too delighted in the moment to care how much of his emotions he was exposing, he shrugged off the shirt and threw it carelessly on the chair. \u201cShouldn\u2019t there be some whipped cream and oil at this point?\u201d</p><p>Bright indigo-colored eyes met his. \u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that for next time.\u201d The words were a sultry promise. \u201cYou planning to take off your pants anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Andrew said, stepping closer to the bed as he began to undo his belt. \u201cAre you planning to use and abuse my poor body like you did at the restaurant?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was nothing.\u201d Flowing up into a kneeling position on the end of the bed, she tugged off his belt and threw it to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019ll be whimpering by the time I\u2019m through with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? We\u2019ll see.\u201d He stepped out of reach and unzipped his pants, turning to give her his back. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m shy.\u201d</p><p>Something hit him in the back, and he realized she\u2019d thrown one of the small cushions piled up beside the pillows on the bed. \u201cDemon.\u201d</p><p>His wolf smiled at the way she said that\u2014with open, sensual affection. Not saying anything in response, he pulled off his pants and threw them to the side.</p><p>Indigo sighed at the sheer gorgeous perfection of the man in front of her. \u201cCome here so I can take merciless advantage of you.\u201d His body was all smooth golden skin and toned muscle, his butt just made for her teeth.</p><p>When he turned, his fingers circling his erection, she felt her own body grow impossibly more ready for him. Looking into his eyes, she saw pure blue flame . . . and something else. A deep, inexorable possessiveness. Her wolf didn\u2019t snarl, not this time. Because whatever the future held, she\u2019d claimed him as hers, too. This was the trade-off, and if she was honest with herself, she didn\u2019t mind belonging to someone who was happy to belong to her.</p> <p>\u201cOn your back,\u201d he said in a voice gone rough with desire.</p><p>She slid up the bed until she lay half braced on the pillows, her legs bent, her knees together. \u201cI thought I was the one taking advantage.\u201d</p><p>Releasing the rigid length of his erection, he got on the bed and put one hand on each of her knees. \u201cLater.\u201d Spreading her thighs with open sexual intent, he slid his hands down to the exquisitely sensitive skin of her inner thighs.</p><p>Her body arched up in shameless welcome.</p><p>Shifting closer, he thrust in. The blunt penetration was exactly what she craved. Moaning at the shock wave of pleasure, she wrapped her legs around his waist, pushed her fingers into his hair. When his gaze met hers, she saw eyes of wild copper looking back at her. Wolf. Tugging down his head, she nipped at his lower lip before sucking it into her mouth.</p><p>He growled against her, and then he began to move.</p> <p>Hard and fast, until she had to brace her hands against the headboard to keep from being pounded right into the wood. But, oh, it felt gooood. Meeting him thrust for thrust, she felt one of his big hands close over her breast, squeezing and petting with a proprietariness she\u2019d never allowed anyone else. And the kisses . . . he sucked and licked and nipped at her mouth, her neck, throughout, making her feel unbearably cherished even as he sexed her brains out.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>Afterward, she lay crushed under hard male muscle, almost certain her heart would regain a normal rhythm sometime in the next century. Curving one hand around the back of Drew\u2019s neck as he lay slumped over her, his chest rising and falling in gasping breaths, she nuzzled at the side of his face. \u201cI do believe I\u2019ve just been royally tumbled.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved against her. \u201cTumbled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like the right word. I feel like the country maid who got her skirts thrown up over her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time.\u201d</p><p>Biting lightly at his ear, she rubbed the now bare heel of one foot over his buttocks, enjoying having him all to herself.</p><p>For a while, they just lay there, soaking in each other\u2019s scents. When Drew did move, it was only so he could spoon her body with his. \u201cIndy?\u201d</p> <p>Catching the oddly solemn note in his voice, she ran her hand over the arm she was using as a pillow. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It was a stark statement. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done what I did in front of the others. I won\u2019t do it again, no matter how hard I have to fight my wolf.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t brush off the apology this time. Because it was important. Not simply what he\u2019d said\u2014but that he\u2019d said it after she\u2019d already come back to him. \u201cYou were right about something, too,\u201d she said, opening herself up in a way she\u2019d never done for any other man. \u201cYou might be younger, but you are very much a dominant male. I\u2019m sorry if I made you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d A kiss on her neck. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>God, he was so generous, he\u2019d spoil her terribly if she let him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201clet me finish. This mule-headed woman might not say it again.\u201d</p><p>A husky chuckle, but he didn\u2019t interrupt her this time.</p><p>\u201cIn spite of what I told myself, I\u2019ve been burying my head in the sand about you,\u201d she said with brutal honesty, \u201cbecause it was easier to deal with this thing between us if I stripped you down to just the younger, less dominant male.\u201d So long as he was that, she could justify maintaining a subtle emotional distance under the masquerade of caution. \u201cI won\u2019t be doing that again. I\u2019m going to learn to deal with you exactly as you are.\u201d And that man, she thought, was more than a match for her wolf.</p><p>He ran a hand over her hip, the touch warm and affectionate. \u201cYou know this means I get a free pass on certain actions that are likely to drive you insane.\u201d Light words, and yet there was a grain of truth in them.</p><p>Stroking his arm, able to feel the caress of the crisp hairs beneath her palm, she said, \u201cNo free pass. I\u2019ll get mad. I might even yell.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her closer to him. \u201cThat I can take. Hell, I like arguing with you.\u201d A kiss on the curve of her shoulder. \u201cBut I won\u2019t let you put up those walls of ice between us again, Indy. Fair warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018let me\u2019?\u201d she asked in a tone that she knew was disgruntled. \u201cYou call bombarding me with roses, kisses, and adorable soft toys \u2018letting me\u2019? I\u2019m not even going to mention my cell phone or the closet.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cYes\u2014now imagine how much worse I can get.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist smiling, she shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably come up against the ice walls again in the future,\u201d she said, knowing herself. \u201cBut you have full permission to do your worst.\u201d</p><p>His laughter was warm and open. \u201cSnuggle closer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get any closer.\u201d But she pressed deeper into him, her wolf still sprawled out in abandon inside of her from their recent loving. Andrew Kincaid, she thought sleepily as Drew continued to run his hand over her hip, his breath steady against her hair, had some serious moves.</p><p>He also had an endless supply of energy.</p><p>She woke in darkness to his nibbling kiss along the line of her neck, his fingers playing between her thighs. Melting, she pulled his head down for a kiss. When he lifted up her leg and slid into her, it made her nerve endings sizzle with delight.</p><p>It was a lazy loving this time, Drew rocking her to a long, deep orgasm before coming in a pulse of heat inside her.</p><p>Andrew knew he had a smug arrogance to his step when he walked back into the den with Indigo by his side, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He was so damn happy, the joy bubbled through his veins. Even when Indigo gave him a scowling look that said \u201cbehave,\u201d all he wanted to do was grin and shout to the world that she was his.</p><p>And he was keeping her, mating dance or no mating dance.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing today, Lieutenant?\u201d he asked after they\u2019d gotten changed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check up on Silvia.\u201d</p><p>Andrew had looked in on the girl the previous day, happy to see that she was conscious and well on the road to recovery. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. Lara\u2019s certain now that she won\u2019t have any long-term injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn lucky, given the height she fell from.\u201d Wrapping an arm around his waist, she said, \u201cDid the cats\u2019 little healers have anything to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Andrew shook his head, curving his own arm around her shoulders. The \u201clittle healers\u201d were two very gifted children\u2014whose talents DarkRiver had only divulged to a tight group in SnowDancer because the kids often came to play with their friends in the den, and the wolves needed to know to keep them away from the infirmary. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in agreement that those two need their childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the cats have decided to put them off-limits until they turn eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Pups need to be pups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Andrew added, \u201cmight be, the kids can\u2019t heal all physical injuries. Lara and the DarkRiver healer are starting to think their gift may be linked directly to traumatic brain injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Indigo murmured, \u201csince the Psy are so cerebral.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded in agreement as they neared the infirmary. \u201cThere goes Brace.\u201d The boy was heading in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cI hear he\u2019s been skipping classes to go sit with Silvia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy\u2019s got it bad. Teachers are letting it slide for the moment since he\u2019s normally such a good student.\u201d Smiling at the way she walked close enough to him that their bodies occasionally brushed, much as courting wolves walked in the wild, he drew in the scent of her skin\u2014which now carried his own so deep and true, there\u2019d be no more talk of it fading.</p><p>Indigo shot him a warning glance when they headed out of the infirmary after visiting Silvia. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the outside run with the novices today. Riaz is helping me.\u201d</p><p>His wolf snarled, but Andrew wasn\u2019t stupid. She was waiting to see what he\u2019d do. Maybe it would\u2019ve been better to pretend he didn\u2019t still want Riaz\u2019s blood, but he wasn\u2019t about to lie to the woman he wanted by his side forever. Showing her his teeth, he said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m not in the vicinity.\u201d</p><p>Indigo paused in the corridor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He let his wolf rise to the surface. \u201cWe both know who and what I am. Therefore, we both also know I don\u2019t think too straight when another male is near the woman I consider mine.

Because, though strong, that bond wasn\u2019t yet set in stone. \u201cI might be able to rework things, come back to the den on a more regular basis.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s gaze was dark when she looked at him. \u201cWhat you do, it\u2019s important, Drew. Don\u2019t shortchange the pack because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He kissed her this time. \u201cYou make me happy. A happy Andrew is a more productive Andrew.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo rolled her eyes. \u201cWhen was the last time you lost an argument?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to think about it. Then, leaning down, he whispered in her ear, \u201cA few hours ago when you refused to stop the car and crawl into the backseat with me.\u201d</p><p>Not long afterward, Andrew stared at his alpha as they stood looking down over a beautiful green valley. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Hawke raised an eyebrow. \u201cNot quite the reaction I was hoping for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little unexpected, that\u2019s all.\u201d He took a moment to think about the proposal. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam likes you,\u201d Hawke said, naming the leader of the WindHaven falcons as he leaned against a large fir, his hair almost pure silver in this light. But it wasn\u2019t a silver that shouted of age\u2014no, it was the silver of precious metals, unique and startling. Especially given the other man\u2019s wolf-pale eyes. \u201cYou okay with taking it on?\u201d</p> <p>Looking away from his alpha, Andrew paced to the edge of the cliff. \u201cSure. I mean, I\u2019ve got no problem acting as liaison with the falcons, but won\u2019t Adam be talking to you directly on most matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big things, yes,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cBut, as with DarkRiver, there are going to be matters that don\u2019t need an alpha\u2019s attention, but do need to be looked at by someone senior.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded. As alpha, Hawke had a thousand things on his plate. Delegation of some responsibility was key not only to his own sanity, but to ensuring the health of his pack; that many strong wolves with nothing to do would be a recipe for disaster. \u201cWhy not ask one of the lieutenants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all got heavy responsibilities already . . . and we both know you could be a lieutenant if you wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do what I do if I was.\u201d He needed to be seen as approachable by even their weakest and least confident, not someone who was automatically identified as part of the pack\u2019s power structure.</p><p>\u201cIt would make your relationship with Indigo easier,\u201d Hawke said, and Andrew knew it was a question.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t. The basic issues would remain.\u201d His age, the fact of her higher dominance. \u201cOut of curiosity\u2014when did I hit your radar as a possible lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew you had it in you,\u201d Hawke said, surprising him. \u201cThat\u2019s why I originally had you stationed as the sector leader in San Diego, and you more than delivered. Your work over the past ten months has only been the icing on the cake. But I\u2019m ruthless when it comes to the pack. You were useful to me exactly where you were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, ruthless?\u201d Andrew put a hand on his chest, feigning a heart attack.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s grin was sharp. \u201cAdam says the liaison on their side will be Jacques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him. He\u2019s okay.\u201d A little quiet, but after growing up with Riley, Andrew could deal with that fine. You just had to poke at the quiet ones until they spoke up. \u201cWho\u2019re the cats using as their liaison?\u201d Because Andrew would have to work with him or her.</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d Hawke said, naming the most senior of DarkRiver\u2019s sentinels.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably set up a meeting to nut out some basics.\u201d Pushing his hands into the pockets of his jeans, he rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019ll try and hook us all up for a quick comm-conference when I get back to the den.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded and pushed off the tree. \u201cI\u2019m going to run up to the northern edge, see how things are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny further indications of Psy interference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And the techs have found no other buried objects of any kind.\u201d Deep grooves appeared on either side of Hawke\u2019s mouth. \u201cBut Judd called with some information last night. He\u2019s heard whispers that suggest Henry Scott wanted\u2014still wants\u2014our land to use as a staging post for an armed take-over of the entire city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t they be too far, physically speaking?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but evidence indicates they have several teleport-capable telekinetics in their group.\u201d</p><p>Andrew thought about it. \u201cYeah, that could have worked.\u201d SnowDancer land was remote enough that any invading army wouldn\u2019t be immediately noted from the city. \u201cEspecially if they\u2019re considering surgical strikes, rather than a full assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really need to start sitting in on the lieutenant meetings,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cSince intel is your job.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded. When he\u2019d first taken on this position, it had only been about keeping a finger on the pulse of the pack, but the network he\u2019d constructed now meant information of all kinds flowed through to him. \u201cI\u2019ll have Indy give me a heads-up before the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hawke reached down to pet a wild wolf that appeared out of the trees. \u201cJudd found something else, too\u2014looks like Pure Psy has commandeered a remote mountain village to use as its gathering place for arms and supplies, and as a training ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he recommend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving the operation in place. He says he can keep an eye on them\u2014and it\u2019s better to know where the vipers are hiding.\u201d Hawke\u2019s face was without mercy when he looked up. \u201cThat way, we can hit them hard if the Scotts do move to strike against the city, disabling a large part of their strength at a critical time.\u201d</p><p>Dismissing the group of her people that she\u2019d brought outside for a meeting on how best to cover\u2014in the long term\u2014the wider patrol area necessitated by the Psy incursions, Indigo picked up a bracelet that had slipped off someone\u2019s wrist and was about to head back up to the den herself when she caught an unexpected\u2014but not unknown\u2014scent on the wind. Her wolf was already crouching to leap in welcome when Matthias walked into the clearing. Giving a whoop, she flew into his arms, wrapping her legs around his hips.</p><p>Not many men could\u2019ve stood firm against the impact of her welcome, but since Matthias was built like a tank, he just caught her, giving her one of those small, quiet smiles that had fooled many a woman into thinking him shy. Half an hour after that and most of those women had probably found themselves sprawled naked under him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d she asked after giving him an affectionate kiss.</p><p>Eyes as dark as mountain skies at midnight met hers as he squeezed the arm he had around her hips. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing some mighty surprising rumors about you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Arching an eyebrow, she unhooked herself from his body and took enough of a step back that she could look up into his face.</p><p>Matthias wasn\u2019t only built like a tank, he was taller than every other male in the pack, coming to something like six feet six. All of which would\u2019ve made him a threatening-looking package but for that amazing face; a haunting mixture of Spain, the Far East, and the warm dark of his mother\u2019s home-land of Tanzania, it had a way of making people forget just how lethal he could be.</p><p>But Indigo had known him too long to be bamboozled\u2014and right now, she was very aware of the teasing light in those eyes of liquid night. \u201cAnd what exactly,\u201d she drawled, \u201chave you been hearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about you setting up house with Riley\u2019s baby brother.\u201d</p><p>She knew it was a deliberate dig, meant to get her to give up information, so she plastered an innocent expression on her face. \u201cReally? How interesting.\u201d The hairs on the back of her neck rose at that moment, and she suddenly realized she could scent another male getting ever closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Matthias said even as she was turning on her heel, \u201cso I thought I better come on over and make sure you hadn\u2019t forgotten who you belonged to.\u201d</p><p>A growl of rage filled the air an instant before Drew\u2019s body slammed out of the forest and into Matthias\u2019s, taking the male lieutenant down to the ground.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Indigo muttered as Matthias retaliated instinctively, one of those massive fists clocking Drew in the ribs.</p><p>Shaking off the blow as if he hadn\u2019t even felt it, Drew slammed a punch into Matthias\u2019s face, snapping it back. Matthias snarled and shoved Drew off his chest. Except Drew didn\u2019t budge, crunching another fist into the other man\u2019s jaw. This time, Matthias responded with a similar hit.</p><p>Indigo, having watched for a gap, jumped in between the two men as they flowed to their feet. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes were wolf-copper when she looked up at him, and they were focused on Matthias. Who was doing a good job of imitating a wolf in human form. \u201cGet out of my way, Indigo,\u201d the big lieutenant snarled.</p><p>Drew\u2019s body vibrated against her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t give her orders!\u201d Reaching as if to pull her behind him, Drew sucked in a breath when she elbowed him sharply in the stomach at the same time that she kicked Matthias in the knee. He was too big to go down, but it did snap his attention to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she said, speaking to both of them. \u201cMatthias, I need you to go to the den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuc\u2014\u201d Matthias froze, blinked, and suddenly he was human again. \u201cAw, shit.\u201d</p><p>Indigo stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d expected to have to deal with his considerable sleeping volcano of a temper . . . except that it looked like he was going to apologize. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Matthias continued to look at Drew. \u201cI was only kidding, man, you know that. I\u2019d never have said it if I\u2019d known.\u201d</p> <p>Drew was still growling low in his throat, his eyes that strange, fascinating copper. They tracked Matthias with unrelenting focus as the other man began to back off toward the den, rubbing at his bruised jaw with one hand.</p><p>\u201cMatthias,\u201d Indigo snapped. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew gripped the back of her neck, his mouth suddenly at her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Snarling, she was about to turn her own temper on him when the pieces fell into place with dizzying suddenness. Yes, Drew was dominant. Yes, Drew had a temper\u2014one he was usually very good at hiding. But Drew was also very, very smart. He\u2019d never have come out at a bigger, stronger opponent the way he had unless he\u2019d been driven by something other than logic and reason.</p><p>Barely aware of Matthias disappearing into the trees, she put her hand on Drew\u2019s chest. \u201cAndrew,\u201d she said in a calm, rational tone, \u201clet me go or I\u2019ll make spaghetti out of your insides.\u201d</p> <p>His hand still around her nape, he bent his head until his eyes were staring into hers\u2014dominant, primitive, and devoid of civilized thought. It didn\u2019t surprise her in the least when he growled and sank his teeth into the tender curve where her neck met her shoulder.</p><p>Hissing out a breath, she clenched one hand in his hair. Rational obviously was not going to work. In any other situation, her wolf would have gone for blood. But this wasn\u2019t any other situation. This wasn\u2019t any other man.</p><p>He\u2019d bent for her more than once.</p><p>So today, she bent for him.</p><p>Letting her body soften in welcome, she held his head against her while she shoved her free hand under his T-shirt to lie on the heated skin of his back. Skin privileges. He didn\u2019t change position for several seconds. When she didn\u2019t move either, except to stroke her hand over his back, he finally released the grip he had on her with his teeth, laving his tongue over the small hurt even as his arms came around her in a much gentler\u2014though no less possessive\u2014hold.</p><p>His lips on her neck, over her cheek, on her lips.</p> <p>She groaned as he demanded she open her mouth, and gave in. Hard and hot and deep, the kiss could have only one conclusion. She didn\u2019t stop him when he ripped away her T-shirt to expose the sports bra she wore underneath, cried out when he broke the kiss to take her right nipple into his mouth through the soft fabric, his hand covering the mound of her neglected breast, fondling and teasing.</p><p>He\u2019d never stopped growling low in his throat, but now that growl became more a quiet rumble than a roar. She was ready when he pushed her down to the earth, ready when he lifted his head and kissed her again, ready when his hand stroked and petted her body with rough promise.</p><p>What she wasn\u2019t ready for was for him to raise his head and give her a dazed look. \u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>She closed her hands over the taut muscle silk of his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, tugging him back down.</p><p>But he resisted, shaking his head as he knelt to straddle her body. A blink, and when he looked at her again, his eyes were the blue of Sierra lakes in sunshine once more. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d He touched the bite mark with careful fingers.</p><p>She pushed herself up on her elbows, unable to go any farther\u2014he\u2019d trapped her lower body with his own. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve clawed you more than a few times during sex and you don\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d A thunderous scowl.</p><p>Once, her response would\u2019ve been anger . . . but being with Drew had changed something in her, taught her that laughter could be as powerful as fury. \u201cBecause it\u2019s okay for you to be a show-off but not me?\u201d</p> <p>Putting his hands palms down on either side of her, he glowered. \u201cA male doesn\u2019t hurt his mate.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The reason her gorgeous, generous, laughing lover had turned into a crazed beast without warning.</p><p>The words seemed to penetrate his mind at the same moment. \u201cWe\u2019re in the mating dance.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for several long minutes. Then Drew began to smile, his eyes shifting from blue to copper and back again. \u201cWe\u2019re in the mating dance.\u201d</p><p>Falling back onto the earth, she poked him in the chest. \u201cDon\u2019t look so satisfied. Just because we\u2019re in the dance doesn\u2019t mean my wolf will accept the mating itself.\u201d Exhilaration raced through her, along with a healthy dose of panic.</p><p>Andrew, able to think again now that the red haze of jealous rage was no longer clouding his judgment, looked down into those stunning eyes, saw the wolf prowling beyond, and knew he\u2019d have to walk carefully. He\u2019d courted her, played with her, and won her. But now the stakes had changed again, become much, much higher. Because there was no \u201cout\u201d once wolves mated\u2014it was for life.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he murmured, changing position so that his legs tangled with hers, though he kept his upper body braced on his forearms. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll just have to seduce your wolf into it.\u201d</p><p>She stroked her hands across his shoulders to curve over his nape. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you know?\u201d she asked, her hold possessive in a way that made his own wolf sing. \u201cThe male always knows when the dance begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I headed out to see you\u2014I felt it kick in without warning.\u201d It had been a shock to his system, a joy he\u2019d never expected, and he hadn\u2019t even thought about not sharing it with Indigo, whatever the consequences. \u201cThen I reached here and heard what Matthias was saying and smelled your scent mixed with his and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaboom,\u201d Indigo completed with a laugh. \u201cWell, now we know one thing\u2014Matthias can be taken down if you hit him hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wolf growled in pride. \u201cI was feeling no pain. I can\u2019t actually remember most of it\u2014ouch!\u201d he cried as Indigo poked gently at his side.</p><p>She winced. \u201cSorry. Let me look.\u201d</p><p>Bracing his weight on his opposite side, he allowed her to tug up his T-shirt. Angling her head, she winced again. \u201cI think he probably broke your ribs. The bruise is already forming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth it,\u201d he said, nuzzling his nose against hers as she petted the hurt spot with a tender touch. \u201cWhen are you going to mate with me?\u201d</p><p>She nipped his jaw. \u201cWhen you convince me it\u2019s worth my while.\u201d</p><p>Dipping his head into her neck, he kissed the bite mark and hid his smile against her skin.</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t pulled back, hadn\u2019t pulled away. He\u2019d been half-terrified that she would, that all they\u2019d achieved would be buried under her wolf\u2019s savage refusal to surrender to that depth of vulnerability. Instead, that wolf had looked out of her eyes with pure challenge a moment ago. Catch me, it had said, catch me and maybe I\u2019ll be yours.</p><p>Dressing for work the next day\u2014and given that she wouldn\u2019t be doing any physical training\u2014Indigo pulled on a pair of jeans that fit her like a second skin and sat easily on her hips, her favorite boots, and a black tee with a respectable scoop neck. When she pulled her hair off her face and into her usual ponytail, the bite mark on the lower curve of her neck stood out like a beacon.</p><p>Smiling, she finished getting ready, throwing on a hip-length leather-synth jacket as a final touch. She was about to head out when she hesitated. She wasn\u2019t bothered by the mark\u2014her wolf actually approved of the aggressive way Drew had reacted to what he\u2019d read as a threat to his claim over his mate. But Drew was still beating himself up over it. Every time he saw the mark, he got a black look on his face.</p><p>She could cover it up . . . but her wolf rejected the idea. This was who she was, and if the man who wanted to be her mate didn\u2019t know that by now, well, she\u2019d have to beat him over the head with the truth until he got it.</p><p>Scowling at the thought, she wrenched open her door and stalked out.</p><p>The first packmate who came upon her stared at the mark until she had to growl at him. Raising his hands, he walked off . . . but not before she\u2019d caught the startled look on his face. She saw that same look everywhere, until it began to make her skin itch. Yeah, she could understand a bit of surprise, but usually it\u2019d have been teamed with catcalls and teasing suggestions for revenge.</p><p>Today, nothing.</p><p>She cornered Hawke in his room before he\u2019d even had his first cup of coffee, his jeans hanging perilously low on lean hips. When he blinked drowsily at her, she pushed past him, folded her arms, and started to rant about the over-the-top reaction. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me, so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head as if snapping himself awake, Hawke pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cThe mark is very precise,\u201d he said, his eyes on the flesh of her neck. \u201cNo rips, no tears. Means you didn\u2019t struggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asked, knowing she sounded belligerent but too annoyed to care.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Indigo,\u201d Hawke murmured. \u201cFor you to have allowed this means something, and the pack understands that.\u201d</p><p>Scowling because she still didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, she unfolded her arms and said, \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t hassle Drew about it.\u201d</p><p>A look in his eyes she didn\u2019t trust\u2014it was too sneaky. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about Drew.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019d worry about how he\u2019s planning to win the mating dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Indigo knew Drew very well by now. She was ready for his tricks. Raising her hand, she straightened Hawke\u2019s thick hair with the familiarity of a long and deep friendship. \u201cYou need to go have sex.\u201d</p><p>Hawke blinked, then stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI can sense your wolf straining at the reins, almost feel its hunger.

In truth, there were very, very few \u201cperfect\u201d Psy in the Net, and now they all knew, thanks to Nikita\u2019s careful whispers, that Henry found them dispensable. \u201cThe populace has reacted unfavorably to his attempts at intimidating them away from this region.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kaleb?\u201d Anthony asked. \u201cThere is a high chance he\u2019ll seize control of the Arrows.\u201d</p><p>One Arrow was worth dozens of ordinary soldiers, but\u2014\u201cAsking Kaleb for assistance has to be a last-case scenario.\u201d Because it was highly likely he\u2019d walk in and capture the city himself. \u201cThere is one more option.\u201d If they took it, it would shift the balance of power in the world forever.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p> <p>Two days after the beginning of the mating dance, Indigo found herself standing on a ridge along the northern edge of their territory thanks to a report from Judd. The other lieutenant had somehow managed to \u201clisten in\u201d on a meeting between two high-level people in Pure Psy, and had come out with a disturbing account of their confidence in being able to take SnowDancer whenever they chose.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else on the land that we haven\u2019t found,\u201d he\u2019d said in his last message, \u201csomething they\u2019re certain will give them an insurmountable tactical advantage.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had immediately prioritized the task, placing Indigo in charge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve swept this area, and other outlying areas, several times since the transmitters were originally discovered,\u201d Indigo now said to Riaz and Elias, both of whom stood with her, \u201cand got nothing. So what are we missing?\u201d Even now, the techs spread out below them like an army of ants, but she could tell they were discouraged.</p><p>\u201cChance the Psy penetrated deeper into regions we haven\u2019t checked?\u201d Riaz asked.</p><p>Elias was the one who answered. \u201cAsk me, zero percent. We\u2019re too unpredictable in those areas. An adult wolf could decide to go for a run at any time, night or day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Eli. The isolated sections are the only parts where they would\u2019ve been sure of having an uninterrupted stretch of time.\u201d Letting her wolf rise to the surface, its vision more acute, Indigo focused in the distance\u2014to see a heavily muscled wolf with fur the rich color of silver-birch bark loping up toward her. Her lips curved.</p><p>\u201cDo we need to disappear?\u201d Elias asked with a cough that struck her as suspicious.</p> <p>When Indigo raised an eyebrow at him, he winked. \u201cDrew\u2019s style of courtship seems to involve pulling you into as many shadowy corners as he can.\u201d</p><p>Riaz snickered.</p><p>She decided to handle the ribbing with grace. \u201cDidn\u2019t you once get caught butt naked with Yuki?\u201d she asked Elias. \u201cWeren\u2019t you covered in chocolate sauce at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuddup.\u201d Elias folded his arms. \u201cAnd for your information, it was honey.\u201d</p><p>Riaz was doubled over by now, and though his hilarity was partly at her expense, Indigo\u2019s wolf was glad to see him, if not happy, then at least able to find some joy. Turning to watch as Drew crested the final hill to circle around and stand beside her, she stroked her fingers over that proud head.</p><p>Having recovered from his fit of laughter, Riaz pointed to a small valley to the west. \u201cThey could\u2019ve hidden something there. We haven\u2019t paid much attention to that area because it\u2019s so flood prone.\u201d</p><p>Indigo, her wolf rubbing contentedly inside her skin as Drew leaned his weight against her, nodded. \u201cThe four of us are free right now. We can borrow a couple of scanners and go have a preliminary look.\u201d But when she glanced down into Drew\u2019s copper gaze, she saw disagreement. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>\u201cAre you rolling your eyes?\u201d Her wolf was miffed.</p><p>A long sigh, and then he looked up again. Pointedly.</p><p>Indigo followed his gaze. \u201cEli, Riaz, am I blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Riaz\u2019s deep voice. \u201cI see sky and tree branches same as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I spotted a squirrel,\u201d Elias put in.</p><p>This time, they all turned to look at Drew.</p><p>If a wolf could be said to look exasperated, he did.</p><p>About to ask him to shift and explain himself, she saw his head snap toward the sky, his gaze following something.</p><p>A goshawk, its wings spread in a wash of blue-gray and white as it swept down to grab its hapless prey in powerful claws before rising.</p><p>Into the sky.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d Indigo breathed. \u201cWe\u2019re creatures of the earth\u2014we rarely look up.\u201d</p><p>Drew gave a short bark to indicate she\u2019d got it. Going to her knees beside this wolf who was able to see the world through so many different lenses, she clenched her fingers in the fur at the ruff of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll get the techs to scanning, but I need you to find me some cats.\u201d The leopards were much more arboreal than SnowDancers, could search in a way the wolves couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou know who\u2019ll be good at this.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, glancing at Riaz.</p><p>She rubbed her cheek against his fur, conscious the mating dance had to be playing havoc with his instincts. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Though it was clear the wolf was in no way pleased, he went. Rising to her feet, she glanced at a silent Riaz. He shook his head. \u201cDamn, but his control must be good.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the large silver wolf disappear from sight, she realized Riaz was absolutely right. At that same moment, she understood that Drew had followed her request for one reason only\u2014because he\u2019d promised her he\u2019d never again do anything that would lead anyone to question her rank.</p><p>Comprehending as it did the compulsions of the mating dance, her wolf was staggered by the fact that he\u2019d remembered his promise even now.</p><p>One more barrier fell.</p><p>Bringing in the cats turned out to be a wise decision. Drew had rounded up several of the nimble, curious, and energetic juveniles and young adults. Among them, Kit\u2014who was as gorgeous in leopard form as he was in human.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Sienna\u2019s maybe-boyfriend who found it, but a sleek little leopard named Grey. \u201cMercy\u2019s youngest brother,\u201d Indigo said to Riaz as Grey ran over and, having got their attention, led them back to a gnarled old tree.</p><p>It took him one lunge and two seconds to scale it.</p><p>Releasing her claws, Indigo followed a little more slowly. Once in the lee of the branches, she watched as Grey jumped up to a higher branch and pointed a paw to the one below. Balancing carefully, she walked over to the spot he\u2019d indicated. For an instant, she saw nothing\u2014and then she did. \u201cShit.\u201d The camouflage was brilliant, the piece of technology blending so well into the leaves that she was astounded Grey had spotted it.</p><p>Looking down, she saw Drew had followed her scent. \u201cBren,\u201d she said.</p><p>He left at once to track down his sister, who\u2019d come up to help sweep the area. When Brenna saw the device, she hissed out a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a camera,\u201d she said, removing the battery at once. \u201cShort-range transmission capacity\u2014more than enough if you had a receiver just beyond the edge of our territory.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s blood ran cold, but she had no time to worry about the devastating impact the surveillance could\u2019ve had. Not right now. \u201cGrey,\u201d she said, jumping onto the ground beside Mercy\u2019s brother, \u201ccan you explain to the others how you found it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes a crystal clear blue-green amid the gold and black of his fur.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>With the cats helping\u2014more arriving as word spread\u2014and the techs climbing through the trees as best they could, they found fifteen more cameras in the area by nightfall, along with one larger object that Brenna determined acted as a signal booster.</p><p>\u201cNo way to know how far they\u2019re spread out,\u201d Indigo reported to Hawke that night. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to sweep the entire compromised section\u2014and while it remains a low-probability target, we should check the snowpack areas, too. I\u2019ve already rejigged our schedules, but we\u2019re going to continue to need the cats\u2019 help.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed her alpha\u2019s mouth, but his words were calm. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lucas.\u201d He met her gaze. \u201cThey were watching our sentries, learning our patterns.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was Indigo\u2019s take as well. \u201cJudd\u2019s intel was on the money. No one goes to this much trouble unless they\u2019re planning to launch a major offensive.\u201d Though, she\u2019d been thinking . . . \u201cIf I were a Councilor who wanted to take SnowDancer, I\u2019d go after you first.\u201d The pack had one weakness and perhaps, just perhaps, Henry Scott had figured it out.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s eyes were chips of ice by now. \u201cRiley, you, or Cooper could step into the breach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019d be constantly challenged. It would take us months to fend off the challengers, and it\u2019d leave the pack in disarray.\u201d No one challenged Hawke because he\u2019d proven himself, been bathed in blood for the pack.</p> <p>\u201cEven if I am a target,\u201d he said, \u201cthis kind of planning goes beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They undeniably want what we hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to kill every last SnowDancer to get it.\u201d</p><p>Exhausted by the events of the day, Indigo should\u2019ve gone to her room and crashed in readiness for the next day\u2019s exertions. But Drew was waiting for her when she turned the corner, his eyes solemn but his words light. \u201cMassage and a slice of white chocolate g\u00e2teau with fresh cherries?\u201d</p><p>Which was how she found herself naked in his bed not much later.</p> <p>Head on his chest, she stroked him as they spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t want the pack to go through what we did all those years ago,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI can\u2019t forget the blood, the loss.\u201d</p><p>Drew ran his hand down her back. \u201cI was younger, but I remember parts of it. My parents were lost in the first wave of trouble, only a couple of years earlier.\u201d</p><p>Hugging him tight, she took a moment to appreciate just how very good it felt to lie with him, to discuss their day. She couldn\u2019t imagine being this comfortable with anyone else. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for getting the cats.\u201d For following her orders no matter the possessive drive that had to be pushing him close to insanity these days.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to kill Riaz later, when you\u2019re not watching.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting up, she looked into his eyes. \u201cI want you to know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo serious.\u201d He brushed strands of hair off her face. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am ever talking out of my ass, I fully expect you to call me on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, Lieutenant.\u201d He tapped her bottom. \u201cI\u2019ll never let things slide.\u201d A more sober look. \u201cBut any arguing we do on pack issues won\u2019t be in front of others.\u201d</p><p>She knew that would be hard on him, predatory changeling male that he was. But the past weeks had shown her the staggering depth of his will. He\u2019d bite his tongue until it bled, but he would never again diminish her in public\u2014and would certainly never fail to back her up when she needed it, like Martin so often did with Adria.</p><p>And that, she decided with absolute finality, would be the last time she ever compared her man to her aunt\u2019s. Because Drew was a thousand times the man, the wolf, that Martin was. \u201cI thought there was cake,\u201d she said, tracing his lip with her fingertip.</p><p>He nipped at her. \u201cI would never lie to you about cake.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling at that pretty mouth, she said, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cIn the cooler. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she pushed off him. \u201cLet me replenish my energy first. You boy toys are exhausting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToys?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She winked at him as she jumped off the bed. \u201cI, of course, am only interested in my own personal boy toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said, stealing a kiss as he got out, too, and walked\u2014gloriously nude\u2014to the cooler.</p><p>\u201cHave you no shame?\u201d She tried her best to sound scandalized, difficult when the only thing she wanted to do was lick him all over.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Not as ready to eat naked, she went to Drew\u2019s dresser to pull out a T-shirt. \u201cSince somebody tore mine.\u201d Her glare had no effect on the gorgeous man who was currently chugging down milk straight from the carton.</p><p>Wiping his mouth, he put down the milk and crooked a finger. \u201cCome \u2019ere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2014\u201d Hand on a T-shirt, she frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Drew was suddenly beside her, trying to shut the drawer. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already pulled out the raggedy soft toy. It was a bear, probably once a plush brown but now sadly bedraggled, most of its fur gone, one eye missing, and the ears nibbled half-off. Definitely in rough shape, but not uncared for, she realized, noticing the neat stitches that had mended the tears.</p><p>Aware Drew had gone silent beside her, she glanced up. And for the first time in her life, she saw a mask on Drew\u2019s face. It hit her like a punch to the gut.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, certain she\u2019d hurt him in some terrible way. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s hand slipped behind her neck to tug her to his chest. \u201cShh.\u201d The warmth had returned to his voice, the tone husky. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She stroked his back with her free hand, the bear between them. \u201cWe\u2019ll put it back until you are.\u201d It hurt her to know that he was hurting. Really hurt her.</p><p>Drew nuzzled at her neck. \u201cNo, I think Platypus is probably tired of being in that drawer.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cYou have a bear named Platypus?\u201d</p><p>A grin as he took the bear from her and ran his hands affectionately over the chewed-off ears. \u201cHey, I was a kid. How was I supposed to know what a platypus was?\u201d Walking to the bed, he sat down, tugging the sheet across just enough to cover the most distracting part of him. \u201cCome, sit.\u201d</p><p>Pulling on the T-shirt, she went to sit beside him, her legs curled under her. Still uncertain what she\u2019d inadvertently done, she put one hand on his shoulder, pressing her body a little against his. \u201cHe was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was small.\u201d</p><p>She saw him swallow, remembered how young he\u2019d been when he\u2019d lost both parents. Her own throat grew choked. \u201cYou were a feral little thing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she said past the knot of emotion, tugging at the bear\u2019s abbreviated ears.</p><p>Drew gave a small laugh, and the tightness in her chest relaxed. Her wolf didn\u2019t like seeing him in distress.</p><p>\u201cMy mom gave Platty to me.\u201d He brought the bear up to his nose, drew in a long breath. \u201cSometimes, I think I can scent her perfume if I try hard enough.\u201d</p><p>A tear threatened to streak its way down Indigo\u2019s cheek, but she blinked it back, knowing Drew needed her to listen today. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we were fostered in the pack,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cOur foster parents were good, really good to all three of us. They\u2019d brought up their own kids, understood exactly what we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t your parents.\u201d Indigo understood, knew that his foster parents\u2014who\u2019d both gone roaming around the world a few years ago\u2014would\u2019ve understood as well.</p><p>Drew surprised her by laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Riley would\u2019ve allowed them to take over.\u201d A sharp grin, full of affection. \u201cHe was the one we instinctively looked toward, as the oldest, and he never let us down. We loved our foster parents for the home they gave us, but we bonded the strongest with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me better understand the way Riley treats the two of you.\u201d Especially with Brenna, the other lieutenant was severely overprotective\u2014more like a father than a brother. He was less so with Drew, but there was still a hint of it in his dealings with his brother.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Holding Platypus in one hand, Drew put his other one on her thigh, his fingers stroking with an affection that she\u2019d long understood was as natural to him as breathing. \u201cYou know, part of the way he is, is because of the fact that he all but brought us up, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014part of it is just Riley,\u201d Indigo completed. \u201cI remember him as a kid, you know. So intense, so focused. If you needed to get something done in the kid circles, you went to either Hawke or Riley. Hawke to lead the trouble, and Riley to make sure we didn\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><p>Drew squeezed her thigh. \u201cI kept Platypus with me all through my childhood,\u201d he said, then gave a self-conscious shrug. \u201cWhen I turned into a teenager, I hid him in the cupboard, but I used to take him out at night sometimes and talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Shifting her hold, she hugged him around the shoulders, putting her face cheek-first against his back. \u201cIt was like being with your mom again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Drew stroked the bear\u2019s ragged ears once more. \u201cRiley and Brenna don\u2019t know I still have him.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf understood what he was telling her, accepted the gift. \u201cI think he\u2019d look good on top of the dresser,\u201d she murmured, pressing a kiss to his nape. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Drew thought about it for a long second before lifting her hand up to his lips and rising to place Platypus in pride of place on the polished wood of his dresser. There was a vulnerability to him she could almost touch\u2014and she knew he was embarrassed by it. Yet still he\u2019d shared so much of his heart. It humbled her, his courage.</p><p>And it pushed her to the precipice of accepting the mating bond.</p><p>Her remaining hesitation had nothing to do with his youth or dominance. It was far more visceral. Her wolf adored Drew now, but used to control, to protecting itself, it was uneasy at the idea of the total, absolute surrender signified by the mating bond. Yet in spite of that, it found itself compelled to the edge by Drew\u2019s open commitment, by the fearless way he grabbed onto life . . . onto love.</p><p>Andrew could almost taste the mating bond the next morning as he worked beside Indigo to clear the northern edge of their territory of surveillance devices. It was serious work\u2014but he was a wolf. \u201cHey, Indy,\u201d he said around midmorning, feeling a little raw after the previous night. But because it had been his mate who\u2019d seen him so very vulnerable, he was able to deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo more kisses,\u201d she warned with a scowl that he knew was all pretend. \u201cPeople are placing bets now on how long till you ambush me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for morale.\u201d</p><p>Indigo shot him a narrow-eyed look. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sneak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFringe benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like kissing you.\u201d In front of people. So everyone would know she was his. \u201cBut this time I wanted to tell you that you have something in your hair.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, she stroked over and stopped at her hair tie. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d A chocolate kiss sat in her hand.</p><p>He waited for her reaction.</p><p>Holding his gaze, she peeled away the silver wrapper and closed her lips over it in a way designed to make a certain part of his anatomy throb. \u201cDelicious.\u201d Licking her lips, she pointed south. \u201cTime to work.\u201d</p><p>He worked, but by the time Indigo left to return to the den to take one of her classes\u2014they couldn\u2019t afford to be slack on that, especially now\u2014he\u2019d kissed her on the lips five more times and showered her with several hidden candy kisses.</p> <p>A few were found by gleeful packmates, who solemnly delivered them to Indigo . . . who just as solemnly accepted each offering. His wolf was pleased with this day\u2019s work.</p><p>Tai came up to him after Indigo left. \u201cTeach me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtship. Because, from the smile on Indigo\u2019s face, you\u2019re really good at it.\u201d</p><p>Andrew thought of last night, of the power of the emotions that had passed between them. She\u2019d opened her arms to him when he\u2019d returned to the bed, and he\u2019d felt her wolf\u2019s presence in every atom of her being as they lay intertwined. It had been a stunning intimacy, but\u2014\u201cShe hasn\u2019t accepted the mating yet.\u201d You could never, ever be certain of a dominant female\u2019s choice until that moment.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m only a novice, but I think that\u2019s because female wolves like to run their men ragged.\u201d A scowl. \u201cAnd because she\u2019s having too much fun playing with you.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew was still thinking over Tai\u2019s words as he entered his room that night, having spent all day with the search team. They\u2019d discovered only one other camera, but they weren\u2019t going to let up. The bloody things were so small and cunningly camouflaged that they could be easily overlooked.</p><p>Frowning, he stopped on the way to the shower.</p><p>There was something wrong with the room, but he couldn\u2019t put a finger on it. Shucking his clothes, he washed, then walked out. He still couldn\u2019t figure out what was different . . . until he went to grab a pair of sweatpants from the dresser.</p><p>A laugh escaped him.</p><p>Platypus had been given an eye patch embroidered with a skull and crossbones.</p><p>Picking up the little note under the bear\u2019s paw, he saw Indigo\u2019s scrawl: I think he looks rather dashing, don\u2019t you? Come sleep with me when you get back.</p><p>That was exactly what he did. \u201cWhen are you going to mate with me?\u201d he asked her in the midnight hours, as he slid into the melting heat of her body.</p><p>Her eyes, gone wolf-gold, gleamed in the darkness at him. \u201cWe\u2019re considering it.\u201d</p> <p>His own wolf bit back a grin of triumph, even as his heart expanded. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep with you every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound very certain.\u201d An edge of dominance.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am.\u201d Instead of snarling at her, he kissed her slow and easy. \u201cYou\u2019d miss me if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Her body arched up as he stopped his strokes. \u201cDrew.\u201d It was a warning.</p><p>But he was bigger and heavier, so he pinned her to the sheets. \u201cAdmit it.\u201d Kisses on her lips, nibbles on her jaw, licks on the line of her throat. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her body and almost managed to put him on his back. Laughing, he pinned her again. \u201cHey, you nearly broke a very important part of my anatomy in half.\u201d Unable to resist the slick heat of her, he began to move again, deep and hard.</p><p>Indigo fractured under him moments later, and he wasn\u2019t far behind. He realized she hadn\u2019t said what he\u2019d asked her to, hadn\u2019t admitted that vulnerability, and that worried him, because for the mating bond to snap into place, she had to open her soul to him.</p><p>No shields, no walls, no protections.</p><p>Still, he thought, cuddling her close, she was without a doubt taking an active part in the mating dance, and that was a very good sign. Patience, he counseled his wolf, just a little more patience.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>Councilor Henry Scott looked at the man he\u2019d put in charge of the SnowDancer operation. \u201cYou assured me they wouldn\u2019t uncover the surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have, but at the current pace, they\u2019ll have the entire area cleared within a week, two at most.\u201d</p><p>Henry shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on having that length of time. We need to act now.\u201d While they still maintained something of an element of surprise.</p><p>\u201cI have a team ready to go. When would you like us to mobilize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Focus on the primary target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Henry flicked up a second image. \u201cSend a couple of your men to remove him, too.\u201d There was no point in waiting, not when a dual assassination would have a much stronger impact.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>Early the next morning, her heart smiling at the way she\u2019d woken to find Drew sprawled all over her\u2014and the bed\u2014Indigo sat beside Joshua on the pebbled shore of the lake nearest the den.</p><p>The search for the cameras was ongoing in the mountains, with different men and women being rotated in each day, but she and Hawke had both agreed she needed to continue to work with their young. They didn\u2019t want to lose all the progress they\u2019d made to date.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asked the boy beside her, examining his expression, his posture, for any hint that he continued to have problems with his wolf.</p><p>A quick smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing better. Hawke\u2019s been keeping an eye on me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Indigo\u2019s wolf looked out at the boy, made a judgment. \u201cYour wolf is still very near the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Hawke said it\u2019s like that for some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should know.\u201d Hawke\u2019s own wolf was difficult to spot, because his eyes never changed color\u2014which, of course, was an answer in itself. \u201cBut he can control it. Has he been teaching you to handle your wolf when it gets pushy?\u201d</p><p>Joshua nodded. \u201cThe things you\u2019ve been teaching me\u2014about focus and discipline\u2014that\u2019s helping as well. I think I\u2019m coming to an understanding with my wolf.\u201d</p><p>That made Indigo relax, because the boy was talking of his wolf as a partner, not a combatant. \u201cI hear you\u2019re seeing Molly,\u201d she said, having made a few discreet inquiries after Drew hinted at it this morning.</p><p>Joshua\u2019s eyes went wide right before a hot flush burned across his cheekbones. \u201cJesus, Indigo, do you have spies everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Laughing at his embarrassment, she reached out to ruffle his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s good for you, puppy. And too good for you.\u201d</p><p>He bore the affection in silence but shot her a pleased look. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m keeping her anyway.\u201d Such a smug expression, she couldn\u2019t decide whether to laugh or growl. \u201cShe\u2019s much more mature than I am,\u201d he said bluntly, \u201cso calm and easy with her wolf.\u201d</p><p>Surprised at his insight, she looked at him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His shoulders were relaxed, his lips curved. \u201cMy wolf wants to please hers so much, it behaves . . . and I think we\u2019re both learning and becoming better from it.\u201d</p><p>It was such an astute comment that Indigo was silent for a while. Because she, too, understood about learning from another wolf.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Joshua said into the silence, \u201care you and Drew going to mate?\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s wolf flexed its claws. \u201cWhy exactly,\u201d she said, looking at the boy who was very much her subordinate, \u201cdo you feel you have the right to ask me that question?\u201d</p><p>Joshua winced at her tone. \u201cUm, never mind. I\u2019ll just go get a clue now.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf resheathed its claws. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your session tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d A pause as he got to his feet. \u201cAnd Indigo . . . thanks.\u201d</p><p>Indigo sat there staring at the water long after he left. Mate. She knew Drew was it for her, but the idea of taking that final step . . . it made her breath catch in her throat, her wolf pace from side to side within her mind.</p><p>\u201cIndigo!\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up to see Mercy scrambling down the bank. Dressed in a white peasant blouse embroidered with red roses around the deep neckline and faded jeans, the DarkRiver sentinel\u2019s freckles glowed against her creamy skin. Her red hair, in contrast, appeared lighter, shot with strands of blonde.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Indigo cried, rising to her feet and grabbing Mercy in a hug as the other woman reached the edge of the lake. Odd as it was, Mercy had somehow become one of her closest friends\u2014and even odder, the feeling seemed to be mutual. They were both the lone high-ranking female dominants in a group of men in this area, and it was damn nice to have someone to talk to who understood the unique issues they had to face.</p><p>Drawing back from the hug, Mercy said, \u201cJust now. Riley\u2019s talking with Drew and Hawke, but I caught your scent and decided to follow you down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to sit?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Mercy took a seat on the pebbles beside her, her gaze on the tranquil surface of the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d</p><p>Indigo shot her a glance. \u201cDo you think of SnowDancer territory as home, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere Riley is,\u201d Mercy said simply. \u201cWe stopped in at my parents\u2019, too, on the way up. Oh, and the DarkRiver building\u2014Dorian would\u2019ve never forgiven me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Indigo laughed and asked a question she\u2019d always wondered about. \u201cWhy did you and Dorian never . . . you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, it would\u2019ve been like sleeping with one of my brothers.\u201d Mercy shuddered. \u201cBut hey, I\u2019m not the one with all the hot news. You and Drew, huh? Riley told me he scented the mating dance.\u201d</p><p>Indigo blew out a breath, tried to keep her words light in spite of the chaos of emotion within her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened. He just sort of snuck up on me.\u201d</p><p>Mercy patted her on the shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s got sneaky down pat. But\u201d\u2014a pause\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s a damn powerful heart in there, Indigo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Swallowing, she glanced at Mercy\u2019s suddenly solemn face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Mercy,\u201d she said, admitting the truth to perhaps the only person who\u2019d truly understand.</p><p>Mercy didn\u2019t give her platitudes. Hooking her arms around her raised knees, she nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d she said with frank honesty, \u201cwhen you find yourself facing the one man who you know could cut through your defenses and lay you bare. Our animals don\u2019t like that, don\u2019t even like the idea of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat scared part of me wants to snarl at him until he decides I\u2019m not worth the effort,\u201d Indigo admitted. \u201cBut I know he\u2019d never leave\u2014and that makes me want to take his face in my hands and kiss the hell out of him.\u201d</p><p>Mercy snorted. \u201cThat sounds like the kind of response Drew would provoke.\u201d A pause, then the leopard sentinel said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should point this out, but . . . you do realize he\u2019s not at full strength yet.\u201d</p><p>Indigo whipped her head around so fast she got whiplash. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRiley told me that Drew has gained in strength, in dominance, every year since he reached adulthood, and he shows no signs of stopping.\u201d</p><p>Indigo had known that, vaguely\u2014but she\u2019d never really thought about the implications. \u201cHe could end up more dominant than me.\u201d Her wolf sat stunned.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Mercy played with a pebble. \u201cThat bother you?\u201d</p><p>Indigo opened her mouth to respond, closed it, thought about what she felt. \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to dealing with dominant men\u2014and Drew\u2019s plenty dominant now.\u201d She\u2019d learn and grow, as he would. \u201cWe\u2019ll work out our own balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you trust him, trust your relationship\u201d\u2014Mercy\u2019s hair lifted in the breeze as she turned to look at Indigo\u2014\u201cbut something\u2019s still holding you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing concrete, just . . .\u201d Indigo squeezed her arms around her knees. \u201cIt feels like standing on the edge of a cliff, knowing all it\u2019d take is one step to change everything forever.\u201d Terror and excitement and a wild, wild hunger churned within her.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Mercy said, \u201cit\u2019s so amazing when you give in and fall. If you can fight the panic, if you can fight your animal\u2019s instinctive need to protect you against that kind of vulnerability, the prize is something\u2014\u201d She shook her head, a catch in her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s my forever.\u201d</p><p>Indigo felt her own eyes burn at the simple truth in that statement. It was as well that she heard male voices that instant. Riley, Drew, and Hawke all appeared out of the forest a moment later and began to make their way down the incline.</p><p>Drew was laughing at something Riley had said, his face tilted toward his brother. It was an ordinary moment, on an ordinary day. He was simply being Drew, with his easy smile and his way of teasing that had his brother scowling and Hawke grinning. And she felt the most insane urge to rise up, press her lips to that jaw, and mark him.</p><p>Mine, her wolf murmured for the first time, he\u2019s mine.</p><p>Having left Indigo soon after his brother and Mercy\u2019s arrival, to go up and spend several hours in the search area\u2014while Indy briefed the honeymooners\u2014Andrew returned home just as daylight was fading to find Brenna haunting the entrance. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, baby sis?\u201d Hugging her, he pressed a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>She squeezed him tight. \u201cI got a message from Judd to say he was back in the city and heading up.\u201d</p><p>Moving aside, he stood with her by the entrance. \u201cHe too wiped out to do his \u2018thing\u2019? \u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded, leaning close enough to rest her cheek against his arm. \u201cHe found out some really disturbing stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Having seen Judd\u2019s earlier reports, Andrew could well believe that. \u201cI\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna threw him a teasing look. \u201cGo on, you\u2019re all but salivating to get your paws on Indigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I resent that remark.\u201d Leaning over to tug at her hair, he felt the wind shift to bring him a familiar scent. \u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Brenna was already gone, running out toward the scent that announced her mate was nearby. His wolf was happy for its sibling, but it wanted its own mate.</p><p>Brenna felt the rumble of the vehicle getting closer and guessed that Judd had picked up one of the cars the pack kept in the city. But she didn\u2019t stop running toward him, knowing he\u2019d sense her approach. And he did. The vehicle pulled off to the side of the track as she came around the corner, and her mate stepped out.</p><p>\u201cJudd!\u201d She flew into his arms, locking her own around his neck, her face buried in the warmth of his skin. Her wolf batted at his scent, delighted and drunk on the pleasure of his presence. Woman and wolf, they\u2019d both missed him until they couldn\u2019t breathe, though the mating bond had made things easier.</p><p>When he kissed the curve of her neck, his arms steel bands around her, she smiled and echoed the caress before pulling back enough that she could look at his face. \u201cBaby, you look exhausted,\u201d she said, noting the deep shadows under his eyes, the gaunt lines of his face. \u201cAre you close to flaming out?\u201d The last time he\u2019d looked this bad, he\u2019d been kicked into unconsciousness soon afterward, his power reserves wiped out.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Judd said, ducking his head as if he expected a severe talking-to.</p><p>\u201cYou need rest.\u201d She\u2019d yell at him later for not taking better care of himself. \u201cGet back in the car and let me drive us home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him when he refused to release her. \u201cSomeone has to be or you\u2019ll run yourself into the ground.\u201d Then, unable to resist, she cupped his face in her hands, his unshaven jaw rasping against her palms, and kissed him . . . and kissed him. Phantom fingers stroked intimately between her legs in time to the thrust of his tongue in her mouth and she gasped. \u201cStop that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re running on empty as it is.\u201d</p><p>He used his telekinesis to caress her once more before the sensation faded. \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re right. I can feel my brain shutting down.\u201d</p><p>That decided it. She bullied her much bigger and stronger mate into the car and took them home. He insisted on a shower, but she made sure it was a quick one, pulling back the sheets so he could fall facedown on the futon after doing a haphazard job of drying himself. Picking up the towel he\u2019d dropped on the floor, she rubbed it over his hair as he turned his face sideways on the pillow, his strong body sprawled naked across the bedding.</p><p>Her own body shimmered with flame at the temptation of him, and she couldn\u2019t resist running the towel slowly over the sweep of his back and lower, patting him dry with loving motions. \u201cSleep,\u201d she murmured, kissing the soft skin behind his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you when you wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d It was an almost soundless request as sleep sucked him under, but she had no intention of doing anything else. Shucking off her clothes after putting away the towel, she crawled into bed beside her mate. Though he was lost in deepest sleep by then, he reached out and hauled her against the heat of his body.</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d left the den, she closed her eyes and fell into true, deep sleep.</p><p>Andrew had managed to corner Indigo in her office and was demanding a kiss in exchange for the little fossil he\u2019d picked up for her when her cell phone started beeping in what he knew as the emergency code. He stood back as she took the call.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked after she hung up.</p><p>\u201cSigns of Psy incursion in an entirely different location from where we\u2019ve got most of our people,\u201d Indigo said, leaving the office at a jog. \u201cEquipment, scent of explosives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we redirect our soldiers to that area?\u201d he asked as he went with her to find Hawke.</p><p>She shook her head, told him the position of the site. \u201cThe terrain means we have a better chance of reaching it faster from here.\u201d They walked into a small training room to find Hawke sparring hand to hand with a sweating Harley.</p><p>Dismissing the boy when he saw Indigo, Hawke came to join them. His wolf was in his voice by the time Indigo finished speaking, but his orders were cool, intelligent. \u201cPrep a team. We won\u2019t let them push us into responding half-assed, but neither are we going to sit back while they play games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap,\u201d Indigo said, voicing what Andrew was thinking. \u201cNo question about it. They probably chose that location because they still have cameras there. They\u2019ll be able to confirm if you\u2019re with us before they strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to stay behind?\u201d A soft question.</p><p>Andrew stepped up beside Indigo. \u201cThey can\u2019t assassinate you if you\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think the pack will take the knowledge that I sat here safe while my people walked into danger?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Andrew looked at Indigo, saw the same realization on her face. Hawke\u2019s lack of participation would do as much damage as his being hurt.</p><p>After that, it took only twenty minutes to put together a team. Indigo, Andrew, D\u2019Arn, Riaz, and six other soldiers would go with Hawke, while Riley would organize a team to protect the den just in case. \u201cWhere\u2019s Judd?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d Indigo answered, \u201cbut that\u2019s as well. We can\u2019t risk exposing him\u2014not unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d As far as the rest of the world\u2014especially the PsyNet\u2014was concerned, the entire Lauren family was long dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley gave a swift nod. \u201cI\u2019ve let Mercy know what\u2019s happening. She\u2019ll get the word out to the cats that there might be trouble in the city, too.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing high-powered weapons, they streamed out of the den and toward the area that looked to be the focal point of activity. The three SnowDancer sentries who\u2019d detected the intrusion were already in position.</p><p>But the Psy had learned from their earlier mistakes when coming up against keen changeling senses. They teleported in just as the changeling group began to crest a rise at least a ten-minute walk from the site of the reported incursion.</p> <p>The black-garbed men were shooting with high-impact projectile weapons as they appeared, the bullets designed to hit hard and splinter inside the body, ensuring the shrapnel would ricochet within walls of flesh, causing severe organ damage.</p><p>The SnowDancer group was directly in the line of fire.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>\u201cDown!\u201d Hawke\u2019s call came as he twisted out of the way of a bullet, slamming D\u2019Arn out of the way of another.</p><p>No one was hit in the first volley as they used bursts of changeling speed to find cover, but Andrew felt a hard punch across his mind an instant later. His natural mental shield protected him from brain damage, but his ears rang\u2014and he knew the shield wouldn\u2019t protect him if the Psy paused long enough to concentrate the blast of telepathic power.</p> <p>Which meant the changelings couldn\u2019t allow them time to focus.</p><p>Leaving the sharpshooting to the marksmen in the group, Andrew circled out and around the Psy in the early evening gloom, sensing more than seeing two other SnowDancers melt away into the forest to do likewise. The Psy spun around, attempting to pick them off in the trees. But this was wolf territory, and Andrew didn\u2019t even need to look to see where he was going.</p><p>Not bothering to strip, he shifted into wolf form. And waited. When the Psy who\u2019d trained his gun on the trees finally decided he\u2019d killed what awaited within and turned, Andrew made his move, streaking out to sink his teeth into the man\u2019s throat. He\u2019d ripped out that throat and was gone before the Psy\u2019s colleague noticed how far his partner had ventured from the tight formation of the attacking group. Even when they did notice the fallen male, a lone man turned to protect their flank.</p><p>Something was wrong. Very wrong.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t have to do with the fact that they were unmistakably only interested in Hawke\u2014even to the extent of leaving themselves open to enemy fire. A moment later, he heard gunshots from the other side. Somehow, in spite of the security beyond, the Psy had flanked them, pinning the SnowDancers.</p><p>The human half of Andrew might\u2019ve sworn, but the wolf thought only in terms of turning the tables on this threat. Running to a better position, he saw Hawke, Riaz, and D\u2019Arn standing back-to-back, holding off the Psy with well-placed bullets from weapons of their own. Indigo was gone, as were Elias, Sing-Liu, and a couple of others, and he knew Hawke had spun them off to deal with the group approaching from the other side.</p> <p>The two other wolves who\u2019d shifted had stayed behind, and Andrew saw one of them dart out and take down another Psy soldier when the man lowered his guard. A shot rang out and the wolf disappeared back into the trees, but the Psy male was already dead or dying, his throat so much meat.</p><p>Good. One less enemy to worry about.</p><p>As Andrew shimmied forward on his belly, having crept up behind another Psy attacker, he scented D\u2019Arn\u2019s nose start to run. The mental assaults were beginning to get through. Seeing that his prey had moved far enough away from the main group to be vulnerable, Andrew bunched his muscles, ready to take him out. But then he noticed the man in the center. He was shooting, but only enough to cover himself, most of his attention seeming to be on looking at Hawke . . . as if he was sending through a visual transmission.</p><p>Andrew realized what was about to happen a fraction of a second before another Psy teleported in directly in front of his alpha. Even Hawke\u2019s superhuman speed couldn\u2019t have avoided a bullet at that range. But Andrew had jumped toward Hawke in the split second between realization and the appearance of the assassin.</p><p>The bullet felt like a fucking anvil thrust into his abdomen, bloodying his fur and sending him crashing into Hawke and the others. His alpha went down, but didn\u2019t stay in place, rolling with Andrew to take up a more secure position behind a tree, Riaz and D\u2019Arn doing the same on the other side. \u201cStay with me, Drew,\u201d Hawke ordered, putting pressure on Andrew\u2019s gushing wound. \u201cIf you die, Indigo will fucking skin me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew, his body starting to shut down, kept his eyes open long enough to see the Psy fall. They\u2019d left themselves too open in focusing on their charge toward Hawke and now had no cover. Riaz took down two, D\u2019Arn another. Two of the Psy managed to teleport out. That left three. Keeping pressure on Andrew\u2019s wound with his knee, Hawke steadied his arms and took aim. He shot the closest Psy operative in the kneecaps. As the target collapsed, Hawke took aim at the man next to the fallen Psy, his mouth grim, blood streaking his chest from Andrew\u2019s wounds.</p><p>But before Hawke could shoot, the second man turned his gun on his colleague and drilled a bullet through the injured male\u2019s skull. Hawke\u2019s bullet took him out a second later. The last man fell to a shot from Riaz.</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>Indigo, Andrew thought as his chest spasmed, as blood began to pour out of his mouth, where was Indigo?</p><p>A rush of scent an instant later, of windstorms cut by steel.</p><p>His soul sighed in peace. His eyes closed.</p><p>Indigo felt her heart stop. \u201cNo, no!\u201d Falling beside the severely injured wolf, she replaced Hawke\u2019s hands with her own.</p><p>\u201cJudd,\u201d Hawke said, his gaze icy with control. \u201cHe can fix\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just sleeping when we left\u2014he was unconscious,\u201d Indigo said, throwing Hawke her new sat phone. \u201cSee if he\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>Hawke made the call, and she knew from his bleak expression that Judd remained unconscious. His powers to use telekinesis on the cell level, literally putting shattered bodies back together, would take time to regenerate after his recent trip.</p><p>Time Drew didn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d Indigo said, determined not to lose this wolf who\u2019d chased, charmed, and played his way into her heart. \u201cWe need to get him to Lara.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t bother to tell her that Drew was too badly injured, that they\u2019d never be able to get him down to the den in time. He simply slipped his arms beneath the heavy body of the wolf and said, \u201cHold him here.\u201d</p><p>Hold him here.</p><p>Her wolf didn\u2019t hesitate. It dropped even its innermost barriers, and Indigo\u2019s heart, her soul went wide open. For an instant, nothing happened, and she wanted to keen in agony. It wasn\u2019t fair. He was hers! A mate could hold her other half to life, could will him to live.</p><p>Then untrammeled power slammed into her with such force that she went to her knees, her mind crashing with pain that wasn\u2019t hers as the mating bond snapped into place. \u201cI\u2019ve got him,\u201d she said, holding on to Drew\u2019s fading spirit with steely hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Drew. Don\u2019t you dare make me fall in love with you and then leave. I\u2019ll hunt you down in the afterlife if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Hawke was already moving. And, somehow, she was walking beside him.</p><p>Riaz, she belatedly realized, had one muscular arm around her waist, was almost carrying her. \u201cYou just hold him,\u201d the lieutenant whispered in her ear, his voice harsh. \u201cHold him, Indigo.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d have nodded, but she didn\u2019t have the energy. It was taking everything she had to keep pushing her will, her anger, her fear, into the mating bond. She wasn\u2019t Psy, couldn\u2019t see the bond. But she could feel it, could almost touch it. And she knew when it flickered. So she poured more of her energy, her strength into it. She refused to allow herself to think of anything but success.</p><p>Of course it would work. Of course Drew would awaken to torment her again. Of course he wouldn\u2019t leave her. Please, Drew. She didn\u2019t know if she said the words out loud, but she knew when Lara ran out of the trees close to the den, her healer\u2019s heart having felt the tug of hurt.</p><p>\u201cDrew,\u201d the healer said with pain shattering her voice before her expression turned practical, her shoulders going stiff. \u201cPut him down. I\u2019ll see if I can heal some of the damage here.\u201d</p><p>That was the last thing Indigo was aware of hearing, her mind encasing her in a dark good-night. But she held on to Drew even then. He was hers. She would not let him go.</p><p>Lara glanced at Indigo even as she placed her hands over Drew\u2019s injury and fed her healing power into him. \u201cGod, she\u2019s stubborn. I\u2019m going to have to kiss her after she wakes. She held him. She\u2019s still holding him.\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced at Indigo\u2019s unconscious body and then at Drew. He said nothing, knowing Lara was well aware she could pull Pack energy from his body. It was something every healer could do, but only when it came to her own pack, her own alpha. He felt it when she began to pull, opened himself up to give more and more. He\u2019d give the last drop of his blood for his pack.</p><p>Except this time, he wasn\u2019t sure if it would be enough to save two lives. Because if they lost Andrew, Indigo would go with him, stubbornly holding on to the very end. \u201cLara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stable enough to move,\u201d the healer said, lines of strain flaring at the corners of her eyes. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much damage. The bullet shards ripped through most of his major organs.\u201d</p><p>Hawke said nothing as he carried Drew, with Riaz at his heels with Indigo. He simply concentrated on gathering strength from his blood bond with his lieutenants. It flowed in from Riley, from Riaz, from all of them across the state, strong and pure and given freely. He even felt Judd\u2019s cool energy as the Psy male responded in spite of his unconscious state. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose them, Lara.\u201d</p><p>Andrew was one of the \u201cheart\u201d pieces of the pack, those wolves who connected them all to each other in a way that was difficult to explain, but integral to the functioning of a healthy pack. Losing him would cut that heart wide open, leave them all bleeding . . . and losing Indigo would crush what hope remained. She was one of SnowDancer\u2019s strongest support pillars, the woman everyone\u2014even Hawke\u2014went to for advice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Lara said as they reached the infirmary, and she began to work, using both her healing gifts and her skill as a medical practitioner. Her assistant, Lucy, chased out everyone except Hawke, who stayed with one hand on Lara\u2019s shoulder to ease her access to the Pack energy inside him\u2014and of course Indigo, who had woken long enough to collapse into a chair at the top of the bed, her hand on Drew\u2019s head.</p><p>It took hours.</p><p>Indigo came to consciousness again toward the end. He met her namesake eyes, saw that they were devoid of tears. He understood. Now was not the time to cry. Now was the time to fight. Finally, deep in the early hours of morning, he felt Lara stop drawing from him, from his lieutenants.</p> <p>Her normally tan-brown skin holding a tinge of gray, she nodded at Indigo. \u201cTell him to stay in wolf form for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Indigo didn\u2019t argue, just said the words, and Hawke knew she\u2019d be sending the force of her command down the mating bond as well. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare shift until I say it\u2019s okay.\u201d Her voice was taut, her will absolute. \u201cLara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I got the major damage,\u201d the healer said, her body trembling from the exertion.</p><p>Hawke tugged Lara to the warmth of his body. \u201cHe finally got Indigo to accept the mating bond,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you really think the damn stubborn wolf will give that up?\u201d</p><p>That made Lara\u2019s lips curve a little and she rested against him as Lucy started to clean up. But she only allowed herself a short break. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should move him, but we need to change this sheet. I have just about enough energy left for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Releasing her after a small squeeze, he moved around to slide his arms under the body of the large silver wolf as Indigo did the same for his head. \u201cLucy?\u201d</p><p>The trainee nurse, her eyes red with unshed tears, nodded. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>As they lifted, she whipped out the bloodied sheet and slipped in a new one, with Lara helping from the other side. It only took a few seconds, and Drew didn\u2019t stir once.</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>Shoshanna put down the incident report. \u201cYour unit failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The only positive news was that the highly intelligent man who\u2019d organized the operation had made it out alive. \u201cWe won\u2019t get another chance. They\u2019re continuing to dismantle the surveillance and they\u2019ve further strengthened their security.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have hit the wolf alpha in the city.\u201d</p><p>Henry wondered if his wife thought she was in charge of their \u201cpartnership\u201d again. But he said nothing on that point. Let Shoshanna lull herself into a false sense of superiority. It would, in the end, make her easier to kill. \u201cSuch an operation would not have fit in with our long-range plan.\u201d</p><p>As that plan included taking the city and its resources as cleanly as possible, Shoshanna had to agree with her husband. \u201cThe others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men were ordered to eliminate the DarkRiver alpha, but as our surveillance efforts were focused on the wolves, they could not get to him. It appears he spends most of his time away from the city at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting his unborn child,\u201d Shoshanna said. \u201cA child that should not exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, we\u2019ve tipped our hand and they are now all on high alert.\u201d Henry\u2019s head gleamed mahogany dark under the lights as he rose to his feet. \u201cIt may be time to change the long-range plan.\u201d</p><p>Shoshanna wasn\u2019t Henry\u2019s wife except in the legal sense, but she\u2019d worked with him long enough to comprehend his meaning. \u201cYou want to sacrifice San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Henry turned from the window. \u201cIt will cause economic chaos on a mass scale, but that can be managed once we remove the roots of the trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Shoshanna considered their options. An all-out war would have a serious impact on the world, including on the businesses that had backed the Scotts to date, but by the same token, a clean strike would eliminate ninety percent of the problem. \u201cHow strong is your army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me two more months.\u201d</p><p>And then, Shoshanna thought, San Francisco would burn.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>Indigo sat in the curve of her father\u2019s arm on the edge of the White Zone forty-eight hours after the shooting. She hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Drew even for an instant, but Lara had pulled in Hawke, and her alpha had ordered Indigo to take a break or he\u2019d carry her out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d decided on him,\u201d she told her father. \u201cMy wolf had decided on him, but he didn\u2019t know.\u201d There had been too many people around before he went up for his security shift, and she\u2019d wanted it to be a special, private moment. \u201cI was going to tell him when he got home, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her father stroked a big hand over her hair, slow and easy. \u201cDo you think he didn\u2019t know when the bond snapped into place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just keep thinking if I\u2019d accepted the bond earlier, I could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou held him,\u201d her father said, his voice stern. \u201cThat\u2019s all a mate can do in that situation. You did it. You\u2019re still doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew\u2019s in my heart. So deep,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil the thought of losing him feels like razors cutting across my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s who we are, pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>She knew the childhood nickname was meant to make her smile. Nothing could. But she accepted the comfort of his hold. \u201cAll this time, this was what I was so scared of\u2014of loving someone this much and losing them.\u201d</p><p>Abel brushed her hair off her face. \u201cYou were always going to love with all your soul, sweetheart. You\u2019re built that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is he,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s so much love in him, Dad.\u201d The mating bond showed her a depth of feeling, of heart, even greater than she\u2019d imagined. He was someone special, Andrew Liam Kincaid, and he was hers. \u201cI wish you could see him as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be against the laws of nature,\u201d Abel said in a somber tone. \u201cI have to be able to kick his ass if necessary\u2014therefore, I must see him as the filthy bastard who dared hurt my daughter by getting himself shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening my mortally wounded mate?\u201d</p><p>Her father pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cI\u2019ll hold off until he\u2019s healthy.\u201d</p><p>About to respond, she caught a gentle scent as familiar to her as her own. \u201cEvie\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s embrace almost brought moisture to Indigo\u2019s eyes, but she swallowed back the tears. She would not cry. To do so would be a surrender. And she refused to give Drew up.</p><p>Having just spent an hour beside Drew\u2019s motionless form, Hawke pressed his palms to the wall outside the infirmary, wanting to do some damage, find his revenge, but knowing that even if he was able to get his hands around Councilor Henry Scott\u2019s neck right this instant, it wouldn\u2019t help Drew.</p><p>Logic didn\u2019t matter to his wolf. It was enraged and\u2014</p><p>A scent. Rich and exotic. Sandpaper across his skin.</p><p>He stayed still, hoping like hell she\u2019d pass by.</p><p>But she stopped and to his shock, put a hesitant hand on his back. \u201cIs he . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn, knowing that if he looked at her right now, he might do things that could never be taken back. \u201cHe\u2019s stable, but otherwise, no change.\u201d</p><p>Her fingernails scraped against his T-shirt as she curled her hand into a fist. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay, though, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She was asking him for reassurance, and had it been any other member of the pack, he would\u2019ve turned and taken them into his arms. But this was Sienna Lauren, and he couldn\u2019t trust himself around her. \u201cHe\u2019s strong.\u201d When her hand dropped from his back, he felt the loss like a knife wound. \u201cLara\u2019s hopeful\u2014and your uncle\u2019s worked on him, too, helped repair some of the microscopic damage.\u201d But the bullet fragments had caused so much harm that even Judd couldn\u2019t be sure he\u2019d found every lethal cut and nick.</p><p>Sienna nodded and he just caught the movement with his peripheral vision. As he watched, she went to the door of the infirmary and slipped in. Only then did he push off the wall, his muscles taut as iron.</p><p>It was agonizingly tempting to give in to his wolf, to run until the violent emotions within him were exhausted to silence, but he was alpha. And there was work to be done. One of the most important things was ensuring that every single surveillance device within the entirety of den territory had been found and destroyed. SnowDancer, in concert with DarkRiver, had already launched an all-out search, but there was still a chance of overlooking one or two.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anyone who can help us be certain the land is clear?\u201d Hawke asked Lucas on the phone a few minutes later, thinking about the Psy members of the leopard pack.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t. But he made a discreet inquiry, which led him to ask Hawke an odd question. \u201cThe devices you\u2019ve found all have metallic components?\u201d</p><p>Hawke checked with Brenna. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s at least a little metal in some form or another in every single one of these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>When Lucas called back, it was with an offer of assistance from one hell of an unexpected source. Devraj Santos, director of the Shine Foundation and one of the Forgotten\u2014 descendants of those Psy who\u2019d dropped out of the Net before Silence\u2014had volunteered his services.</p><p>\u201cHow is he going to find them?\u201d Hawke asked, his wolf unwilling to put its faith in a man he hadn\u2019t ever met. \u201cAnd what does the metal have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>The leopard alpha sounded annoyed when he answered. \u201cHe won\u2019t say, but I trust him. The Forgotten hate the Council even more than we do.\u201d</p><p>That much was true, and it made him consider Santos\u2019s offer. \u201cWhat does he want in exchange?\u201d Hawke knew of Shine, knew Santos wielded considerable power. No man kept that many people safe from the Council\u2019s assassins by doing good deeds for free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already linked to Shine,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cHe wants some kind of relationship with SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo alliance.\u201d Hawke didn\u2019t ally with anyone he didn\u2019t know inside out. \u201cBut we\u2019ll owe him one if he can deliver.\u201d A favor from SnowDancer was worth a hell of a lot.</p><p>Dev Santos agreed to the deal.</p> <p>It took the Shine director a week of eighteen-hour days\u2014the man located the cameras unerringly even in the blackest darkness and across immense distances\u2014to clear their entire territory.</p><p>Hawke decided to up the favor count to Santos\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cI occasionally need to \u2018disappear\u2019 people when the Council gets too interested in them,\u201d the man said afterward. \u201cCan\u2019t think of any place better than in a pack of wolves. You\u2019re so secretive, I had to sign my name in blood in triplicate before being allowed to set foot on your land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cbut contact me when you need a disappearance and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d There were hundreds of places across the state controlled by wolves where a man or woman could vanish and not be found. And Dev Santos\u2019s people had Psy genes; as the man himself had shown, those genes could prove very useful.</p><p>Devraj Santos held out a hand.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s wolf decided they could deal with the man. They shook.</p><p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>Indigo touched her lips to Drew\u2019s. They were soft, warm, as if he was simply resting. He\u2019d shifted into human form spontaneously earlier that morning, and they were all hoping that meant he was about to break through the comalike sleep that had held him in thrall. She hated seeing him so quiet, so still.</p><p>Drew was never quiet. He was energy and life and mischief.</p><p>\u201cIndigo?\u201d Lara asked. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked, distracting the healer by gesturing at something on Drew\u2019s bedside table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She held up a small yellow action figure, complete with fangs and claws.</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d Lara smiled. \u201cHe keeps sneaking in here and leaving his soldiers to \u2018guard\u2019 Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, Drew,\u201d Indigo said as Lara left to check on Silvia, who was well on the way to recovery, \u201cyou have to wake up now. What\u2019s Ben going to play with if he gives you all his soldiers?\u201d</p><p>She was brushing Drew\u2019s hair off his face when she caught Riley\u2019s scent. The other lieutenant came in and took his brother\u2019s hand. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>Riley always asked her, not Lara. Because he was mated. And he\u2019d almost lost his mate once. \u201cStrong,\u201d Indigo said, \u201cso strong that when I fall asleep, I swear he\u2019s curled up around me.\u201d Sometimes she woke feeling as if she\u2019d been rubbing her face against thick, lustrous fur the shade of silver-birch bark. It comforted her in sleep . . . and caused incredible desolation when she woke.</p><p>Meeting her gaze in silent understanding, Riley leaned down to whisper something in Drew\u2019s ear before leaving several minutes later. Brenna had already been by that morning and would likely return again within the hour.</p><p>Lara touched Indigo\u2019s shoulder some time afterward. \u201cCome have a cup of coffee.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFine, then I\u2019m pulling rank,\u201d Lara said in a steely voice. \u201cYou will get up right now, sit your ass down at my desk, and eat what I put in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Indigo stared at Lara. \u201cYou can only pull rank when a pack member is in danger of harming herself.\u201d In that situation, Lara outranked even Hawke.</p><p>Lara poked Indigo in the ribs. \u201cWhen was the last time you ate?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do this voluntarily, I\u2019ll call Hawke and Riaz and have them hog-tie you to a chair. Then I\u2019ll spoon-feed you, and after that, I\u2019ll pump you full of narcotics so that you get at least eight solid hours of rest.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s wolf wanted to snarl, but it loved the pack healer too much. \u201cYou play mean, Lara.\u201d Bending down, she pressed her lips to Drew\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll be back after I satisfy General Lara.\u201d It was hard to pull herself away, harder still to stuff food down her gullet.</p><p>It took her ten minutes\u2014because Lara refused to let her go until she\u2019d finished every bite. \u201cDrew, sweetie, I have some bad news,\u201d Lara said, after Indigo returned to his side. \u201cYour mate\u2019s lost twenty pounds and looks like a fish stick. You\u2019re going to find yourself mated to a skeleton if you don\u2019t open those baby blues.\u201d</p><p>Indigo scowled, but her response was lost in a rush of noise as Riley, Brenna, and Judd all returned, along with Hawke and a couple of the teenagers who\u2019d gone up into the mountains with her and Drew. Too many people\u2014but this was how they healed.</p><p>By touch. By Pack.</p><p>Hawke asked Lara for an update, and the healer began to speak, but Indigo was focused only on Drew . . . and her wolf caught it the instant his breathing changed.</p><p>Then she heard the sweetest sound of all.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Indy?\u201d It was a groggy question.</p><p>A whirl of sounds and scents crashed against Andrew\u2019s senses. He felt Lara\u2019s warm hands on his face, his chest, heard his sister\u2019s cry of welcome, saw Hawke\u2019s distinctive hair glint in the light, but\u2014</p><p>There she was.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Memories tumbled into him, pain and anguish . . . and the incredible power of someone holding him to life.</p><p>His mate.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, just pushed past Lara to crawl into bed beside him, her face buried in his neck. His heart almost stopped. She\u2019d done it in front of everyone, his strong, private, incredibly proud mate. And then he didn\u2019t care, because he could feel damp heat against his skin. \u201cOut,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Everyone left.</p><p>\u201cIndy, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stand it. Indigo was tough to her bones; he\u2019d never seen her cry. \u201cPlease, baby, please.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clenched on his shoulder, her tears heartbreakingly silent.</p><p>He stroked one hand into her hair, a little lost, but determined to give his mate what she needed. \u201cI promise not to get shot again. Twice in one lifetime should be enough to fulfill anyone\u2019s quota.\u201d He kissed the parts of her face he could see, her ear, the corner of her eye. \u201cBaby, you have to stop.\u201d</p><p>His wolf was going insane inside him, scratching and clawing in distress. Giving in to the animal\u2014and ignoring the sharp aches and twinges of his body\u2014he shifted to take her mouth in a kiss that was a passionate mix of apology, possession, and sheer tenderness. When he finally allowed her to breathe, her eyes glittered up at him, a bright, brilliant indigo.</p><p>Unable to bear the sight of the tear trails that marked her cheeks, he kissed them off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d A husky reprimand, his Indigo coming back to sparking life. \u201cIf you make me go through that again\u201d\u2014her fingers clenching in his hair, holding him close\u2014\u201cso help me, God, I\u2019m going to kick your ass three ways to Sunday.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and let her tell him off, hiding the wolf\u2019s smile against her neck. Because her hands were stroking over his body even as she spoke, her legs locked around him. Sighing because he was home, he closed his eyes and gave in to the demands of his bruised and battered body.</p><p>Indigo knew the instant Drew fell asleep, sprawled over her in a big, gorgeous spread of muscled male flesh. Feeling her throat thicken again at the thought of how close she\u2019d come to losing him, she pressed a kiss to his temple and forced herself to unhook her legs from around him, afraid she\u2019d put pressure on his wounds.</p><p>\u201cIs it safe to come in?\u201d It was a whisper from the doorway.</p><p>Indigo nodded at Lara. \u201cHe\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>Lara tiptoed in\u2014though Indigo had a feeling Drew was well and truly down for the count\u2014and ran her hands over his body. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Relieved words. \u201cHis body\u2019s healing the remaining damage at its own pace, and I\u2019m going to let it. It\u2019ll ensure he rests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he does exactly as you order.\u201d Indigo\u2019s hands tightened in Drew\u2019s hair. \u201cGod, but he\u2019s got me good.\u201d It was a heart-shuddering jolt, the rush of emotion she\u2019d finally allowed herself to feel now that he was safe.</p><p>Lara hitched herself up to sit on the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re all jealous, you know, all the unmated women.\u201d A smile full of the wolf\u2019s laughter. \u201cNot only is he a strong, younger male who\u2019ll probably drive you ragged in bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s glare had no effect.</p><p>\u201c\u2014he adores the ground you walk on.\u201d The healer placed one hand on the back of Drew\u2019s shoulder in gentle affection. \u201cI\u2019d cut off my right arm to have a man look at me the way Drew looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, he\u2019s mine.\u201d The sudden, violent need to hold him close, to quench her thirst for him, had her scowling at Lara\u2019s hand.</p><p>The healer lifted it off with a grin. \u201cHow are you going to get out from under him?\u201d</p><p>Indigo tried to shift Drew off a fraction. He grumbled in his sleep and shoved a hand under her T-shirt to cup her breast as he snuggled his face deeper into her neck. Looking up to see Lara trying not to burst out laughing, Indigo felt her own lips twitch. \u201cMaybe you should lock the door on your way out.\u201d</p><p>The healer did just that . . . and Indigo decided she\u2019d earned some time off. Hooking one leg carefully over Drew\u2019s uninjured side, she put her arms around the heavy heat of him and let sleep sweep her under.</p><p>Indigo left Drew to brief Hawke on an unexpected message Drew discovered on his phone when he rose again and was able to check his messages. As a result, she found herself at a highly secure and private location three days later, about to take part in a meeting none of them could\u2019ve dreamed up, even in their wildest, most insane dreams.</p><p>Hawke sat on one side of the table, Riley to his left and a heavily pregnant Sascha Duncan to his right, with her mate, Lucas, next to her. Indigo, DarkRiver sentinels Nathan and Dorian, and a still-healing but stubborn Drew, held up the wall at their back, while Riaz was standing watch outside the meeting room with Mercy by his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Across from them sat Councilors Nikita Duncan and Anthony Kyriakus. Nikita had Max Shannon to her right, with Max\u2019s wife, Sophia, sitting beside him; while Anthony had a tall, brown-eyed, brown-skinned young man next to him. Tanique Gray was apparently Anthony\u2019s son and Faith\u2019s half brother, and, from the looks of things, he had chosen to ally himself with his father in adulthood.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s job was to protect her alpha, and to that aim, she kept her eyes resolutely on the threat posed by the Councilors. She had, she thought, never brushed against so cold a personality as that of Nikita Duncan. Even Anthony Kyriakus, for all his power, didn\u2019t ruffle her wolf\u2019s fur as badly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose someone needs to speak first,\u201d Sascha said, her voice the only sound in the silence.</p> <p>Nikita Duncan gave a single short nod to acknowledge her daughter\u2019s words. But it was Lucas who spoke next. \u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here. This territory belongs\u2014in some part or another\u2014to all of us.\u201d</p><p>Nikita looked straight at the DarkRiver alpha. \u201cThat territory is now under threat.\u201d</p><p>Indigo could sense Hawke exercising savage control to rein in his instinctive and feral dislike of the Councilors. The Council had almost destroyed SnowDancer once, and none of them would ever trust its members again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d\u2014Nikita glanced from Hawke to Lucas\u2014\u201cwere both targeted, because your deaths would\u2019ve sent your packs into at least temporary disarray.\u201d</p><p>Neither alpha said anything, though they\u2019d figured out that much for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cTake down SnowDancer and DarkRiver,\u201d Anthony added, his tone measured, calm, \u201cand you crack the city\u2019s defenses.\u201d</p><p>Indigo wasn\u2019t fooled by his outwardly mild demeanor. According to SnowDancer\u2019s research, the reclusive Councilor had access to a network of F-Psy stronger than any other. Anthony Kyriakus knew more secrets than anyone else in this room, and she was quite certain the Councilor didn\u2019t hesitate to use those secrets to leverage power when necessary.</p><p>Riley broke his silence to say, \u201cOur information is that the Council is at war.\u201d The statement was a test. Judd had already confirmed the rumors. Now, Indigo waited to see what Nikita would say.</p><p>Sascha\u2019s mother didn\u2019t even blink as she answered. \u201cHenry, Shoshanna, and possibly Tatiana have decided that Silence must hold at all costs. They seek to eliminate anyone who goes against that rhetoric.\u201d</p><p>Riley spoke again, his tone so calm, you\u2019d think they were discussing the watch rotation. \u201cWhy share that when the Council prefers to keep its secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason they\u2019re focusing on this city, this state,\u201d Anthony responded, \u201cis because both Nikita and I call it home, as do the two most powerful changeling packs in the country. Given all that\u2014take this city, and they take the country.\u201d</p> <p>True, Indigo thought. Because even if Anthony or Nikita survived an attack, Henry and the others, having proven their strength on this battleground, would continue to claim city after city, state after state.</p><p>\u201cWhy target us at all?\u201d Hawke asked, and Indigo knew his wolf was weighing all the options with cold, hard focus. Part of what made Hawke such a good alpha was that no matter how savage his emotions, both man and wolf never stopped thinking. \u201cWhat makes them think we\u2019d care one way or another about an internal Psy war?\u201d</p><p>Sascha was the one who spoke, her gaze locked to her mother\u2019s. \u201cBecause of me, because of Faith.\u201d Quiet words from a woman who\u2019d once been viciously rejected by the Councilor in front of her. \u201cDarkRiver\u2019s emotional connection to us, the pack\u2019s inability to sit by and let our parents die, will have been factored into their calculations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Max said as Drew shifted his position a fraction, placing his weight on his other foot.</p><p>Indigo moved her body a tiny increment to the left to support him if necessary. A pulse of love came down the mating bond, an affectionate caress that \u201ctasted\u201d of Drew. It was still new, that intimate connection, but it was already so much a part of her life that she couldn\u2019t imagine how she\u2019d existed without it.</p><p>Wrapping her mate\u2019s love around herself, she watched Nikita shoot her security chief a cool glance, but the human male shook his head, a grim line to his jaw. \u201cThey need all the information,\u201d he said to Nikita. \u201cOtherwise, Hawke will be more than happy to throw us to\u201d\u2014a wry grin\u2014\u201cthe wolves.\u201d</p><p>Nikita took several seconds to reply. \u201cIt appears Mr. Shannon is correct. They are targeting all of us because I am seen as too liberal in my business dealings with you.\u201d Another pause, and then she met her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd because I no longer support the Protocol.\u201d</p><p>Quiet, so quiet Indigo could hear the heartbeat of every person in the room.</p> <p>Even that of the child in Sascha\u2019s womb.</p><p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>They\u2019d all heard the rumors, seen the Psy coming into the city, but for Nikita to admit it . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Mother?\u201d Sascha asked at last. \u201cAre you advocating the fall of Silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence cannot fall with such quickness,\u201d Nikita retorted, \u201cnot without immense devastation. But it is starting to crumble at the edges\u2014and I have never stayed on a sinking ship in my life. I\u2019m unlikely to start now.\u201d</p><p>Sascha moved a little in her chair, one hand on the hard mound of her belly. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve always known how to ride the tides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned Ming or Kaleb,\u201d Lucas pointed out, massaging his mate\u2019s lower back unobtrusively as he spoke.</p><p>Nikita turned her eyes to the DarkRiver alpha. \u201cKaleb is highly unpredictable and may, in the end, double-cross everyone, but he doesn\u2019t stay on sinking ships, either. Ming is having issues of his own and is more concerned with that than taking over this or any territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry and Shoshanna are the strongest advocates of Silence proceeding as it has for the past century,\u201d Anthony added. \u201cThey want to increase the involuntary reconditionings, force those who are fractured to submit\u2014or face total rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s wife, Sophia, spoke for the first time. \u201cBy refusing to sign my rehabilitation warrant, Nikita sent a signal that she was no longer toeing the party line. It has left her . . . unpopular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the packs step back in a public fashion,\u201d Sascha said, to Indigo\u2019s surprise, \u201cmake it clear we\u2019re not allied with you, what will happen?\u201d</p><p>Tension gripped the room.</p><p>\u201cThey may leave you alone,\u201d Anthony said, \u201ccome after Nikita and me in force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t bet on it,\u201d Max added, pushing back strands of his jet-black hair. \u201cFrom what Sophie here tells me, far as the PsyNet is concerned, this area is already seen to be functioning as a cohesive unit. There\u2019s a hell of a lot more cross-pollination than in any other sector.\u201d</p><p>Indigo thought of the connections that tied the people in this room to each other and knew Max Shannon was right. There was also the fact that both packs had proven themselves a threat to even the most powerful Psy. No matter what, the other Councilors would not leave them in peace.</p><p>Nikita spoke into the quiet, her words directed at her daughter. \u201cThat is a decision your emotional nature would never allow you to make,\u201d she said with icy practicality, \u201cso why did you ask the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a child to protect now, Mother.\u201d Soft, powerful words. \u201cPriorities change.\u201d</p><p>Nikita said nothing, and Indigo\u2019s wolf wanted to claw at her. Because that wolf understood only family, knew that its own mother would never look at her child with such coldness.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Sascha said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how we try to distance ourselves. Max is right\u2014we\u2019re all connected now. We all call this region home. They can\u2019t attack one without affecting the other.\u201d</p><p>That, Andrew thought, leaning a little on his mate as his body began to protest at being forced upright for this long, was the crux of it all.</p><p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p><p>Andrew wouldn\u2019t go that far, but he could almost see Hawke calculating the possible options before saying, \u201cWe\u2019d be more apt to take you seriously if you gave us information we could actually use.\u201d It was a challenge.</p><p>\u201cHenry and Shoshanna are assembling an army,\u201d Anthony said, meeting Hawke\u2019s gaze. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a few Arrows on their side, along with all those who believe in Purity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey lost people when they came after Hawke\u201d\u2014Riley\u2019s steady voice again\u2014\u201cand at least one of them was a teleport-capable telekinetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scarce resource,\u201d Anthony agreed. \u201cIt may prove a set-back to their plans\u2014but a small one. As Tks have one of the most dangerous abilities, they tend to most strongly embrace the Protocol.\u201d</p><p>Giving the Scotts a powerful pool of assassins.</p><p>\u201cMing and Kaleb may assist us when the Scotts strike,\u201d Nikita added. \u201cBut only if that assistance serves their own interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome assistance,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cwe don\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>Andrew agreed. Ming LeBon, by all accounts, was a sociopath masquerading as a Councilor. Kaleb Krychek was harder to pin down, which might simply mean he was better at hiding his crimes\u2014because according to the intel Andrew had unearthed, Kaleb Krychek had been mentored by the same sadistic killer who\u2019d not only tortured Brenna, but killed a number of other young changeling women.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cso any defensive measures we take will have to be based on our own resources. I have a not insignificant pool of strong telepaths under my direct command, but the primary asset I bring to the table is my considerable economic strength. I am already in the process of strangling some of the Scotts\u2019 finances.\u201d</p><p>Anthony, it went without saying, brought his foreseers to the table.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered a preemptive strike?\u201d Hawke asked, and Andrew recalled the \u201cwarning tap\u201d they\u2019d discussed not long ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anthony nodded. \u201cHowever, they have a strong advantage on home ground. The opposite is true here.\u201d</p><p>A long, silent pause broken by Hawke. \u201cAnother meeting. One week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Anthony inclined his head, the threads of silver at his temples catching the light. \u201cThere is one more thing you should know. Every strong F-Psy in the NightStar Group has made at least one spontaneous nonbusiness prediction over the past month, a highly unusual event.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they see?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cBlood and death and fire. Over and over, with no alternate futures logged. Whatever we decide at the next meeting, I do not believe any of us will escape the coming holocaust.\u201d</p><p>Drew patted Indigo\u2019s butt as she lay sprawled over him later that night. \u201cI think I\u2019m dead.\u201d He squeezed her toned flesh with blatant possessiveness. \u201cAnd this is my idea of heaven.\u201d</p><p>Well aware she had to keep a watch on those sneaky steamroller tactics of his, Indigo gave a half hearted growl, but she was too sated to work up any real outrage.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing you this way.\u201d He petted her ass again before beginning to draw designs on her lower back with a desultory finger. \u201cAll pleasured and warm and mine.\u201d</p> <p>Possessive demon. But she was the same, so she couldn\u2019t complain. Yawning, she snuggled closer, her eyes heavy lidded. His body was hot and muscled under her touch, his heartbeat still a little erratic, and his scent . . .</p><p>Her wolf rolled into a happy little ball, but she dragged up the willpower to say, \u201cI thought Lara ordered you to rest.\u201d He\u2019d literally ambushed her as she walked in the door, his mouth on hers and his body inside hers before she could corral her brain cells into objecting.</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cI decided pouncing on you sounded like more fun.\u201d</p><p>Smiling against his mouth, she stroked her hand over his ribs. \u201cThat was some meeting, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially that last comment by Anthony.\u201d Shifting to accommodate Indigo when she tangled her legs with his, Andrew played his fingers through her hair. \u201cCats say Faith confirmed the prediction.\u201d And Faith NightStar was the strongest foreseer in or out of the PsyNet.</p><p>Indigo circled a finger over his chest. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ll handle it. SnowDancer hasn\u2019t survived this long to fall to the Councilors\u2019 megalomania.\u201d Another lazy circle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t read Hawke\u2014guess we\u2019ll find out what he thinks at the lieutenant meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI kept expecting him to get up and tear out someone\u2019s jugular today.\u201d</p><p>Indigo laughed. \u201cYou sound so disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s acting reasonable. It\u2019s vaguely terrifying.\u201d</p><p>This time, Indigo\u2019s laughter was long and deep. Shifting onto her back, she untangled their legs and looped her arms around his neck as he rose over her. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you love me.\u201d Rubbing his nose against hers, he felt his wolf stretch out inside him in naked pleasure.</p><p>She nipped at his chin, dropped a kiss onto his lips. \u201cYeah. The day you begin behaving, I\u2019ll know I have an impostor on my hands.\u201d Playing her fingers into his hair, she swung a leg over his hip. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what we\u2019re going to do with the traveling you have to do for your position in the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy team\u2019s got things under control for now,\u201d Drew said, his eyes such a clear blue that she felt bathed in sunlight.</p><p>\u201cBut they need you.\u201d Pride was a fierce beat inside of her, for this wolf who was smart enough, strong enough, to reach their most vulnerable. \u201cWith Riaz here, in the den, I can come on a lot of the trips with you.\u201d</p> <p>Drew blinked, his lashes long and beautiful. \u201cIf Riley is Hawke\u2019s right arm, you\u2019re his left. He needs you here. Especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him.\u201d She pulled him down against her, enjoying the all over contact. Such exquisite skin privileges.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be gone for months at a time; you\u2019ve got your network set up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I\u2019m still going to need to make a lot of short trips\u2014especially to San Diego. Seb is damn strong,\u201d he said of his replacement in that sector, \u201cbut he\u2019s younger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can play those times by ear,\u201d Indigo said, knowing she\u2019d miss him when he was away, but also knowing the mating bond would ensure she was never lonely.</p><p>A long, quiet pause. Then, \u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>Hearing the edge in his tone, she nuzzled a kiss against his neck. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were put in a situation where you had to accept the mating bond,\u201d Drew said, shadows whispering over the clarity of his gaze when she looked up. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly how much it had to have cost him to ask that. \u201cThe only thing I regret is not being able to end the mating dance as I planned.\u201d</p><p>A spark in the blue. \u201cYou had a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell.\u201d Fingers dancing over her abdomen, threatening to tickle.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, brushing her lips against his ear, \u201cit involved tying you naked to my bed, having my wicked way with you in revenge for all your crazy-making tactics . . . and then telling you that you belong to me. Forever. No outs. No givebacks.\u201d</p><p>Drew thrust his hand into her hair, his gaze gone that startling wolf-copper. \u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>She did. And then, because she was in a good mood and she adored him and he\u2019d taught her about opening her heart, she whispered more love words in his ear, until he broke every single one of Lara\u2019s rules and drove them both to heaven a second time around. </p> </body></html>"]
