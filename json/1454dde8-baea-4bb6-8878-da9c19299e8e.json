After all, Brandy and Ted were her doing. That made...hmm...fourteen couples she\u2019d set on the road to matrimony? No, fifteen! Not bad. Not bad at all.</p> <p>\u201cGood job, Coll,\u201d said Gerard Chartier, accepting his free Cooper\u2019s Cave IPA. He sat at the end of the bar, where the fire department was having a \u201cmeeting,\u201d the agenda of which seemed to be O\u2019Rourke\u2019s list of microbrews. She wasn\u2019t complaining. They were good for business.</p><p>\u201cYour sorry single state hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed,\u201d she said, rubbing his bald head. \u201cNot to worry. You\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. Trust Auntie Colleen, ever wise and all-knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen!\u201d her brother, Connor, yelled from the kitchen. \u201cStop harassing the customers!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m part of our charm!\u201d she yelled back. \u201cGang, are you feeling harassed?\u201d</p><p>A satisfying chorus of no answered her. She breezed into the kitchen. \u201cHi, Rafe,\u201d she greeted the backup chef, who was making one of his famous cheesecakes. \u201cSave some of that for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my truest love,\u201d he said, not looking at her. He was g*y. All the good ones were.</p><p>\u201cBrother mine,\u201d Colleen said to her twin, \u201cwhat bug is up your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just gave away three hundred dollars\u2019 worth of booze, that\u2019s what,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBrandy and Ted got engaged. Beautiful ring, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour work, Collie?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. They\u2019d been eyeing each other for weeks. I gave a gentle shove, and voil\u00e0. I expect I\u2019ll be a bridesmaid. Again.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled. \u201cAnd when will you work your superpowers on your own self, lovey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never. I\u2019m too smart for all that. I like to use men for purely physical\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! No one wants to hear about your sex life,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d said Rafe.</p><p>She grinned. Tormenting her brother, though they were both thirty-one, was still one of the great joys in life.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like such a waste. All that, unclaimed.\u201d Rafe gestured to her torso and face.</p> <p>\u201cShe got burned when she was young,\u201d Connor told Rafe.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m single. Besides, you\u2019re single, too. It\u2019s all part of our dysfunctional childhood, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try,\u201d he said, adding the sour cream layer to the cake. \u201cI was a g*y boy born to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and grew up in East Texas with five older brothers who all played football. It was Friday Night Lights meets The Birdcage meets Swamp People. No one can compete with me in the land of dysfunctional families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou totally win,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cCon and I only had a cheating father and\u2014</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t tonight your night off?\u201d Connor interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYep. But I came in because I sensed, using our magical twinsy bond, that you missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sensed wrong,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGet out of my kitchen. Your posse just came through the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has batlike hearing,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s creepy. Bye, boys! Don\u2019t forget my piece of heaven, Rafe. Connor, come say hi. Everyone loves you, for some reason.\u201d</p><p>She went back out into the bar and sure enough, there were the girls: Faith Holland, her oldest pal in the world (and a newlywed, and while Colleen couldn\u2019t claim that one as her idea, she\u2019d nonetheless helped keep them together); Honor, Faith\u2019s older sister (bone-dry martini, three olives), someone Colleen had definitely helped with sweet Tom Barlow\u2014their wedding would be in early July; and Prudence, the oldest Holland sister (gin and tonic, now that it was spring), married for decades.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s tricks, Holland girls? Honor, you want your usual? Pru, a G&amp;T? And what about you, Faithie? I have some strawberries I\u2019ve been saving for you...a little vodka, a little mint, splash of lemon...want to try one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust water for me,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cOh, lordy, are you pregnant?\u201d Colleen blurted. Faith and Levi had gotten married in January, and from the way he looked at her, those two got it on like weasels. And you know what they say about weasels.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d But she blushed, and Honor smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you are,\u201d said Pru. \u201cNothing like the blessing of kids, even though I thought I would kill Abby the other day. She asked if she could get her tongue pierced. I said sure, I\u2019d get a hammer and a nail and we could do it right now if she was that dumb, and the conversation devolved from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, girls,\u201d Connor said dutifully, having emerged from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCon, bring Pru and Honor their regulars, and a big glass of ice water for Faith here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to say hi, not to wait on you,\u201d he said. \u201cFaith, are you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Maybe. Just shush,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor Cooper would be a great name,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds pretentious,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cColleen Cooper, or Colin for a boy...now we\u2019re talking. Con, how about those drinks? And some nachos?\u201d</p><p>Her brother gave her a dark look but left obediently, and Colleen settled back in her seat. \u201cGuess what you missed? Brandy Morrison and Ted Standish just got engaged! He got down on one knee and everything, and she was crying, and it was beautiful, ladies! Beautiful!\u201d</p><p>Hannah, Colleen\u2019s cousin, brought over their food and drinks, and Prudence launched into a story of her latest adventure in keeping things fresh in the old conjugal bed. Very entertaining. Coll scanned the bar as Pru talked, making sure all was running smoothly.</p><p>It occurred to her that spending her night off at work was maybe not 100 percent healthy. Granted, options were limited in Manningsport, New York, a town of just over seven hundred. She could be home, reading and cuddling with Rufus, her enormous Irish wolfhound mutt, who would love nothing more than to stare into her eyes in adoration for several hours. One couldn\u2019t rule out the ego boost that provided.</p><p>Or, Colleen thought, she could be out on a date. Rafe had a point.</p><p>It\u2019s just that every guy she met seemed to be lacking something. She hadn\u2019t felt the tingle in a long, long time.</p><p>As the proprietor of the only year-round alcohol-serving establishment in town, Colleen saw a lot of relationships blossom or end in a fiery crash. When things went right, it was generally because the woman had cleverly manipulated the guy into good dating behavior. He\u2019d call when he said he would. Put some thought into dates. He\u2019d ask questions about her life because she didn\u2019t vomit up all her personal history in the first ten minutes.</p><p>Far more common, however, was the fiery crash model, when Colleen mixed a sympathy cosmo or poured an extra ounce of Pinot Grigio into a glass for a woman who had no idea what went wrong. Colleen could tell her, of course, and sometimes did... Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have talked about your ex for two hours, or Is telling him you were just cleared for fertility treatments a good idea on the first date?</p><p>Happily, the now-engaged Brandy had asked Colleen for advice from the start. Should I go out with him again tomorrow? Is it okay to sleep with him yet? How about if I text him right now?</p><p>The answers: No, no and no.</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d said the bride-to-be now, \u201cI just wanted to thank you again for everything.\u201d She bent down and gave Coll a hug. \u201cBridesmaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou two...mazel tov! I\u2019m so happy for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Coll,\u201d Ted said. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fifteenth couple,\u201d she said to the Holland sisters as the happy couple left for some monkey sex, one presumed.</p><p>\u201cYou have a gift,\u201d Faith said, taking a slab of nachos onto her plate.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet just last night, there was some poor woman in here, begging the guy she was with not to dump her, and I took her aside and said, \u2018Honey, if you have to beg, do you really want this loser?\u2019 But of course, she kept crying and begging, and it was agony, I tell you.\u201d She finished her drink, one of the strawberry thingies Faith had passed on. \u201cMaybe I should teach a class. Pru, when Abby starts dating, you send her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. And thanks, because God knows, she\u2019s not listening to me these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d came a voice, and all three of them looked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Paulie,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHow are you? Have a seat!\u201d</p><p>Paulina \u201cPaulie\u201d Petrosinsky pulled up a chair, swung it backward and straddled it. She\u2019d been Faith and Colleen\u2019s classmate\u2014not quite a friend back in the day, but really nice. She came into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s once in a while, usually after a workout at the gym, where her weight lifting skills were the stuff of legend.</p><p>\u201cUm...I overheard you say something about, uh, teaching people? Women?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSlut University,\u201d Pru said, and Faith and Honor snorted.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cMy reputation is greatly exaggerated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cYou should stop spreading rumors about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Colleen smiled. Had she in fact written something flattering about herself on the men\u2019s room wall just last week? She had. \u201cIgnore my so-called friends,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...can you really help a, um, a person? With, uh...you know. Love and men and stuff?\u201d Paulie\u2019s face turned deep red, then purple.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Honor asked, frowning a little.</p><p>\u201cOh, that. My face. It\u2019s called idiopathic craniofacial erythema. I...I blush. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could hang around,\u201d Prudence said. \u201cWe farm people have to get up early. Good luck with your man, Paulie! See you, girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you interested in someone in particular?\u201d Colleen asked, scootching over into Pru\u2019s vacated chair to make more room at the table.</p><p>Paulie swallowed. \u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered, glancing around.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cUm...I\u2019d rather not say.\u201d</p><p>Colleen nodded. \u201cWhat do you like about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...he\u2019s just so nice. I mean, really kind, right? And he\u2019s cheerful and good and smart, I think, too. I mean, he...well. He\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Colleen smiled. \u201cAnd do you feel sick when you see him, and then hot, and then nauseous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Paulie said, her face purpling again.</p><p>\u201cDo you imagine conversations with him, holding hands and moonlit walks and all that other mushy stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes. I do.\u201d Paulie took a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cDoes he make your danger zone tingly? Does your skin get hot, do your knees wobble, does your tongue feel swollen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Faith stood up. \u201cI miss Levi,\u201d she announced. She gave Colleen a kiss on the cheek and squeezed her sister\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGood luck, Paulie! Take Colleen with a grain of salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, too,\u201d Honor said. \u201cBye, matchmaker. Do no harm, mind you. See you, Paulina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who is this guy?\u201d Colleen asked when they were gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paulie shot a nervous glance back to the bar. Aha! A hint. \u201cYou know what?\u201d Paulie said. \u201cNever mind. He\u2019s...he\u2019s out of my league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not!\u201d Colleen cried. \u201cPaulie, you\u2019re so nice! You are! Anyone would be lucky to have you.\u201d Besides, Colleen always felt a little guilty where Paulie was concerned.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Colleen said firmly. Granted, Paulie hadn\u2019t been blessed with great beauty. And her dad was a little odd\u2014Ronnie Petrosinsky, owner of four small restaurants called Chicken King that served fried chicken thirty-eight different ways, all of them very, very bad for you. He was locally famous for his commercials, where he pranced around dressed as a rooster wearing a crown. Poor Paulie was also featured in a fluffy yellow chick suit, wearing a crown\u2014the Chicken Princess. Try getting out from under that title, especially in high school.</p> <p>\u201cListen, Paulie. No one is out of your league. Go ahead, tell me.\u201d</p><p>Paulina sighed gustily and drained her Genesee (first order of business: get her to drink something more feminine). \u201cIt\u2019s Bryce Campbell.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Okay, so that might be tough.</p><p>Bryce was gorgeous. Jake Gyllenhaal DEFCON 4\u2013gorgeous. He got his share of tail, as Colleen knew all too well. Bryce was a regular. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but sweet. He had a certain charm, and women threw themselves at him all the time.</p><p>Lots of women.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Colleen said, realizing she hadn\u2019t spoken for a moment. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>Paulie gave her a despairing look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. We can work with this. So, tell me more about you and Bryce.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s expression grew dreamy, the severe blush fading. \u201cHe volunteers at the animal shelter, you know?\u201d Colleen nodded; Bryce had in fact helped her choose Rufus the Doofus. \u201cAnd the animals, they all love him. I go in a lot. I, um...I\u2019ve adopted two dogs and four cats in the past year.\u201d</p><p>Colleen smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot. But go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other day, I was getting gas, and so was he, and I didn\u2019t even plan that! He just smiled at me and said, \u2018Hey, Paulie, how\u2019s it going?\u2019\u201d She sighed at the memory of the magical words. \u201cIt was amazing. I mean, that smile, right?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Bryce had a beautiful smile. That was true.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never in a bad mood,\u201d Paulie went on. \u201cNever has a bad thing to say about anyone. Not that I talk to him. Not much, anyway. But sometimes we lift weights at the same time, and...well, I try to talk to him. But my mind goes blank, and I never think of anything good to say. But last week? I had to walk past him, and I said \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 and he said, and I quote, \u2018No problem.\u2019 Colleen, he smelled so good.\u201d</p><p>The woman had it bad.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we were in high school, he never made fun of me.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s heart gave a squeeze. Paulie had a solid, athletic build and held the school record for the number of push-ups, beating even Jeremy Lyon, football god, a record that stood to this day. Her father\u2019s business didn\u2019t help her social status; he\u2019d started out as a chicken farmer, and Paulie hadn\u2019t grown up as comfortably as most of the kids in town, though not as poor as others. And then, when the Chicken King became so successful, well, that was different, too, and it was hard to be different at that age.</p><p>Though she was now the chief operating officer for the Chicken King franchises, Colleen had never seen Paulie out of gym clothes, and she always seemed on the fringe of things, as nice and smart as she was.</p><p>With a pang, Colleen realized Paulie reminded her of Savannah, her nine-year-old half sister.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s forget about it, okay? I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Paulie said now.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHe\u2019d be lucky to have you. I\u2019m serious. You\u2019re great, you have so many nice qualities...it\u2019s not gonna be that hard, Paulie. What have your other relationships been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I...I\u2019ve never had another relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. So, no experience with men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a virgin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Nothing wrong with saving yourself for true love.\u201d Colleen herself had, after all. Not that hers was an exemplary story.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like no one\u2019s ever asked me.\u201d</p><p>Oh! Poor lamb! \u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d probably rather go out with you,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Colleen said with a flinch. \u201cBryce? No. We\u2019re not... He\u2019s a sweetheart, but not my type. But you guys...you\u2019d be great together.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s face lit up. \u201cReally? You think so? Honest? I\u2019ll do whatever you say. You think I have a shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Connor was back. \u201cDad called. Wants you to babysit. Apparently, Gail needs a break.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Gail Chianese O\u2019Rourke, their stepmother, four years their senior, not so lovingly known as Gail-the-Tail-Chianese-Rhymes-with-Easy-Hyphen-O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>\u201cA break from what?\u201d Colleen asked. \u201cFrom spa appointments? From shopping? A break from having breaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ask him to call you on your cell next time. Hey, Paulie, anything else for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d she said, shifting to take a ten from her pocket.</p><p>\u201cOn the house,\u201d Connor and Colleen said in unison.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She stood, tripped a little over the chair; Con grabbed her arm and Paulie flushed again. \u201cWell. Thanks, Coll. You rock.\u201d With that, she headed out into the beautiful spring night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fixing her up,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You have something against true love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d</p><p>The bar was emptying; the sidewalks, few that there were, tended to roll up early in Manningsport. Connor sat down with her. The only folks left were on the volunteer fire department, who felt that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was their home away from home.</p><p>\u201cCon, you think Mom and Dad screwed us up forever? I mean, neither one of us has a significant other.\u201d</p><p>Connor shrugged. He hated talking about their parents.</p><p>\u201cYou should go out with someone. Jessica Dunn, maybe. Or Julianne from the library. Or I could fix you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather hang myself, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, can I have your car?\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, but hey, the twin telepathy was alive and well. \u201cDon\u2019t have kittens, okay? But actually, I\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Since when? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kittens, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my twin, my family, my coworker! We share a house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother life mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d she said more calmly, \u201chow are you seeing someone and I don\u2019t know about it? Who is she? How long has this been going on? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of this. I didn\u2019t want you to go crazy and give me advice or start naming babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago. You told Faith to name her baby after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so did you.\u201d</p><p>Her brother crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept this from me. God, those three minutes you have on me ruined you. I should\u2019ve been born first, and I would\u2019ve been, if you hadn\u2019t shoved me out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re done here. You wanna kick out the fire department, or shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, people!\u201d Colleen yelled, and the various and sundry members of Manningsport\u2019s bravest started reaching for their wallets.</p><p>Hello. Bryce Campbell was there, too. He must\u2019ve come in when she was with the girls. He was watching the fire department with an almost wistful look on his face. Boys. They never got over the thrill of their first shiny red truck.</p><p>Well, no time like the present.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bryce,\u201d she said, ambling over.</p><p>\u201cHi, Colleen.\u201d He looked at her and smiled, and yes, Paulie had a point. Bryce was cute. That wasn\u2019t news, but still.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your dad?\u201d Smiling Joe Campbell was one of Colleen\u2019s favorite patrons, though he hadn\u2019t been in much in the past year.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great!\u201d Bryce flashed another look at the MVFD, who were now filing out the door, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou should join the fire department,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I doubt my mom would approve of that. I might get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t, though. Their safety record is stellar, even if they are a bunch of goofballs.\u201d She took his empty glass and wiped the counter in front of him. \u201cSo, Bryce, you seeing anyone these days?\u201d</p><p>He raised a friendly eyebrow. \u201cYou asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He gave a mock grimace. \u201cNope, no one special. I wouldn\u2019t mind having a girlfriend, though.\u201d</p><p>This was going to be easier than she thought. \u201cReally? What\u2019s your type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from you?\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cNone of that, now. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Pretty. Kind of...pretty and nice and hot, you know? Like Faith Holland, except maybe taller and skinnier, and don\u2019t tell Levi I said that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce Campbell. Looks aren\u2019t everything, you know.\u201d And if he had a problem with Faith\u2014who was built like a 1940s pinup girl\u2014she was going to have to tread carefully with Paulie. \u201cHow about personality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally outgoing. Like me, kind of. You know anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. No one leaps to mind.\u201d Actually, four women leaped to mind, but Bryce was a typical man\u2014he didn\u2019t know what he needed; he just knew what he liked. \u201cBut I\u2019ll think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Coll! You\u2019re the best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Now get out, we\u2019re closing.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, Colleen walked to the yellow-and-red Victorian she shared with her brother. A duplex, so it wasn\u2019t quite as dysfunctional as it sounded. Connor had left a little earlier, and the first-floor lights were out. Colleen\u2019s apartment was on the second floor\u2014a staircase in the back led to a small deck and her door.</p><p>She wondered if this mystery woman of his had visited the house yet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d she murmured to herself as she opened her door. \u201cAfter all, we have somebody to love, too. Right, Rufus?\u201d</p><p>One hundred and sixty pounds of scruffy gray canine agreed. She allowed him to maul her, scratched his rough gray fur, gazed meaningfully into his eyes, and then extricated herself. \u201cWho wants a cookie? Is it us? I want an Oreo, and you, my beautiful countryman, can have a Milk-Bone.\u201d</p><p>Some bozo had bought Rufus as a puppy, then, shocker, learned that the breed tended to get a wee bit large. But the idiot\u2019s loss was her gain, because, as Bryce Campbell had suspected, Rufus and Colleen were kindred spirits.</p><p>She called Rushing Creek and talked to Joanie, the night nurse in her grandfather\u2019s wing, and ascertained that Gramp was having a good night. Then, with a sigh, she got the snacks, made Rufus balance his cookie on his nose before allowing him to inhale it, then flopped down on the couch with the box of Oreos. Because really, no one had just one Oreo.</p><p>Love was in the air. It was all around her, as a matter of fact\u2014Faith and Levi maybe percolating a baby; Honor and Tom getting married; Brandy and Ted now engaged. Paulie and Bryce (complicated on several levels...but maybe a chance for Colleen to do something good). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor and someone.</p><p>That one gave her the biggest pang. Granted, there\u2019d been many times over the years when Colleen would\u2019ve cheerfully sold Connor to the gypsies (and had, in fact, put him up for adoption when they were twelve and he announced the fact of her period in the cafeteria). When their parents went through their ugly, horrible, terrible divorce, she and Connor had become closer than ever. They often called or texted each other simultaneously. Saw each other every day.</p><p>It was strange, thinking of her twin married, a dad. She certainly wanted him happy, of course she did. It was just that she always pictured it in the happy, sunny future, in which she would have a great spouse and adorable tots.</p><p>But that picture always held a dreamlike quality, the image overexposed, as if the sun shone too brightly, and her husband\u2019s face was blurred.</p> <p>Once, she\u2019d known exactly who the face belonged to, and it hadn\u2019t been blurry at all.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cMOMMY SAYS YOU\u2019RE emotionally shut down.\u201d The voice came from the child standing in the doorway of Lucas Campbell\u2019s office at Forbes Properties. A female child of the smallish variety. One of his four nieces, specifically.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s adorable. I thought I banned you from visiting me,\u201d Lucas said. He pressed the intercom to his assistant. \u201cSusan, please call Security and have my niece escorted from the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s five years old,\u201d Susan said.</p> <p>\u201cHave them send a team.\u201d</p><p>Chloe grinned, flashing the gaping hole in her teeth. Too soon for dentures, probably. \u201cMommy says you\u2019re constibladed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to agree,\u201d Susan said, then clicked off.</p><p>He leveled a stare at his niece. \u201cThe word is constipated. If you\u2019re going to talk about me, you need to up your game. Why are you here? Didn\u2019t I pay you not to bother me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo give me more.\u201d The kid had the soul of a Beverly Hills trophy wife. She skipped over to him and climbed onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think this show of affection will win you any points,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Chloe said, settling back against him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Forbes is building a new skyscraper,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI want to live in the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re broke. And you have no earning potential, I might point out. You can\u2019t even drive. Not very well, anyway.\u201d This earned a giggle, and Lucas smiled into his niece\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cIs that a princess you have there?\u201d came a voice.</p><p>\u201cHi, Frank!\u201d Chloe scrambled off Lucas\u2019s lap and charged into Frank Forbes\u2019s legs. \u201cUncle Lucas showed me your new skyscraper, and I want to live in the penthouse!\u201d</p> <p>Frank picked up Chloe and laughed. \u201cWell, you can stay overnight before we sell it, how\u2019s that? You and your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle girl, whatever your name is, go see Susan and tell her to let you answer the phones,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou can be her boss until your mom comes to get you.\u201d Steph, Lucas\u2019s older sister, worked in Accounting seven floors down, and often sent her youngest up to bother him. Chloe was in the after-care program that Forbes offered its employees. Cara, Tiffany and Mercedes\u2014Chloe\u2019s sisters\u2014had all been in the same program, though they were now extremely mature at ages fourteen for the twins, and sixteen for Mercedes.</p><p>Chloe stampeded for the reception area, the promise of power the best bribe possible.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we hire her?\u201d Frank asked, sitting down in the leather chair in front of Lucas\u2019s desk.</p><p>Lucas smiled and waited. Frank only came by to talk about one thing these days\u2014why Lucas should stay with Forbes Properties and not leave, as he planned to, once the Cambria skyscraper was finished. But Lucas was done here, as grateful as he was. Frank Forbes, his boss and former father-in-law (and yes, a relation to that Forbes) had been good to him.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stay, son,\u201d he said, almost on cue. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. But I think it\u2019s time. More than time.\u201d</p><p>Frank sighed. \u201cMaybe. It won\u2019t be the same without you, though.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, it was still hard for Lucas to believe he worked here\u2014him, a kid from the South Side, taking an elevator to the fifty-third floor every day. He\u2019d first worked for Forbes Properties the summer of his freshman year of college, doing grunt-work construction, mostly cleaning up after the union carpenters and electricians, schlepping supplies, then working his way up being able to drive nails and cut wood.</p><p>Four years later, he\u2019d been given a promotion, a health care package and a title.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened when you knocked up the boss\u2019s daughter.</p><p>And despite the fact that Frank had forgiven him for that transgression, had treated him far better than he deserved, had truly made him part of the family\u2014and not just him, but Steph and her kids, too\u2014Lucas couldn\u2019t stay anymore. His debt to the Forbes family was paid as much as it would ever be.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my daughter lately?\u201d Frank asked now.</p><p>\u201cWe had dinner the other night.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cShe looks good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s intercom buzzed. \u201cA call for you on line three,\u201d came Chloe\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a name?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cGet it yourself.\u201d</p><p>Frank smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Frank.\u201d He waited until Frank left; the guy would stop to talk to Chloe, no doubt, who collected souls like a tiny Satan.</p><p>\u201cLucas Campbell,\u201d he said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cLucas? It\u2019s Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Joe,\u201d he said. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI\u2019m not so good, pal.\u201d</p><p>Something flared in Lucas\u2019s chest. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...the tumor\u2019s getting bigger, and I think I\u2019d like to...you know. Wind down.\u201d</p><p>The words seemed to echo. Lucas looked out his window, automatically noting the Sears building, the Aon Center. \u201cWhat can I do, Joe?\u201d he asked, then cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan you come home for the duration? Bryce...he\u2019ll take this hard. And there are some things I\u2019ll need help with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>For the past eighteen months, Joe had been on dialysis; once a week at first, then twice, and now every other day. The kidney disease made him tired, but dialysis would keep him going almost indefinitely.</p><p>Unfortunately, a routine scan had discovered something more ominous\u2014stage IV lung cancer, which would take him long before kidney failure, and Joe wanted to die on his own terms, as much as he could.</p><p>Joe was his only uncle, the older brother of Lucas\u2019s late father. Joe\u2019s wife, Didi, wasn\u2019t the nurturing type. Bryce, their son, was an overgrown kid, sorely lacking in pragmatism. Not like Lucas, though they were almost exactly the same age.</p><p>\u201cIs Bryce still at the vineyard?\u201d he asked. His cousin had gotten a job at one of the many small vineyards in the Finger Lakes area, where Joe and Didi lived.</p><p>\u201cNo, he left there. It wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Ah. Lucas tried to remember if Bryce had ever had a paying job for more than three months and came up empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him settled before...before long,\u201d Joe added. \u201cYou know. Employed. Happy. Stable.\u201d</p><p>Adult, Lucas thought. He\u2019d spoken to Bryce a couple of weeks ago, but it was mostly about the White Sox.</p><p>Lucas hadn\u2019t been back to Manningsport in years. It wasn\u2019t as if it had ever been home\u2014just a place he\u2019d lived for four months.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make some arrangements, then,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cCall you tonight, Joe.\u201d</p><p>Very gently, he hung up the phone.</p><p>So he\u2019d be going back to Manningsport. Once more, he\u2019d do his best to look out for Bryce. Once more, endure his aunt Didi, who\u2019d only found him worthy of attention when he\u2019d married Ellen Forbes, and still hadn\u2019t forgiven him for divorcing her.</p><p>And once more, he\u2019d see Colleen O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>\u201cHEY, SUGARPLUM!\u201d Colleen said as her little sister wriggled into the first booth at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. \u201cNachos grande, coming up!\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s face lit up, then avalanched. \u201cOh, no thanks,\u201d she said, tugging at her formfitting purple shirt. \u201cMaybe some water and a salad? Dressing on the side?\u201d</p><p>Colleen paused. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Connor\u2019s nachos all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>It was a Friday evening tradition that Savannah came to the bar for supper while Dad and Gail went out on a date. Colleen, Connor and their sister would eat together, because even if Connor couldn\u2019t stand the sight of their father and didn\u2019t speak to Gail, he wasn\u2019t an ass. Both twins loved Savannah quite a bit. Tons, in fact.</p><p>But it was fair to say that the universe had been paying attention to Gail-the-Tail-Chianese-Rhymes-with-Easy-Hyphen-O\u2019Rourke when she was pregnant with Savannah.</p><p>Nine years ago, Colleen had been visiting her father and the Tail, despite her father\u2019s infidelity and Gail\u2019s fertility, and had overheard Gail saying this: If Colleen is pretty, imagine what our daughter will be like. Think it\u2019s too early to call a modeling agency? Warm chuckles between the parents-to-be ensued, and Colleen had to stay in the cellar, where she\u2019d been sent to hunt for a bottle of wine, until the bile surge subsided.</p><p>She imagined the baby would be beautiful. No such thing as ugly babies, after all. But she knew what Gail was saying. Colleen was pretty, something her father used to point out with great frequency...but Baby Girl 2.0 was going to be even better.</p><p>However, the karmic gods want to hear you praying for healthy children, not children with superior bone structure.</p><p>Savannah was not beautiful.</p><p>Colleen adored Savannah from the second she\u2019d seen her at the hospital, with her little tubular head and snub nose. She changed diapers and took the baby for walks and rocked her and kissed her and sang to her, and Connor did the same, though with a lesser degree of fervor, being that he was a guy and all. But Colleen was in love.</p><p>Gail...not so much. Not enough, it seemed.</p><p>Savannah was wonderful and happy and funny, but she wasn\u2019t beautiful. Not like Gail, who was a mere four years older than Colleen, and not like Colleen. Savannah was stocky and pale, whiter even than most Irish, which was saying a lot; while Colleen had creamy skin and rosy cheeks, Savannah was practically translucent. Her face was dotted with giant freckles, rather than a sprinkling of cinnamon, and her pale eyes were set close together. Instead of Gail\u2019s Irish setter\u2013auburn hair, Savannah\u2019s was a pinkish strawberry-blond.</p><p>She walked heavily, despite Gail trying to teach her to tiptoe through the house, a strong, strapping girl with a low center of gravity that made her a great catcher on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s softball team, which Colleen managed in the town league. But she wasn\u2019t what Gail had expected.</p><p>Gail wasn\u2019t a bad mother. She made sure Savannah ate her veggies and got enough sleep, went to all her school activities and drove her to trumpet lessons, though Gail had petitioned hard for the flute or violin or something \u201cmore feminine.\u201d It was clear Savannah confused her. She, after all, was a size two. Her hair was long and glossy and straight. Green eyes, of course. Perky boobs (Savannah had not been a breast-is-best baby) and a great ass. She bought micro-shorts and cropped tops for Savannah, who preferred Yankees T-shirts and sweats.</p><p>\u201cA salad, huh?\u201d Colleen said now.</p><p>\u201cMom says I should lose some weight.\u201d</p><p>Colleen blinked. Savannah was solid. Sure, she had a little pudge. She was nine. Any second now, she\u2019d shoot up five inches and things would balance out a bit more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, sweets,\u201d Colleen began. \u201cEating healthy is smart. Your mom is right about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a grilled pork chop for lunch. And broccoli,\u201d her sister said. \u201cAnd water. No carbs.\u201d</p><p>For crying out loud. \u201cVery nutritious. But everything in moderation, right? Nachos once a week isn\u2019t going to ruin you. And life without nachos, you know? Why bother?\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s smile lit up the room.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, Connor set down the nachos and slid in next to Savannah, and all was as it should be. Savannah chattered happily about gym class and baseball (they were Yankees fans, of course). Connor let her come into the kitchen and drizzle sauce on the cheesecake desserts that were flying out of the kitchen, and Colleen let her take orders. All the regulars loved Savannah.</p><p>When Gail arrived to pick her up, she gave the girl a hug, then inspected the salsa stain on her shirt, shooting Colleen a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cNachos,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cIt\u2019s our girls\u2019 night tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Gail said. \u201cWell. Good night.\u201d Savannah waved, grinning.</p><p>So, yes. There was a personal parallel between her sister and Colleen\u2019s other mission tonight: Paulie Petrosinsky and Bryce Campbell, Step One.</p> <p>Like Savannah, Paulie lacked certain attributes deemed important by some. But it didn\u2019t mean Savannah and Paulie were any less deserving of true love with the man of their dreams (though, yes, Savannah would have to wait quite a few years for that, thank you very much). Tonight\u2019s mission: get Paulie on Bryce\u2019s radar.</p><p>Speaking of Paulie, in she came, wrapped in what appeared to be a dirty sheet that went past her knees. Colleen had said \u201csoft\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cbright\u201d when Paulie asked what to wear. Not \u201cgray.\u201d She hadn\u2019t said the word gray once. The word sheet had also not been mentioned.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Paulie asked. \u201cThe salesman said these worked on every figure so I bought six of them.\u201d</p><p>Colleen grabbed Paulie\u2019s arm and hustled her into the office in the back. \u201cGet out, Connor. Wardrobe emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I should stay, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked, not even looking up from the computer, where he was doing God knows what.</p><p>\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Paulie asked. \u201cCrap. You know what? This isn\u2019t gonna work. I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, no you\u2019re not,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cCourage, my friend. Just let me fix your hair a little, okay? We\u2019re going for a soft, gamine look, and you used just a little too much product.\u201d Ow. Paulie\u2019s hair was stiff with gel. Colleen broke through and tousled it a bit for a slight improvement. \u201cLet\u2019s ditch this, uh...this sweater, is it?\u201d Colleen plucked at the gray fabric that swathed Paulie\u2019s muscular figure.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s a multi-look sweater,\u201d Paulie said, clutching it closed. \u201cI have six of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s face was bright red, so Colleen reached across Connor to grab a folder and began fanning her, smiling encouragingly. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. The sweater can stay. It\u2019s...it\u2019s an interesting piece.\u201d Confidence, she well knew, was the key to true beauty.</p><p>\u201cYou can wear it seventeen different ways,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cLike this, my favorite, just sort of flowing\u2014\u201d And it did flow, almost all the way to the floor, since Paulie was about five-one. \u201cAnd then you can take the ends and wrap it around your neck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Colleen said. \u201cTo hang yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you can make it even into a dress, see, like this. Or a scarf. Even a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a sock, it\u2019s a sheet, it\u2019s a bicycle seat,\u2019\u201d Connor said in a singsong voice. \u201cRemember that, Coll? The Lorax? What was that thing they made from the Truffula trees?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Thneed,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHere. Let me drape it...um...great. There!\u201d Okay, it was a weird sweater, but if Paulie thought she looked good in it....</p><p>\u201cIt hides a lot of flaws,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have flaws. You\u2019re very strong and healthy-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you can bench-press two twenty-five,\u201d Connor said, earning a kick from Colleen.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Paulie said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s great,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBut tonight, let\u2019s focus on femininity. No, don\u2019t panic. We\u2019re just planting the seeds, that\u2019s all. Just planting seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Thneeds,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Connor. Why are you still here, anyway? Go cook something.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed (finally).</p><p>\u201cNo need to be nervous, Paulie,\u201d she said more gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve known Bryce for aeons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d she muttered, her face going blotchy.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and he already likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes everyone.\u201d</p><p>True. Bryce didn\u2019t have a mean bone in his body. Or an ugly bone, either. Which was why women launched themselves at him like hypersonic missiles.</p><p>\u201cNow tonight,\u201d Colleen said, \u201cyou just want to get his attention, okay? As a woman, not as his buddy. Don\u2019t talk about sports, don\u2019t mention how much you can bench-press. Just say something like, \u2018Oh, hey, Bryce! You look really handsome tonight.\u2019\u201d</p><p>From Paulie came the sounds of a dry heave.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fine. Bryce is handsome. We all know that. So you just remind him that you\u2019re here and female and fabulous. I want you to just brush against his arm, like this, just a little swoop of the breast, okay? A breast-swoop.\u201d She demonstrated, pressing the girls lightly against Paulie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou smell great,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a perfect thing to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant you. You smell really nice.\u201d</p><p>Colleen paused. \u201cThanks. Now take a deep breath.\u201d She looked down at Paulie\u2019s kind, flushed face. \u201cThis is just the shark-bump test. Just to bring you onto his radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Shark. Radar.\u201d She was hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cBreathe in for four, hold for four, exhale for four, that\u2019s a girl. I know Bryce\u2019s usual type, and guess what? They\u2019re not right for him, are they, or else he\u2019d be married right now. Just imagine that he\u2019s been waiting for you all his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to sell it that hard, Coll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called confidence.\u201d She squeezed Paulie\u2019s hard shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I screw up? What if he laughs at me? What if I puke and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down. Remember, you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re an executive at a successful company, you have what, an MBA? Everyone likes you, Paulie. Bryce just needs a little...strategy, and he\u2019ll see you for the amazing person you are. And if you really love him, he\u2019s worth the effort, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He is.\u201d Paulie stood up a little straighter.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s go. I hate to be clich\u00e9, but I want you drinking a martini or a mojito. No more Genesee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeminine, fabulous, martini, mojito.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. And next time, wear a girly color. Not gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gray, Paulie. You came to me, remember? I\u2019m the expert. So no Thneed next time.\u201d</p><p>Paulie cracked her neck. \u201cWhat if\u2014just putting this out there\u2014what if I panic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I\u2019ll give you a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That would be so great, Colleen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do this. See?\u201d She tossed her hair back in the time-honored fertility gesture women used to get men to notice how shiny they were. \u201cHair flip equals abort, abort. You pretend your phone is ringing and you just step away. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that.\u201d</p><p>Colleen took the shorter woman by the shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re special, and he\u2019d be lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>Paulie smiled, even if her breathing was labored. She really did have a sweet smile. \u201cOkay. Thanks, Coll. If you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Now get out there and make me proud. Don\u2019t forget your lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Bryce, you smell so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, we don\u2019t want him to think he smells like meat on a grill. It\u2019s, \u2018Hi, Bryce! Don\u2019t you look handsome tonight.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Bryce, don\u2019t you look so beautiful tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome.\u201d Colleen smiled firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnd handsome, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look handsome tonight, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough. Go get \u2019em,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI\u2019ll be eavesdropping.\u201d</p><p>She held the door for Paulie and went behind the bar, pulled a Guinness for Gerard, automatically smiled at his compliment because he was a schmoozer of the first class, and watched her prot\u00e9g\u00e9.</p><p>There weren\u2019t too many people here; it was a Tuesday in late May, and the summer season hadn\u2019t really begun yet, so she had a great view.</p><p>She really hoped this went well. She owed Paulie a little happiness.</p><p>When they were in sixth grade, something happened to Paulie. Her hair turned greasy, her face broke out and she thickened without growing in height. Not a big deal. After all, Faith had epilepsy, Jessica Dunn wore hand-me-downs, Asswipe Jones\u2019s dandruff could\u2019ve been covered by The Weather Channel. Paulie\u2019s awkwardness wasn\u2019t that big a deal.</p><p>But then came The Smell. A not-very-good smell that wafted from Paulie. The other kids noticed it but didn\u2019t say anything. Not at first. But then whispers started, and Paulie seemed completely unaware, smiling, blushing, always being so damn nice.</p><p>One day, several of Colleen\u2019s crowd decided to talk to their English teacher about it. Mrs. Hess was young, pretty and nice and had a Southern accent, which they all found terribly exotic. Sure enough, the teacher listened sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI hear what y\u2019all are sayin\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s what I think should be done. It\u2019d be a genuine favor if one of y\u2019all took Miss Paulie aside and just told her the truth. Otherwise, how\u2019s she gonna know, bless her heart?\u201d</p><p>Colleen was immediately elected as the bearer of bad news. If anyone could say it, it was Colleen. Personally, Coll thought Faith would be even better at it, but no, the other girls said Colleen was good at that sort of thing. And so, the next day, Mrs. Hess asked Paulie to stay in at recess, and then said, \u201cColleen here has something she\u2019d like to discuss with you, Paulie,\u201d she said with a smile, then slipped from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Paulie asked. There was a hopeful look in her eyes, and Colleen felt her heart spasm a little. She\u2019d been sick with nervousness all day long as it was, and the greasy cafeteria pizza at lunch hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>Colleen was popular; not mean-girl popular, just really well liked. She had the glamour of being a twin, not to mention her prettiness and ease with boys. Paulie had none of those things (except that everyone thought she was nice). But already, before she said a word, Colleen knew this wasn\u2019t going to go well.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, sitting next to Paulie, who was clad in rust-colored corduroys and bedazzled sweatshirt. Damn. Faith would\u2019ve been perfect for this job...Faith the sweet, the kind, the slightly tragic, would\u2019ve had just the right touch. \u201cOkay, well, here\u2019s the thing, Paulie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t feel so good. She could almost taste the bitter smell. Didn\u2019t Paulie\u2019s mother talk to her about stuff? She cleared her throat. \u201cSome of us were talking,\u201d she said, biting her thumbnail. \u201cAnd...uh, it was about things that, um, happen to some people when you\u2019re a teenager and stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paulie frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s stomach lurched. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad, Paulie. You\u2019re really nice and smart and stuff. But, um...well...there\u2019s a certain...smell? There\u2019s a funky smell around you.\u201d She winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Paulie looked at Colleen a horrible, long minute, then bowed her head. \u201cI don\u2019t smell,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Colleen swallowed. There was that taste again. Why had the other girls elected her? Why hadn\u2019t Mrs. Hess said something instead, or had Paulie see the nurse, who could talk about hormones and whatever? \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cBut you do. It\u2019s hard to sit next to you sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho was talking about this?\u201d she whispered, and a single tear slid down her face and landed on the molded plastic desktop.</p><p>\u201cJust...a few of us. I\u2014we thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell!\u201d Paulie yelled, then pushed back from the desk and ran out of the room.</p><p>And Colleen threw up. Not because of the smell...because of shame. Shame and greasy pizza. But the rumor flashed\u2014Paulie smelled so bad that she made Colleen puke.</p><p>Paulie didn\u2019t come back to school for the rest of the week, and Colleen had never felt so small. She told only Connor about the conversation, and when he said, \u201cOh, Coll,\u201d she knew for sure she\u2019d done something terrible.</p> <p>Later that month, they learned that Paulie had bigger problems. Her mother had run off with another man, and Paulie would be living with her dad from now on. When she returned to school, she had a new haircut. Her clothes were better, and the smell was still there, but it was fainter. Eventually, it went away altogether.</p><p>A thousand times, Colleen wanted to apologize; a thousand times, she convinced herself that it was kinder not to bring it up. In tenth grade, they were assigned to the same group for a social studies project, and Paulie couldn\u2019t have been nicer.</p><p>So if Colleen wanted to help Paulie with her love life, who could blame her?</p><p>Paulie stood in the vicinity of Bryce\u2019s usual spot at the bar. Gerard said hi to her, but Paulie didn\u2019t answer, just stared at Colleen as if she was facing a firing squad.</p><p>\u201cHow about a mojito, Paulie?\u201d she said cheerfully, tossing some mint into a glass.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Paulie mumbled, rubbing her hands on her sweater.</p> <p>And then in came Bryce Campbell, all easy male grace, tall and lanky, dressed in a white polo shirt and jeans. He waved and made his way to his usual place at the horseshoe-style bar. A strangled noise came from Paulie.</p><p>Colleen handed her the drink. \u201cHey, Bryce, don\u2019t you look handsome tonight,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cColl, you could whisper to me?\u201d Gerard said. \u201cI can think of a whole bunch of things I\u2019d like you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush, child, I\u2019m talking to my friend,\u201d she answered. She gave Paulie a firm smile. \u201cNow\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d Paulie whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. Can you do it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019re in third grade, and you want me to tell him you like him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come on now. Handsome, shark, boobs, smile. And then you\u2019re done. Now go.\u201d</p><p>With a faint groan, Paulie inched toward Bryce, who was at the end of the bar, talking to Jessica Dunn. Hmm. Jess was way too pretty, all blonde and super-modelesque, Bryce\u2019s usual type.</p><p>Paulie stopped just behind him and shot Colleen a terrified glance and appeared to freeze. Luckily, Hannah was behind the bar, too, so Colleen boob-skimmed her.</p><p>\u201cGet your boobs off me. Sexual harassment and all that,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d She smiled firmly at Paulie, who took a deep breath, swung her shoulders and bodychecked him right off his stool, Jessica Dunn stepping neatly aside as Bryce sprawled on the floor. Colleen\u2019s view was all too clear. \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d Paulie said. She reached down to help him up, tripped on the dangling end of the Thneed, stepped on Bryce\u2019s hand and spilled her mojito right onto his head. \u201cShit! Shit!\u201d</p><p>So much for soft and feminine. Colleen tossed her hair for the \u201cabort\u201d sign. Paulie didn\u2019t notice, Gerard was wheezing with laughter, one of those guys who loved nothing more than the physical pain of others (he was a paramedic, after all). Now Paulie was hauling Bryce to his feet, but she was too strong, and she yanked him not only up, but slammed him into the bar, causing the hanging glasses to rattle and sway.</p><p>Colleen tossed her hair again. Coughed. Coughed again more loudly. Tossed. Coughed. Tossed. Cough \u2019n\u2019 tossed.</p><p>\u201cWow, Paulie, easy does it, okay?\u201d Bryce said, rubbing his arm at the shoulder. Paulie\u2019s face was broiling-red. She took both ends of the Thneed and twisted them in anguish.</p><p>Another hair toss, this one so hard Colleen thought she might\u2019ve dislocated her neck, and still Paulie didn\u2019t see her. Colleen threw up her hands</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a low voice behind her.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s heart froze, as though she\u2019d swallowed a large ice cube, and it was stuck right over her heart.</p><p>She turned around.</p><p>Yep. Lucas Campbell.</p><p>None other. Standing approximately two feet from her, looking at her with those knowing, dark eyes.</p><p>Her skin suddenly felt tight. Mouth: dry. Brain: dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Colleen?\u201d Lucas asked again.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said as if it hadn\u2019t been ten years since she\u2019d last seen him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go see your cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to my cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to your cousin.\u201d So mature. And did they have nothing else to say to each other? Ten years apart? A river of tears (hers) and blood (his...well, she wished it was his blood).</p><p>Lucas just looked at her, his pirate eyes unreadable.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Of all the gin joints in all the world, she started thinking, then squelched a blossom of slightly hysterical laughter.</p><p>Lucas Damien Campbell was here. Here in her bar. You think he could\u2019ve called? Would that have been so much to ask, huh? Hmm? Would it? Hey, Colleen, I\u2019m coming to visit my cousin, so be prepared, okay?</p><p>Colleen took a ragged breath, then coughed to cover. Unfortunately, the cough became genuine, and tears came to her eyes as she hacked and choked.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked in that ridiculously sexy, river-of-dark-chocolate voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she wheezed, wiping her eyes. \u201cJust great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He dragged his eyes off of hers and looked over at the little knot of people at the end of the bar; Jess was laughing, Bryce smiling and Paulie looked like she was praying for a swift death.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to fix Bryce up with Paulina Petrosinsky?\u201d he asked. Damn. She\u2019d forgotten how...observant he was.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, proud of getting that one word out.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You are.\u201d He raised an eyebrow, and her knees wobbled. Sphincter! He was here. Here and beautiful, and damn it, older. A decade older than the last time she\u2019d seen him, and yet it seemed like yesterday when he\u2019d walked with her down to the lake and broke her heart. Irreparably, the bastard.</p><p>Her breath wanted to rush out of her lungs, but she held it in carefully, not wanting to induce another sexy choking fit.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten how he looked, like a pirate, like Heathcliff of the moors, dark and slightly dangerous...except for his eyes, which could be so sad. And so happy, too.</p><p>His black hair was slightly shorter than it had been years ago, but still gypsy beautiful, curling and black. He\u2019d lost his boyish skinniness, had broadened in the shoulders. He hadn\u2019t shaved today, and he seemed taller now than he had back then.</p><p>Back when he loved her.</p><p>He seemed to read her mind, because something flickered through his eyes.</p><p>In the year after Lucas left her, Bryce would come into the bar and mention him occasionally. Went to see my cousin last weekend, or Hey, Lucas is taking me and Dad to a White Sox game! Finally, in a rare show of vulnerability, Colleen had asked him not to talk about Lucas anymore. And in an even rarer show of understanding, Bryce seemed to get it.</p><p>She knew he was married. No kids\u2014surely Smiling Joe Campbell would\u2019ve mentioned that. She knew he worked for his father-in-law. That was about it.</p><p>She had told him never to call her again, never to write, and he took her at her word.</p><p>And now, her heart was jackhammering in her chest, and though she hoped like hell her heart wasn\u2019t written all over her face, she was...terrified.</p><p>Lucas took a breath. \u201cColleen, I\u2019m only back in town because Joe asked me to come. I imagine you know he\u2019s pretty sick.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave an unwilling tug. \u201cI do,\u201d she said, then, fearing that sounded a little too matrimonial, she added, \u201cKnow he\u2019s sick. I do know he\u2019s sick, I mean. He\u2019s sick, I know it, the dialysis, not easy, I guess, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her Tourette\u2019s of Terror, Connor called it when she babbled. Not that she was terrified often, but hell, she certainly was now.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He glanced again at Bryce\u2014right, right, there was something going on with Bryce tonight, whatever\u2014then looked at Colleen again. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same,\u201d she answered.</p><p>His mouth tugged on one side, causing a respondent tug in her special places. Five more minutes, and she\u2019d be back in love.</p><p>\u201cBryce doesn\u2019t need more complications in his life right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by complications, you mean what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Chicken King\u2019s virgin daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cool! That sounds like a Harlequin romance. I would definitely read that.\u201d The Chicken King\u2019s virgin daughter was nowhere to be seen at the moment. \u201cAnd how do you know Paulie\u2019s a virgin, huh? Maybe she\u2019s the town slut.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. This wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019s the town slut.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cWhat are you implying, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a strange look. \u201cNothing. Just that Paulie doesn\u2019t seem like the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if she is a slut, huh? Maybe Bryce likes sluts.\u201d Time to shut up now, Connor\u2019s voice\u2014her conscience\u2014advised sagely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your problem, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to have a rational conversation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I haven\u2019t seen you in ten years, and you just waltz into my bar and start insulting me and bossing me around. I do know about your uncle and how sick he is, because guess what? I visit him. I like him. I bring him magazines and cookies, and he likes my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, so just...you just, um, put that in your pipe and suck on it.\u201d Smooth, O\u2019Rourke. She tried to look haughty and dignified. \u201cMaybe I happen to think that Bryce needs someone to help him through this difficult time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he has other things to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to one side. \u201cI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re still mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave my cousin alone, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his beautiful (damn them) eyes and walked over to Bryce, hugging him.</p><p>Humph. He hadn\u2019t hugged her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop being stupid, shall we?\u201d she muttered to herself.</p><p>Lucas said something, then smiled. Shit, that was a good smile. Hardly ever saw it, that was the trick. She, on the other hand, smiled like a pubescent monkey or jackal or hyena or some other animal that smiled a lot. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked Victor Iskin, a regular at the bar who had a well-documented love of animals. \u201cDo hyenas smile more than monkeys?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a hyena right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that you do, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen!

She heard an odd sound; it was her, sucking air.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>Colleen gave herself a mental shake. \u201cHey. Paulie. How\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knocked him down, stepped on his hand, spilled a drink on his head, yanked his arm, hurled him into the bar and then hid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Colleen murmured.</p><p>Paulie frowned, then looked at Colleen more closely. \u201cWho was that? The guy you were talking to. He looked familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s Bryce\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I remember him! Lucas, right?\u201d Paulie ran a hand through her hair. \u201cYou were together, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit. Are you still in love with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your special places tingling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? No. No, that\u2019s...of course not.

A long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d give anything to have Bryce look at me the way Lucas was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to have Bryce fight with me that way.\u201d Paulie raised her eyebrows.</p><p>A change of subject was definitely needed. \u201cOkay, so tonight\u2019s Bryce encounter didn\u2019t go as planned,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is, you got his attention, right? That\u2019s the first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first step in his filing a restraining order against me, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, come on. Bryce probably doesn\u2019t know what a restraining order is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dumb, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>Colleen winced. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. Sorry. Anyway, you were memorable, so it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>As she and Paulie talked, there was another voice in her head. Common sense, call it. Don\u2019t fall for those eyes again. Don\u2019t notice his hands, or his mouth. Those are just tricks. We\u2019re not doing this again.</p><p>Already, it felt like she was in a whole lotta trouble.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THE FIRST TIME she ever saw Lucas Damien Campbell, Colleen fell in love.</p><p>Not that she was a believer in that kind of thing.</p><p>Even at the tender age of eleven, when her mother had sobbed through yet another sappy romantic comedy, Colleen pointed out the fact that the characters had known each other for only six days, so it was a little hard to buy into the whole everlasting soul mate philosophy. In seventh grade, Tim Jansen sent her a letter full of hyperbolic compliments (\u201cyour eyes are shinier than a mirror,\u201d which Colleen thought was creepy and hoped wasn\u2019t true) and anguished love (\u201cI feel like my heart will explode when you smile at me\u201d). She patted his hand and said he probably should take up a sport to channel some of that energy.</p><p>High school was no different, though the boys abruptly grew taller...despite the abundance of hormones, despite her abiding love for Robert Downey, Jr., Colleen remained above the fray. No, she\u2019d rather hang out with her brother, laugh at his friends, and watch Faith and Jeremy, the perfect couple, with fondness and a satisfying bit of melancholy. By the time she was a senior, virtually every boy in Manningsport had asked her out and received a kindly \u201cno.\u201d Love\u2014especially the sloppy, frenching-in-the-halls type\u2014was not meant for Colleen Margaret Mary O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not going to prom?\u201d her mother asked one night around the family dinner table. Con was going with Sherry Wong, a mathlete like himself. \u201cHasn\u2019t anyone asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine guys have asked her, Ma,\u201d Connor offered, taking another shovelful of mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d Colleen said easily. \u201cDrama, rayon dresses, crepe paper, the inevitable tears. I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Dad said with an approving nod. Connor sighed, and Colleen could feel his mood drop several degrees. It was no secret that Colleen was their father\u2019s favorite.</p><p>People like them, Dad said once in a while, were too smart for that. Just what that was, Colleen wasn\u2019t sure, but she was flattered to be included. Her father\u2019s approval was everything. Connor was smart, too\u2014smarter, at least according to his grades, but \u201cwe think alike,\u201d Dad would say.</p><p>Pete O\u2019Rourke was still handsome enough to get stares from women of all ages\u2014black Irish, the same clear gray eyes Colleen had, unlike Connor\u2019s blue. He was the youngest of his family, widely viewed to be the star of the family by his older sisters, who fussed over him at family gatherings, getting him plates of food as if he were an invalid, cooing over his latest real estate coup. In town, men shook his hand, laughed loudly at his jokes, came to him for advice\u2014Dad owned six of the fifteen commercial buildings in town.</p><p>Mom was still sappily infatuated with him, which Colleen found both cute and annoying. When his car pulled into the driveway, she\u2019d rush to ditch her slippers, shove her feet into heels and put on lipstick. If he commented on her appearance, \u201cJeanette, is that a new hairstyle?\u201d She\u2019d flush with pleasure. \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d she\u2019d say, not quite noticing that it wasn\u2019t exactly a compliment. And Dad would give Colleen a little wink of collusion, which made her feel simultaneously guilty and clever.</p><p>Mom never finished college, knocked up in the great tradition of the O\u2019Rourke family. She worked part-time for an interior designer and actually could\u2019ve joined the firm; her boss quite liked her, but she always said no. \u201cYour father is such a good provider,\u201d she\u2019d say.</p><p>Slightly overweight, she\u2019d go on fad diets before the holidays or the annual Manningsport Black &amp; White Ball, get her hair done, buy a new dress...but still, Mom always looked a little older, a little frumpier, a little less certain than Dad. Pete O\u2019Rourke was, there was no mistaking it, one of those guys who got better with age, Manningsport\u2019s version of Pierce Brosnan: the graying hair, the extreme good looks.</p><p>To Colleen, the best compliment she could get was that she was her father\u2019s girl. Except when Mom said it, for some reason; there\u2019d be a slight and rare tinge of bitterness in her voice. Then again, Mom loved Connor best. It was only fair.</p><p>So yeah, a high school romance, prom, and all that...leave that for the other girls: Theresa and Faith, who\u2019d marry their high school honeys, no doubt. Let other girls worry over boys (or girls, in the case of Deirdre and Tiffy). Colleen would give advice to the girls, deflect advances from the boys, cheerful and observant and not at all lonely...not with a twin and a best friend and adoring father. It was exactly how she wanted things.</p><p>And then she met Lucas Campbell.</p><p>It was big news, of course. Manningsport had a tiny year-round population; just about any change was cause for excitement.</p><p>\u201cKids,\u201d said Mrs. Wheaton, their beleaguered English teacher, adjusting her corduroy (ouch) jumper, \u201cwe have two new students joining our class shortly.\u201d She consulted her paperwork. \u201cBryce and Lucas Campbell. Uh...cousins, it says here. Please be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Bryce a boy\u2019s name?\u201d Tanya Cross asked. She wasn\u2019t tremendously bright.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mrs. Wheaton asked. \u201cNow, getting back to Hamlet. Does anyone have an opinion on Ophelia?\u201d</p><p>No one bothered answering. A ripple went through the class. Two new members of the senior class? Jeremy Lyon had transferred in last summer, and look how totally awesome he was! Could lightning strike twice? The girls began either whispering to or ignoring each other. Posture: improved. Hair: tossed. Legs: crossed. Lips: licked.</p><p>The guys in the class exchanged glances, aware that two new roosters in the henhouse would shift the dynamic. Well, not all the boys. Asswipe Jones was sleeping (hungover, probably), and Levi Cooper stared at Jessica with that hot look of his. Jeremy was running a hand through his own dark hair.</p><p>As for Colleen, she didn\u2019t need to sit up or lick or cross. She already had it going on. (False modesty\u2014not one of her flaws.) Still, she too glanced at the door. Just because she didn\u2019t want to date anyone didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t want to be acknowledged as, yes, the prettiest girl in high school, the funniest and the most sought-after.</p><p>The door opened, and in came the newbies.</p><p>There was a stunned silence, then a collective murmur.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Tanya breathed.</p><p>Yep, the first guy was a looker. Blue, blue eyes, sweet smile, dark brown hair that was styled but not too embarrassing. Dimple in his left cheek. Were Colleen the dating type, she\u2019d probably be all over that. His eyes stopped on her, his smile widened, which was gratifying. Colleen allowed a faint smile back. The not-quite-catty thought came to her\u2014she could have him if she wanted. Which she didn\u2019t, but still.</p><p>Then she noticed the second guy. Her smile faltered.</p><p>Holy St. Patrick. Her face didn\u2019t change (she hoped), but her body was...was doing things. Stomach tightened, mouth dried, knees (and other parts) tingled. She acknowledged the feelings from afar because her brain couldn\u2019t quite function at the moment.</p><p>He looked a lot like the other boy, but he was darker. Not quite as good-looking...well, no. Not quite as perfect, but a lot more compelling. Black hair instead of brown, olive skin and deep, dark eyes.</p><p>He looked like a Spanish pirate. Like a Romany gypsy. Like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, and like Heathcliff, there was something about his expression that said he knew things, saw things, that he wasn\u2019t as sweet or as easy or as simple as the boy who stood next to him.</p><p>\u201cNow, which one of you is Bryce?\u201d Mrs. Wheaton asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d said the blue-eyed guy. \u201cThis is my cousin Lucas. He lives with us.\u201d And even though Bryce made the introduction, it was Lucas who shook hands with Mrs. W. first, causing his cousin to follow suit, and Colleen could sense the dynamic: Lucas, the cousin who lived with \u201cus,\u201d was in charge.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d the gypsy boy said, and Colleen just about slid out of her chair in lust. Because that voice, good God, did eighteen-year-old boys really get to sound like that? It was deep and mellow and just a little rough and caused a reverberation in Colleen\u2019s special places, and what the hell would happen if he actually spoke to her?</p><p>\u201cWelcome, boys,\u201d Mrs. Wheaton said. \u201cFind a seat, if you\u2019d be so kind.\u201d There was a tremendous screech as the female half of the class pushed their chairs back to make room for the newcomers.</p><p>Lucas went past Colleen, and it was horrifying, embarrassing, thrilling to have her heart pound so hard. He smelled like soap and sunshine and wore faded jeans and black Converse, and that was all she saw because she didn\u2019t dare look at him. Don\u2019t talk to me, don\u2019t talk to me, her brain chanted. He didn\u2019t, just went past to the back of the room, the longest four seconds of her life. Her cheeks burned\u2014honestly, a boy making her cheeks burn? This never happened!\u2014and she stared at the words in her book. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p><p>Preach it, Ophelia.</p><p>Where was he? Was he looking at her? Who was he sitting next to? A girl? Probably a girl. Jessica? She always sat in the back. She\u2019d probably already given him her number. They were probably already planning a hookup, because everyone knew Jess just used Levi for sex. Would the Spanish pirate boy go for someone like that? Colleen would lose all respect, not that she had any just yet, but you know, she could already feel herself getting mad, boys were so stupid, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Bryce asked. He\u2019d sat down next to her, and she hadn\u2019t quite noticed.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Colleen. Welcome to Manningsport.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d he said with an easy grin.</p><p>Where was Lucas? What was he thinking? Would he like her, too? Because it was obvious that what\u2019s-his-name, Bryce, already did, though he was now talking to Tanya, who was being super-duper helpful and sharing her copy of Hamlet with him, pressing her boob against his arm. Colleen hoped he liked the smell of Eternity perfume, because Tanya practically bathed in it.</p><p>She wanted very much to turn around and see the gypsy boy. Also, she should probably stop referring to him as pirate or gypsy. Even mentally.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn. She was too smart for that, as Dad pointed out.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t feel so smart now.</p><p>For the next thirty-one minutes, she tried to concentrate on Hamlet. Never before had she been quite so interested in the words coming out of Mrs. Wheaton\u2019s mouth. Not that she could actually understand them, mind you, but Colleen assiduously took notes, keeping her handwriting tidy, mentally repeating phrases like \u201cpreoccupation with death,\u201d \u201ctheme of decomposition.\u201d And in the meantime, her entire body pulsed with hot, almost painful throbs and a vague sense of danger, the same as last summer, when they\u2019d gone swimming on Cape Cod the day after a shark attack. Just because you couldn\u2019t see it, didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cCome on, idiot,\u201d her brother said, nudging her head with his backpack. \u201cPhysics lab. Snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Class had ended, then. Lucas and Bryce were talking to Mrs. Wheaton. Colleen stood up and gave her brother a look. \u201cI was taking notes. Thank me later when I save you from flunking the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need notes,\u201d Connor said, going on ahead.</p> <p>She carefully didn\u2019t look at Lucas...well, not directly. Wouldn\u2019t want to give the impression that she couldn\u2019t look at Lucas, so she did the drive-by glance...gaze just skimming the face, looking away the instant before his eyes could meet hers, a faint smile on her face, so very pleasant. \u201cBye, Mrs. Wheaton,\u201d she said. \u201cBye, boys.\u201d Because Colleen O\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t bothered by the male species. She was too smart for that.</p><p>For the next three weeks, Colleen managed not to speak to Lucas Campbell. Bryce, she found, was as friendly as Smiley, the Holland family\u2019s Golden retriever, and about as smart. Bryce was quite beautiful and fun to look at, and she found herself flirting with him harmlessly, same as she did with all the other boys. He could volley it back pretty well, though most of her jokes went over his head. Still, he had long eyelashes and beautiful blue eyes and always seemed happy.</p><p>His cousin...well, Colleen didn\u2019t know what he was like. She gave him the occasional drive-by, not wanting to ignore him outright because of what that might reveal.</p><p>Tanya Cross who was as determined as she was irritating, asked Bryce to the prom. Bryce then sealed Tanya\u2019s bitchery by asking Colleen if she\u2019d go with him, and could she give an answer because \u201cthat Tanya chick wants to go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal,\u201d she said, patting him on the arm like a fond auntie. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my thing. You go with Tanya. She\u2019s sweet.\u201d Which Tanya wasn\u2019t, but it wouldn\u2019t be nice to say so...plus, it would irritate Tanya all the more to know that Colleen had been totally classy.</p><p>Had Lucas asked her to go, her answer might\u2019ve been a lot different.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t going and had turned down four girls before it had been ascertained that no, he wasn\u2019t waiting for someone else to ask him; he just wasn\u2019t going. This, of course, was widely and voraciously analyzed every time two or more girls gathered in a classroom, hall, cafeteria, gym, bakery, school bus or mall and via phone, text, email, sign language and smoke signals.</p><p>Oh, the delicious and frustrating mystery of it! No one knew why Lucas lived with Bryce. Their fathers were brothers, and Bryce said only that \u201cit worked out best.\u201d Bryce\u2019s mother worked for an insurance company that had a branch in Corning, a half hour away; hence the senior-year move from Illinois.</p><p>Bryce\u2019s dad was the one who showed up at Bryce\u2019s soccer games, sitting with his nephew, talking easily. The fondness between them was reassuring to Colleen. Lucas Campbell was no Heathcliff (thank heavens, because she knew how irresistible those types were).</p><p>Still, Lucas had a tinge of tragedy about him: his own mother dead; details of the father unknown, though speculated upon greatly\u2014mafioso, movie star, eccentric billionaire, prison, g*y, defrocked priest. Coll pretended not to listen but ate up every word.</p><p>The week before prom was consumed with talk of dresses, hairstyles, shoes and how to stop a guy from going too far. Despite her own utter lack of experience, Colleen was asked for advice and doled it out, sounding quite expert to her own ears\u2014tell him beforehand how far you\u2019re comfortable going, or just say, \u201cthat\u2019s far enough,\u201d no, don\u2019t french on the dance floor, it\u2019s so tacky, and whatever you do, don\u2019t have unprotected sex.</p><p>On prom night, she took pictures of Connor, helped Sherry pin on his corsage because Sherry had it bad for Con and couldn\u2019t quite manage it as her hands were shaking. Colleen wished them a merry prom and waved with her parents as the limo pulled away, filled with the other four couples as well as Con and Sherry. \u201cKids today. They grow so fast,\u201d she sighed happily. \u201cWhat are we doing tonight, parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d watch movies,\u201d Mom said hopefully. \u201cI made Rice Krispies treats.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hooray,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cDad? You in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to check on some properties,\u201d he said a bit tersely.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll come and help,\u201d Colleen offered, a twinge of guilt at instantly changing plans. \u201cWe can watch movies a little later, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Mom said with forced good cheer. \u201cI\u2019ll tag along, too.\u201d She frowned, her sweet face soft.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll go alone. You girls stay here,\u201d he said in that voice he used when he was irritated.</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Colleen said, keeping her voice light. Experience had shown that when Dad was in a bad mood, there was no point in arguing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. We\u2019ll go with you, and we can all get some dinner afterward, and it\u2019ll be really fun?\u201d Mom suggested, her voice ending in a question mark. Colleen wished she wouldn\u2019t be like that.</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019ll go alone. Okay? I have some business to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Mom said, and Colleen had to stifle an eye roll. She loved her mom, of course, but...well. \u201cOf course, Pete! We\u2019ll keep the home fires warm.\u201d</p><p>Dad forced a smile, then kissed Colleen\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure the other girls are glad you\u2019re not going tonight, honey. All their dates would be after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Colleen said. It was a slightly insulting insinuation\u2014she\u2019d never steal someone else\u2019s guy, and she liked to think that most other girls quite adored her\u2014but she knew Dad meant it as a compliment.</p><p>And so she and Mom ate the sticky treats and admired Matthew McConaughey\u2019s abs, Mom sitting with the house phone and her cell on the arm of her chair, just in case Dad changed his mind.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, but around eleven, the phone rang. It was Faith, urging her to come to the after party at her boyfriend\u2019s lovely house.</p><p>\u201cOkay if I go up to the Lyons\u2019, Ma?\u201d she asked her dozing mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Mom said. \u201cDid your father call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Why don\u2019t you go to bed? Con and I will be home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to take the car?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll walk.\u201d Jeremy only lived a half mile away from the O\u2019Rourke house, and she could get a ride home.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Make sure you\u2019re smart, sweetheart.\u201d Her code for \u201cdon\u2019t drink, don\u2019t do drugs, don\u2019t have unprotected sex, don\u2019t get kidnapped, don\u2019t eat tuna fish\u201d (she had a strange fear of tuna, for some reason).</p><p>\u201cI was born smart.\u201d She kissed her mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>The Lyon parents were exceptional hosts; nothing was more fun than one of their parties because they were the cool parents\u2014the kind who knew how to be welcoming and funny and also how to disappear and let the kids do their thing.</p><p>The entire senior class was there, it seemed, and gourmet pizzas were being served, in addition to three kinds of green salad, ciabatta sandwiches and designer pop, and yards and yards of organic snack food and desserts. \u201cHi, Mrs. Lyon,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThanks for having us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, why on earth didn\u2019t you go to your prom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have an old soul,\u201d Colleen answered, getting a fond chuckle as a reply.</p><p>Most of her classmates were in the huge finished basement. \u2019N Sync played from the hidden speakers, and a fire crackled in the stone fireplace. Colleen saw Connor, who was nodding as Sherry talked. He shot her a look that she read perfectly, courtesy of their psychic twin connection\u2014I\u2019m dying here, curse of the nice guy, please save me. She blinked at him. You should\u2019ve listened to me, shmuck-o. Suffer on. He responded with a subtle middle finger. But hey! She\u2019d warned him. Sherry had had a crush on Connor since preschool, something Connor had refuted until a few weeks ago.</p><p>Faith and Jeremy were snuggled on the couch, the golden couple, prom king and queen, of course, as if anyone else had a chance. Some guys were playing pool while their dates gossiped or sulked in a gaggle nearby. Funny thing about prom; no one ever had as much fun as they were supposed to. Except Faith and Jeremy, of course.</p><p>Bryce Campbell, looking pretty beautiful in his tux, gave her a sloppy wave. Colleen instantly pegged him as being a bit drunk. Must\u2019ve snuck in some booze, because the Lyon elders would\u2019ve called his parents if they\u2019d noticed he\u2019d been drinking. Tanya added a sharp look and put her arm around Bryce\u2019s waist. Please. Colleen was so not the type to swoop in and ruin someone\u2019s night. She drifted over to them. \u201cYou look gorgeous, Tanya!\u201d she said, getting a fake smile from the girl. \u201cAnd you, pal, very handsome.\u201d She leaned in. \u201cNo more drinking here, got it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd no driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, Coll,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>She got a bottle of Virgil\u2019s root beer, made the rounds, admired the gowns of the girls, winked at the boys and generally schmoozed, comfortable as the grand dame of the senior class. Part of things, but above them. A modern-day Emma, her favorite Jane Austen heroine. She ascertained that her brother was still trapped as Sherry moved in to try to kiss him, and once again smilingly rejected his silent plea for help. Revenge for the time he locked her in the cedar closet for six hours when they were ten.</p><p>At about midnight, it was decided by half the group that a visit to the lake was in order; for one, it was a gorgeous May night, the sky gleaming with stars, the air soft and gentle and just cool enough for cuddling; and two, those who wanted to have sex or drink could drift off to wherever without getting busted by Mr. and Mrs. Lyon. The good kids stayed put, and Colleen figured she would, too.</p><p>Until she saw Bryce Campbell fumbling for his keys.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d she said, earning yet another glare from Tanya. \u201cYou\u2019re not driving, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine, don\u2019t even worry about me,\u201d he slurred. So much for her warning. Was there a creature on earth more stupid than an eighteen-year-old boy? \u201cI\u2019m totally fine, Colleen. You\u2019re pretty, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not driving. Let Tanya... Oh, right.\u201d Tanya had flunked her driver\u2019s test three times already.</p><p>Colleen could tell the Lyons, of course. But then they\u2019d call Bryce\u2019s parents, and who wanted to be the kid who turned in a friend?</p><p>\u201cHow about if I drive, then?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Colleen,\u201d Tanya said. She really was quite dim. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour date\u2019s not sober, sweets.

Goofball.</p><p>Jeremy and Faith walked everyone to the door, already acting like a married couple, and Mr. and Mrs. Lyon waved good-night and told everyone to drive safely.</p><p>Colleen got into Bryce\u2019s car (a red Mustang convertible, really, did his parents want him to die in a fiery crash?), and Tanya and Bryce got in back. Bryce took a brown paper bag from under the seat, unscrewed the cap of the bottle inside and took a pull, then offered some to Tanya, who accepted.</p> <p>\u201cUnderage drinking, children,\u201d she said mildly. \u201cIllegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLighten up,\u201d Tanya said.</p><p>Kids today. No respect. Good thing they had her to watch over them and get them home. And sure, it was fun to drive the Mustang.</p><p>The gathering at the lake was on a private beach; the owner was a summer person who surely wouldn\u2019t mind if the Manningsport youth used her property. Colleen parked the Stang on the street and followed the path down to the lake, the sound of peepers shrill and sweet.</p><p>The party was already in progress; Asswipe Jones lit a fire on the small beach, and a radio was playing. Two or three couples were out on the dock, smooching. There was laughter and a shriek as Angela Mitchum\u2019s date, a kid from Corning, picked her up and threatened to throw her in the water.</p> <p>Bryce and Tanya weren\u2019t the only ones drinking. Colleen made the rounds and ensured that those who were had a ride with a sober driver; most of the kids had come via limo; Colleen had seen one parked on the street, the driver smoking a cigarette and talking on the phone.</p><p>After a while, most of the couples left. It had gotten colder, and the night was winding down. There were still a few couples left\u2014the drinkers, naturally.</p><p>Sigh. The curse of the designated driver. She\u2019d volunteered, after all. She checked her phone, hoping to call Con to alleviate her boredom. No cell service down here, though.</p><p>Stifling a yawn, she sat down on the sand, which was a little chilly. The stars stretched and blazed above, and a comet streaked across the eastern sky, and then her eyes were closed.</p><p>She awoke to the sound of angry voices.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, pretty boy,\u201d someone was saying. Great. It was Jake Green, one of the too-privileged lacrosse players. He\u2019d been the first of the nine who\u2019d asked Colleen to the prom and was now talking to Bryce out on the dock.</p> <p>Colleen got up. Tanya was sitting with her head in her hands, crying. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Colleen said, putting an arm around her. \u201cHoney? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy shoe broke,\u201d Tanya sobbed. \u201cSee?\u201d She held it up for inspection. \u201cThe heel just snapped. And they\u2019re so pretty!\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed. People who couldn\u2019t hold their liquor really shouldn\u2019t drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?\u201d She pointed to the dock.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Tanya mumbled, tears falling on the wounded shoe. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Bryce and we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With that, she lay down on the sand, her wounded shoe cradled against her chest, and closed her eyes.</p><p>The voices were louder now. The moon had risen higher, fat and full, shining across the lake in a wide path of white light, allowing Colleen to see who was out there with Bryce. In addition to Jake were his minions (because all irritating rich boys had to have minions)\u2014Jase Ross and Chris Eckbert\u2014Crabbe and Goyle to Jake\u2019s Draco Malfoy. Their three dates appeared to have left.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re mad. I meant it as a compliment,\u201d Bryce said.</p> <p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re here?\u201d Jake sneered. \u201cI thought you were too good for the prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not too good, Jake. I\u2019m only here as a designated driver. Speaking of that, Bryce, can we go? I\u2019m tired, and Tanya is, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, O\u2019Rourke,\u201d Jake said. \u201cMind your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mad at me,\u201d Bryce whispered (loudly). \u201cI told him I thought he looked like Cameron Diaz.\u201d</p><p>Colleen bit down on a smile. Jake was indeed blond and blue-eyed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be sorry you said that, idiot,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk, Jake. And you do look like Cameron Diaz, right, Crabbe? Right, Goyle?\u201d She smiled at Jase and Chris, who, uncertain of how to respond, glanced at Jake.</p><p>\u201cBryce, let\u2019s get going,\u201d she said, starting toward him. He answered with a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jake said, and then put his hand on Bryce\u2019s chest and shoved, almost gently.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Bryce murmured. His legs buckled, and Colleen realized that at some point, Bryce had gone from sloppy to shit-faced. This was confirmed when he lay back on the dock. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d Jake echoed in a high-pitched voice. \u201cI bet you don\u2019t, pu**y.\u201d His minions laughed, and Jake gave a tentative kick to Bryce\u2019s ribs.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off!\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bryce said faintly, sounding more surprised than hurt.</p><p>She took a step toward them, stopping as Jake turned and looked at her, a speculative expression drifting over his face.</p><p>The cold lance of fear that slid through her stomach was almost alarming.</p><p>Jake was in front of her. Jase and Chris were behind her.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>That was the thing about life in a small town. Once, they\u2019d all been friends, more or less\u2014all forty-nine kids in the senior class, back in the day of Halloween parties and field trips to the local cemetery. But somewhere in high school, things changed. Cliques formed, circles closed, and before you knew it, you could lose track of a person.</p><p>And Colleen had definitely lost track of Jake. She\u2019d rebuffed him a few times, starting in seventh grade, not liking his rich-boy superiority, his casual dismissal of the girls who liked him. Chris and Jase, too, had never been her favorites. Chris wasn\u2019t that bad, just kind of a jerk. But Jase had a mean streak, too.</p><p>Suddenly, they seemed...dangerous.</p><p>Without looking away from her, Jake gave Bryce another oddly gentle kick, as if trying to see if he enjoyed it. Bryce appeared to have passed out.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019d drown if we rolled him in the lake?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>The minions snickered</p><p>This night was heading south. Fast.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough, boys,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cHelp me get him to the car.\u201d Yes. Give them the chance to be on her side, to change the dynamic.</p><p>Chris and Jase didn\u2019t move, waiting for instructions from their leader.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re better than everyone, don\u2019t you, Colleen?\u201d Jake said softly, looking her up and down.</p><p>And all of a sudden, Colleen was\u2014there was no more denying it\u2014genuinely scared. Her knees buzzed, and her heart kicked in her chest.</p><p>\u201cJake, come on,\u201d she said, and she hated the fact that her voice shook. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. This prom sucked, and I want some fun.\u201d Another kick to Bryce, resulting in a soft grunt and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d she said, her voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do for us if we don\u2019t?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Colleen swallowed.</p><p>There was no cell service down here.</p><p>Tanya was sleeping on the shore.</p><p>And no one else was around.</p><p>If only Connor had come, because she always felt stronger and smarter when her twin was around. Connor would die before letting anyone hurt her. If only Jeremy was here, because he was tall and strong and honorable. Or Levi Cooper, who was badass and had a protective streak. Or Big Frankie, or any number of nicer, more decent boys.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t. She was on her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came down here, O\u2019Rourke,\u201d Jake said. \u201cGuys, aren\u2019t you glad? Coll, so nice of you to come! Yeah, I think we can all use a little fun, sure. And everyone knows how much fun you are.\u201d His eyes drifted down her body, then up again, stopping on her br**sts.</p><p>Jesus God in Heaven.</p><p>You read about stuff like this. Saw those awful reports on CNN. Stuff like this happened all the time, and it was beyond belief. But Jake wouldn\u2019t\u2014and Jase and Chris, they wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>She could run...except Jase and Chris were blocking the way. Even if she managed to get past them, which was unlikely, she\u2019d have to leave Bryce to their mercy. She could jump in the lake and swim, but the water would be cold, maybe cold enough to stop her from thinking clearly. What if she drowned, and even if she didn\u2019t, where would she swim? How far? Could she make it somewhere safe? What if they just waited for her wherever she came to shore?</p><p>This wasn\u2019t really happening. She knew these boys. She\u2019d gone to kindergarten with them. They wouldn\u2019t actually\u2014</p><p>Jake took off his tuxedo jacket.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>The word she hadn\u2019t wanted to think now reared up in searing color.</p><p>Raped. She could end up raped. The image throbbed in her brain like a tumor, blotting out everything else. Three against one.</p><p>She turned around to face the minions. Jase weighed upward of two hundred and fifty pounds; he\u2019d been a tackle on the football team. The regional division championship football team. Chris was smaller, but still had a good forty or fifty pounds on her. \u201cChris, remember that field trip to the glass museum? When we sat together?\u201d For a second, he looked uncertain.</p><p>Oh, please, please help me, Chris, you weren\u2019t always a bad kid\u2014</p><p>\u201cCome on, Colleen, let\u2019s have a little fun,\u201d Jake said from behind her, and then he had her by the arms, jerking them behind her, and bile surged up in her throat, yes, yes, let her puke, maybe it would stop them.</p><p>\u201cBet you wish you\u2019d been nicer to me now,\u201d Jake whispered, and he licked her cheek, and icy terror convulsed in Colleen\u2019s chest. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started, boys.\u201d</p><p>But then all of a sudden, Chris was down on his knees, looking stunned, and oh, thank you, thank you, God, someone had come to help her, was it Connor, had he somehow sensed she was in\u2014</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Connor.</p><p>It was Lucas Campbell.</p><p>Chris tried to get to his feet, but Lucas simply put one foot against his shoulder and pushed him into the water. There was a splash, then some sputtering and yelping.</p><p>\u201cThis is not your business, man,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her,\u201d Lucas said, and his voice was almost friendly.</p><p>Then Jase lunged at him, but Lucas made two very small moves, one punch to the throat and one to Jase\u2019s meaty face, and Jase, too, dropped to his knees, blood spurting from his nose. \u201cJesus!\u201d he wheezed, his voice thick and wet. With that, he ran heavily down the dock, causing it to bob beneath his fleeing bulk.</p><p>Jake\u2019s grip loosened, and before Colleen could formulate the thought, she elbowed him as hard as she could. He reacted by grabbing her hair, yanking so hard she saw a flash, and there was a blur of movement. Then Colleen was free, and Lucas was holding Jake by the throat.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes bulged as he clawed at Lucas\u2019s arm, his feet scrabbling for purchase on the rough wood of the dock. Lucas, on the other hand, looked calm as a June day.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Colleen?\u201d he asked without looking at her.</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d ever heard him say her name, and if there was a whisper of doubt that she\u2019d been affected by him before, it was gone now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and her voice sounded strange.</p><p>Chris had made it to shore, she saw. He half staggered, half ran up the path.</p><p>\u201cIs Bryce hurt?\u201d Lucas asked, his voice low and calm even as Jake continued to struggle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe passed out,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>It seemed as if Jake was about to strangle there; he was breathing, but he wasn\u2019t fighting anymore. \u201cYou should probably let him go. You don\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable.\u201d But he did let go, and Jake dropped right on his ass, hard, and sucked in air.</p><p>\u201cMy parents will f**king sue you,\u201d he gasped.</p> <p>\u201cThey can try,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sue him?\u201d Colleen blurted in outrage. \u201cThink about what my parents will do to you, you little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Jake said, his voice shaking with tears. \u201cFor horsing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to rape me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You wanted it, Colleen,\u201d Jake said, and even while on his knees, there was a smug look of entitlement on his face. \u201cWhy else did you come on to me? To all three of us?\u201d</p> <p>Her hands turned into fists, and she took a furious step forward, fully intending to kick him in his Cameron Diaz face, but Lucas stepped between them.</p><p>Jake\u2019s voice took on more confidence and the nasty edge returned. \u201cAre your clothes torn? Did I even kiss you!\u201d He stood up. \u201cThis ass**le, though...he has a violent streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI do. I\u2019m from the South Side of Chicago, and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d He stepped forward, forcing Jake to step back. \u201cIf I see you within fifty feet of her, you\u2019ll see just how violent a Southie can get. Me and a hammer. You and a new orifice. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Granted, being protected wasn\u2019t really Colleen\u2019s thing, as she\u2019d never needed it before, but damn. Jake\u2019s eyes grew comically round with terror.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, you little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jake said, his voice shaking.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d It was the limo driver, followed by Chris.</p><p>\u201cThis ass**le grabbed me by the throat!\u201d Jake said, his tone immediately sullen.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you deserved it,\u201d the driver said. \u201cAt least, according to him.\u201d He gestured to Chris, who gave her an ashamed nod. \u201cNow get in the limo, rich boy. Party\u2019s over.\u201d The driver looked at Colleen. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever touch her again, Jake,\u201d Lucas said, his voice soft and matter-of-fact, \u201cyou\u2019ll be eating through a straw for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Jake said. \u201cJust because you snuck up on me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas made a small movement toward him, and Jake screamed and jerked back.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d the driver said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jake?\u201d Colleen said sweetly.</p><p>He gave her a lethal look.</p><p>\u201cYou wet yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked down at his crotch, froze a second, then shuffled off the dock. He yelled at Jase, shoving him as he walked past.</p><p>\u201cStupid little dick,\u201d the driver muttered. He turned to them. \u201cYou guys all set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Colleen,\u201d Chris muttered, following the driver down the dock.</p><p>It was only when they were gone that Colleen looked at Lucas. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He took a few steps down the dock to his cousin. \u201cBryce, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, dude,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWhat was that yelling all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about drinking tonight, huh? Someone almost got hurt, and you\u2019re shit-faced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, man. I had a little too much, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up, buddy.\u201d He helped his cousin to his feet.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I saved you?\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Bryce took a weaving step toward her. \u201cOh, hey, Coll. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, idiot,\u201d she said gently. She put her arm around him, steering him down to the shore.</p><p>Delayed terror kicked in then, and she started shaking. \u201cYou cold?\u201d Bryce asked.</p><p>\u201cLittle bit,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tanya was sleeping on the sand, and without bothering to try to rouse her, Lucas simply picked her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she whined. No one bothered to answer.</p><p>A mountain bike was parked behind the Mustang. Lucas dumped Tanya in the backseat, then popped the trunk and loaded the bike in. \u201cYou rode here on your bike?\u201d Colleen asked, though the answer was obvious.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was playing chauffeur. Tanya can\u2019t drive, and Bryce was already pretty sloppy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, then opened the car door for her.</p><p>No boy had ever held a car door for her before.</p><p>She gave him directions to Tanya\u2019s house, then walked Tanya to the door. Mrs. Cross was waiting up, her mouth falling open when she saw her daughter\u2019s less-than-sober state, then thanked Colleen for seeing her home and began laying into Tanya for her stupidity. Colleen waved and went back to the car.</p><p>Bryce was sound asleep in the backseat, his snoring soft and rhythmic.</p><p>\u201cDoes he drink this much all the time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while.\u201d</p><p>Colleen nodded. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have asked, because Lucas seemed tense. Then again, this had been a tense night, hadn\u2019t it? Holy Mary. There\u2019d be fallout\u2014Jake was not the forgive-and-forget type. She might have to make sure everyone heard about his pants-wetting. Then again, that could make matters worse. Don\u2019t poke a wounded snake and all that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to watch your back,\u201d she said, stealing a look at her driver\u2019s profile.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, uncharacteristically nervous. \u201cYou were really brave. Three against one.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cThree against two,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Bryce wasn\u2019t much help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking about you.\u201d</p><p>The words brought a nearly painful heat to her cheeks. \u201cI am pretty good in a fight,\u201d she said, forcing some bravado into her voice.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been good. She would\u2019ve lost that one without Lucas, and the thought made her legs start shaking again. \u201cTake this left, and we\u2019re the third house on the right,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled into her driveway, then turned off the engine and got out. She got out as well, all too aware of his presence behind her.</p><p>The house was quiet, but Mom had left the light on over the sink, her code for everyone\u2019s in bed. Colleen turned to Lucas. His eyes were steady on her, dark and mysterious in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>He looked at her for a long minute. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, forcing a smile.</p><p>His dark pirate eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell. Men\u2014especially boys\u2014didn\u2019t usually call her on her bullshit. \u201cAll right, then. I\u2019m still shaking, and I probably won\u2019t sleep tonight, but I\u2019m not hurt, and I\u2019m really, really glad you came looking for Bryce.\u201d She wiped her eyes, which appeared to be tearing up. \u201cI could say I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if you hadn\u2019t come along, but I\u2019m afraid I know exactly what would\u2019ve happened if you hadn\u2019t come along. So thank you, Lucas Campbell, for coming along.\u201d She smiled, and it felt normal again. \u201cAnd for being all badass and scary when you did. It was very hot.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that.</p><p>It was a smoky, ashen sound, just a low scrape in his chest, and it filled her with lightness, somehow. But at the same time, she felt a little terrified, too, because she knew, somehow, that Lucas Campbell was different. He was dangerous to her, in ways that had nothing to do with violence and everything to do with the soft, hot feelings that pulsed and burned in her chest.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said. But he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And then he kissed her, so gently at first, as if he\u2019d never kissed a girl before, and please, looking like that, like Heathcliff, like a pirate or a gypsy or a member of the Sharks or the Jets...please, he\u2019d kissed plenty of girls before.</p><p>The kiss was soft and sure at the same time, and she felt his welcome heat against her cool skin, felt his hand go to the back of her head, his fingers sliding into her hair. His mouth moved against hers, testing and waiting to see if she\u2019d respond, and she did, hoping she was doing it right, because it sure felt right. It was all instinct\u2014all those tips and comments and methods she\u2019d given lectures on to her classmates these past five or six years, hell, she had no idea what she was supposed to be doing. All she knew was that Lucas Campbell was kissing her, and it felt so, so good.</p><p>It took her a second to realize he\u2019d stopped, and that his forehead was resting against hers. Her hands were on his wrists, clinging to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me now,\u201d he said softly. Then he pulled back to look at her. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She was too smart for all this. She had an old soul. She couldn\u2019t picture having a boyfriend.</p><p>But his eyes were steady, and his lashes were thick and dark. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. So much for her legendary comebacks.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you liked me,\u201d he said after a minute.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole white-knight thing.\u201d</p><p>There was that laugh again, and just the sound of it had her stomach tightening in a warm spiral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around, hotshot,\u201d he said, stepping away from her, and the cold and emptiness he left was a little shocking.</p><p>He seemed to read her mind, because he was back, and this time his kiss was more insistent. She grabbed his hair and answered, her mouth opening under his, and God, this was better than food, better than breathing, and a lot more important than either, the hard press of him against her, the silkiness of his hair, the taste of his mouth\u2014</p><p>\u201cGo inside,\u201d he ordered finally.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me,\u201d she said, hoping her legs still worked. He grinned, and hell, she nearly came.</p><p>They\u2019d be sleeping together. Soon. It was as inevitable as morning.</p><p>A long time later, she lay in bed, her fingers tracing her lips.</p><p>This night might\u2019ve turned out horribly, horribly wrong.</p><p>Instead, she was in love.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>THE DAY AFTER HE SAW BRYCE AT O\u2019ROURKE\u2019S LUCAS PULLED UP to Joe and Didi\u2019s house in his rental car, turned off the engine and sat for a moment.</p><p>In the fourteen years since he\u2019d left for college, Lucas had been back to Manningsport only a handful of times, and only once since he\u2019d gotten married.</p><p>Here was the thing about Didi Nesbith Campbell, Lucas\u2019s aunt by marriage. She had a vision of how life was supposed to be, goddamn it, and when life didn\u2019t obey, she got mad. Was still mad, in fact.</p><p>She\u2019d married Joe just after he\u2019d sold the rights to a video game for a million bucks when he was twenty-four years old. Rat-Whacker got picked up by Nintendo, and Joe seemed on track to billionaire status, joining the whiz kids of that era who made their first million before they were twenty-five.</p><p>And, like most of them, Joe was a flash in the pan.</p><p>That first million turned out to be the last million, but by then, they had a big house in the suburbs and a baby boy. Much to her supreme dissatisfaction, Didi had to get a job. She found her niche at an insurance company, denying claims of horribly injured people. Even as she rose through the ranks, she never got over the bitterness of having married the guy who failed to become the next Bill Gates.</p><p>The other great inconvenience of Didi\u2019s life was inheriting Lucas. She already had her only begotten son; she certainly didn\u2019t want the silent child of her slacker husband\u2019s criminal brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well. Time to see Joe. Lucas took off his sunglasses and headed toward the house.</p><p>It was beautiful up here, that was certain. The leaves were fresh and green, glowing with good health, unlike Chicago, which was currently baking in a heat wave. But here, where the landscape was dotted with deep glacier lakes and waterfalls by the dozens, where green farmland spread out on the hills and the forests were thick and deep, it was cooler and more lush than the flat Midwest and its punishing summers. The air was heavy with the smell of lilacs, so painstakingly trimmed along the border of Didi\u2019s perfectly landscaped (and somewhat soulless) yard.</p><p>Lucas would be in Manningsport for a month, maybe two. He wouldn\u2019t be staying at Didi\u2019s, that was certain, no matter that the house had five bedrooms and a basement apartment. No, he\u2019d rather amputate his own foot and eat it than do that. For the moment, he was staying at the Black Swan B and B.</p><p>He knocked on the front door. Nephew or not, Didi wouldn\u2019t like him coming in unannounced.</p> <p>Sure enough, she opened the door. \u201cOh. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Didi,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite well,\u201d she said, her lips tight. \u201cYou may as well come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Bryce here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s at the gym.\u201d</p> <p>Bryce still lived at home, though he\u2019d bounced around a little bit after dropping out of college. He\u2019d tried to live in Chicago for a short time, and Lucas had even gotten him a job with Forbes Properties, which lasted five days before Bryce quit. Bryce had also tried Manhattan, San Francisco and Atlanta, but all roads led him back to Manningsport, specifically, to the basement apartment that Didi had made for her baby boy, giving him the illusion of adulthood while remaining clamped under her thumb.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Ellen?\u201d Didi asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he answered. She waited for more. He didn\u2019t offer it.</p><p>The one thing Lucas had ever done that won approval from Didi was to marry Ellen Forbes. \u201cAny relation to Malcolm?\u201d Didi had immediately asked when he\u2019d told them. No curiosity about why he was marrying someone he\u2019d never mentioned, or what had happened with his longtime girlfriend, or why he wasn\u2019t going to law school. Just \u201cAny relation?\u201d Her eyes alight with a sudden, keen interest.</p><p>The answer, of course, was, yes.</p><p>And suddenly, Lucas was a beloved nephew. Didi wanted to help plan the wedding, just loved Ellen to death within seconds of meeting her, thought of Lucas like a son, wanted so much to have holidays together, one big happy family, the Forbeses and the Campbells, wasn\u2019t it wonderful?</p> <p>Granted, Ellen and her parents saw right through her, but Didi was too busy trying to pretend she was completely at home with their vast wealth, the penthouse overlooking Lake Michigan, the maid who served dinner, the sailboat and cars and drivers and wine.</p><p>Once, Lucas had come upon her in Frank\u2019s study, where she was slipping a little glass statue in her purse. \u201cPlease don\u2019t steal from my in-laws,\u201d he\u2019d said mildly, and she\u2019d flashed him a glare of such hatred, he\u2019d actually smiled. She might want to kiss up to his in-laws, but it was almost reassuring to see that she still couldn\u2019t stand the sight of him.</p><p>When informed about his divorce, Didi\u2019s first question had been, \u201cWhat about the holidays?\u201d After all, if Lucas wasn\u2019t a son-in-law anymore, odds were low that his aunt and uncle would get an invitation to the famous Forbes New Year\u2019s Eve party, the amazing Thanksgiving dinner for thirty of their closest friends.</p><p>Frank and Grace Forbes\u2014and Ellen\u2014had stayed close with his sister, Steph, and her girls since the divorce, because they were really wonderful, not about to cut off five people\u2014six, counting him\u2014they loved. His divorce was more than amicable, not to mention Ellen\u2019s idea.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Joe today?\u201d Lucas asked Didi.</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d she said, turning away. \u201cTake off your shoes first.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, then started upstairs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in your\u2014the room off the kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was easier that way.\u201d</p> <p>Of course. Joe was weak, that was true. Also, Didi was a bitch.</p><p>Lucas went through the vast chef\u2019s kitchen to the small hallway that led to the laundry room and his old room. Knocked gently on the door, which was open a crack.</p><p>The room was crowded: the hospital bed, a night table covered with the detritus of sickness\u2014pill bottles, a half-filled glass of water, tissues, a magazine and Joe\u2019s silver pocket watch, which had been handed from father to son since the Civil War. A desk with a large-screened computer was wedged against one wall. The room didn\u2019t have windows, and Lucas remembered how dark it was in here. Like a grave, he\u2019d often thought, and now more than ever.</p><p>His uncle was sleeping. Lucas hadn\u2019t seen him for a few months. The kidney disease made Joe appear tan, and he was thinner than he\u2019d ever been, though a little puffy from fluid retention.</p><p>But now, even asleep, he looked old. And tired.</p><p>A lot like Lucas\u2019s father the last time he\u2019d seen him. The family resemblance was strong.</p><p>Joe was dying. The reality hit Lucas like a tanker, and his eyes stung all of a sudden. Despite Didi\u2019s ceaseless resentment, Joe had always been a good uncle.</p><p>Joe stirred, then opened his eyes. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, struggling to sit up. \u201cHow are you, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave his uncle a lean-in hug. Cleared his throat. \u201cGood to see you, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too! You look great. When did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see Bryce yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did. Found him at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s.\u201d And not just him, either.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he goes there a lot.\u201d Joe smiled. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tire him out, Lucas,\u201d Didi said, appearing in the doorway, hands on her bony hips.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Bryce coming back? He wanted to do something with you this afternoon.\u201d Her eyes flickered toward Lucas. This was typical for her; any time Joe and Lucas might have a bonding moment, she was there to interrupt and remind Joe that he had a son, a wonderful son, a real son.</p><p>And the thing was, it generally worked. Joe was a nice guy, but he was no match for Didi. There were other terms for it, meaner terms, but it was clear that Joe generally did what Didi told him to do.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes with my uncle,\u201d Lucas said, and without waiting for an answer, got up and closed the door in her face.</p><p>The door flew open again immediately. \u201cJust because you breeze into town whenever you like, I\u2019m still the one who has to take care of him. My whole life is doctor\u2019s appointments and hospital visits these days. I don\u2019t have a minute to breathe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen breathe now,\u201d he said, and closed the door again.</p><p>Apparently Didi couldn\u2019t find a way to argue that. After a second, her heels tapped away down the hall, though Lucas would bet she\u2019d tiptoe back and eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Uncle Joe?\u201d he asked, taking his seat again.</p><p>Joe sighed. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Lucas. Bryce...well, he\u2019s just not really grown up yet, you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his hand on his uncle\u2019s. Joe\u2019s arm looked odd, courtesy of the fistula he needed for dialysis.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to leave this world knowing he had a plan, at least. I don\u2019t want him\u2014\u201d Joe glanced at the closed door and dropped his voice to a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to have her hooks in him forever. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe you could hang around for...well, till the day comes. I know he\u2019s gonna take this hard.\u201d Joe\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Yes. Last night, Bryce had acknowledged that his dad was sick, but he also talked about how much better Joe was looking these days. Dialysis was amazing! And besides, a kidney would come along any minute.</p><p>The fact that Joe wasn\u2019t on the organ registry\u2014and indeed, wasn\u2019t eligible for a transplant, thanks to the tumor in his lung\u2014was not something Bryce would admit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay however long you need,\u201d Lucas said. He owed it to Joe, after all.</p><p>\u201cYou can get off work that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m leaving the company, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d Joe paused. \u201cWhere will you stay when you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the Black Swan right now,\u201d he said. \u201cJust called the Realtor about a short-term rental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay here,\u201d Joe offered, but they both knew that he wasn\u2019t. Didi would hate having him here, and if Didi wasn\u2019t happy, no one was allowed to be happy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think you could help Bryce? Maybe help him find work? He hasn\u2019t ever had a job he really loved, aside from the dog shelter stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust having you here is going to be great. He\u2019s always worshipped you. Always wanted to do what you did, whatever that might\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. That was certainly true; from baseball cards to a paper route, if Lucas had it, Bryce wanted it. And Didi made sure he got it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another thing I need you to help me with,\u201d Joe whispered, and Lucas felt a flash of anger that the man had to whisper in his own home.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, adjusting Joe\u2019s blanket. It was meat-locker cold in here. Another thing he remembered too well.</p><p>Joe glanced at the door, then picked up a notepad and pen. Wrote something down and passed it to Lucas.</p><p>I want a divorce before I die.</p><p>Lucas looked at his uncle. Back at the notepad. Back to his uncle. \u201cWell, holy shit, unc,\u201d he said, then grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lucas.\u201d Joe smiled, but his eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Joe said, his voice fading into sleep. Then his eyes opened. \u201cMaybe you can see some old friends while you\u2019re here.\u201d He winked, the ghost of his old self, then fell asleep, just like that.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cOH. COLLEEN. IT\u2019S you.\u201d Carol Robinson, one of the local Realtors, gave Colleen a jaundiced stare. \u201cFine, come in. I\u2019m not showing you around, though. I know you won\u2019t be buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely to see you, too, Carol.\u201d Pi\u00f1a colada, very old-school, Carol was. \u201cBursitis flaring up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just don\u2019t want to waste my time. Hi, Jeanette, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s mother pulled her shirt away from her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot in here, Carol! How do you stand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a hot flash. I still get them,\u201d Carol said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatan\u2019s barbecue,\u201d Mom said. \u201cDon\u2019t make that face, Colleen. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. Carol, do you have a fact sheet on the house?\u201d Carol handed her one with a sigh. \u201cBy the way, do you have to walk in the middle of the road every morning? I almost hit you the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, I saw you speeding by. Jeanette, your daughter and that red car of hers...\u201d</p><p>Colleen had brought her mother to an open house, and yeah, fine, she had a bit of a reputation with the real estate people. It wasn\u2019t her fault. Yes, she wanted to buy a house, very much, in fact. She was thirty-one, for heaven\u2019s sake. She didn\u2019t want to live above her brother forever. Their house was adorable; it was just that it was their house, and she wanted a place of her own. A place where, yeah, she\u2019d have those adorable tots and Rufus could frisk and frolic, and her husband and she would have lots and lots of great sex.</p><p>And since Lucas Damien Campbell had walked into her bar the other night, she felt considerably more motivated to find that husband and bear those children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today, she\u2019d taken her mom with her, because (a) she was a saint, and (b) it was one of Mom\u2019s many Significant Dates, of which there were many, 99 percent of them marking some dire event relating to Dad.</p><p>This house was a white farmhouse with a porch, a horseshoe driveway and big, beautiful yard. Not too big, not too small, not too new, not too old. Remodeled kitchen with white cabinets and glass fronts, lots of counter space, should she take up cooking (which she wouldn\u2019t but it could happen, if hell froze over). The living room had lots of windows and a really pretty fireplace.</p><p>Colleen and her mother went upstairs as Carol went back to reading her fat spy novel.</p><p>Coll felt a tingle of hope. If she was busy moving into a new place, painting and shopping for a new couch and plates, she\u2019d have less time to lie in bed and think about a certain tall, dark un-stranger. \u201cBlack-haired boy, work of the devil,\u201d her grandmother used to say, and it was flippin\u2019 true. Lucas had black hair and had broken her heart. Jeremy Lyon had black hair, and he\u2019d broken Faith\u2019s heart by coming out of the closet on their wedding day. Dad had black hair and broke Mom\u2019s heart.</p> <p>Connor, on the other hand, had brown hair, taking after Mom\u2019s side of the family, with no broken hearts in his past. Levi Cooper, police chief and decorated veteran\u2014dark blond, making Faith very happy these days. Gerard Chartier: bald, a cheerful man-whore and very well liked. Grandma had known what she was talking about.</p><p>The master bedroom was at the end of the hall and utterly gorgeous. Slanted ceiling, a long window seat, built-in bookshelves. Even space on the wall for a TV, if she was so inclined. Not that she approved of watching TV in bed; in her mind\u2019s eye, Tom Hardy would be waiting, na**d and impatient, for her, his beloved wife. In reality, however, she and Rufus put in far too many hours watching HGTV and Game of Thrones. (Was Jon Snow too young to lust after? Probably and oops, another black-haired boy.)</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely. What do you hate about it?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find something. You always do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, Ma.\u201d</p><p>Her mother wandered into the bathroom. \u201cOh, Collie, come in here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The master bathroom was vast\u2014tiled floor, walled-in shower area and a huge, triangular tub, big enough for Colleen and Tom Hardy and his muscles.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Mom said. Her face flushed bright red, she began flapping her shirt again. \u201cOh, dear! Oh, man! I think I might be having another hot flash!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You hide it so well.\u201d Mom had always been the type to detail her physical woes. \u201cBleeding like a stuck pig\u201d had been popular back in the good old period days. \u201cOvaries the size of grapefruits\u201d was another. \u201cThat Chinese food went through me like a knife.\u201d One of the many ways Mom was so much fun.</p><p>Mom continued flapping, then climbed in the bathtub. \u201cThis porcelain feels like ice. Thank God, too.\u201d She lay there, red-faced and panting, and Colleen waited, used to her mother\u2019s menopausal adventures by now. After a minute, Jeanette lifted her head, her hair damp with sweat, and surveyed the tub. \u201cSo how many jets does this thing have?\u201d she said speculatively.</p> <p>\u201cIcky, Mom.\u201d Quite a few, though. Handy, in case marriage to Tom Hardy didn\u2019t work out.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Just because it feels like tumbleweeds are blowing through my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace,\u201d Colleen began. \u201cThe Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou who can make my mother stop talking, and blessed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her mother gave her a martyred look. \u201cYou know, Colleen, just because I\u2019m suffering through menopause, and just because your father left me for That Whore doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have certain urges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I not a human all of a sudden? Not allowed to be lonely? Hey, did you know that John Holland got married a couple weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>Another maternal habit: announcing facts known by everyone as if it was big news. Of course she knew. She was the best friend of the man\u2019s daughter, and if there was a more beloved man than Faith\u2019s dad, Colleen didn\u2019t know him. She herself wouldn\u2019t have minded being the second Mrs. Holland. Well, not really. But it had always been fun to flirt with him anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been widowed for twenty years,\u201d Mom said.</p> <p>\u201cMa, I know. I grew up with Faith, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. You girls were at our house half the time. The point is, both he and Mrs. Johnson are older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Want to see the other bedrooms now?\u201d Colleen asked. So far, the house had given her no reason to reject it. But the tingle was fading. This bathroom was possibly too large. It always seemed to her that when she found the right house, she\u2019d know. Instantly.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d known with Lucas the day he walked into her English class.</p><p>And look where that had gotten her.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with a text. From Bryce, no less. Think Jessica Dunn is a good match 4 me?</p><p>Oh, crap. First of all, Jessica Dunn would never go for a guy like Bryce; Jess had a very appealing edginess to her, and Bryce was as complicated as a chocolate chip cookie. Secondly, there was Paulie!</p><p>Not really, she typed back. Hang in there. I\u2019m working on someone for you. She\u2019s special.</p><p>Pretty? appeared almost immediately.</p><p>Sigh. Paulie could not be described as pretty. Striking.</p><p>Awesome, came the reply. C u soon!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna lay here for another minute,\u201d Mom said. \u201cBut, Colleen, I was thinking. It doesn\u2019t seem like your father is going to come to his senses any time soon. I thought That Whore was a midlife crisis, just a little fling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been together for ten years, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even after that child, I thought he\u2019d come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavannah, Mom. Say what you want about Gail the Tail, but be nice about Savannah. She\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour half sister.\u201d Mom sat up, grabbed one of the attractively rolled facecloths and ran some water on it, then held it against her chest. \u201cAnyway, John Holland has adult grandchildren, he\u2019s in his sixties, but he found someone. I\u2019m only fifty-four, and what do I have? Nothing. No grandchildren, not even a daughter-or son-in-law, and nothing on the horizon, either. What\u2019s wrong with you and Connor?\u201d</p><p>A familiar refrain. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Mom? Why haven\u2019t you given me a nice stepfather? I wouldn\u2019t say no to Mariano Rivera, for example. Or George Clooney. Actually, I\u2019d marry both of them myself, so take them off the list. Sean Connery, he\u2019d do. Or Ed Harris. Why haven\u2019t you married Sean Connery or Ed Harris, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father married That Whore. John Holland married Mrs. Johnson. Cathy Moore turned g*y and married Louise. And here I am, sitting in a tub having a hot flash. On the tenth anniversary of your father leaving me, no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can get out of the tub, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till you hit menopause. I\u2019ll have no sympathy for you.\u201d Mom sighed. \u201cI\u2019m tired of things being the same. I want a life. I want to get laid.\u201d</p><p>Hail Mary, full of grace\u2014</p><p>\u201cBarb McIntosh said you told her you could fix up anyone. Does that include me, or don\u2019t I count?\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s head whipped around from where she was examining the showerhead.</p><p>In all the years since the divorce, Mom had not gone out once. Not once. \u201cReally? You really want to date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why shouldn\u2019t I? Your father has That Whore, and if John Holland can find someone, I probably could, too. I\u2019m not disgusting, am I?\u201d Her mother climbed out of the tub and scooped her hair off her neck in a regal move, one that Colleen had copied as a kid.</p><p>Danger, she heard Connor\u2019s voice say in her head. He definitely was the logical twin. And yes, fixing up Mom could be the emotional equivalent of waterboarding.</p><p>Then again, Mom had waited years for Dad to come back to her. Denial, then bitterness as an Olympic sport. Maybe what she needed to get over Dad was another man. Certainly, Colleen had always thought so.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I meet someone, maybe your father will get jealous and finally get his head out of his ass.\u201d</p><p>Crud. Using people to make other people jealous...that never worked very well. \u201cMom, if you want to date, maybe find someone, I think that\u2019d be great. But Dad\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know. So? Will you help me? I need to set up an online profile.\u201d</p><p>Faith had done the same thing with her father last fall. It hadn\u2019t been a particularly good experience, though all\u2019s well that ends well. Also, Faith herself was sweet and naive.</p><p>Colleen was not.</p><p>If there was one thing she knew, it was men and how they thought.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Mom exclaimed, grasping Colleen\u2019s arm. \u201cAnd guess what else I heard? Guess! Guess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sound of a butterfly\u2019s wings,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Guess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Mom let go of her arm, fluffed her hair and gave Colleen a triumphant look. \u201cI heard Lucas Campbell is back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise! Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back because Joe Campbell isn\u2019t long for the world, so I\u2019d have to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is! It\u2019s great because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you never got over him.\u201d Mom fixed her with a triumphant look.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable.\u201d Granted, a debate she\u2019d probably lose, but still. \u201cAlso, Mom, he\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>Colleen blinked.</p><p>\u201cAha! I knew you didn\u2019t know that!\u201d Mom crowed.</p><p>\u201cAre you two done up there?\u201d Carol called from downstairs. \u201cI have other people here who might actually buy this place, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right down. She doesn\u2019t love it,\u201d Mom yelled. Colleen barely heard.</p><p>Divorced?</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t mentioned that the other night. Questions surged into her head. Why? For how long? Was he heartbroken? Bitter? Had he cheated? Had she? Was he seeing someone?</p><p>Get a grip, she told herself. He broke your heart. He fell in love with someone else, and he left you. Just. Like. Dad.</p><p>\u201cColleen?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not really interested in this house, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost perfect,\u201d she said, clearing her throat. \u201cBut there\u2019s not enough shade in the front.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>A WEEK BACK in Manningsport, and Lucas had spoken to an attorney, who told him that a divorce for Uncle Joe was going to be just about impossible. Lucas wasn\u2019t giving up on that just yet. New York divorce law was a tangled, Puritanical web, but maybe there was a loophole somewhere. Then there were Joe\u2019s finances; he wanted whatever assets he had to go to Bryce. What exactly those assets were remained to be seen, because Didi kept a tight fist around the family funds.</p><p>In the meantime, Lucas found a short-term, furnished rental in a pretty building on the green, roughly two hundred feet from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s front door. He\u2019d been avoiding the pub, not wanting Colleen\u2019s panties to get into a twist (though thinking about her panties wasn\u2019t the worst way to spend time).</p><p>Today, however, he was stopping by the Manningsport Animal Shelter to see Bryce, and hopefully get his cousin to commit to a plan of action for a future that included more than playing video games in his mom\u2019s basement. Bryce loved animals; maybe Lucas could convince him to go to school to become a veterinary assistant or the like.</p><p>The shelter was a gray building on the outskirts of town, and Bryce\u2019s Dodge Ram pickup truck was parked outside, along with a cute little Porsche and a mountain bike with a wicker basket on the handlebars. Lucas went inside. There was no one in the waiting room, but he heard voices coming from behind a closed door. Some female murmuring, then Bryce speaking more clearly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s use a little lubricant, don\u2019t you think, baby? Don\u2019t be scared. I\u2019ll just ease my finger in like that and squeeze, nice and gentle.\u201d</p><p>Lucas froze.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that feel good, sweetheart?\u201d Bryce went on.</p><p>A moaning sound came in response.</p> <p>What the hell? Was Bryce ha**ng s*x in an animal shelter?</p><p>\u201cBryce? It\u2019s Lucas.\u201d</p><p>There was a scrambling sound from inside, and then the door opened, and there was Colleen, her hair tumbled, cheeks pink.</p><p>A white-hot knife of jealousy slid between Lucas\u2019s ribs, and for a second, he couldn\u2019t see straight.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said calmly, though her eyes widened a bit.</p> <p>\u201cColleen.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at his tone, then looked behind her. \u201cYour cousin\u2019s here, Bryce,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lucas!\u201d Bryce called. \u201cI\u2019m covered in slime. Be out in a second.\u201d</p><p>Colleen came into the waiting room, closing the door behind her. \u201cWe meet again. How are you, Spaniard?\u201d</p><p>It was her old nickname for him...she had often said he looked like a Spanish pirate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cWhat exactly were you doing in there?\u201d</p> <p>She cocked an eyebrow, then grinned. \u201cSounded like sexy time, didn\u2019t it? But no. Just Bryce expressing the anal glands of a very cute little dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014okay, I\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. There\u2019s just no good comeback for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs life so quiet here that this is what passes for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sell it short. Want to watch? He\u2019s really good.\u201d She grinned, and Lucas felt a responding smile start in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo your dog required some, um, special treatment?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that would take the New York Giants and a very, very brave vet. It\u2019s Mrs. Tuggles, one of Paulie\u2019s recent acquisitions. Rufus over there is my baby.\u201d She pointed, and Lucas glanced over to where a gray, cow-sized dog lay on its side as if dead.</p><p>\u201cAre you a good boy, Rufus?\u201d Colleen asked.</p> <p>The dog\u2019s tail thumped twice in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cSo these anal glands,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYour way of getting Paulie and Bryce together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s working. You see, Lucas, a lot of men don\u2019t appreciate what\u2019s right in front of them, so they have to be shown. In twelve-foot neon letters. With arrows pointing to it.\u201d She paused to let that sink in, lest he miss the innuendo (whatever it was). \u201cAlso, Mrs. Tuggles was blocked and kept scooching her butt across Paulie\u2019s rug. You get the picture.\u201d</p><p>The exam room door opened again, and there was Paulie, holding Mrs. Tuggles, a rotund little dog that looked extremely satisfied at the moment, her wide mouth grinning, tongue lolling. The dog yawned and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she could use a cigarette,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBryce, what did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please,\u201d Bryce said, drying his hands on the paper towel. \u201cHey, Lucas! You know Paulie, right? We went to high school with her senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, too, Paulie,\u201d he said with a smile. Her face grew pink...then red...then blotchy. That was some blush.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tuggles, say hi to Lucas,\u201d Bryce said. He bent down to kiss Mrs. Tuggles\u2019s head, bringing his own head in the vicinity of Paulie\u2019s chest. Her face went into the purple zone, and the dog licked Bryce\u2019s face with exuberant gratitude and slobber. Kind of disgusting.</p><p>\u201cYou got a minute, Bryce?\u201d he asked when the dog was done frenching his cousin.</p><p>\u201cTotally. Girls, it was great seeing you both,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cAll three of you, that is.\u201d He scratched the pug on the head.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...uh, I mean, yeah. You, too,\u201d Paulie said. She cleared her throat and took a deep breath. \u201cColleen, thank you for coming with me.\u201d Her voice was loud and expressionless. \u201cI was so concerned about poor Mrs. Tuggles, and it was good to have a friend.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cBryce, you were so wonderful. Let me buy you a beer some night.\u201d Her face went nuclear.</p><p>Lucas would bet a hundred bucks Colleen had given her those lines.</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019d be great,\u201d Bryce said, completely oblivious. Paulie\u2019s eyelids fluttered, and she took an unsteady step backward, looking as if she was about to faint.</p><p>Colleen gave her a little push forward and picked up a bike helmet from one of the chairs. \u201cSee you around, boys. Paulie, I\u2019ll walk you out. Come on, Rufie!\u201d</p><p>The women and their animals left, and Bryce stretched his arms over his head. \u201cI think Colleen might have a thing for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was that flash of jealousy again. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not it,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cYou never know. She and I\u2014\u201d He glanced at Lucas as if just now remembering that Colleen had once been with Lucas. \u201cUh...nothing. We hit it off. As friends, you know? At the bar, just shooting the shit. Friends. You\u2019re right, there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d He cracked his knuckles. \u201cWhat can I do for you, bro? You want a dog? Or a cat? My mom won\u2019t let me have one, which is probably why I work here, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have a pet, Bryce,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI\u2019m only in town for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Or you could move back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. South Side forever.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled. \u201cI figured you could show me around, since you said you spend a lot of time here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Come on back.\u201d</p><p>Another door led to the kennels. The usual suspects\u2014pit bull here, Rottweiler there, with a couple of older-looking dogs. Bryce had a kind word for all of them, even the snarling black mutt in the last kennel. Then on to the cat room, where there were far too many felines of varying colors and sizes.</p><p>Bryce picked up a kitten. \u201cWho\u2019s beautiful, huh? Who\u2019s so pretty? You are, sweetie!\u201d The kitten batted Bryce on the nose and mewed.</p><p>Lucas had never had a pet. He could get one, he guessed; he just wasn\u2019t home a lot. Maybe now that he was leaving Forbes, he\u2019d get a dog who could ride in his truck to job sites and lie at his feet at night. It\u2019d be nice to have some company.</p><p>Well. He\u2019d wait to get back to Chicago. There were plenty of animals waiting to be adopted in the city, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cYou ever think about becoming a vet tech, Bryce?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re really good with animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks! But not really, no. You need school for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You could do it part-time, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever. Even so, the shelter can\u2019t afford to pay anyone. We\u2019re all volunteers, and Dr. Metcalf comes in when we need real stuff done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you work for Dr. Metcalf?\u201d</p><p>Bryce shrugged. \u201cHe has this hot chick who works for him. She volunteers here, too. We hooked up once or twice.\u201d He scratched his head. \u201cMaybe I should give her a call. I\u2019m thinking about having kids.\u201d</p><p>Wow. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d be a great dad,\u201d he said (and hoped). \u201cBut you need a job first. And possibly a place of your own, so you don\u2019t have to raise a kid in your mother\u2019s basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. You wanna get a beer? I think O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eleven-thirty, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so they\u2019re definitely open. Oh, I get it. You don\u2019t want to see Colleen.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave his cousin a look. \u201cI have no problem seeing Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust bring up memories, though, right? Because you two were pretty hot and heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago. Anyway, about you getting a job, Bryce\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! I forgot. I\u2019m supposed to have lunch with my mom. I gotta run.\u201d Just then, the front door opened, and a very pretty woman came in. \u201cHey, Ange! Right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Bryce,\u201d she purred, sparing Lucas a glance (and giving him a gratifying double take). \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin. Lucas, this is Angie...Angie, uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeekman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Ange, I gotta fly, but listen. You wanna grab a drink sometime?\u201d</p><p>Lucas couldn\u2019t help feeling a flicker of sympathy for Paulie.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said with a coy smile. \u201cSee you around, boys.\u201d</p><p>Lucas scrubbed a hand through his hair as Bryce tore out of the parking lot a few seconds later, going too fast, as usual.</p><p>WHEN LUCAS WAS fifteen, his cousin saved his life.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I saved you?\u201d Bryce would say from time to time. And Lucas would have to say of course he remembered, and yes, it sure was lucky Bryce had been there, and absolutely, they were as close as brothers, and yep, they did look alike, since they both looked like their fathers\u2014and Dan and Joe could\u2019ve passed for twins.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Lucas disliked Bryce. No one did. Bryce Campbell, the adored only child of Lucas\u2019s aunt and uncle, was unendingly cheerful, up for anything and had an intense case of hero worship. He kept a respectful distance from Lucas\u2019s sister, Stephanie, who was six years older and called him only \u201ckid.\u201d But he stuck to Lucas like a tick.</p><p>About three times a year, Joe, Didi and Bryce would visit them (they, in return, were never invited to the wealthy suburb to the north of Chicago where Bryce and his family lived). And every time, Bryce would be glued to Lucas\u2019s side, wide-eyed with wonder at anything Lucas had or did\u2014his tiny bedroom on the third floor of the two-family house they lived in, his second-hand bike, the stunts he could do on it. Lucas was a White Sox fan, obviously, being from the South Side; Bryce traded in his Cubs shirt to match Lucas\u2019s, which nearly got him stoned by his peers. Lucas would clear the crowded table after dinner because he was the kind of kid who did chores; Bryce decided that nothing was more fun and exotic than washing dishes by hand. And the thing was, he meant it.</p><p>Bryce couldn\u2019t get over the fact that Lucas was not only allowed to have a knife, but was allowed to use it as well, and viewed whittling as damn near miraculous. He peppered Lucas with questions about his late mother, who\u2019d died of ALS when Lucas was six. Did he miss her? What had it been like to have a Puerto Rican mother? Did they ever see her ghost? It never occurred to Bryce that the subject might be a sensitive one.</p><p>Lucas liked his cousin. But Bryce could be tiring, like a puppy who just wanted to bring you a stick. At first, it\u2019s really cute. Aw, hey, a stick! Go get it, boy! But by the tenth time, when the puppy\u2019s enthusiasm hasn\u2019t been touched but yours is getting tired, you wish the dog would take a nap. By the twentieth time he brings you the stick, your arm aches. And by the fiftieth, you really wondered what you were thinking when you decided to get a dog.</p><p>It was always something of a relief to see Bryce get reluctantly bundled off into the car with his parents. \u201cMy God, that woman is evil,\u201d Dad would say of his brother\u2019s wife, tousling Lucas\u2019s hair. Though it was clear Aunt Didi barely tolerated her husband\u2019s family, she never let them visit without her, even if she did brush off a chair before sitting on it. \u201cBut your cousin, he\u2019s a pretty great kid, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>And Lucas would agree that yes, Bryce was really nice. Which he was.</p><p>Joe Campbell was the brother who\u2019d made good; Dan never made it out of the careworn neighborhood where they\u2019d grown up. Joe got into college, which was near-miraculous from the sound of it, whereas Dan became a mechanic, married the girl next door and moved into an apartment around the corner from where the brothers grew up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was clear that Joe viewed their childhood as far more idyllic than Lucas\u2019s dad did. Even when he was little, Lucas understood that, felt his father\u2019s edge when Uncle Joe would wax poetic about riding their bikes in the empty lot or leaving pennies out on the rail for the train to flatten. After all, Joe and his family got to leave at the end of the day.</p><p>When Steph was nineteen, she moved in with her boyfriend and had a baby girl. Another thing Bryce couldn\u2019t get over\u2014how cool was it that Lucas was an uncle! How he wished he had a sister, too, so he could be an uncle! \u201cBryce, angel, a baby\u2019s not always a good thing,\u201d Aunt Didi said.</p><p>\u201cThis baby is,\u201d Lucas said, giving his aunt a dirty look. Mercedes was cute and smelled nice, most of the time, and Steph was a good mom.</p><p>Didi didn\u2019t blink. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see how things turn out, won\u2019t we?\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot all of us are thrilled that our tax dollars pay for Stephanie\u2019s lifestyle.\u201d And though he wasn\u2019t 100 percent sure what she meant by that, Lucas knew that it was a put-down just the same.</p> <p>Visits from Joe and Bryce and Didi were rare, he didn\u2019t have to think about it much. Would it be nice to take a vacation in Turks and Caicos, wherever that was? Probably. Would it be fun to have a flat-screen TV in your room? Sure. But Lucas wouldn\u2019t trade places, that was for sure. Home always seemed a little nicer after those visits. Careworn instead of shabby, washed in the light of relief that they had each other, at least.</p><p>Until Dad was arrested.</p><p>Things Lucas Didn\u2019t Know About His Father:</p><p>He\u2019d been arrested at age eighteen for grand theft auto (a Camaro left with the keys in it, so really, who could resist? Certainly not an eighteen-year-old American male from the wrong side of the tracks).</p><p>He\u2019d been arrested at age twenty-one for breaking and entering and vandalism (Mrs. Ortega\u2019s place, where he and his buddy sat in the living room, watched Cinemax, drinking her schnapps).</p> <p>He was $95,700 in debt, thanks to Mom\u2019s medical care during her unsuccessful battle with ALS.</p><p>He was a drug dealer.</p><p>Lucas was fifteen at the time of the bust. The cops showed up, flashed a warrant and searched the house while Lucas made frantic phone calls to the garage. It was too late; the police found several small bags of crystal meth in a shoe box in the back of Dad\u2019s closet.</p><p>Seemed like Dad had become a minor dealer in an organization run by one of his old high school friends. It was the only way he\u2019d found to stop the creditors from taking the house after Mom died; he already worked eighty hours a week at the garage. Because of Dan\u2019s \u201ccriminal past,\u201d the judge sentenced him to sixteen years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, son,\u201d Dan said to Lucas as the bailiff handcuffed him. Lucas hugged his father and tried not to cry. His father, who looked a decade older than he had that morning, didn\u2019t need to see that. Besides, they\u2019d appeal, the public defender said. This wasn\u2019t forever.</p><p>Lucas wanted to stay with his sister, but Steph had tearfully turned him down. She and Rich lived in a tiny apartment, and she was pregnant again, this time with twins. Though Lucas swore he\u2019d help, he could sleep on the couch, Mercedes loved him, he could babysit and everything, Steph said he\u2019d be better off with Uncle Joe.</p> <p>Joe and Bryce showed up as Lucas was packing. \u201cThis is so great!\u201d Bryce exclaimed. \u201cYou can live with us now! We\u2019ll be like brothers!\u201d</p><p>Lucas barely refrained from punching him. It wasn\u2019t great. His father was in jail, and even if he\u2019d be getting out soon\u2014please, God\u2014this was far from great.</p><p>Being without a choice in the matter, he went, moving from the South Side, the run-down but tight-knit blue-collar neighborhood he\u2019d lived all his life to a development made up of streets with saccharine names: Shadow Creek Lane, West Wind Way, Shane\u2019s Glen Circle.</p><p>Didi showed him his room, the smallest room in the house, jammed full with an unused treadmill (which Didi insisted stay in the room, rather than be moved to the basement), a broken computer from the early nineties and a twin bed under the eaves. Bryce had been hoping they\u2019d bunk in together, but no. There was another unused bedroom, but Didi said it was for company.</p><p>It was horribly different.</p><p>There was a pool in the back, serviced by Juan the pool boy; he and Lucas would speak in Spanish together, which irritated Didi and filled Bryce with still more admiration. The lawn was mown by a landscaping company. They had a cleaning lady. Didi drove a Mercedes and shopped at high-end retail stores and, according to a receipt Lucas found, spent one hundred and fifty dollars on her hair every five weeks.</p><p>Lucas remembered his father asking Joe for money five or six years before. He\u2019d been lingering in the bathroom, needing a break from Bryce\u2019s constant questions, and was washing his hands with much more care than usual.</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask,\u201d Dad said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t, except...well, the hospital hired a bill collector. I\u2019m working as much as I can, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, I understand,\u201d Joe said. \u201cUm, I\u2019ll ask Didi.\u201d</p><p>A few nights later, Uncle Joe had called, and Dad\u2019s answers got shorter and shorter. \u201cI understand. Of course not. Don\u2019t worry about it. Thanks anyway. No. Sure. Yep.\u201d He hung up the phone, sighed, such a weary, hopeless sound that Lucas must\u2019ve looked stricken, because the next minute, Dad smiled. \u201cWant ice cream for dessert?\u201d he asked, and they both pretended things were okay.</p><p>A few months after that phone call, Didi and Joe took Bryce on a Disney cruise around the Mediterranean.</p><p>For the first few weeks he was living with them, Lucas kept his clothes in his backpack because he knew he wouldn\u2019t be there long. His father\u2019s sentence had been sixteen years, but come on. That was for ra**sts and murderers. Not for a mechanic who was trying to pay off his dead wife\u2019s medical expenses and support a family. Surely Dad\u2019s lawyer would get that straightened out.</p><p>But as the days turned into weeks, and the first month came around, Joe gently explained that it looked like it might be longer than Lucas hoped. He might as well make himself at home, right?</p><p>When it came time for back-to-school shopping, Didi bought Bryce\u2019s clothes from Hollister, and Lucas\u2019s from Kmart. Point taken. Joe bought him a new baseball glove for his birthday, the first never-been-used glove he\u2019d ever had, despite playing for a couple of years already, and five minutes after he opened the package, Didi\u2019s tight lips and hissing whispers managed to convince Joe that Lucas didn\u2019t need a new glove. But Bryce did. Lucas could have Bryce\u2019s old glove.</p><p>And so it went. It was Didi\u2019s job that afforded the big house and tricked-out car in the garage (\u201cIsn\u2019t it cool that your niece and our car have the same name?\u201d Bryce said once). Didi was vice president of something, whereas Joe worked from home, and somewhat sporadically.</p><p>But despite his uncle\u2019s assurances that they were thrilled to have him, despite Bryce\u2019s adoration, Lucas had never felt so alone. He missed Stephanie, who was kind of a screwup, sure, but who was also funny and who let him have ice cream every night the year after Mom died, when Dad worked nights. He missed his niece, who smiled and drooled on him and babbled at him. Her first word had been Wookus and everything.</p><p>Being half\u2013Puerto Rican was not a big deal in his old neighborhood, but here in the suburbs, he was the only nonwhite, as far as he could tell. He missed people knowing who he was\u2014Dan\u2019s son, Steph\u2019s brother, widely regarded as a good kid. He missed his room with the poster of Yoda on one wall, one of Michael Jordan on the other.</p><p>Here at Didi\u2019s, the walls were bare. His bedspread was blue, the sheets new and stiff, the bed tightly made, unlike the nest of soft old blankets on his bunk bed back home. Didi asked him to throw out his battered feather pillow, saying she\u2019d bought him a new pillow, and his probably had any manner of microscopic life growing in it. He obeyed.</p><p>If it had just been Joe and Bryce, it would\u2019ve been easier. But Didi was constantly irritable when he was around, no matter how hard he tried to be polite. The fact that he needed a haircut or new shoes seemed like a personal insult, and she\u2019d get a look on her face as if she\u2019d just smelled a rotting corpse. When she had to introduce him, she always called him \u201cJoe\u2019s nephew\u201d\u2014never our nephew. Never Bryce\u2019s cousin, even. One night, he overheard Didi describing his parents as \u201cSouthie trash,\u201d and he had to go for a long run to burn off the hatred.</p><p>Bryce was tiring, too, in a completely different way. Everything Lucas did still fascinated him, from the fact that he flossed his teeth every night (Dad had warned him about that\u2014they couldn\u2019t afford a dentist, so Lucas had been instructed to take damn good care of his teeth) to the fact that he knew how to cook a meal.</p><p>He tried to stay out of the way. Kept his head down, showered at night after the rest of them had gone to bed because Didi made comments about the hot water running out. He never asked for seconds and always made sure his room was neat. He worked to catch up in school and wrote to his father and Steph, because a cell phone wasn\u2019t one of the items given to him. But he emailed from the library every day, sitting at the third computer in the second row. He also sent handwritten letters to Dad because Dad had said in one of their weekly phone calls (which Didi resented) that getting mail was really great. And he sure would love it if Lucas could visit.</p><p>Lucas asked. He waited until he could have a word alone with his uncle. \u201cSure, of course, I\u2019ll see when we can make it,\u201d Joe said, but nothing materialized. He asked again, and then again. Late at night at the end of his second month, he overheard Joe and Didi talking through the air-conditioning vent that made for excellent eavesdropping. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take Lucas to see my brother tomorrow,\u201d Joe said affably, and Lucas actually jolted upright, his heart leaping in his chest.</p><p>Silence, then, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be good for him. He\u2019s having a tough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you an idiot, Joe? You want to take a child to a prison? Can you imagine how that will impact your son? Lucas is a bad enough influence on him as it is. And I think I\u2019ve bent over backward here, taking him in the way we\u2019ve had to. This is not how I envisioned life, you know. Now you want to take him to see your criminal, drug-dealing brother?\u201d</p><p>As usual, Didi got her way.</p><p>So the letters and emails had to suffice.</p><p>Then, after seven months, word came that Dan was being transferred. Overcrowding in Illinois prisons; Dad was going to a facility in Arizona next week. Joe broke the news at dinner, and Didi\u2019s pinched face froze even harder.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can take me to see him this weekend?\u201d Lucas asked, his fork was clenched in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, sport,\u201d his uncle said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Didi answered. \u201cThis is not really dinner conversation, though, is it?\u201d She inclined her head toward Bryce, who was texting someone and smiling.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Aunt Didi.\u201d He hated calling her aunt. She didn\u2019t deserve the title, but maybe, please God, it would soften her up.</p><p>\u201cI said, we\u2019ll see, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>That meant no.</p><p>Dad was being moved on Monday. It was already Wednesday.</p><p>That night, after the family had gone upstairs and no voices drifted down through the vents, Lucas packed his cheap backpack, made a couple of peanut butter sandwiches, taking care to wipe down the counter and put the knife in the dishwasher. Left the house, closing the door silently behind him.</p><p>His plan was pretty basic: he\u2019d get to his sister\u2019s place and get her to borrow her friend\u2019s car. The prison was about three hours out of Chicago. If she couldn\u2019t take him, Tommy O\u2019Shea\u2019s parents might. They\u2019d liked him well enough back in the day. Once, Lucas had intervened in a fight on Tommy\u2019s behalf and got a black eye for his trouble. Maybe it\u2019d be enough to get a ride. Or he\u2019d hitchhike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made it out of the development and walked about a mile to the train tracks. It\u2019d be perfect if he could hop a freighter like the hobos of yore, but the trains on this track were commuter trains and flew by at this time of night. But the tracks did lead into Chicago, so Lucas walked along them, his heart both heavy and light.</p><p>It\u2019d be good to see Dad again. But it would be terrible to see him, too, because this would be the last time for a long time. A really long time.</p><p>Arizona...that was two days of driving, and Lucas didn\u2019t even have a learner\u2019s permit.</p><p>He was about two miles out of town when he looked over his shoulder.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>Bryce was following him. His cousin raised his hand and trotted to close the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cHey! I should ask you that, right? Where are you going? You running away?\u201d</p><p>Lucas took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to say goodbye to my dad. Don\u2019t follow me, okay? I\u2019ll be back in a day or so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s cool! I\u2019ll come with you, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, if you come with me, your mom will have the state police out looking for you. Go home, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019ll be fun! The two of us, together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d Bryce grinned, but there was a hardness there, the stubborn tone of a kid who was used to getting his way. \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle. I wanna say goodbye, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go back home and ask your mother to take you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right. She\u2019d never let me go to a prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. What do you think she\u2019s gonna do when you don\u2019t come down for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Bryce shrugged. In the distance, a train whistle sounded, as lonely and sad as the call of a wolf at this late hour.</p><p>Lucas turned his back and kept walking. Bryce fell in step beside him. \u201cThis\u2019ll be great. We\u2019ll go see Uncle Dan then maybe hitchhike back or something. Maybe we can stop at your old place and hang out.\u201d</p><p>For a flash, Lucas could feel how good it would be to punch Bryce. Hard. Hard enough to knock him down. To tell him to get his head out of his ass, to see things from someone else\u2019s point of view, just once, and not be such an idiot. To go home and enjoy his status as Perfect and Adored Son and not co-opt this one thing, this goodbye to his father. To acknowledge that the loss of his mother and father hurt, goddamn it. To recognize that this wasn\u2019t some sort of cousins-ho! adventure. It was Lucas\u2019s chance to say goodbye to his father, who\u2019d worked so hard and been so stupid and wrong and was such a good guy even so.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun,\u201d Bryce said now. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been out this late at night.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>The train whistle sounded again, and Lucas put his foot on the rail. A faint vibration hummed through it.</p> <p>In a flash, he saw how he could lose Bryce. He could cross the tracks at the last minute; Bryce wouldn\u2019t follow him because he\u2019d be scared of getting hurt. When they were little, he never tried the stunts Lucas could pull on his bike, wheelies and jumps and spins. He wouldn\u2019t even dive off the dock at the lake where Joe had taken them last month.</p><p>So Lucas could sprint across the tracks, and Bryce wouldn\u2019t follow. The train would come, and it was a long one from the sound of it; Lucas hadn\u2019t grown up two blocks from the tracks for nothing. Then he\u2019d run ahead as fast and far as he could, hidden by the train, and duck out of sight. Bryce would give up and go home, and Lucas could make it up to him when he got back. He just had to wait until the train got close enough, so Bryce wouldn\u2019t dare follow.</p><p>It almost worked.</p><p>When he estimated that he had four seconds until the train passed, he bolted onto the tracks.</p><p>But instead of being on the other side, he jerked to a stop right in the middle. You\u2019re supposed to be across by now, a quiet part of his brain calmly informed him.</p><p>One Mississippi.</p><p>His foot was stuck. Wedged tight between two cross ties. He wore Converse high-tops, the kind that went up to the ankle. Laced up tight because Didi had fits if either boy had untied shoes. Which meant he couldn\u2019t just pull his foot out, and wouldn\u2019t have time to untie it. The laces were double-knotted.</p><p>Two Mississippi.</p><p>He yanked and yanked, and time froze, and thoughts flew through his head, as clear and cold as a January night on the plains.</p><p>At least it\u2019ll be fast.</p><p>Bryce is gonna freak.</p><p>Poor Steph, hope the kids will do okay.</p><p>All the while, he lunged with his entire being, but the shoe didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Three Mississippi.</p><p>The light washed over him, blinding him, and the train whistle was screaming\u2014sorry, conductor, not your fault\u2014and he looked at it, all that whiteness and noise and figured this was it, it\u2019d be okay, Mom would be there, and\u2014</p><p>And then something crashed into him, and he landed hard and was rolling on the gravel and dirt and the train was roaring past, shaking the earth.</p><p>Four Mississippi.</p><p>When the train finally passed, the quiet took a minute to return. The sound of hard breathing filled the air.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Bryce said faintly, looking at him. A smile crept on to his face. \u201cJesus Christ, we\u2019re still alive, thank you, God!\u201d</p><p>Bryce had saved him. Bryce had risked his own life to save him, had hurtled across the tracks, tackled him and knocked him free.</p><p>The kid had come through.</p><p>And even though he was glad not to be a stain on the tracks and the conductor\u2019s conscience, Lucas felt his heart slide down a little. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I wasn\u2019t just gonna let you die! That was unbelievable!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s ankle was starting to swell from the force of being ripped out the shoe, which remained unharmed on the track. He tried to stand, but white-hot fire flashed up his leg.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>And he did. Three miles back to the house, Bryce kept hold of him, carried his backpack, never grew tired. Got an ice pack and an Ace bandage and some Motrin. He suggested they not tell anyone about this, and Lucas agreed. They told Didi and Joe he\u2019d tripped, and when he still couldn\u2019t walk without pain a week later, Joe took him to the E.R., where the doctor told him he\u2019d torn a ligament. Crutches for a month, physical therapy for two.</p><p>He never did get to see his father again.</p><p>Dan Campbell died nineteen months later, stabbed in the laundry room of his prison which, he\u2019d said in his letters to Lucas, was much nicer than the one he\u2019d left.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cSO WE NEED a plan,\u201d Colleen said, scrubbing a countertop with Clorox Clean-Up. They were at Faith\u2019s new house, a snug little Craftsman bungalow two blocks off the town green. \u201cA safety net. I need a man, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally on board,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cAs you should be, since I\u2019m your best friend and have been your maid of honor twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate it. Leave those counters alone, Coll. God, he really freaked you out, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Faith rolled her eyes.</p><p>Yeah, okay. Stress-cleaning. Colleen set down the sponge, took off her rubber gloves and turned her attention to unpacking a box full of photos. Here was one from Faith\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding, when Faith had been about ten. Gorgeous, all of those Hollands. The perfect family, unlike her own mess.</p><p>\u201cAbout my new man,\u201d she said. \u201cI need someone hot and romantic and intelligent with a great sense of humor who can cook and is also a cowboy or a firefighter.\u201d</p><p>Faith snorted. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m thinking...uh...cowboys are pretty scarce. And for hot firefighters, we only have Gerard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what would be great? A tragic widower type, like Jude Law in The Holiday. Definitely my type. Or Hugh Jackman in Les Mis. Le sigh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Impoverished fugitives who burst into song. Coming up empty, Coll.\u201d</p><p>Colleen flopped onto the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s the entire problem with living in this tiny town. Fine. Will Jack date me? Can you make him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Faith took the photo and put it on the mantel. \u201cBut you do really want to settle down, right?\u201d Faith said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to break my brother\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to settle down! This whole domestic bliss thing you and Levi have going...I\u2019m burning with jealousy. In a loving, supportive way.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Levi was hot and grouchy and wonderful, and whenever Colleen saw the way he looked at Faith\u2014that protective, alpha thing, my woman, people, and yes, I have been banging her silly...well, sure. She wanted that. Plus, she hadn\u2019t been banged silly in ages.</p><p>\u201cFaith, what\u2019s wrong with me? How come I never found anyone? Anyone real, that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Let me think about that for a second. Plus, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating for two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not official yet, so don\u2019t say anything, and yes, of course you\u2019re godmother. Even if Pru and Honor will kill me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope they do kill you. Then I get your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Levi would have something to say about that.\u201d Her hand went to her belly in that primal, beautiful way.</p><p>\u201cI can handle Levi,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cCome on. I brought you a salad. All that nice spinach is good for my godchild. And it\u2019s loaded with bacon for you.\u201d</p><p>They sat at the kitchen table and ate. Not only had Colleen brought the salad, courtesy of her brother, but also some whole-grain artisanal bread from Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery, sparkling water and Lorelei\u2019s famous carrot cupcakes for dessert.</p><p>The breeze came through the open windows that overlooked the small, precious backyard. Soon there\u2019d be a little kid toddling around out there. It was nice to picture.</p><p>\u201cI think the reason you haven\u2019t found anyone,\u201d Faith said carefully, \u201cis that men are scared of you. They want you, of course, because come on. Look at this.\u201d She waved her hand in front of Colleen. \u201cBeautiful. But it\u2019s intimidating. You have a smart mouth, you\u2019re successful and you know everyone\u2019s secrets. It\u2019s a lot. And then there\u2019s Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I should euthanize him.\u201d</p><p>Faith shoveled in some more spinach. \u201cDo you really like Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Of course I do. He\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, he\u2019s your brother. But he\u2019s got that crinkly eye thing going. Like your dad.\u201d Colleen took a bite of bread. \u201cI wish your dad had married me instead of Mrs. Johnson. I\u2019d make such a good trophy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore that. Okay, of course I\u2019ll fix you up with Jack. And then you can get married and your babies will be my nieces and nephews. Not that I\u2019m rushing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSORRY,\u201d JACK SAID two nights later as they sat at Hugo\u2019s on their first official date. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. Jessica!\u201d She waved Jess down; though Jess worked at Blue Heron for the Hollands, she still waited tables here a couple nights a week. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Jack and I make a great couple?\u201d</p><p>Jess tilted her head. \u201cI\u2019m not really feeling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Colleen drained her martini and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou guys want dessert?\u201d Jess asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Colleen grumbled. \u201cBring us the lava cake, okay? We\u2019ll split it because it\u2019s more romantic that way.\u201d She tried not to mind as Jack looked at Jessica\u2019s ass as she walked away. For one, it was a great ass. For two, yeah...the chemistry thing might be a little hard to overcome. The past hour and a half seemed like six. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On paper, things were perfect. Jack obediently called her for a date, though he didn\u2019t pick her up at her house; she lived a stone\u2019s throw off the green, but he kissed her cheek in the restaurant foyer. He smelled nice. She\u2019d been flirting with him for ages, and he always blushed and went silent, indicating high levels of attraction.</p><p>And then...fizzle.</p><p>Happened every damn time.</p><p>She stared at him. It wasn\u2019t that there was no chemistry. It was that there was a black hole where chemistry was supposed to be. Jack felt an awful lot like a brother right now. Picturing him naked...yuck.</p> <p>\u201cJack, I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019ve been flirting with you for five years now. Now here\u2019s all this\u2014\u201d she gestured to her torso and face \u201c\u2014and you\u2019re just sitting there like a mushroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not quite as...\u201d He let his voice trail off before he damned himself completely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no. It\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She couldn\u2019t help smiling back.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s that you\u2019re like a fourth sister,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut you blush when I flirt with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a flush of horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It seemed rude to say, \u2018Please stop, you\u2019re making my skin crawl.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! I didn\u2019t make your skin crawl!\u201d</p><p>He grimaced.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sphincter.\u201d She put her head on the table. \u201cWell, what am I supposed to do? The man I once loved, who dumped me for someone else, is back in town and I don\u2019t have a boyfriend. You\u2019d think you could just marry me out of decency. How many free beers have I given you over the years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give you more in exchange for your hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, Colleen,\u201d he said kindly, even if he was being a jerk and not marrying her. \u201cYou know. The divorce. Trust issues and, uh, what else did my sisters say? I wasn\u2019t really listening. Anyway. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this sucks.\u201d She paused. \u201cWill you at least be my date for Tom and Honor\u2019s wedding? I can\u2019t go with Connor. He might have a girlfriend.\u201d Perhaps three martinis had been one too many. Then again, conversation hadn\u2019t exactly been flowing. Vodka had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to pass,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI plan to be the handsome, single brother of the bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for nothing,\u201d Colleen grumbled.</p><p>And then the door opened, and bugger it all, there was Lucas Damien Campbell, Prince of Darkness. Alone. Black jeans. Black shirt. Black hair, black eyes (not in the hockey player way, but in the Heathcliff way). God, he was beautiful, a thuggish angel, the kind who did God\u2019s dirty work. Beautiful with a side of scary.</p> <p>You need to stop with the hyperbole, Connor\u2019s voice informed her.</p><p>Colleen swallowed with an audible click, her throat dry as...as...something really dry, she couldn\u2019t think just now.</p><p>She forced her eyes to the blond-haired, blue-eyed Jack.</p><p>\u201cAs of right now, you\u2019re my boyfriend, Jack, and I will castrate you if you deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we wonder why you can\u2019t find a man,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you deeply, Colleen, and can\u2019t take my eyes off you.\u201d His words were undercut by the act of taking out his phone.</p><p>Lucas saw them, did a slight double take, and came over, all predatory masculine grace (now that was a great phrase, oh, mommy, yes, and even better live and in person).</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLucas, what a pleasant surprise, do you know Jack Holland, my boyfriend?\u201d Alas, Jack was texting. Colleen kicked him under the table.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he said. \u201cStop kicking me. I already have three sisters.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled. The special places squeezed. The men shook hands, and Colleen couldn\u2019t help being jealous of Jack, having Lucas\u2019s hand squeeze his, that big, swarthy, beautiful hand, strong and sure and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your lava cake,\u201d Jess said, setting it down. \u201cHey,\u201d she added, looking at Lucas. \u201cDid we go to school together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colleen answered. \u201cI mean, yes, but it was only for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYou guys were together. Nice to see you. Luke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cLike George Lucas,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cNot like Luke Skywalker. Personally, I like Luke better, you know, like \u2018Use the Force, Luke, the Force is strong within you,\u2019 but Lucas isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019m not judging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cut off,\u201d Jess said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the check, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Colleen said. \u201cOur cake is here, punkin.\u201d She took a bite.</p><p>Unfortunately, lava cake tended to be, well...lava-hot. As her tongue shriveled in agony, Colleen reacted. Spit that cake right out.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d Jack murmured as she scraped her tongue free of the molten dessert.</p><p>\u201cThut up,\u201d she said.</p><p>She gulped some ice water, some dribbling down her chin in her haste. Lovely. No napkin, where the hell was the napkin? She looked like a drooling freak. Fine. She used the tablecloth to dab her chin. And neck. And bosom, for the love of St. Patrick.</p><p>Lucas was watching the show, his eyes holding an irresistible hint of smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Lucas? Is there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cJust getting something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because Jack and I want to get back to our romantic dinner, right Pooh Bear?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked confused. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Faith\u2019s brother, right?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. And Prudence\u2019s, and Honor\u2019s. Have we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to date him,\u201d Colleen said. She took another forkful of cake, careful to blow on this one.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou were talking about him in the bar the other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cShut up, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed. \u201cBabe? Sweetie-pie? Cuddlebuns? Can I leave now?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so this wasn\u2019t working. Time to surrender. \u201cJust get out of here, Jack, and thanks for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her un-husband grinned, shook Lucas\u2019s hand far too cheerfully and stopped to chat with Jess. \u201cYou better pay for dinner!\u201d Colleen added.</p><p>He did. He might not want to marry her and sire three gorgeous children (possibly four, if one pregnancy was a set of twins, as Colleen would prefer), but he did pick up the tab.</p><p>\u201cCan I join you?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she muttered. He slid into Jack\u2019s vacated chair, and the air seemed to shimmer with the sheer force of...of them.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slight smile. \u201cWould you like me to?\u201d</p><p>Yes, please. \u201cSuch an ego. Good to see that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two restaurants in this town, Colleen. You own one. I showed up here as a courtesy to you. Not to stalk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can come to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. I have no problem with that. I\u2019m totally over you.\u201d</p><p>Another almost-smile. The special places began to purr.</p><p>Jessica came over and cleared the table, her movements precise and efficient. Lucas ordered a glass of 2010 Fisher Cabernet Sauvignon that Robert Parker had anointed with a 96. It went well with Lucas\u2019s whole fallen angel thing. He might as well have been drinking a soul.</p><p>Colleen looked around the restaurant, automatically smiling at the familiar faces scattered among the tourists. Hugo\u2019s was the fancier restaurant in Manningsport, white tablecloths and flowers and a view of the lake. The sun was setting, the sky purple and slate, the lake darkening. A few boats glided toward the marina, white sails sharp in the dimming light. Hugo\u2019s was busy tonight, and if Hugo\u2019s was busy, it meant O\u2019Rourke\u2019s would be mobbed. She should go help out after this, even if it was her night off.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Her skin felt too tight. \u201cSo you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m here, and obviously we\u2019ll run into each other now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Spaniard,\u201d she said. \u201cThe years have been kind.\u201d</p><p>His eyes smiled. His face didn\u2019t move; it was like a magic trick or something, the way he could smile like that. Those dark, dark Latin eyes. Lucas never said too much, but his eyes did. Always had.</p><p>Never once had he ever said he loved her. Never. But she would have sworn it was true anyway, hell\u2019s to the yes, she thought she\u2019d seen it in his eyes a thousand times.</p><p>She wondered if his wife had thought the same thing.</p><p>Her throat was abruptly tight.</p><p>\u201cI need to walk my dog,\u201d she said. He could just stay here and eat and brood and be by himself.</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Dang it. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He left a few bills on the table, and they went out. Better. The cool May air was welcome against her hot face.</p><p>They crossed the town green. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s looked safe and cheery; she could see the mob through the windows, the soft, golden light and gentle tide of voices and music from inside. The pub\u2019s slogan was simple and heartfelt, and one Colleen had come up with the first day she and Con bought the place: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s: You\u2019re very welcome here.</p><p>And now, Lucas one step behind her, she wanted very much to go into the bar, see her brother, flirt with Tom Barlow and Gerard Chartier, chat up Cathy and Louise, give a hug to Mel Stoakes, whose wife had just died. She wanted to be the person behind the bar, because she knew what she was doing there.</p><p>They went down the block, away from the green and into the Village until they were in front of her house. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she told him, and ran up the stairs, past the landing where she\u2019d just planted her porch garden, and up to her cheery blue door.</p><p>Rufus, her faithful pup, was waiting. \u201cCome on, big guy,\u201d she said, and he bounded down the stairs in two strides.</p><p>Lucas took a step back, she was happy to see, and Rufus did what most dogs did\u2014rammed his snout right into Lucas\u2019s crotch.</p><p>\u201cEasy there, boy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you. Then again, he tried to hump a tree the other day, so don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s teeth flashed in the darkness. \u201cYou need a leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Rufus stuck to her side like a guardian angel as they walked to the park down by the lake. \u201cGo ahead, boy,\u201d she said, and he loped off to sniff and investigate.</p><p>The air smelled coppery and sweet\u2014lilacs and lake water\u2014and the hum from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was audible on the breeze. Small waves slapped the shore and dock. There were a few people out, but it was fully dark now, and most were on their way home.</p><p>The tingling feeling was back, and her whole body thrummed with that invisible connection to Lucas, as if they were circled by electricity.</p><p>She wondered if he felt it, too.</p><p>This is pathetic, she told herself. He was your first love. Big deal. Get over it. He\u2019ll be gone again soon, anyway.</p><p>She sat down on one of the benches that overlooked Crooked Lake. Lucas sat next to her, not touching, but close enough.</p><p>He smelled the same. That clean, sharp smell, like the outdoors. She used to tell him it was ironic, he smelled like the mountains, her city boy\u2014</p><p>Well. He wasn\u2019t a boy anymore. And he wasn\u2019t hers.</p><p>Funny that she\u2019d felt buzzed earlier. She was stone-cold sober now.</p><p>\u201cWell? You wanted to talk,\u201d she said, her voice sounding terse to her own ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was a long silence, the wind gusting. It was getting chilly. She should\u2019ve brought a sweater. Or he could put his arm around her, and she\u2019d feel perfect.</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>Rufus came up, and she rubbed his rough head, then tugged on his ears. He smiled happily and flopped at her feet, and she slid her foot over his stomach for the obligatory belly rub.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Lucas asked.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Fine. Great, actually.\u201d She cleared her throat. Think of him as an old friend. \u201cYou know. Connor and I bought the pub, and he\u2019s the chef, and I run the place. We love it. Things are good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?</p><p>\u201cJust fine. Sort of. Dad and Gail got married, and they have a daughter. Savannah. She\u2019s nine now.\u201d Weird, to be telling him about this. Maybe he knew. Maybe he internet stalked her the way she occasionally looked him up on Google. Well. She hadn\u2019t in a long time. But she used to.</p><p>\u201cIs your grandfather still alive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s horrifyingly healthy.\u201d Gramp no longer spoke and hadn\u2019t in years, and he cried most afternoons, but his body was doing just great. One of God\u2019s little jokes.</p><p>\u201cHow old is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty-seven.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. Didn\u2019t say anything else, and she didn\u2019t, either. He was the one who wanted to talk, after all.</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d he began, and his voice, damn it, so deep and rumbly and scraped her in all those special places, and it just wasn\u2019t fair.</p> <p>She\u2019d talk. It was safer that way. \u201cLucas, here\u2019s the deal. You\u2019re back for a while, and of course we\u2019ll see each other, and no hard feelings, okay? I mean, we were young and foolish and all that fun stuff. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well, and it\u2019s nice for Joe that you\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her, and she forced herself to return his gaze, even if her knees were trembling.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he said.</p><p>Why? Why her and not me?</p><p>\u201cNope. Anything else for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Except I\u2019d really like you to leave Bryce alone. Now isn\u2019t the time for him to be involved with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, God. I mean, Lucas. Sorry. I get you two confused sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI take that as a \u2018piss off.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerceptive of you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right, Colleen. Do what you want. You always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cAfter all, you haven\u2019t been around for roughly a third of my life. Not one letter, not one email, not one phone call. You have no clue about what I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just saying maybe you don\u2019t know everything, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know what\u2019s best for my cousin. He needs to grow up. He needs to stand on his own two feet and be a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love when you talk all Latin machismo.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward so she had to look at him now. \u201cHis father is dying, Colleen. His mother still hasn\u2019t cut the cord, and Bryce hasn\u2019t ever had a job for more than two consecutive months. I\u2019m here to honor Joe\u2019s dying wish that his son grows up a little, and the last thing he needs is another meddling woman trying to run his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about me or Paulie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice. Well, I spend a lot of time with Bryce, unlike yourself. I might know him better than you think. Paulie is a very nice person. She\u2019d be good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not debating that. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s nice. But distracting Bryce and trying to force some kind of romance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Lucas. I understand your opinion. I just don\u2019t happen to share it.\u201d She twisted the silver ring on her right hand. \u201cIs this what you wanted to talk about? Bryce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why? Did you want to talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>Men. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the impression that you want very much to talk about something else. So do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Rufus licked her ankle.</p><p>\u201cColleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Lucas. Is there something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you what\u2019s on my mind. Can you not be so female and please just address what you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t not be female, Lucas. I mean, not without the big operation, which I really don\u2019t want to have and can\u2019t afford anyway.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to strangle you or kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>God.</p><p>God. It was a prayer, as in God help me, because Colleen\u2019s whole body lit up with flares of light and heat and tiny pinpricks of shock. Lucas was hot and hard and strong, and she wrapped her arms around him and held him just as hard, her mouth opening under his, and yes, yes, this was what they were meant to do, this elemental, hard, thought-stealing kiss.</p><p>How dare he.</p><p>She yanked back. \u201cHell\u2019s to the no, Lucas,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re not here for me. You\u2019re back to help your uncle, and then it\u2019s bye-bye, Manningsport, back to Chicago and your swanky life there. So don\u2019t you dare kiss me. Don\u2019t you dare, Lucas. I\u2019m not about to become some little fling you have in between the important chapters of your real life. Been there, done that.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his ridiculously gorgeous hair. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Strike that. Good, she meant. \u201cYeah. So just...you know. Remember that. Whatever.\u201d She stood up. \u201cCome on, Rufus, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Her dog, who was lying splayed on the grass like a giant dog-slut, leaped to his feet and trotted up the street.</p><p>Colleen followed, furious with herself, furious with him, her whole body throbbing with need and lust and heat and...and...</p><p>Don\u2019t go there again, Connor\u2019s voice said. We know how this ends. We\u2019ve been through this before.</p><p>You\u2019d be stupid to do it again.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>BY THE TIME his senior year of high school rolled around, Lucas Campbell was well aware that girls found him very appealing. He didn\u2019t mind. Had the typical fun with the occasional girl, making out in a car or stairwell at school, getting fifteen texts a day from some infatuated sophomore. His school had almost two thousand kids in it, and he was out from the shadow of being Bryce\u2019s impoverished orphaned cousin, since Bryce went to a private college prep school (days, of course; Didi would never let him board).</p><p>But then they moved from Illinois to the tiny town of Manningsport, New York, a postcard type of place with vineyards and a lake that was a far cry from the mighty Michigan. Bryce had gotten into Hobart (thanks to Lucas dragging his GPA into a respectable range), and Didi took a transfer to her company\u2019s branch in Corning so she could be closer to her son.</p><p>Lucas, on the other hand, got a full scholarship to University of Chicago. When Didi announced the move to Manningsport, he figured he\u2019d stay in Chicago; Stephanie would let him crash on her couch for a couple of months until he graduated. But Bryce wanted him to come along, already distressed that they wouldn\u2019t be at the same college, and Bryce generally got what he wanted.</p><p>It was fine. Lucas had no ill will toward his cousin, who was easy to get along with and endlessly cheerful. Come August, they\u2019d be parting ways, and he\u2019d even miss the big doofus, so what was another few months? No big deal.</p><p>Until he saw Colleen O\u2019Rourke, that quick instant when their eyes met, and something he\u2019d never felt before slammed into his chest at seventy-five miles per hour.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he would\u2019ve classified (and dismissed) her as another too-popular pretty girl, same as any other.</p><p>But something happened when their eyes locked.</p><p>She saw him.</p><p>Not just his general bad-boy looks, which he had nothing to do with but which had an undeniable effect. Not just a slide of her eyes up and down his torso.</p><p>She saw him. Her eyes\u2014her big, wide beautiful eyes changed from smug and amused to...more open somehow. Like something clicked, and she could see his whole life story in one look.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it one freaking bit.</p><p>By the end of that day, he knew her voice, could tell when she was nearby, because it was the same feeling as when the barometer dropped in front of a storm, that strange, buzzing sensation he\u2019d get before the mighty Midwestern clouds rolled in, churning with electricity and heat. The same feeling as the night he\u2019d put his foot on the rail and felt the train coming, that hum of power.</p><p>She felt it, too. He could tell, because she avoided him for weeks.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t even look him in the eye, the girl who seemed to have a smile and a quip for everyone, universally looked up to by the other girls, universally wanted by the boys.</p><p>If she was walking down the hall and he happened to be close by, she\u2019d veer off or stop to talk to someone\u2014the janitor, a teacher, a friend. If he was sitting in the bleachers, watching Bryce play soccer, she made sure to sit far away. She didn\u2019t come into Raxton\u2019s Hardware, where he\u2019d gotten an after-school job. Only if she absolutely couldn\u2019t avoid it would she give him the briefest and most generic smile he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Ever since his father had gone to jail, Lucas felt as though he was half invisible and half a front. His fellow students in Manningsport were a little awed by his newness, his half\u2013Puerto Rican looks, as most of them were as white as snow. A mixed-race kid from Chicago? Wow! Cool! Bryce saw him almost as a superhero, where the ordinary act of doing his own laundry was regarded with wide-eyed wonder. To Joe, he was a remembrance of the old neighborhood, an obligation to his late brother.</p><p>Sometimes he\u2019d watch Bryce and Joe horse around on the perfect lawn of the perfect house, scuffling over the soccer ball, and a sense of longing would almost drop Lucas to his knees\u2014to go back in time so just once more, he could sit on that old blue plastic crate, handing his father tools as he worked on a car.</p><p>The memory of that almost moment on the train tracks, when he\u2019d almost made it to see his father one last time, almost had been able to tell his father he\u2019d been a good dad, almost had that last time to see his father who had worked so hard, who\u2019d done a very wrong thing for very right reasons...just one more time to see those careworn eyes smile at the sight of his son. He\u2019d almost had that.</p><p>Joe tried. But he had a son, and Didi made sure he remembered the difference between son and unwanted relation.</p><p>As for Didi, he\u2019d learned early on to stay out of the way. If he joined them for Family Movie Night (Fridays) or Family Game Night (Mondays) or Family Hike (Sunday afternoons), she\u2019d get that corpse-sniffing look on her face, her lips tight, her eyes on him for too long, willing him to disappear. Lucas claimed that he\u2019d rather stay in his room and read, which wasn\u2019t untrue. But when he heard them laugh, or even just the sound of Didi\u2019s voice, relaxed and easy with him not around...he\u2019d just turn up Bryce\u2019s cast-off iPod and try to remember his mother\u2019s face.</p><p>His sister would call once in a while, mostly to vent about Rich. Things weren\u2019t working out, and Steph was up to her ears in babies: Mercedes was one of those high-maintenance types who\u2019d learn to talk back before she could walk, and the twins, Tiffany and Cara, were toddlers bent on taking over the world one broken lamp at a time.</p><p>So Lucas\u2019s plan was simple. Make good grades, get a scholarship to a school in Chicago, go into a field where he\u2019d make a lot of money, take care of Steph and the girls. Head down, nose clean.</p><p>It irked Didi that Lucas was smarter than her own son, but then again, this way, she had a built-in tutor. She made sure Lucas checked Bryce\u2019s homework and taught him algebraic theorems and quizzed him in history dates. Between that and his own heavy load of homework, running interference when his cousin hung out with the wrong kids or drank too much, the job at the hardware store and cutting lawns on Sundays so he could save as much as he could, Lucas definitely did not have time for a girlfriend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had a plan, and it wasn\u2019t to fall in love. He had three months of high school left, three months to spend with kids who\u2019d been together since birth, it seemed. He\u2019d be going back to Chicago soon. He was just passing through Manningsport.</p><p>And then prom night came, and for once, he was in the right place at the right time. When he saw Colleen on the dock, being held by that dickless wonder, he felt something bigger and more powerful than anything he\u2019d felt since his father had been led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. He would\u2019ve died for Colleen O\u2019Rourke that night with a glad heart, no questions, no hesitation.</p><p>From that night on, he and Colleen were together. They weren\u2019t dating, hanging out, hooking up. They were together. He was locked in from the second he kissed her, something he\u2019d been thinking about doing from the moment he first saw her, something he\u2019d vowed not to do because it was certain that even one kiss would bind him to her.</p><p>He was right. The second his lips touched hers, a word came into his head, a word from long ago when his mother was still alive, when Spanish was still spoken at home.</p> <p>M\u00eda. Mine.</p><p>Colleen was his.</p><p>They managed to wait until after graduation to seal the deal; the first time for both of them, two kinds of birth control because he was paranoid about getting her pregnant, the way his father had done to his mother. He went as slowly as he could, heart thudding so hard he shook, unable to believe that she\u2019d have him.</p><p>It got awkward, they were nervous and inexperienced, and it was amazing anyway, and when he was on top of her and inside her at last, and he was just holding still for fear of causing her any more discomfort than he probably already was, she opened her eyes, those beautiful clear eyes, and just looked at him. Colleen who always smiled and always laughed was serious now, and for one beat of his heart, he thought she was going to say Get off, leave, this isn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered instead, and the words wrapped around his chest and squeezed hard.</p> <p>No one had said those words to him in a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cSay that again,\u201d he whispered, just to make sure he\u2019d heard right, and she laughed, and the sound was even better than her words.</p><p>She could do that\u2014flip a switch like that. She\u2019d be laughing with her friends on the green, eating an ice cream cone, and she\u2019d see him walking to the hardware store, and her eyes would change from that slightly knowing, sly smile to unguarded and soft and full of so much that he could drown in it. Or the reverse, too\u2014one July night they were lying on a blanket in the backyard of her house, just holding hands, and Lucas was trying to figure out a way to tell her he loved her, because of course he did, and of course she knew it. But the actual words...they were harder.</p><p>Just say it, his brain instructed. Don\u2019t be such an ass. She tells you five times a day. You\u2019re gonna blow this, you know.</p><p>But the words stayed locked.</p><p>Colleen rolled on top of him, looking at him, and there it was, that soft, gentle gaze that seemed to know every event that had torn off a chunk of his heart\u2014his mom\u2019s slurring voice as her ability to speak died little by little, his father\u2019s arrest, the phone call that came from the prison at 2:36 a.m., asking if he was the son of Daniel Wakeman Campbell\u2014every jealous thought he\u2019d ever had about Bryce, every lonely minute spent trying to be invisible...Colleen\u2019s love erased them all.</p> <p>But all he could do was look at her, touch her face, and hope she knew.</p><p>She smiled just a little, almost as if she was answering his question. \u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said, and her smile grew in a flash, and his was born. Because yeah, it felt as if he had never smiled until her.</p><p>Her family liked him well enough\u2014except for her father, which was understandable. Pete O\u2019Rourke tolerated him, though, and Lucas appreciated it. Her mom exclaimed over his manners and always made a lot of noise when she was coming down the hall, giving them a warning to keep it clean. Connor watched him at school, and then seemed to mellow, realizing that Lucas wasn\u2019t some player out to break his sister\u2019s heart.</p><p>In late August, she drove him to Chicago, ten hours of them holding hands and barely talking, and dropped him off at the university, took an unnecessarily long time to unpack his meager belongings and walked around campus with him.</p><p>Then it was time for her to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in an hour,\u201d he said, kissing her for the hundredth time.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m already over you. It was a passing thing, like a virus.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cNot that you\u2019ve ever said it once, mind you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, feeling as if he was saying goodbye to the brightest, best thing that life had ever granted him, and Colleen wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face against him. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said, and her back hitched with a sob.</p><p>\u201cAdi\u00f3s, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love when you speak Spanish. So hot.\u201d</p><p>Then she got into her car and drove off, tossing him a cheery salute that contradicted the tears that gleamed on her cheeks.</p><p>He stood there until her car turned the corner. Kept standing there until she pulled up again, because he\u2019d known somehow that she\u2019d drive around the block to see if he\u2019d left. She got out of the car, laughing, and jumped into his arms again. \u201cGo to your dorm, idiot,\u201d she said. \u201cCall me in an hour.\u201d</p><p>So his plan became more complicated. Stay in college, make good grades, get a job that earned a lot of money, take care of Steph and the girls...and marry Colleen.</p><p>For three and a half years, it worked. Whenever possible, in between working as a security guard at a gleaming skyscraper downtown, between fixing Stephanie\u2019s car/furnace/pipes and the occasional stint babysitting the girls, working summers for a construction company, keeping his GPA over 3.7, he saw Colleen. He\u2019d hitchhike back to Manningsport when he could, or kick his roommate out for the weekend when Colleen came to Chicago. They called, emailed, instant-messaged, took advantage of whatever form of communication available to them.</p><p>She was still his. He was still hers. He wasn\u2019t sure why she kept him, but she did.</p><p>And then, one weekend when he had scored a plane fare that let him fly to Buffalo-Niagara for seventy-nine dollars, the shit hit the fan.</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t been sure he could get the time off from work, he hadn\u2019t told Colleen he was coming. Figured it\u2019d be fun to surprise her; she was going to Ithaca College, not wanting to be too far from home, from her elderly grandfather, specifically. Connor was at the Culinary Institute, which was a few hours\u2019 drive, and Faith was all the way in Virginia. Colleen put on a cheery front, but Lucas knew she was lonely. She\u2019d told him she\u2019d be home this weekend, and the stars had fallen into alignment with that flight.</p><p>He stopped for a cup of coffee at an airport kiosk, tore open two sugar packets, glanced up and saw a familiar figure.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s father was kissing someone who was definitely not Colleen\u2019s mother. Who was, in fact, a redhead dressed in a tiny white dress that just cleared her (admittedly great) ass and who wore high heeled shoes and was wrapped around Pete O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>Both of them had suitcases.</p><p>Both appeared to be doing a tonsil swab of the other with their tongues.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke broke the kiss, looked up with the smug expression of exactly what he was: an older man with a very hot, much younger girlfriend. Then he saw Lucas. He froze for a second, and\u2014horribly\u2014smiled. \u201cLucas. How are you, son?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never called Lucas that before, that was for damn sure.</p><p>He took the hot chick\u2019s hand and towed her over to where Lucas was standing, sugar packets still not emptied into the coffee. \u201cThis is Gail,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d she purred.</p><p>She was a knockout, Lucas would give her that. Long red hair, creamy skin, and a look in her green eyes that said she knew it.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cGail, babe, give us a second,\u201d Pete said, and Gail gave both men a sultry look and cruised away, ass swinging in a blatant advertisement. Pete folded his arms. \u201cSo this is awkward,\u201d he said. He gave Lucas a fake smile, his eyes completely uninvolved, like a snake\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s going on here, so I won\u2019t bother saying it\u2019s not what it seems. It\u2019s exactly what it seems. But it would obviously hurt my family\u2014Colleen especially\u2014to hear about this.\u201d</p><p>He kept talking. More of the same. I\u2019m not terribly proud of it...Colleen\u2019s mother...haven\u2019t been right for a while...just happened...wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He made Lucas\u2019s skin crawl. The kind of man who thought he was smarter than everyone else, who endured conversation from his wife. Slick, that was the word.</p><p>But Lucas knew how much Colleen loved him. She was a daddy\u2019s girl, but not in a bad way. Just in maybe a typical way, a girl who thought her father was the smartest, funniest, greatest guy around. Steph had felt the same way about their dad. And yeah, with Colleen, Lucas would admit, Pete was okay.</p><p>\u201cSo I hope I can count on your discretion, son. No reason for anyone to get hurt here.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave him a long look. \u201cI\u2019m not your son,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cTrue enough. Well, you probably have to get going. I gather you\u2019re visiting my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t bother answering. Glanced over at Gail, who was putting on lipstick to the fascination of a security guard, then back at Pete. Without another word, he hefted up his backpack and walked away.</p><p>When he arrived in Manningsport a few hours later, he stopped at the Black Cat, the scummy little bar where Colleen occasionally filled in. Her face lit up when she saw him, and he smiled as she launched herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about you!\u201d she exclaimed, her eyes bright. \u201cYou\u2019re a sight for sore eyes, Spaniard. Kiss me! Do it!\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, and the unclean feeling from the airport faded.</p><p>Colleen took him home for a late dinner, and they sat at the kitchen table. Jeanette cut him a slab of cake before helping herself to one, and said how Pete was in Mexico...a conference for commercial property owners.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to go?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said, waving her hand demurely. \u201cPete said it wouldn\u2019t be any fun. Just a hotel with a lot of drunk people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad hates those things. Wouldn\u2019t want to drag Mom there and make her suffer, too,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>Yeah. What a champ.</p><p>All weekend long, it throbbed like a rotten tooth, and every once in a while, he\u2019d reach out and touch the thought. Framed how he\u2019d bring it up to Colleen. Hey, m\u00eda, I ran into your dad and his lover at the airport or Hey, Colleen, how are things with your parents? or This conference of your dad\u2019s, Colleen\u2014it\u2019s no conference.</p><p>A hundred times over the weekend, he started to tell her, and stopped. It wasn\u2019t his place. Maybe it would blow over. Maybe Pete and Jeanette O\u2019Rourke had an arrangement, an open marriage, whatever.</p><p>Colleen drove him to the airport Sunday night, waited with him as she always did, every minute together precious. She lay with her head on his lap, her long black hair glistening under the lights, a smile on her face, eyes closed.</p><p>She looked so happy.</p><p>\u201cThings are good with your family?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said without opening her eyes. \u201cYou know. Connor\u2019s perfect, Mom\u2019s discovered scrapbooking, and Dad...Dad\u2019s been working a lot.\u201d</p><p>Now was the moment.</p><p>But the smile on her face...he couldn\u2019t. Stroked her hair instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, I have a summer job lined up,\u201d she said, practically purring under his hand. \u201cNurse\u2019s assistant at Rushing Creek. Kind of great, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019ll be great. I can work there, take care of Gramp, sock some money away, finish school, and then we can get married and have twelve beautiful children.\u201d She smiled more fully and opened her eyes. \u201cSpeaking of that...\u201d</p><p>Lucas stopped breathing.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of what?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cKids. Marriage. Eternal love and death do us part. Wanna get married this summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d he managed.</p><p>She bolted up. \u201cWhat? No! Oh, I get it. Sorry. Wow, look at your face. Are you having a heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, babe. Not pregnant. I mean, come on. We use two kinds of birth control.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut you do want to get married, right?\u201d</p><p>He was still digging out of the avalanche of terror. \u201cUh, sure, m\u00eda. Someday, yeah.\u201d He took a deep breath and looked at her face. Shit. Wrong answer. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Never a good sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to get married. To me, specifically.\u201d</p><p>This was, unfortunately, one of the few parts of their relationship that stuck a little. Her picture of the future, and his.</p> <p>To her, there was nothing at all scary or strange about getting married young. Why not? They loved each other. (True.) She wanted to live in Manningsport, preferably down the street from Connor, and have a bunch of kids.</p><p>And so did he. Mostly.</p><p>Except for the Manningsport thing. He was a Southie. His sister lived in Chicago, not to mention his nieces, and Steph always needed something, whether it was babysitting, or extra money, or a flat tire changed. She was his true family, as opposed to Bryce and Joe and Didi. He hadn\u2019t even called them to let them know he was in Manningsport this weekend, not wanting anything to take away from his time with Colleen.</p><p>Marriage, sure. Just not now.</p><p>Lucas wanted to get through law school, having decided that was the best way to make a decent living. Colleen wasn\u2019t materialistic, but Lucas would kill himself before having her live in some shitty little apartment the way Stephanie did, bartending nights while he was in law school. She deserved better than that, and until he could give it to her, they weren\u2019t doing anything. He wanted health insurance and sunny rooms and a yard and a dog.</p><p>He wanted to provide for his family, and he wasn\u2019t going to have one until he could give them a good life. He wasn\u2019t ever going to be in the same straits his father had been in. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWell, this silence doesn\u2019t give me much to go on, does it?\u201d Colleen said, pulling her legs up onto the chair and wrapping her arms around them. She rested her chin on her knees and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>That got a little smile.</p><p>\u201cJust not yet, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have this image of me,\u201d she said, \u201cas needing a nice car and three acres and a membership at the country club.\u201d Her voice wavered a little. \u201cAnd all I want is for us to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttention passengers,\u201d came the voice over the PA. \u201cWe\u2019ll now begin boarding for American Flight 227 for Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cWe should have these talks earlier in the weekend next time.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, tasting the salt of her tears. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The words almost made it out this time. It didn\u2019t matter. She knew anyway, and despite her wet eyes, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Even if you don\u2019t deserve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kind of do.\u201d She stood up and hugged him and kissed him again, sending him off with a smile and a pat on the ass, despite her wet eyes.</p><p>Next time, he promised himself. Next time he would definitely say the words. And next time, he\u2019d tell her about her father and Gail.</p><p>EXCEPT HE DIDN\u2019T.</p><p>How do you break someone\u2019s heart? How do you ensure that someone never sees her father the same way again? He just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>So he told himself it wasn\u2019t his business. Maybe the affair had blown over by now, anyway. It was the right thing to do, he told himself. Even if agreeing with Pete O\u2019Rourke made him feel unclean. It wasn\u2019t his job.</p><p>If his conscience knew that was bullshit, Lucas nonetheless stayed mute on the subject. His arguments for doing nothing sounded good enough. For two months, he tried not to think about it.</p><p>One April night, he sat at the front desk at the trading firm where he was one of the night security guards, attempting to read a textbook on commercial torts in anticipation of law school, and instead listening to Bernard detail his conquest the weekend before.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s all this and that, right? But I just keep looking at her, she\u2019s so hot, let me tell you, a body that would make Jesus weep, okay? And so all these guys, they\u2019re trying to get her number or dance with her, but I just stare, and she\u2019s all, \u2018Hey, what you looking at, ass**le?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m looking at nothing,\u2019 and she\u2019s all pissy now, right, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, because these stories tended never to end, a banging came on the front door of the lobby, despite the fact that it was after ten.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your girlfriend?\u201d Bernard asked. \u201cMan, you been cheating on her or something? Yikes. That, or she\u2019s pregnant, dude.\u201d It was Colleen, clad in a sweatshirt, jeans, flip-flops and a Yankees hat. She was crying.</p><p>Lucas ran over, punched in the code for the door, and she hurled herself into his arms, her face unrecognizable with grief.</p><p>\u201cM\u00eda, what happened?\u201d he asked, holding her hard.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk on the phone...so I just came here, I drove all day...he...my...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Connor? Is he okay?\u201d Oh, God, if something happened to her twin, it would kill her. Literally, maybe.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she managed, her voice strangled. \u201cIt\u2019s my father. He\u2014he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d he asked, picturing Smug Pete lying in a hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s...\u201d He heard her take a shaking breath, then another. She pulled back and wiped her eyes with the heels of her hands. \u201cLucas, he\u2019s divorcing my mom! He has some whore on the side, and she\u2019s pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGail?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Huge. Fucking. Mistake.</p><p>She blinked up at him, her face changing. \u201cHow...how do you know her name?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. The damage was done\u2014time to face the music. \u201cI saw them at the airport a while ago. He, uh...he introduced me.\u201d</p><p>Bernard grimaced and tiptoed a safe distance away to the bank of elevators where he\u2019d probably eavesdrop.</p><p>The innocent distress that had painted Colleen\u2019s face a minute ago slid off, and in its place came a horrible nothingness.</p><p>She took a step away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth. Opened it. Closed it again, then spoke. \u201cYou saw them together, and you never told me?\u201d Her voice bounced through the huge, vacant foyer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to break it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did nothing? Let me sit there like an idiot, thinking my father was the best guy in the damn world, and he was screwing another woman the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was this? A man-to-man agreement or some such shit? You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want to know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. I should\u2019ve said something, and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re sorry. Well, that\u2019s fine, then. You\u2019ve been lying to me for\u2014how long? How long have you known? Specifically, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cSince February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince February?\u201d The last word was a shriek. Bernard peeked around from the elevator banks again and shrugged, male sign language for Dude, if I could help you, I would, but you\u2019re up shit creek, man.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s breath was coming in gasps.</p><p>\u201cColl, I think you should calm down.\u201d</p><p>Again, such a dickhead thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2014 Wow. Wow, Lucas. Months! You\u2019ve known for months! Did it ever occur to you that if you\u2019d said something, maybe I could\u2019ve stopped this? Maybe I could\u2019ve talked to him, and he would\u2019ve seen how wrong this was, and I wouldn\u2019t have a baby brother or sister on the way right now, did that ever occur to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, if you\u2019d just listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve loved to have listened a few months ago. Now, not so much.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cLook. I know how you worship that guy. Okay? And I didn\u2019t want to say anything, since this is exactly what would happen. You\u2019d get hysterical.\u201d</p><p>Dickhead thing to say. He winced and tried to take her hand, but she pulled it away. Folded her arms and looked out the window, her jaw hard. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Don\u2019t call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d Here came the part where he would beg.</p><p>\u201cIn case it\u2019s unclear, we\u2019re breaking up.\u201d</p><p>Her words sucker punched him in the gut. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to law school, my family\u2019s imploding, and maybe we\u2019re not the people we think we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d she barked, even as tears spurted out of her eyes, \u201cthat I thought you were the kind of person I could trust! But no, Lucas, you\u2019ve been keeping this huge secret from me, and it\u2019s about my family and my father, but you decided who gets to be told and who gets to stay in the dark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were close, I thought, despite the fact that you\u2019re struck mute half the time we\u2019re together, that you loved me! But maybe you don\u2019t! Maybe I\u2019m just a habit you don\u2019t know how to shake. Same as my father can\u2019t shake my stupid, oblivious mother, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Colleen, that\u2019s not how it is at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, do you want to get married, then?\u201d Her breath was ragged.</p><p>You have the right to remain silent. \u201cYes. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, I want to get married sooner than eventually.\u201d She jammed her hands on her hips, and for the first time, Lucas felt a stir of anger.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re blackmailing me, is that it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI screwed up, I was trying to protect you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even go there. Do you want to marry me, or don\u2019t you? Do you want to play the field? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, come on.\u201d He tried to take her hands, but she stepped back. \u201cThere\u2019s no one but you, okay? But if you\u2019re asking if I want to get married now, at the age of twenty-two, the answer is no. I don\u2019t want to live above some garage, I don\u2019t want the hassle that goes along with getting married, not to mention staying married. Not right now. I just don\u2019t, Colleen. I\u2019m sorry about your father, but...no.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a few seconds. \u201cTake care, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she walked out, and he stood there like an idiot, her words surreal, hanging in the air like a noose.</p><p>\u201cJesus, man,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cShe\u2019s feisty.\u201d</p><p>Lucas bolted after her. \u201cColleen, this is stupid. We don\u2019t have to break up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d she said, yanking open the door of her Honda. \u201cIf you think of being married to me as a hassle, we do. Now, I\u2019m sorry, but I have a ten-hour drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, don\u2019t be irrational.\u201d On such a roll tonight, really. But honestly, she couldn\u2019t issue an ultimatum just because she was upset. That wasn\u2019t how things worked.</p><p>\u201cYou had a choice. You made it. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Nice. Did she think he was about to drop to his knees and say, \u201cYes, baby, whatever you want, just don\u2019t leave me.\u201d For the life of him, she looked as if she was about to rip his heart out of his chest and eat it like an apple. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like an idiot,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d she answered. \u201cWho could resist such tender and beautiful words? Really. I\u2019m all choked up. Fuck you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She got in the car, slammed the door and threw it in gear, laying down some rubber as she left. Screeched around the corner.</p><p>He pulled out his phone and texted her. Slow down and call me later. We\u2019re not done.</p><p>She may have slowed down. She didn\u2019t call.</p><p>He called her the next day. When it went to voice mail, he hung up and called the house. Connor answered.</p> <p>\u201cIs Colleen around?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in the middle of something,\u201d Connor said tightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She told me. Uh...can you have her call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her you called.\u201d Connor hung up.</p><p>Fine. She was mad, he understood. She could call him when she wanted to. But he wasn\u2019t going to marry her because she ordered him to or as some kind of Band-Aid; he\u2019d marry her when they could have a good life together. That had always been the plan, and she knew it.</p><p>Colleen had never gone without. Lucas had. He remembered his sister at the age of sixteen, spending hours to get across town, taking three buses to the store that had double coupons once a month. He remembered knowing not to ask for seconds because whatever was left over would be tomorrow\u2019s dinner, too. He\u2019d been poor, and he\u2019d seen what a lack of money had driven his father to do, and he was damned if he\u2019d bring Colleen into that life.</p> <p>As for the situation with her father...that was wretched. He knew this must be killing her, and the only thing he wanted was to help. But he\u2019d called her, and she didn\u2019t want to talk, so it was her move.</p><p>A week later, Colleen hadn\u2019t called him.</p><p>Fine. She wanted to take a break, fine, that was great. Smart, even. She had shit going on, and so did he. Classes. Finals. He\u2019d be going to Loyola for law school. Stephanie had found another, slightly nicer apartment and needed him to help her move. Maybe Colleen would realize that all or nothing wasn\u2019t the way to play this. Maybe she\u2019d miss him.</p><p>It took him a month to snap.</p><p>He took a bus to Manningsport and got there at nine-thirty that night with a massive headache from diesel fumes and the rose perfume of the old lady next to him, who hadn\u2019t stopped talking since Terre Haute. He stood for a minute on the green, breathing in the clean air, the smell of the lake and recent rain. The town was quiet, and it took a minute for Lucas to acclimate from the roar of the Greyhound bus, the squeal of its brakes.</p><p>The Black Cat was open.</p><p>Despite thirteen hours of thinking of nothing else, Lucas suddenly wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to say. Hopefully, when she saw him, she\u2019d give him that smile and say, \u201cIt took you long enough, idiot,\u201d and all was fine with the two of them, and yes, marriage now wasn\u2019t the best idea, of course she\u2019d wait. She loved him. And this time, he\u2019d tell her the same thing.</p><p>Still, he hesitated, not sure if walking through the door was the best plan. From the green, he could see the bar was crowded. Probably, being May, there was some kind of wine thing in town, as there was most weekends during the spring and summer (and fall, and half of winter). Sure enough, there were plenty of out-of-state license plates on the cars parked in the street.</p> <p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t even there. Maybe he should go to her house and throw pebbles at her window, like he had the summer after high school graduation.</p><p>He\u2019d take a look inside, see if he caught a glimpse of her.</p><p>The windows on the side of the bar showed the pool table and a little open area where people sometimes danced. And sure enough, Colleen was there, and his heart lurched so hard he staggered a little.</p><p>She was talking to some guy he didn\u2019t recognize, and she was laughing, and God, he\u2019d missed her so much, he\u2019d forgotten how beautiful she was even if he had a dozen pictures of her, and it was so stupid that they\u2019d gone twenty-nine days without\u2014</p><p>Then she kissed him. The guy who made her laugh.</p><p>Really kissed.</p><p>As in, kissing.</p><p>Lucas stepped back. Kept looking, though.</p><p>The guy\u2019s hand went to her ass.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move it.</p><p>He wanted to look away, but he couldn\u2019t. He wanted to kill that guy, unleash his South-Side talents and go for it. Grab her by the hand and drag her out of there and remind her just who she belonged to, and yes, beg her to take him back.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to need reminding. She loved him. So she said, anyway.</p><p>The kiss ended, thank God. Another smile. She laid her hand on his chest and said something, giving him that grin\u2014the grin that promised so much, that Lucas had seen countless times, slightly knowing and...and...</p><p>Almost without realizing it, he was walking. Past the library. Past the other restaurant. Post office, candy store, antiques, antiques, bakery.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure where he was supposed to go, really. Didi\u2019s house was out of the question. He felt as if he\u2019d been sliced open with a blade so sharp he was a little confused as to why his guts were spilling onto the street. Hey, where\u2019s all this blood from? Are those intestines? That\u2019ll leave a mark, won\u2019t it? Band-Aid\u2019s not gonna help that one, pal.</p><p>He spent the night on a bench in the little cemetery, a place where Colleen wouldn\u2019t see him just in case she drove past. The sky was black, and somewhere nearby, a stream shushed gently, counting the hours as they dragged past.</p><p>The next morning, when the sky was just turning pink, he hitchhiked into Corning and caught a bus to Chicago.</p><p>He skipped his graduation ceremony the next week. Started both jobs he\u2019d lined up for the summer. Took his nieces to the beach. Went running along Miracle Mile.</p><p>And then one day, he ran into Ellen Forbes, a classmate from college. Also a political science major, also from Chicago itself, though not a Southie, no way. A Cubs fan and everything.</p><p>He knew her, of course. Ellen was nice. One time this past year, she\u2019d had a study group at her parents\u2019 apartment\u2014a two-story, massive penthouse overlooking the lake. Her parents had been away, but a maid or housekeeper set out trays of food: lobster macaroni and cheese, filet mignon sliders, Greek salad, sweet potato fries. Wine and microbrewed beer. Ellen was cool about it, neither embarrassed by her family\u2019s wealth nor stuck-up about it. It was what it was. He mentioned that he worked on a Forbes Properties job the summer before; she said she hoped they treated him well.</p><p>She\u2019d always seemed happy. Pleasant. Nice. They were friends, a little bit, anyway. Ate together occasionally, always with other people, too, and took a lot of the same classes. She always said hello and chatted, the kind of easy and graceful conversation he imagined they taught in finishing school, whatever that was. She was headed for law school, too, at Northwestern.</p><p>It was about a month after graduation when she came to the construction site where he was working. It was his third consecutive summer working for Forbes Properties, and there she was, talking to a silver-haired guy in a suit\u2014Frank Forbes himself. Lucas waved.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger!\u201d she called, and he went over, wearing carpenter shorts and an aging T-shirt, hard hat in hand, and met her father.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, this is a classmate of mine,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cLucas Campbell, my father, Frank Forbes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, son,\u201d the man said, shaking his hand firmly.</p><p>\u201cLikewise, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. This is my third summer here. Johnny Hall hired me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good people, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. It\u2019s a beautiful building.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Forbes smiled. \u201cThat it is.\u201d He turned to Ellen. \u201cSweetheart, I have to talk with the building inspector. Give me ten minutes, okay, and then we\u2019ll grab that lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Ellen said. Her father walked away.</p><p>\u201cI should get back to work,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, sorry, Lucas, I didn\u2019t mean to keep you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe should grab a drink, since we\u2019re both here for the summer. Talk about law school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI meant as friends, Lucas,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI know you\u2019re seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m...not.\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d seen Colleen with that other guy, it felt as if a hard, wooden block had filled his chest, as if that hot, soft place that Colleen had created with her very first glance at him had petrified into something unbreakable.</p><p>A beer with a pleasant woman who\u2019d never been anything other than nice? Why not? \u201cSure. Let\u2019s grab a beer,\u201d he said.</p><p>He met her at a bar near her place. They had a drink. They had another. Two beers for him, two glasses of white wine for her. He paid and walked her home, the smell of chocolate from Blommer\u2019s thick in the air. Talked about mutual friends, professors, the usual.</p><p>When they got to her place, a town house on North Astor Street, she asked him if he\u2019d like to come up. He said yes. When she offered him another beer, he took it. When she told him to have a seat on her sleek gray couch, he did. Then she kissed him, and he kissed her back, slightly drunk and feeling oddly surreal.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t kissed anyone other than Colleen in four years.</p><p>Colleen, on the other hand, had already moved on.</p><p>Ellen was nice. She smelled good. Her lips were soft.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay?\u201d Ellen whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m on the Pill.\u201d She smiled and kissed his neck.</p><p>So he took her to bed for the simple reason that she was nice, and she was uncomplicated, and he was almost unbearably lonely.</p><p>The hard place in his chest remained.</p><p>In the morning, he thanked her for a nice time and said he\u2019d call her. She smiled, said she had a nice time, too.</p><p>Nice. It was the only word applicable. Ellen was nice. They\u2019d had a nice time. He\u2019d been nice, too.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to have any expectations, and she didn\u2019t seem needy or desperate. It certainly hadn\u2019t felt like his heart might stop because he loved her so much. It had just been sex, and despite the reputation of the twentysomething American heterosexual male, Lucas was finding that just sex and making love were miles apart.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t want to be a dick, he called Ellen that weekend. They went to a movie and he held her hand, and when it was over, he apologized. He had to be at his construction job at 6:00 a.m., which was the truth. Maybe they could do this again, since it was all so nice. He kissed her quickly. She emailed him a few days later, saying she was going away for a while with her mom. Have a great time, he responded.</p><p>Three weeks later after they\u2019d gotten that beer, she called him and said she needed to see him. It would be best if she could come over.</p><p>Before she even got there, he guessed. She waited until he\u2019d gotten her a glass of water and sat across from her at his tiny kitchen table before saying the words.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that I\u2019m pregnant. And I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s not...it\u2019s fine.\u201d There were probably better responses he could\u2019ve made, but his mind was a roaring white space at the moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellen cried a little\u2014hormones, she said, and apologized repeatedly. She\u2019d been on antibiotics a few weeks before, and apparently, that weakened the birth control. He told her it wasn\u2019t her fault, just biology. She admitted to being in love with him since freshman year but knowing that he had a girlfriend back home. She wasn\u2019t asking him for anything, but he had a right to know that she\u2019d be having a baby, and even though the circumstances were far from ideal, part of her felt blessed.</p><p>He looked at his hands for a long minute.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d he said finally, meeting her eyes.</p><p>She made some token protestation, but her eyes lit up at the prospect.</p> <p>Besides, what else was he going to do? Be a baby daddy? Hopefully get some visitation rights? His father had gotten his mother pregnant with Steph, and they\u2019d worked out okay. They\u2019d been happy.</p><p>He\u2019d been raised to be honorable, despite how things might\u2019ve looked from the outside. He\u2019d gotten a girl pregnant, and he\u2019d stand by her.</p><p>Just how things had become so badly butchered between him and Colleen...he couldn\u2019t think about that anymore. He was going to be a father.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cMOM, LET\u2019S GO already!\u201d Colleen bellowed up the stairs of her childhood home. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Satan\u2019s plan,\u201d Connor said mildly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Got any better ideas, brother mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could set yourself on fire. That\u2019d probably be more productive.\u201d</p><p>Colleen narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cLook. She\u2019s finally interested in meeting someone else. Take a gander, Con. This place is a shrine to Dad.\u201d She looked back up the stairs. \u201cMom! This place is a shrine to Dad, for the love of God! You should redecorate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Colleen. Maybe I\u2019ll just burn the whole house down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she serious?\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to tell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019re her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t burn the house down, Ma,\u201d Connor said as Mom emerged (finally) from the bathroom. \u201cAnd you look very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ready for forty minutes,\u201d she said. Any outing with Mom tended to be like this. Suicide-provoking, in other words.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, you two. You\u2019ll be the prettiest ones there,\u201d Connor said, securing his position as favorite.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. Cutie Potatoes.\u201d Mom beamed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what would be so great, Cutie Potatoes?\u201d Colleen said. \u201cIf you came with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re single!\u201d Mom said. \u201cI want grandchildren. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to art class,\u201d Connor said. \u201cIs it even art class, or is it just a meat market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s art class. Please.\u201d</p><p>It was art class with a side of meat market. Singles art class, mind you, and yes, Colleen was trying to trick her twin into coming along. Granted, Colleen loved singles events. Loved them! Singles events were to her what Gaul was to Julius Caesar. She came, she saw, she conquered. Granted, her search for a sugar daddy had been fruitless thus far. The truth was, she had a soft spot for older men and liked to give them an ego boost by flirting with them. Sharing her gift with the world, that was all. Looking for a serious relationship...not so much.</p><p>Mom took a look in the mirror, hoisted a bra strap and sighed. \u201cIf only your father hadn\u2019t had a lapse in judgment,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s Lapse in Judgment,\u201d Connor said. \u201cNow in its tenth year at the Winter Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor Michael O\u2019Rourke, shut it,\u201d their mother said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a love that was more than a love and not realize how special and wonderful it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wonderful, the cheating and the lying,\u201d Con said.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, there\u2019s that,\u201d Mom said. \u201cNo one\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of your father\u2019s many flaws, Connor. I love him anyway. If he\u2019d come to his senses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Colleen said patiently, \u201cDad\u2019s been with Gail for ten years. A third of your children\u2019s lives. Please get on with your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Colleen,\u201d Mom said, sighing as only a Catholic could. \u201cIf you\u2019d prefer, I\u2019ll just be the stupid, aging rejected first wife, traded in for a whore, and I\u2019ll start drinking and become a bitter, fat alcoholic. Would that be better?\u201d</p><p>Connor and Colleen exchanged a look. \u201cWe could give it a try,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>And that was the weird thing with Mom. She knew Dad wasn\u2019t leaving the Tail. Then again, he might well trade her in for a newer model, now that Gail was staring down forty. But he wasn\u2019t coming back to Mom, and Mom knew this...she just wouldn\u2019t admit it.</p><p>Colleen looked at her watch. \u201cOkay, Dad\u2019s a cheating dog, and Mom\u2019s a martyr, and Con, you and I are emotionally scarred for life. Can we get going? Let\u2019s find you a new man to smother, Mom. Hopefully, he\u2019ll be a good stepfather and get me that pony I always wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want season tickets to the Yankees,\u201d Con said.</p><p>\u201cOh, me, too. And a pony. A black pony named Star Chaser. Also, the Barbie Dream Van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Foosball machine. And new soccer cleats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two materialistic little monsters,\u201d Mom said fondly. \u201cAs if I\u2019ll meet anyone. Certainly no one as handsome as your father, because if there are men like that at this thing, they\u2019re all looking for whores like Gail.\u201d One more glance in the mirror, one more Catholic sigh. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. I suppose it beats staying home and scrubbing the bathroom floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it, though?\u201d Connor muttered, and Colleen smacked him on the back of the head as she passed. Yes, there were times when Colleen wished she and Connor had grown up in a nice clean orphanage. Dad was a complete jerk, but he was the only father she had. Not everyone got the John Holland type, those gentle, faithful, sloppy dads who still had his daughters sit on his knee and remembered not only their birthdays but how much they weighed at birth and what Santa had brought them for Christmas when they were five.</p><p>She got Pete O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>But Mom was trying, or pretending to try, even if it was so she could have another failure on her list\u2014 Dating: A Complete Joke, Your Wretched Father Ruined My Life/If Only He\u2019d Come Back.</p><p>Thus, Singles Art Class.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>MANNINGSPORT WAS HOME to the Wine Country Art League, whose offices squatted between the optometrist\u2019s office and the pizza place in the strip mall over by the trailer park. Every year there\u2019d be an art show, and since O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was one of the sponsors (as was every other business in town, you really couldn\u2019t get out of it), Colleen would go, pretend to admire the crooked mugs and plates the same weight and thickness as discuses, the smudgy landscapes depicting\u2014guess what\u2014vineyards\u2014and the still lifes of\u2014guess what\u2014wine bottles and grapes.</p><p>But it was kind of cute nonetheless.</p><p>And they offered classes. There were other singles things\u2014Singles Shooting Night, which Colleen had gone to with Faith once; she\u2019d had a very good time. Guns and romance, what could be better? There were a few singles wine events in the off-season, but Mom worked at Blue Heron in the tasting room and didn\u2019t want to do something work-related in her free time. There was Singles Sailing (\u201cA quick way to drown,\u201d Mom said), and Singles Square Dancing (\u201cWhere the perverts go to meet\u201d), and Singles Mixology, hosted by none other than O\u2019Rourke\u2019s and taught by Jeanette\u2019s fabulous daughter (\u201cI\u2019m your mother and everyone will pity me\u201d).</p><p>And so, Singles Art Class it was.</p><p>Paulie was coming, too. After the disaster and near injury of Paulie\u2019s first attempt with Bryce and the trip to the shelter (Paulie had hyperventilated in the parking lot), Colleen thought that maybe Paulie needed to practice a little on the opposite gender.</p><p>They pulled into the strip mall; Mom waved to Edith Warzitz (whiskey sour, two cherries), who was older than God but apparently looking for love, too. The lovely Lorelei (sweet Riesling to match her sweet personality) waved and blushed...hmm. As soon as Colleen was done with Paulie, maybe she\u2019d try fixing Lorelei up with someone. Gerard Chartier, maybe, because that goofball had been single long enough. Plus he was a firefighter, so all the women loved him. Firefighters seemed to make either wonderful husbands or become man-whores. Therefore, it really was Colleen\u2019s sacred duty to fix him up, or he\u2019d wind up dying of gonorrhea.</p><p>The Art League looked more like a nursery school than an artist colony, but that was largely because of the quality of the work hanging on the walls. A handprint turkey? Really?</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d a man said, approaching Colleen. He wore a winter coat, despite the warm May evening, and had orangey teeth. His breath enveloped her in a toxic cloud. \u201cWow! I never expected to see someone like you at a thing like this! I would love to take you home and have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour game needs work, pal. And a little oral hygiene wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd after that, we can hook up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about some dry humping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear God,\u201d Mom said. \u201cColleen! Do something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Ma? Shall I castrate him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will.\u201d</p><p>The man continued to stare. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be castrated,\u201d he said, raising a tousled eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThen back off, buddy. My mother\u2019s menopausal. You never know what might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, that\u2019s fine. But you\u2019ve failed.\u201d She granted him a smile.</p><p>\u201cIs this what dating is like?\u201d Mom asked in horror.</p><p>Kind of, yes, Colleen thought. \u201cNo! I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet someone great for you, Ma.\u201d</p><p>Paulie was just coming in, dressed in white leggings (who knew they made them?), a black tank top that showed off her muscular pectorals and a pink Thneed. It was almost cute, almost being the key word.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to that red sundress we picked out?\u201d Colleen asked. Paulie had nice enough clothes; she just didn\u2019t wear them.</p><p>\u201cIt gave me a rash,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cIt was cotton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Nerves. I had to go for comfort. Sorry, Coll. Besides, check out the sweater. You like the way I wrapped it?\u201d</p><p>Colleen suppressed a Catholic sigh. \u201cI do. You look great.\u201d Too late for honesty, and Paulie needed the confidence.</p><p>Another man, this one dressed in black pants and a yellow turtleneck, approached. He was very pale.</p><p>\u201cLadies, good evening.\u201d Based on the accent, Colleen would have to guess that he was Count Dracula.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Colleen said. Mom remained silent, clutching her arm in a python grip. \u201cI\u2019m Colleen, this is my mother, Jeanette, and this is my friend Paulie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeanette, Colleen, Paulie, yes, yes, hello. I am so pleased to meet you.\u201d He pushed back his hair, revealing a sharp widow\u2019s peak. \u201cYou and Jeanette are mother and daughter? And both so luffly. I am Droog Dragul.\u201d</p><p>The bizarre name sounded familiar. \u201cHave you ever been to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Tavern?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I heff not had pleasure. I teach at college. You are student, perhaps? Shall we heff date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait! I think you went out with a friend of mine. Honor Holland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Honor, she is so luffly! And now marrying Tom, my friend! You are going to wedding? We can go as couple, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are most welcome.\u201d He turned to Paulie, who appeared stricken. Colleen pointed to her own face and smiled, then made the sign for talk by opening and closing her hand. Paulie\u2019s face flushed purple, but bless her, she looked up (way up) at Droog. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Oh, dear. Well. Brave attempt.</p><p>Colleen steered Mom, who was cowering like an abused dog, to the classroom in the back. Easels had been set up in a circle.</p><p>\u201cIs it warm in here?\u201d Mom asked, starting to flutter her shirt.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a hot flash,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mom said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hot. Wow! They must\u2019ve turned up the heat. Make them turn it down, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s menopause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always think my problems are menopause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace, get my mom on some estrogen, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo God better reward me for this.\u201d</p><p>The instructor came in\u2014Debbie Meering (strawberry margarita), who had painted Still Life with Grapes #15 out in the gallery.</p><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d she cried, flinging out her arms and hitting Droog on the back of the head. \u201cLet\u2019s start by taking a few cleansing breaths...in...and out!...and in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case we\u2019ve forgotten how to breathe,\u201d Colleen said to her mom, who rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve decided to embrace Art with a capital A!\u201d Debbie said. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my life! No, it has. I\u2019ve found a side of myself heretofore hidden\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a word you just don\u2019t hear enough,\u201d Mom said, and Colleen felt a rush of affection for old Momster. She had her moments.</p><p>\u201cEveryone should feel free to tap into their inner gods and goddesses,\u201d Debbie continued, \u201cand set free their muses and let their chakras flow! There is no right or wrong here, just Art! With a capital A! And of course, our fellow single people! Let loose your true selves, people!\u201d</p><p>The students glanced nervously around; Colleen was quite interested to see what the true selves would be like. The Hulk? Wolverine (please, God)? Voldemort? Nope, everyone seemed like their regular selves. Ah, well.</p><p>Except for Orange Tooth, Droog the Vampire and a man so old Colleen wasn\u2019t quite sure he was alive, everyone here was female. The usual, Colleen knew.</p><p>And that was the thing. All the women here were attractive enough. Clean, at any rate. They\u2019d made an effort. Granted, the Thneed choked off much of Paulie\u2019s appeal, but still. She was trying. The point was, normal, honest, decent women with good hygiene were always willing to go to these types of events, whereas the normal, honest, decent men seemed to be anywhere but.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s get started by going around the circle and telling everyone why you\u2019re here and what you\u2019re looking for in a relationship. Bert? Get us started, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Bert, the elderly man, was fast asleep in his wheelchair, drooling. Colleen grabbed a paper towel for when he woke up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, Colleen, why don\u2019t you get us going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI\u2019m Colleen, perpetual flirt, here with my mom to find me a stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you looking for love?\u201d Debbie asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I am, Deb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer first boyfriend just came back to town,\u201d Mom offered. \u201cHe broke up with her years ago, and she\u2019s still not over him. She wants to find someone. A beard. Is that the right term?\u201d</p><p>See? Just when she was feeling warm thoughts about Mom, this happened. \u201cWow, thanks, Mom. I\u2019d deny that, but I\u2019m reeling from the fact that you\u2019re so willing to blurt out my personal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Jeanette?\u201d Debbie asked.</p><p>\u201cColleen made me come.\u201d Mom looked around at the others in the circle. \u201cMy husband left me for a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d said a woman who had to be eighty if she was a day and was eyeing Drooling Beauty. \u201cAn actual prostitute. He said if the dwarf on Game of Thrones could do it, then so could he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And you, Paulie?\u201d Debbie said, completely unfazed.</p><p>\u201cI, uh...well, there\u2019s a certain someone who... He... I wouldn\u2019t...\u201d Her face blossomed into the fascinating mottled purple. Mom started shirt-flapping in sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of, um, unrequited love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnrequited at the moment, that is,\u201d Colleen said, giving Paulie a smile.</p><p>\u201cYoung luff!\u201d chortled Droog. \u201cHow wonderful! Eh heh heh heh heh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Is my turn over?\u201d Paulie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is if you want it to be,\u201d Deb said.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s over.\u201d Paulie wiped her forehead with the tail of the Thneed.</p><p>The rest of the class took their turns, saying more or less the same thing\u2014\u201cI\u2019d like to meet a nice person for a special friendship, possibly more.\u201d So Match.com.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s get started,\u201d said Debbie. \u201cStanley? Come on in.\u201d A man came in, barefoot and wearing a pink terry-cloth bathrobe. \u201cStanley\u2019s our model today, people. Make yourself comfortable, Stan.\u201d</p><p>Stan stood in the center of the circle, turned so his back was to Mom and Colleen, and let the bathrobe drop to the floor.</p><p>Colleen and Mom recoiled in unison.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known it was possible for a man to be so...so...hairy.</p><p>And so naked.</p><p>And so, so hairy.</p><p>As in, pelt. As in, he could donate his back hair to Locks of Love.</p><p>\u201cI think I found my stepfather,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are not funny, young lady. I\u2019m telling Connor about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may kill him.\u201d Colleen hunched behind her easel, torn between the urge to pee in terror and hilarity. \u201cOkay, time to make art,\u201d she whispered to her mother. \u201cTake a good hard look, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been struck blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my country,\u201d Droog said, his tone conversational, \u201cback hair is sign of virility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, Stan, you must have twenty children,\u201d Mom answered drily.</p><p>Coll glanced over to Paulie, who was giving off light, she was so red in the face. She was on the other side of the circle. The front side, God bless her, which meant she had to see the...parts...of Stan, Stan the Hairy Man. Lorelei sat next to her, chatting away, drawing without a care in the world.</p><p>Stan struck a pose, sort of a Mercury pointing to the heavens, and Colleen had to pretend to check her phone to hide her laughter.</p><p>\u201cColleen?\u201d Debbie asked, leaning over her easel. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even started yet. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that a week of waxing won\u2019t solve,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s rude,\u201d Debbie said. \u201cBodies are all beautiful, all miracles of a higher power, all representative\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, I\u2019ll get started.\u201d</p><p>Debbie gave her a disapproving look\u2014no inner goddess for you!\u2014and moved on.</p><p>Colleen took a breath and risked another look at the wizened bu**ocks and scrawny legs of Sasquatch. A breeze came through the window, ruffling the tufts of hair on Stan\u2019s shoulders, and Coll bent down to hide another surge of wheezing laughter.</p><p>For the next half hour, Mom Catholic-sighed and sketched and gave Colleen censorious glances. Colleen herself drew several rather adorable stick figures, complete with tufts of hair, trying not to look directly at Stan, specifically at the fronds of armpit hair, which hung down like human scalps. The skin under her eyes grew raw from tears of silent laughter.</p><p>\u201cStanley, thank you,\u201d Debbie said at long, long last. \u201cClass, one of the things you may not know is just how physically taxing nude modeling is. If you\u2019d like to tip Stanley, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he should pay me for having to look at that,\u201d Mom muttered, fishing out a dollar bill. Colleen, unable to make eye contact, handed him a twenty.</p><p>She went over to Paulie. To her surprise, Paulie had drawn a pretty good picture of Stan, capturing his beady eyes and balding head, and hunched, criminal posture. \u201cNice, Paulie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOnce I got over the shock, it was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first na**d man?\u201d Colleen whispered.</p><p>\u201cWell, my first in real person. I\u2019ve watched a little p**n .\u201d</p><p>Colleen bit her lip. \u201cI see. Listen, I\u2019m sorry there aren\u2019t more men here to practice on. You never can tell with these singles things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay! It\u2019s nice to do something different.\u201d Paulie smiled up at Colleen so sweetly that Coll\u2019s heart tugged.</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking Bryce should see you on your home turf,\u201d she said. \u201cYou interested in throwing a party?\u201d The Petrosinsky home was gorgeous, if, er, unusually decorated.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Paulie said. \u201cYeah! My dad would love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll invite everyone.\u201d Colleen smiled, squeezed Paulie\u2019s rock-hard biceps, reminded herself to work out more and went to find her mom. She was talking to Orange Tooth, who wore a pair of Uggs similar to Colleen\u2019s own, though she wore them only in the winter, like a normal person. Colleen overheard Mom say the phrase \u201clapse in judgment\u201d and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLorelei, do you know Gerard Chartier?\u201d Colleen asked, figuring she\u2019d scatter a few seeds.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Lorelei said. \u201cKind of a man-whore, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. He needs a good woman to reform him. And I know for a fact he loves your coconut macaroons.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion in the corner. Orange Tooth had fallen to the floor, clutching his chest. \u201cCall 9-1-1,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI\u2019m having a heart attack and need sixty milligrams of Oxycontin and a bolus of morphine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone else thinking prescription drug abuse?\u201d Colleen murmured.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the guy (whose name was Calvin) was being bundled into an ambulance. He was talking, sucking hard on oxygen and clutching Mom\u2019s hand. Gerard and Jessica Dunn, who was a volunteer firefighter, were talking reassuringly to him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the heroic man-whore, right?\u201d Colleen said to Lorelei. \u201cNothing like a guy in turnout gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cColleen!\u201d Mom barked. \u201cCalvin wants me to go with him. Follow me to the hospital so you can drive me home.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Colleen got out of her car and walked into the E.R., a place she\u2019d spent many happy hours as a kid, watching Connor get sewn up from his various injuries.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Calvin,\u201d the intake nurse said. \u201cBack to visit us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me some Oxy, stat,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not the generic crap. I want the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grounded, young lady,\u201d Mom said as they wheeled Calvin away. Since he still hadn\u2019t let go of Mom\u2019s hand, she had to go, too, which was cute in a serial killer kind of way. Colleen waved merrily. As Paulie said, it was good to do something different.</p><p>But Mom would be really nice to Calvin because Mom was really nice, if a little obtuse. As for Colleen, having to wait here in the E.R. with nothing to do, or read...</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d call Faith. Nah. It was after nine, and Faith was a newlywed and probably shagging Levi this very moment.</p><p>A sweet needle of envy pricked Colleen\u2019s heart. Not that she begrudged the happy couple. It was just that everyone seemed to be pairing off these days. Even Connor had a girlfriend, and one important enough to sneak around with. So far, the nanny cam she\u2019d put on his bookshelf had captured nothing.</p><p>Honor Holland and the lovely Tom Barlow had hooked up pretty fast, too. The first night Tom had come into the bar, Colleen felt a tiny spark of interest; how could she not, with Tom\u2019s blue-collar British accent and goofy smile? But the spark fizzled for no good reason. Just like with Jack. Just like with Greg the waiter from last summer. The damn spark always fizzled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except with one guy.</p><p>Maybe she understood Mom better than she let on.</p><p>Not that she was still hung up on the past. She was happy, she\u2019d gone out with plenty of guys and slept with a few (though not as many as she let people think).</p><p>But there were a lot of nights in the past couple years when she lay in bed at night, wondering if she\u2019d ever find anyone who made her feel...special. The way Lucas once had.</p> <p>Exactly four minutes had passed since she arrived. Maybe she\u2019d go see if Jeremy Lyon was on call. He was always good for a chat.</p><p>She walked through the E.R. to the main part of the hospital. Faith\u2019s niece, Abby Vanderbeek, was on the front desk, volunteering no doubt, earbuds in place as her thumbs flew across her phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, Abby,\u201d she said to the teenager. \u201cIs Jeremy working today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, Colleen,\u201d Abby said without taking out the earbuds. She tapped a few keys. \u201cNo, sorry. It\u2019s Dr. Chu. She\u2019s new and schizo, so beware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoop. Any patients I might know?\u201d Colleen asked. Who knew how long Calvin would need Mom to stand guard?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to tell,\u201d Abby said. \u201cConfidentiality and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered by HIPAA, since I work part-time at the nursing home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I forgot. Have you seen Goggy and Pops over there?\u201d Abby said, asking about her weirdly named great-grandparents.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not in my wing. I heard your grandmother complaining about the food, though. I hid.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled and hit a few more keys. \u201cLet\u2019s see...how sick do you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sick. That way I can be an angel of mercy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude. You\u2019re so awesome. Okay, I can fix you up. Joe Campbell\u2019s in for dialysis. You know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThanks, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The dialysis unit was on the third floor of the hospital, same floor as the intensive care unit. Last year, Gramp had been here for a week with pneumonia (almost managed to die that time before his pesky and amazing immune system saved him), and Colleen had seen Joe. After she\u2019d gotten Gramp settled and he\u2019d fallen asleep, she\u2019d ventured over to say hi.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known him too well back when she was with Lucas, but Joe and Bryce had been a father-and-son fixture at the far end of the bar until six months ago.</p><p>Being a bartender\u2014the bartender\u2014made her privy to all the town gossip. She\u2019d heard that Joe\u2019s wife, the pinched and snotty Didi, hated going to his appointments, and Bryce seemed to be in denial about his dad\u2019s condition. Joe was often alone during these long, quiet stretches when his blood was cleaned and rotated back inside him.</p><p>So yes, she\u2019d visited. Dialysis took a long time, and it was boring. Three or four times a week, four to six hours at a stretch. Joe was always happy to see her.</p><p>She peeked into Joe\u2019s curtained area. He was awake. \u201cTime for your sponge bath, Mr. Campbell,\u201d she said in her sultriest voice, getting a most rewarding grin from him.</p><p>\u201cWhich Mr. Campbell are you referring to?\u201d came the voice behind her.</p> <p>She jumped.</p><p>Lucas.</p><p>Of course. He raised an eyebrow at her and sat down next to his uncle, a paper cup of coffee in his hand.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shaved today. Or yesterday, maybe. And what was it about that? Did they teach this to men in Man School? Don\u2019t shave, fellas. Chicks love that, wondering how it would feel to have your scratchy face in all sorts of places\u2014</p><p>\u201cLucas, it\u2019s you,\u201d she said, aware that she hadn\u2019t said a word. \u201cI was referring to your much handsomer uncle. Hi, Joe! How are you?\u201d She leaned over and kissed him, and he patted her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, sweetheart. I hope you brought me some of your amazing margaritas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t they kill you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBut what a way to go.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou remember my nephew, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, given that we dated for four years, yes, I\u2019m afraid I do.\u201d She smiled at Joe. Not at Lucas.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Colleen,\u201d Lucas said. There was a chair next to him.</p><p>She tried not to brush against him as she sat down. Tried not to notice that he smelled so good, that clean, outdoor smell even here in the hospital.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSo I\u2019m here because my mom\u2019s date seems to need a drug fix. These are interesting times in the world of romance.\u201d She glanced at Lucas (damn those beautiful eyes), then told the story of the hirsute nude model, and by the end, Joe was laughing so hard he could hardly talk, tears leaking out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colleen, it\u2019s good...to see you...sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed, just like that. Lucas lurched forward.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glanced at her, frowning, then watched his uncle\u2019s chest, which rose and fell with a breath. Another one. Another. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d he asked, sitting back down.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cLucky guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever become a nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an LPN. Licensed practical nurse. I work over at Rushing Creek. There are a couple dialysis patients there.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019ve visited Joe here a couple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he knew that Joe came here alone most of the time.</p><p>\u201cSo you understand how all this works, then?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched a few YouTube videos.\u201d He looked tired. And worried.</p><p>He\u2019d never said too much about life with Joe and Didi. When they were dating, they didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with his relatives. There\u2019d been an awkward family dinner in the early days (she seemed to remember insisting on it). Bryce had been as cheerful as a puppy, Didi with that pinched look, Joe amiable and friendly.</p><p>But Lucas could say more with his eyes than most people could say in three days.</p><p>Then again, that was the kind of thinking that had gotten her exactly nowhere.</p><p>Lucas adjusted Joe\u2019s blanket, and that tender gesture...damn. Those were the kinds of things that messed with a person\u2019s head. She should go before she felt mushier than she did already.</p><p>\u201cSo where are you staying while you\u2019re here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI got a furnished apartment in town. The old opera house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Faith used to live there. With Levi. Well, across from Levi, then with Levi, then they bought a house. They\u2019re cute. The apartments, I mean. Well, Levi and Faith are cute, too. You know what I mean.\u201d She closed her eyes as the Tourette\u2019s of Terror welled up again, spurred on by the old feelings that had led to her ruination.</p><p>She pictured Lucas in the generically furnished apartment, alone, not staying in the big McMansion where the other Campbells lived. The quiet of the green at night. No dog to keep him company.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have dinner sometime?\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>He gave her a long look, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only asking because, well, hell, maybe you\u2019re lonely. I collect strays, you know how it is. Plus, you don\u2019t know too many people here. But you know me. And I know you. But it\u2019s not a date. It\u2019s not romantic, I mean. It\u2019s just dinner. We get together and eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I seem to remember how dinner works.\u201d His eyes were smiling.</p><p>Her arm was almost touching his, and she had an almost overwhelming desire to put her arms around him and draw his head to her shoulder, kiss his hair and tell him it would be okay. Maybe kiss him on the forehead. Or the mouth. Or the neck. Or the\u2014</p><p>Slutty. Very, very slutty, envisioning sex in the dialysis unit.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so intent on Bryce and Paulie being together?\u201d His voice was low and perfectly pleasant.</p><p>She risked another look at him. Damn. His hair was so frickin\u2019 beautiful, black and curly, carelessly tousled. If hair could talk, his would say, That\u2019s right. This means everything you\u2019re imagining. Run your fingers through me. Do it. You won\u2019t be sorry.</p><p>\u201cColleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yes. Um, what was the question?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and her uterus clenched. \u201cBryce and Paulie. Why is that a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and looked at Joe, who was dead to the world. Poor choice of words, actually. Who was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t say anything to Bryce, will you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t. She could trust him, she knew. No one she\u2019d ever met in her life was as honorable as Lucas Campbell. \u201cPaulie\u2019s loved him for years. She\u2019s a really great person, Lucas. Decent and kind and good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember her from high school?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot really. I remember those chicken ads, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Thirty-eight ways to a heart attack,\u2019\u201d Colleen said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t her father have ties to the Russian Mafia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was never proven.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf Paulie\u2019s so great, Colleen, why are you fixing her up with my cousin? Why aren\u2019t you fixing her up with Connor or Jack Holland or someone with a job and a future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want those guys. She wants Bryce.\u201d They were whispering, not wanting to wake poor Joe.</p><p>\u201cAnd why does she want Bryce? Because he\u2019s good-looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, Lucas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014and I repeat, if\u2014you manage to get Bryce to date her, what about what happens next? You know how many women Bryce has slept with?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed hotter. A lot, she knew, give or take a few.</p><p>\u201cA lot,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cHe likes the shallow, beautiful type who are only interested in screwing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly the type of women Bryce sleeps with,\u201d she whispered back, suddenly furious. \u201cAnd yes, they\u2019re generally shallow and beautiful, and no, Paulie isn\u2019t. And maybe it\u2019s time for Bryce to find someone with more depth and character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a big mess on your hands, and your friend is going to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. He might marry someone else when she thought he was in love with her.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a narrow-eyed stare. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about my cousin, who goes through life without having to deal with the consequences of his actions, Colleen. If you want to fight about the past, you\u2019ll have to do it alone, because I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to talk about something that wasn\u2019t on your agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who showed up here, I might point out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one who swans back into town\u2014 You know what? Forget it. I happen to think Bryce should be with a woman like Paulie. No, she\u2019s not some supermodel slut. She\u2019s grounded and decent and loyal. And, I might point out to you, Spaniard, I\u2019ve got a fairly amazing track record when it comes to matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce is going to break her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, how concerned you are about the hearts of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, look at my uncle,\u201d Lucas said, his voice low. \u201cBryce has convinced himself Joe will get better, but he won\u2019t. Joe asked me back here so he could see his son settled before he dies. I don\u2019t want to have to tell him that Paulie\u2019s father had Bryce\u2019s body dumped in the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow Godfather: Part III. I think the Chicken King is more likely to cut him into pieces and deep-fry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce needs to grow up. He needs a job, a home, a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Paulie could\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cColleen, he\u2019s never had a real relationship in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither has Paulie,\u201d she whispered hotly. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t it be nice to see first love work out for a change?\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cLeave him alone. Don\u2019t manipulate him into a relationship he\u2019s not ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut men are simple creatures, Lucas dear, meant to be manipulated into doing what\u2019s best for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you manipulate me into doing what was best?\u201d His eyes were hot.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re my one failure. Ellen Forbes, on the other hand...she had you down cold.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shut off, all that heat and anger instantly muted. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, I\u2019m wrong. You and she are like a Lifetime television movie. Boy from the wrong side of town marries billionaire\u2019s daughter. Very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about her.\u201d</p> <p>That hurt\u2014Lucas, defending his ex-wife. \u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cEither way, you underestimate your cousin. And Paulie, too. And me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve never underestimated you, hotshot.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo you\u2019re barreling ahead with this because you\u2019re mad that I married Ellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Spaniard, your irritation is just a happy byproduct. I have good instincts about people, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your instincts somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, you were the only man I\u2019ve ever been wrong about. You and my dad.\u201d</p><p>His jaw turned to iron, but he didn\u2019t deny the comparison. Turned his eyes back to Joe.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said, standing. Yes. Time to make a regal exit.</p><p>Unfortunately, she tripped on the leg of the chair, landing on Joe, who woke up with a start (and a yelp). Lucas hauled her off his uncle and set her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she said. \u201cAre you okay? Did I bruise your kidneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they don\u2019t work anyway,\u201d he said kindly.</p><p>\u201cAny other body parts hurt? Spleen? Liver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m dying as it is.\u201d</p><p>She bit her nail, then stopped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. Most fun I\u2019ve had in weeks. I love your perfume.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas didn\u2019t add his reassurance, she noted. \u201cFeel better,\u201d she said to Joe, leaning over to kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI already do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him; well, she tried to. Hoped to God, she hadn\u2019t hurt the poor guy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you about dinner,\u201d Lucas said as she left the room.</p><p>\u201cThe offer has been revoked,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you soon, Joe.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>THE AGE OF twenty-two is not generally celebrated as time of deep wisdom and calm, measured acts.</p><p>Almost as soon as she broke up with Lucas, Colleen regretted it.</p><p>But the thing about being right most of the time...it was hard to know what to do when you were wrong. If she\u2019d been, that was because Colleen was kind of on the fence.</p><p>She knew one thing. Everything felt wrong without him.</p><p>At first, she\u2019d just been furious. Life was going to hell on a lightning-speed roller coaster. Dad, Mom, Gail, a baby...and Lucas had lied to her, had played God, deciding what she should and shouldn\u2019t know. What did that say? What if he kept other things from her? What else wasn\u2019t he telling her? Say they did get married and he got a brain tumor. Would he keep that from her, too? Huh? Would he?</p><p>\u201cColleen, enough,\u201d Connor groaned one night. He was done at the CIA and was working at Hugo\u2019s. Colleen was still bartending at the Black Cat, but she\u2019d come over on her dinner break because she wouldn\u2019t eat the food at the Cat with a gun to the back of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to hear this one more time. You broke up with him. If you want him back, call him. Okay? But I can\u2019t listen to you and Mom complaining all the damn day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen. You disgust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Is that why you were making out with that guy the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. That was nothing.\u201d Colleen shifted, guilt squirming in her stomach. The guy in question was some dork from Ithaca and, yes, she\u2019d flirted with him. And kissed him. And then told him that while he was cute and she was positive she\u2019d regret it, she couldn\u2019t go out with him (that is, have sex with him). Because that kiss had been totally meh.</p><p>Not like kissing Lucas, when the world seemed to stop, when the world seemed to smile, even, because they were so right together.</p><p>Then again, Lucas hadn\u2019t been banging on her door, begging to get back in touch with her. One voice mail. One call to the house. That was it. So they were taking a break. Fine. Maybe it\u2019d get his priorities straight. Maybe he\u2019d miss her.</p><p>Maybe...and this was the thought that caused a cold tremor of fear to shake her heart...maybe he was relieved. She was, after all, his high school sweetheart. He\u2019d said he wasn\u2019t ready for marriage. Maybe...maybe like so many other men, her stupid father most certainly included, he wanted to see if there was someone else out there.</p><p>Because he sure didn\u2019t try very hard to win her back. She hadn\u2019t seen that coming.</p><p>Dad had moved in with Gail the Tail. He hired a divorce attorney and started proceedings, and Mom sobbed for twelve hours straight, and Colleen cried with her as the movers took her father\u2019s things away, taking with them the memories of her happy childhood.</p><p>Connor hadn\u2019t been as close with their dad as she had, but this had shaken him, too. Not just Mom\u2019s distress, but Dad being so...pathetic. A hot young second wife. Another family. And in case that wasn\u2019t enough, a convertible.</p><p>But despite that, she couldn\u2019t stop loving her father. She was mad, embarrassed, furious...but when she heard his voice on the phone, or even when she saw him, sometimes, just for a second, she\u2019d forget that he was the man who cheated on Mom, and she\u2019d just remember Daddy. The man who taught her to ride a bike and sail a boat, who used to brush her hair when she was little, who read her stories, who let her stay up late and watch scary movies, then sat on her bed when she was afraid to go to sleep.</p><p>The Tail got a cushion-set diamond as big as a human eyeball, despite the fact that Mom and Dad weren\u2019t even divorced. Dad had shown her the ring, for the love of God.</p><p>Oh, and they were having a girl.</p><p>Dad invited her over to the new place for dinner to meet his lover/fianc\u00e9e. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset,\u201d he said on the phone, and the thinly veiled impatience in his voice chilled her. \u201cBut, Colleen, enough. If you\u2019re going to come over, and I hope you will, I\u2019d appreciate some civility. Your mother is hysterical crying half the time and screaming the other half, Connor won\u2019t speak to me, and I won\u2019t put up with a guilt trip in my own home.\u201d</p><p>It was almost a threat. Another wife; another home; another chance at fatherhood. Another daughter.</p><p>In other words, accept or be discarded.</p><p>She went to dinner.</p><p>The Tail herself answered the door wearing a cropped T-shirt and micro-shorts. Fantastic body, completely athletic and lean and perfectly muscled. Poor Mom. Gail\u2019s red hair was pulled into a ponytail, and she looked dewy and innocent. And most horribly of all...young.</p><p>\u201cColleen, at last!\u201d she cried, throwing her arms around her. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to meet you!\u201d</p><p>Colleen extricated herself. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We could be sisters.\u201d Gail smiled, but her eyes remained cool. Her huge engagement ring flashed.</p><p>Dinner was excruciating. Dad was helpful in a way he never was with Mom. Gail waffled between Adorable Ingenue and Experienced Prostitute, biting her lower lip and shooting Dad come-fuck-me looks. Whenever she stood, she arched her back, shoved her nonexistent belly outward and made doe eyes, smitten with the Miracle of Life.</p><p>When Colleen got home, she was exhausted. Mom was waiting by the door. \u201cWell? It\u2019s just temporary, isn\u2019t it? This can\u2019t last. He\u2019ll come to his senses. This is just a lapse in judgment.\u201d</p><p>And that was maybe the worst part. Far worse than Mom\u2019s occasional and very righteous anger was her hope.</p><p>\u201cMom, why would you even want him back?\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I love him. Because he\u2019s the father of my two beautiful children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd soon he\u2019ll be the father of another beautiful child.\u201d She sat down on the tired couch. \u201cGail has an engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face went white. \u201cHe won\u2019t go through with it. He\u2019s just having a midlife crisis, that\u2019s all. Who even knows if Gail\u2019s really pregnant? Or if she is, if it\u2019s even Pete\u2019s baby?\u201d</p><p>The next day, Mom went to House of Hair a brunette with a few streaks of gray...and came back a redhead. Not only that, but her perfectly lovely blue eyes were looking awfully green lately, courtesy of her tinted contacts.</p><p>In other words, she looked like a wannabe Gail.</p><p>It made Colleen want to cry.</p><p>Mom called Dad six or seven times a day on flimsy excuses...\u201cPete, honey, I\u2019m looking for the screwdriver. Can you come by when you get a second? Pete, do you remember where you put the car insurance papers? Pete, we should talk about the kids. Want to go to Hugo\u2019s and see Connor?\u201d</p><p>Colleen could only watch in sorrow and anger and misery.</p><p>She missed Lucas. God, she missed him.</p><p>But he\u2019d lied to her. Lucas, who was so scrupulously honest and decent beneath his scruffy, South-Side tough-guy persona, had covered for her father. If only he\u2019d told her about it, maybe she could\u2019ve talked some sense into her father, because she and Dad, they were too smart for this.</p><p>And then Gail wouldn\u2019t be pregnant right now. Mom wouldn\u2019t be in schizophrenic divorce hell. Connor\u2019s mouth wouldn\u2019t be so tight, and half the town wouldn\u2019t be clucking and gossiping over the O\u2019Rourkes.</p><p>And maybe her father would still love her as much as he used to, if he didn\u2019t have a replacement daughter on the way.</p><p>Maybe her family would still be intact.</p><p>It felt as if Lucas had taken that chance away.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t keep her from missing him, his dark, steady eyes, his workingman hands and low, smoky voice. The feeling of his mouth, his slow smile, and yes, that little-boy-lost shadow that he still carried with him. His voice when he called her m\u00eda. Mine.</p><p>Of course she wanted to marry him, more than ever now. Her own family was screwed up beyond repair, but they could make a new family. They\u2019d get married and have a relationship that was ten times better than what her parents had had. Lucas would have a home, a real home, and his sister and the girls could come stay for the holidays, and Connor would be in and out, and he and Lucas would be best friends, and they\u2019d be able to handle anything life threw at them. Including her parents\u2019 divorce and her impending sibling.</p><p>They were better together than they were apart. He needed her; she made him smile, she made him happy, she made him whole, and he did the same things for her.</p><p>It was possible, Colleen thought late at night, that she\u2019d been a little...rash.</p><p>But pride kept her from calling him. She wanted that first move to come from him. He was the one who\u2019d lied, and of course she\u2019d forgive him. All he had to do was ask.</p><p>And then, one day, he was here. Finally.</p><p>It was July, and the town was hosting the Days of Wine and Roses, a garden tour/wine extravaganza. Colleen was helping at the Blue Heron booth; the Hollands had just hired Mom in the tasting room for the season, and thank God for that, since the job was at least a distraction. Faith was home for the summer and had been absolutely stalwart.</p><p>The whole town was out, the sun was shining, the green was covered in tents, and mason jars filled with roses adorned every table. Dogs and children ran around in the park across the street, and every business was offering goodies on the sidewalks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor waved to her from Hugo\u2019s doorway\u2014You doing okay?</p><p>She waved back.

With him was his cousin.</p><p>\u201cHey, Coll!\u201d Bryce said as if he hadn\u2019t been at the Black Cat just last night \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cHi, Lucas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He was so beautiful. No, that wasn\u2019t the right word. Bryce was beautiful. But Lucas...he was enthralling, and dear God, she\u2019d missed that face. His voice. He wasn\u2019t smiling, not yet, but that was okay.</p><p>She felt a smile start in her heart, warm and full. Finally, he was back.</p><p>His eyes dropped. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Um, Faith, I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, go, away with you,\u201d Faith said, smiling. \u201cHi, Lucas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Faith.\u201d He gave her a nod.</p><p>\u201cShould I say something bitchy?\u201d she whispered to Colleen.</p><p>\u201cAre you capable of it?\u201d Colleen whispered back. She untied her Blue Heron apron and skirted around the table. He was here. Finally, he was here.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a drink,\u201d Bryce suggested.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I need to talk to Colleen alone,\u201d Lucas said. She could smell his nice smell, soap and laundry detergent and sun, and holy St. Patrick, her knees almost buckled with longing, and she felt so damn right again that she wondered if she\u2019d just float away.</p><p>But yeah, privacy. That would be good because she wasn\u2019t going to last long without wrapping herself around him and kissing him with some happy crying possibly thrown in for good measure.</p><p>He took her hand and led her off the green, and Colleen felt like a blushing bride leaving the wedding...as if everyone knew where they were going and exactly what they\u2019d be doing. His hand was work-roughened from the construction work he did each summer, and his olive skin was darker than usual from the sun.</p> <p>The library was closed for the festivities. Lucas took her behind the pretty limestone building, where it was shady and cool and quiet.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you came to see me,\u201d she said, and her voice was shaking. \u201cI missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should listen to me before you say anything,\u201d he said, not quite looking her in the eye.</p><p>A tremor of fear wriggled through her knees. But no, it was okay. He wanted to go first. That was fine. That was better, really. \u201cApologize away,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>He looked at her. Still no smile, his eyes dark and fathomless. A second passed. Another. Another. The tremor became a spasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was so...freakish...that she almost didn\u2019t understand the words. A chipmunk cheeped from under a dogwood tree, and the sounds of music and people drifted from the green.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what did you say?\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>There was something wrong with her lungs, because she couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Ellen Forbes. I think you might\u2019ve met her once or twice.\u201d</p><p>He was serious.</p><p>Colleen closed her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t clarify.</p><p>Colleen took a step backward. Her legs felt watery.</p><p>Ellen Forbes. Ellen Forbes. Oh, shit, Ellen Forbes.</p><p>Yes, Colleen remembered her. Ellen had offered them a ride once, when they were walking back to campus, pulling over in her little BMW. And while the O\u2019Rourkes were pretty comfortable financially, there was that aura of Money with a capital M around Ellen Forbes, and it didn\u2019t come only from the last name (though that sure reinforced things).</p><p>It came from a blissful ignorance of things as mundane as bills and taxes and budgets and sales, and allowed her the freedom to focus on other things. Her clothes were preppy and dull and screamed expensive\u2014crisp white shirt and little gold hoops in her ears, a sumptuous bag at her side, the designer unfamiliar to Colleen, who might\u2019ve been able to recognize a bag sold at Macy\u2019s or Nordstrom, but not from Saks or Bergdorf. Colleen was used to being the prettiest woman in the room and didn\u2019t worry too much about clothes, but suddenly, she\u2019d felt juvenile and blowsy in her peasant skirt and tank top, long dangly earrings (from Kohl\u2019s) and scruffy sandals on her feet.</p><p>Lucas was marrying Ellen Forbes? Marrying her?</p><p>\u201cAre you...are you serious?\u201d she asked, her voice just a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and to his credit, he looked it. Those dark eyes were all ripped up inside.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He started to say something, then stopped.</p><p>\u201cLucas...you can\u2019t marry her. What about us? I mean, we had a fight, but you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you myself. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Good God.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t marry her,\u201d she said, striving to sound calm. \u201cI love you, Lucas. I always have, since the first time I met you. I\u2019ve never loved anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Shut up, Con\u2019s voice said.</p><p>Lucas was staring at the grass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cIs it her money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she pregnant?\u201d Oh, please, not that.</p><p>He looked at her a long minute. Something flickered through his eyes, and her stomach seized.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and thank you, God, thank you. No, Lucas was paranoid about that.</p><p>\u201cThen...I...I don\u2019t...\u201d she stammered. \u201cLucas, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas...\u201d Colleen took a shaking breath. Another one.</p><p>Hold on. Hang on, it\u2019s coming, the thing that will explain this. Yep, here it is.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t love you.</p><p>No, no, of course he does.</p><p>You\u2019re the one who wanted to get married. He wanted to wait. Wait for something better, apparently. You were too easy. Too obvious.</p><p>Colleen cleared her throat. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just like my mother, then. I hear what I want to hear. See what I want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to slap his face, but she seemed to be paralyzed. Get out of here, Connor\u2019s voice instructed, so she turned and walked away, the grass soft, crinkling under her bare feet.</p><p>The tears wouldn\u2019t come, jammed hard in her throat like a fist.</p><p>She walked fast, out of town. Thank God everyone was on the green. The asphalt burned her feet as she went up the Hill, past the Luces\u2019 driveway, up to Blue Heron, into the fields, then the woods. A little down the path, and there it was, the place she and Connor had thought was the most magical place when they were little, a stream that led down to the lake, complete with small waterfall. The water was cool and gentle, balm on her dirty, burned feet.</p><p>Lucas was getting married.</p><p>What was the phrase Dad had used? Moved on. Lucas had moved on.</p><p>Wrong again. Wrong about Dad, wrong about Lucas.</p><p>And then she cried for the loss of her first love. Cried so hard it hurt, and she understood why they called it heartbreak, because it really did seem as if she was being ripped in half from the inside out.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>COLLEEN HAD GONE to college to become a nurse. Yeah, yeah, it wasn\u2019t what most would\u2019ve guessed. But she\u2019d always been good at taking care of people, she thought, and doing it in a way that didn\u2019t make her seem condescending or irritable. Her grandfather had gone into a nursing home when Colleen was a teenager, and the staff there made Colleen want to scream sometimes. \u201cJust lift your butt for me, hon,\u201d one nurse said once without even waiting for Colleen to leave the room. Or even worse, \u201cGreat. Another dementia patient. Just what I needed today,\u201d as if Gramp, who\u2019d been an English teacher in his prime, chose to have his brain cells harden and die.</p><p>And so Colleen had started helping. Got her certificate as a nurse\u2019s assistant when she was seventeen, volunteered and then worked at Gramp\u2019s place. Called the patients \u201csir\u201d or \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d or Mrs. Carter or Mr. Slate. Explained what she was going to do before she started, whether or not they understood her or not.</p><p>\u201cBecome a doctor,\u201d Dad had said when she told her family of her plans. \u201cWhy be low man on the totem pole when you don\u2019t have to be?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be a doctor.</p><p>She did graduate with a degree in biology, but by then, her family had imploded and she and Lucas were done. Their great-grandmother on Mom\u2019s side died, and the twins inherited a pretty nice nest egg. Two weeks after Lucas slammed her with his news, Connor asked her if she wanted to buy the Black Cat, which was in foreclosure, and she said sure. Being near her twin seemed like the smartest move, and she sensed that Connor felt the same way.</p><p>They spent the summer gutting the place, and the hard work enabled Colleen to fall into a near-coma each night. The noise of saws and hammers (and the jukebox, one of their first purchases) kept other thoughts at bay. She\u2019d be in charge of management and the bar, Connor the king of the kitchen.</p><p>And though she\u2019d never thought she\u2019d end up as a full-time bartender, Colleen loved it. People opened up to her; Connor said there was something about her face that made people spill their guts, and it was an honor, really. And yeah, sure, mixing drinks was kind of fun, too. Tasting wines from the local vineyards, beer from the breweries...before they\u2019d been open six months, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s already had a reputation as being the place for the best spirits, best beer and best wine list. And the best nachos, too.</p><p>Dad and Gail were ensconced in their swanky new house. Mom was a wreck. Connor was clenched and angry and working sixteen hours a day. Gramp lost the ability to speak, and only Colleen seemed to be able to make him seem content. So she stayed in town, the cheerful one, the fun one. She knew everyone, liked everyone (more or less), remembered baby names and boyfriends, advised on romances, recommended people for jobs, and gave the lonely a place where someone, at least, would be a friend.</p><p>Then Savannah Joy O\u2019Rourke was born, and it was love at first sight.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still bartending?\u201d Dad asked one night when Gail had gone to put the baby to bed.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Colleen answered. She was only here to see the baby and already had her keys in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smarter than that,\u201d he said, and the words caused a starburst of anger in her chest. His old mantra, how smart the two of them were. Guess I wasn\u2019t smart enough to see who you really were, Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half owner of a successful restaurant,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cAnd yes, a bartender. An excellent bartender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to be a doctor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were a doctor, hon,\u201d Gail said, slapping on her doe-eyed stepmother smile. \u201cWe sure could use a pediatrician in this family! Savannah\u2019s not even sleeping through the night yet! I get so tired out carrying her. I think she weighs half of what I do! Babe, maybe I need to start lifting weights, what do you think?\u201d She held up her arm to be admired and fluttered her eyelashes, lest Dad forget that his wife was a Hot Young Thing, or, God forbid, have him focus his attention on his grown daughter.</p><p>Colleen kept working at the nursing home, just eight hours a week. She liked the old folks and was glad to be able to help her grandfather. Rushing Creek had several levels of care, and Colleen was one of the few who preferred the sickest patients.</p><p>Gramp didn\u2019t seem to know who she was anymore, but sometimes when she held his hand, his fingers would curl around hers as if he was telling her he was still in there, and glad for her company, her love. That hurt her heart almost more than the days when he didn\u2019t even open his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bartending was a nice balance.</p><p>Eventually, Colleen always thought, she\u2019d meet the guy who would make her forget Lucas Damien Campbell. She tried. She really did. Sort of. Okay, she didn\u2019t try much.</p><p>A couple times a year, she\u2019d go out with someone, only to find that he was married or weird or just meh. And every once in a while, she\u2019d fool around with some guy, let him kiss her, maybe allow a little groping. Even more rarely, she\u2019d sleep with someone, hoping there, too, that maybe sex would be a great revelation, and the two of them would realize, Hell\u2019s to the yes, we are in love, baby!</p><p>It didn\u2019t happen. Her reputation was hugely inflated, but hey. If people wanted to think she was some sort of siren, let them. Better than them knowing she\u2019d never recovered from her first love...like her mom.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to go out with me sometime?\u201d Bobby McIntosh asked her one night when Lucas had been back for two weeks. He sipped his O\u2019Doul\u2019s (proof that he stashed bodies in his cellar, Colleen always thought).</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, Bobby. Sorry, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like you. You\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have great boobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Don\u2019t wait for me in the parking lot, okay? I\u2019ll have to knee you in the groin if you do.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a Cooper\u2019s Cave for Chris Eckbert, who always left a huge tip (as he should, perpetually guilty for that prom night so long ago when he hadn\u2019t stuck up for her), then turned to Levi, who was sitting with Honor Holland\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Tom, a sheaf of papers in front of them. Blueprints.</p><p>\u201cHallo, Colleen,\u201d Tom said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHallo, Tom,\u201d she returned. Loved that accent. \u201cHow are the wedding plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea, really. Girly stuff, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019ll just be glad to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Levi here obsessed over napkin colors for his wedding, didn\u2019t you, bub?\u201d Levi gave her a tolerant look, and she messed up his hair fondly. \u201cWhat can I get you, boys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cWe have seventeen different microbrews,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDazzle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Whiskey for you, mate?\u201d She winked at Tom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer as well, Colleen, and you\u2019ve already dazzled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said, putting her hands over her heart. \u201cLevi, why can\u2019t you be more like Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more the strong, silent type. Also, I\u2019m about to kill myself over these plans,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, are those the blueprints for the thing?\u201d she asked, tilting her head so she could see better.</p> <p>\u201cThe public safety building, Coll,\u201d Levi said. \u201cYour tax dollars at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI voted against that,\u201d she murmured, then smiled at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Faith would\u2019ve killed me. I\u2019m a huge supporter of all of you goofballs, right, Gerard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you say, Colleen,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cI say you should go out with Lorelei, that\u2019s what I say. She\u2019s an amazing baker, she\u2019s nice and she could reform you. And you know how much you need reforming, Gerard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d She pulled Tom and Levi their beers (Empire Cream Ale for Tom, Blue Point Toasted Lager for Levi), and slid them down the bar, where they stopped two inches from Levi\u2019s elbow. A life skill to be sure. \u201cYou treating my friend well, Chief?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWould you say multiply well? If you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all know what you\u2019re saying, Colleen.\u201d He gave her his famed crinkling forehead look. \u201cAnd yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Tom?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs Honor multiply happy? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, darling?\u201d he answered, his grin widening.</p><p>\u201cI like your confidence. Just don\u2019t get smug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d Connor yelled from the kitchen. \u201cStop harassing the customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone feeling harassed?\u201d she asked the bar at large.</p><p>A chorus of denials went up from her peeps.</p><p>Slipping under the bar, she went into the kitchen, where Brother Dear was hard at work. \u201cWhat bug is up your ass this time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Mom was at the hospital the other night?\u201d he said, flipping the vegetable tempura around in the basket.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, that. Singles Nude Modeling. Yeah, I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Coll. Nude modeling? Did Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. She needs a hobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent some guy to the E.R. with a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long-suffering look, which she happily returned until Hannah came into the kitchen. \u201cCheeseburger, medium rare, blue cheese, bacon, mayo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of heart attacks,\u201d Colleen murmured.</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries, Caesar salad with chicken, nachos grande, salmon cakes and the pasta special,\u201d Hannah continued, then bustled back out. Connor\u2019s memory was the stuff of legend.</p><p>\u201cOut of my kitchen,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss me,\u201d she answered, pushing through the doors. She slid back behind the bar, got Lorena Iskin another Manhattan without being asked, smiled at Cathy and Louise, who always only had one drink, refilled Jessica Dunn\u2019s Chardonnay (on the house, Jess was nice) and turned to check on Tom and Levi.</p><p>Lucas was sitting two stools down from them.</p><p>Damn. She didn\u2019t need this. He\u2019d gotten her all...stirred up at the hospital the other day, being all holier-than-thou. So irritating, so judgmental. So...hot...gorgeous...delicious... Crikey. White oxford shirts were so underrated. His sleeves were rolled up a few times, and his olive skin made her want to take a bite. Those hands...oh, she remembered those hands, yessirree. Those were gifted hands, hard and strong and yet so gentle...and so smart, always knowing exactly where to\u2014</p><p>He was looking at her. A corner of his mouth lifted, as if knowing just how tight her special places were becoming.</p><p>Time to bring him down a little. She flashed Tom a smile and leaned down in front of him, giving him a view of her magnificent boobage. \u201cHow\u2019s that beer, Tommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover the goods, please,\u201d he said, shielding his eyes. \u201cEngaged to another, hate to break your heart.\u201d</p><p>Shit, yes, what was she thinking? She jolted upright. \u201cSorry. So, how are things, you...um, you handsome Irishman?\u201d</p><p>Tom flinched. \u201cBritish, darling. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I knew that,\u201d she muttered, glancing at Lucas. \u201cAnd, Levi, you big strong, gun-toting lawman, you.\u201d Ack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that ever again,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cOh, shush. I\u2019m trying to flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, though?\u201d His forehead crinkled at her.</p><p>\u201cBite me, Levi. You guys need some food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need another architect is what I need,\u201d Levi muttered, rustling the blueprints.</p><p>\u201cMind if I take a look?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>Levi looked over. \u201cOh, hey,\u201d he said. \u201cYou went to school with us for a while, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m Levi Cooper. Chief of police here in Manningsport.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his hand. \u201cLucas Campbell. Bryce Campbell\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Good to see you. This is my brother-in-law, Tom. Well, almost my brother-in-law. He\u2019s marrying my wife\u2019s sister in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallo, mate,\u201d Tom said, shaking hands, as well. Lucas moved down to look at the blueprints.</p><p>Great. Three beautiful men, all in a row. Two spoken for, one...not.</p><p>\u201cAre you an architect?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cA building projects manager out in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What kind of buildings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkyscrapers, hospitals, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Annie, one of the new summer hires, came behind the bar with a menu for Lucas, her pad in her other hand. \u201cHi,\u201d she breathed, and Colleen envisioned the girl\u2019s ovaries exploding. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled. Annie staggered.</p><p>\u201cGo clean the bathroom, Annie,\u201d Colleen said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Lucas. He and I are old friends.\u201d She folded her arms under her chest. \u201cLucas, can I get you something to drink? Would you like to see a menu? Or are you meeting someone?\u201d Yes. Pretend he was just another customer, as unthreatening as Reverend Fisk, who was eighty-nine years old.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Bryce,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.

His phone beeped with a text, and he glanced at it and sighed. \u201cBryce ditch you?\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Don\u2019t let me keep you. Nighty-night.\u201d She gave him her best smile.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cActually, I may as well stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin us, mate,\u201d Tom said, the traitor. Just couldn\u2019t trust those Brits; had the War of 1812 taught nothing?</p><p>Fine. That was fine. Colleen slapped a menu on the bar. \u201cNo need,\u201d Lucas said, nodding at the chalkboard (which she\u2019d written out that very afternoon, complete with an adorable stick figure lifting a pint). \u201cI\u2019ll take the burger special.\u201d</p><p>It was pretty fantastic\u2014an all-Angus beef burger with herbed goat cheese from the Mennonite farm up the Hill, native tomatoes and Vidalia onion on an English muffin and served with an arugula salad and Con\u2019s famed sweet-potato fries. As her brother\u2019s guinea pig with all house specials, Colleen had it for lunch. It was almost as good as sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have that as well, please, Colleen,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cMake it three,\u201d Levi added.</p><p>She smiled oh so pleasantly. \u201cComing up, boys.\u201d</p><p>She went into the kitchen. \u201cThree house burgers, Con. Medium on two\u2014\u201d Tom and Levi were regulars, and she well knew their preferences \u201c\u2014and petrify the third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She went out again. Time to schmooze. \u201cHey, lovebirds, happy anniversary!\u201d she said to the Wheelers, who were celebrating their thirty-second. The Murrays were in with their beautiful, red-haired daughters, and Colleen asked the older one how trumpet was going, and the younger one about their new kitten. Bill and Laura Clemson were fighting, but that was nothing new; it was a Friday night tradition. Louis Hudson and Amy Bates, however, were cooing at each other in a dark booth, and Colleen told Hannah to bring them out a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, two spoons, on the house. They were engaged, thanks to one Colleen Margaret Mary O\u2019Rourke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time she got back, the three burger specials were just about ready; the two medium burgers were on yellow Fiesta ware; the well-done order was on blue. Colleen lifted the bun to check it. It was dark, all right. Just not dark enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Connor asked as she put the burger back on the grill.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not well-done enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou said well-done. It\u2019s well-done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said petrify. Where\u2019s that Chinese sauce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Chinese sauce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over the sink. Go easy on that. It\u2019s vicious. Two drops will bring a grown man to his knees.\u201d He turned back to the chicken marsala he was making.</p><p>Colleen rummaged through Connor\u2019s salt collection; honestly, did a person need seven different kinds? Rock, kosher, sea, truffle, black... Aha! Here it was, the strange little bottle with the dragon on the label and some mysterious Chinese characters. She took it out, checked to ensure that the burger was a hardened, dry, hockey puck of meat, then put it back on the bun. Doused it with fire sauce, then added a splash more on the fries.</p> <p>She brought the plates out to the bar and set them in front of their respective orders. \u201cEnjoy, gentlemen,\u201d she said.</p><p>Levi folded up the blueprint of the public safety building. \u201cLucas will be helping us out,\u201d he said. \u201cProject manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Colleen said easily. \u201cGlad you found someone to help you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her a long look, picked up his burger and took a bite.</p><p>Colleen smiled. Happiness was being in charge.</p><p>His eyes began to tear. Sweat broke out on his forehead. He raised an eyebrow, then, she had to give it to him, chewed and swallowed. With great effort. He took his doctored up beer and drank it down. Rested the cold glass against his forehead.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he wheezed, as the fire sauce had paralyzed his vocal cords a li\u2019l tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that burger, hon?\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He wiped his face with a napkin, and Colleen leaned her elbows on the bar and just enjoyed the sight of him, sweating, red-faced, maybe a little closer to death than he had been a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cI made it special just for you.\u201d She smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI guessed that.\u201d</p><p>Then he stood up, slid his hand around her neck and pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see that coming.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t pull away, either.</p><p>It was a hard, authoritative kiss that seared through her. Good God, the Spaniard could kiss. His five-o\u2019clock shadow scraped her just the right amount, and his mouth, oh, yes, that mouth of his, that fallen-angel mouth...and then it was over, and he stood in front of her, dark and sure and steady when she was lucky to be standing, her legs suddenly warm and wonderfully weak, her special places bursting into song. Also, her lips were burning, thanks to the fire sauce, but hey. Worth it.</p><p>Then Lucas smiled that pirate\u2019s grin full of secrets and fun and cockiness, and her heart was rolling and shaking like a hyperactive puppy.</p><p>Oh, man. She was in trouble.</p><p>The bar was completely still.</p><p>\u201cWe should get that dinner sometime,\u201d he said calmly, his voice normal now.</p><p>\u201cI thought this would count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, then,\u201d she said, then cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the wonderful meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d she said. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Then the kitchen door banged open, and Connor tapped Lucas on the shoulder, and punched him in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M NOT SEEING him,\u201d Colleen said three hours later. \u201cRufus, tell your uncle Connor he\u2019s got his head up his butt.\u201d Unfortunately, Rufus was engrossed in a documentary about Yellowstone National Park and couldn\u2019t drag his doggy eyes off the family of wolverines on screen. It was ten past midnight, and Connor had demanded an audience to discuss her love life. Which was a joke because there was no love life, of course.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Lucas had taken Connor\u2019s anger like a boss; a Southie from Chicago wouldn\u2019t be bothered by one punch, no matter how enraged the brother who\u2019d thrown it. Levi, being a cop and all, jumped to his feet, and Tom did, too, but Lucas just said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I earned that.\u201d He slid a twenty under his plate, nodded at Colleen and left calmly. Connor glared at his retreating back, then at her, then at Levi, then at the bar in general, then stomped back into the kitchen, where he banged around for the rest of the night before coming for Big Brother Lecture. He\u2019d always taken those three minutes very seriously.</p><p>\u201cColleen, I saw how you were looking at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, he kissed me. Look. He\u2019s back in town because Joe Campbell is dying. Of course I\u2019m going to see him from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you are? You\u2019re one mattress fire away from becoming our mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like Mom,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cHow dare you and all that. Want some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Connor folded his arms and tipped his head back to stare at the ceiling (and pray for patience, Colleen knew). \u201cIf you\u2019re not dating him, why were you flirting with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Rufus put his head on her foot, then licked her ankle with his giant tongue.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was that game with the fire sauce, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just a little...signal. A shot across the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was flirting. And then you let him kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a face. \u201cYeah. That might\u2019ve been dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get back together with him? You gonna move to Chicago? Is he dating anyone back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Look. It was one kiss.\u201d Well, then, there was that other kiss, down by the lake. Two kisses.</p><p>\u201cOne kiss? This wasn\u2019t the first time, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Long Island Medium, he took me by surprise, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember what he did to you last time. I don\u2019t think he deserves a second chance, personally. But I\u2019m just your brother. I\u2019m just the one who\u2019s been watching you avoid a serious relationship this past decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your wife, huh? Do you have three beautiful children stashed somewhere? No? So don\u2019t throw stones. You won\u2019t even be seen in public with this mystery woman of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d He sat on the floor; Rufus, the whore, rolled onto his back and presented his stomach (and other parts) for admiration. Connor flinched. \u201cYou should get this dog neutered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is neutered.\u201d</p><p>The twins were quiet for a moment. They didn\u2019t fight often; well, they bickered constantly, and Mom still complained about it, but they hardly ever really disagreed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have punched him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe broke your stupid heart,\u201d Connor grumbled.</p><p>There was no lying to her brother.</p><p>She\u2019d done her best to hide her feelings last time. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be like Mom. Didn\u2019t want people to know she\u2019d been dumped. She was supposed to be smarter than that.</p><p>But Connor knew anyway. Despite her playing it lightly with most people\u2014You know how fickle young love is. Hardly ever lasts\u2014Connor knew.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt, Collie Dog Face,\u201d her brother said now.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Connor scratched Rufus\u2019s tummy another minute, then stood up and gave her shoulder a squeeze. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Who\u2019s your girlfriend? Do I know her? Is she a prostitute? I won\u2019t judge either of you. Please tell me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he called from the door. Tossed her a grin and left, his feet thumping on the stairs.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>THE CHICKEN KING lived in a beautiful old Victorian house that had once belonged to Mark Twain\u2019s wife\u2019s aunt, legend had it. Colleen was here to go over the planned encounter with Bryce. And just to hang out a little because, let\u2019s face it, she really liked Paulie.</p><p>The blue-and-cream-painted house sat high on a hill in a heavily wooded neighborhood overlooking Keuka Lake. Their driveway was long and shaded, and the house had to have at least twenty rooms.</p><p>However, the yard\u2014grounds, really\u2014were littered with giant metal chicken statues in lurid colors, like a terrifying dream you might have as a kid when you\u2019re running a very high fever. As the breeze blew, it made a strange whistling sound through the, uh, artwork, making it sound like the chickens were moaning. And those beaks looked mighty sharp.</p><p>\u201cDad collects these from all over the world,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Colleen said, trying not to look. She\u2019d always been a little afraid of chickens, personally. The polka-dotted statue seemed especially hostile.</p><p>Inside, the house was just as beautiful, carefully restored and extremely elegant. Not what you\u2019d picture for the Chicken King; well, no, there were a lot of paintings of chickens on the walls, as well as Mr. Petrosinsky dressed in chicken garb standing next to various local celebrities...and some national celebrities, too. \u201cIs that Meryl Streep?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, her. She\u2019s so nice. Loves the Sweet Home Alabama Triple Batter Honey Dijon,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Vladimir Putin?\u201d Perhaps the Russian Mob rumors were true, after all.</p><p>\u201cMake-Mine-Miami Cuban Spice.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s bedroom was a Maxfield Parrish\u2013blue, deep and poignant. A dressing room bigger than Colleen\u2019s entire bedroom, filled with clothes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t wear much of this,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cIf you see something you want, take it. You know me. I mostly wear gym clothes.\u201d She was, in fact, now clad in spandex shorts that showed her ripped muscles in great detail, and a Cabrera\u2019s Boxing T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. You have a great figure. Very girl-power strong. Here. Put this on. My God, it\u2019s Armani! Hello, gorgeous! Dog, don\u2019t chew on that,\u201d she added as one of Paulie\u2019s rescue dogs, this one looking like a dirty mop, began gnawing on a boot.</p><p>A few minutes later, Paulie frowned at her reflection.</p><p>\u201cSee how it hugs you here?\u201d Colleen asked. \u201cYou look taller and leaner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese shoes are killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer it up to God. And this belt is funky and young and surprising. You look incredible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I feel weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an adjustment, trust me. Where\u2019d you get all these clothes, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad. He does a lot of online shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s single, right?\u201d Colleen asked. Hey. If she was going to have a sugar daddy, she was going to have one who bought Armani.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ever since Mom left, you know.\u201d</p><p>Colleen squeezed her hand. \u201cOkay, so on to Operation Flat Tire. This is how it\u2019s gonna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Will this really work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>The plan was simple. Bryce was home, a little benign stalking had shown. Joe was at dialysis, Evil Didi was at work. Lucas\u2014not that she was thinking about him too much (pause for laughter)\u2014was out at the public safety building, according to Levi, who\u2019d come to the bar for lunch just half an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou get a flat tire, and heck, what\u2019s this? You\u2019re right in front of Bryce\u2019s house, and Bryce is home! What do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange the tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Paulina. You don\u2019t change the tire.\u201d The pug barked, backing her up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Bryce is going to change the tire.\u201d</p><p>Paulie frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be all feminine and helpless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I know how to change a tire.\u201d</p><p>Colleen suppressed a sigh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s great, Paulie. But today, Bryce gets to change the tire and help you, and feel very manly and smart, because men like to be tricked into thinking they\u2019re in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Got it.\u201d Her face started its amazing sunrise impression.</p><p>\u201cNo panicking. Just do what I say, and Bryce and you can have a nice conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I say? I feel a little sick. Do I really have to talk to him? Damn it, this stupid deodorant is supposedly extra strength and it\u2019s doing squat. Oh, I hate being in love!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all do at certain times, Paulie.\u201d</p><p>Paulie threw herself down on her giant bed and covered her eyes with her hands. One of her cats jumped up and began kneading her thigh. \u201cI can barely think about talking to him, let alone actually talk to him. What if I hurt him again?\u201d</p><p>Colleen pondered. \u201cYou know what would be great?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I could somehow feed you lines. Like Cyrano and Christian. You have a Bluetooth, right?\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Colleen pulled around the corner from Bryce\u2019s house, Paulie\u2019s adorable little Porsche purring behind her. Craftily, feeling a bit like Bond, James Bond, Colleen parked and got out, approaching Paulie\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe, this is where you get a flat,\u201d she said. She opened up her Swiss Army knife and stabbed Paulie\u2019s tire.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax. Now just drive really slow to Bryce\u2019s house, then park, get out and stare at the car, helpless and feminine. That\u2019s your job\u2014to appear helpless and feminine, helpless and feminine. Also, mention that you\u2019re throwing a party and you\u2019d love for him to come. Now go. Into the car. Drive on, little sparrow!\u201d</p><p>With a dubious look, Paulie obeyed. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Colleen said into her phone when Paulie was almost there.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Colleen, I don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d She made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a dry heave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d Colleen said in her most reassuring tone, the same one that got people who overindulged to hand over their keys. \u201cOkay, stop. That\u2019s his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve probably driven by a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s heart tugged. \u201cThis will work, Paulie. Just try to relax and enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>From where she stood, Colleen could see her client pull over. This ploy, while definitely on the points-for-difficulty end of what Colleen usually recommended, had worked on her cousin Monica just last year, when Monica had a \u201cbike accident\u201d in front of Fox Den Vineyard. Monica was now married to the Fox Den heir, thank you very much. Colleen had been a bridesmaid, her tenth such gig.</p><p>Paulie got out of the car.</p> <p>\u201cWalk slowly around the car, looking at the tires,\u201d Colleen ordered. \u201cHe\u2019ll be out any second.\u201d She glanced at the house. The day was the best of June, bright and lilac-scented. \u201cOkay, squat down and take a look at the tire. Oh, dear, what\u2019s this? It\u2019s flat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s flat,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cYou stabbed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but pretend to be surprised and dismayed.\u201d</p><p>Paulie hesitated, then bent down. \u201cOh, shit!\u201d she bellowed. \u201cMy tire\u2019s flat! What will I do?\u201d</p><p>Colleen bobbled her phone. \u201cDown, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cEasy on the melodrama, and the volume. You don\u2019t want just anyone coming along. And try not to swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, I forgot about that. Okay.\u201d</p><p>They waited. No one came out of the house.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not home,\u201d Paulie whispered.</p><p>\u201cHis car is in the driveway,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably watching TV or something. Hang on, I\u2019ll get his attention.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a handful of pebbles and walked toward the house, sticking close to the shade from the neighbor\u2019s wide maples. There was a thick hedge of lilacs against the eastern side of the Campbells\u2019 place, and she eased into it, the clean, perfect smell of the flowers giving her a contact high.</p><p>Bryce lived in the basement, she knew. Didi had made it into a full-scale apartment for her baby boy not long after he dropped out of college.</p><p>She threw a pebble. Thanks to thousands of games of darts she\u2019d played over the years, she hit the window on the first try, a satisfying tick against the glass. \u201cPlaces, everyone,\u201d she whispered into the phone. \u201cHe should be out soon.\u201d</p><p>A mockingbird called from a tree. The wind blew, brushing a lilac bloom across Colleen\u2019s cheek. Paulie appeared to be frozen in place. \u201cCheck the tire like you\u2019re trying to figure out what the heck went wrong,\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cAnd be prepared to repeat after me, okay?\u201d Paulie squatted obediently, her short skirt fluttering against her thighs.</p><p>Bryce didn\u2019t come out.</p><p>Colleen threw another pebble. Waited. Nada. Another pebble. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cMy legs are burning,\u201d Paulie whispered. \u201cPlease let me stand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d Colleen said. Paulie stood, groaning, grabbed her ankle and stretched her quads.</p><p>\u201cPut your leg down,\u201d Colleen ordered. \u201cYou\u2019re flashing Mr. Bancroft, and he\u2019s kind of pervy as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there, Paulie!\u201d called Mr. Bancroft. \u201cGot a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no,\u201d Colleen instructed.</p><p>\u201cNo! Go away!\u201d Paulie barked.</p><p>\u201cHenry! Get in the car,\u201d Mrs. Bancroft ordered. \u201cWe\u2019re already late! Paulie, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! Nothing at all,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cI, uh, I...I have a bladder infection and had to stop. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bancroft paused, shook her head and got into the car.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cut the improv, okay?\u201d Colleen said as the Bancrofts drove away. \u201cSay only what I say. Now hang on. This time, I mean business.\u201d She looked at the pebbles in her hand, selected the biggest one and threw it with slightly more gusto.</p><p>The window shattered.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Paulie echoed.</p><p>But the broken glass did the trick. After a second, the front door opened, and there stood Bryce, blinking in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, I see him. Oh, damn it all, he\u2019s here,\u201d Paulie said, her voice strangled.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down. Deep breath,\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s showtime. He\u2019s a nice guy, you\u2019re a nice woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Paulie,\u201d Bryce said as he loped over to Paulie\u2019s car. \u201cEverything okay here? Our window just broke.\u201d</p><p>Paulie inhaled audibly, her breath hitching in her throat. \u201cOh! Wow. Hi. Your eyes are so...so...blue.\u201d</p><p>Colleen winced. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d echoed Paulie.</p><p>Bryce stopped and tilted his head.</p><p>\u201cPaulie, relax. Just...just say hi to him.\u201d</p><p>Another shaking breath. \u201cHi, Bryce!\u201d she said loudly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Bryce laughed. \u201cI live here. How about you?\u201d</p><p>A squeaky groan came over the wire.</p><p>\u201cI threw a pebble, I guess. I think I had a blowout,\u201d Colleen whispered.</p><p>\u201cI threw a pebble, I guess,\u201d Paulie parroted. \u201cI think I had a blow job.\u201d She clapped her hands over her mouth. \u201cOut, out! I didn\u2019t mean blow job. I never had a blow job. I meant something else. Out. I had a blowout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulie, calm down,\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, calm down,\u201d Paulie said, then wiped her forehead with her arm. \u201cUh...I...I have a flat tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d Bryce said, not freaked out in the least by Paulie sounding as if she were possessed by a demon.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me change it, Bryce?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me change it? Bryce? Please? Please help me.\u201d</p><p>Dear Lord. This was going to be a long afternoon.</p><p>THE PUBLIC SAFETY building, half begun and currently stalled, was in a state of chaos. First of all, every one of the three agencies\u2014police, ambulance and fire\u2014felt that theirs was the most important. Lucas had already changed the plans so the police department office was situated between the fire and ambulance departments, because apparently those two fought the way his twin nieces did over who got to sit in the front.</p><p>Besides that, the ventilation had to be specialized, and the alarm system was fairly complicated. It was tricky to make such a functional building also be attractive inside and out, and the builder who\u2019d quit hadn\u2019t tried very hard. Lucas had requested the plans, then got to work on the design. He moved the back entrance so it didn\u2019t come right into the fire department kitchen, repositioned Dispatch to the back of the building and reinforced the walls, added some windows on the eastern side so the place didn\u2019t look like a crematorium. The town council was falling over with gratitude.</p><p>It was nice to be needed.</p><p>Funny, how much he really did love construction work. Never minded it a bit in the summertime during college, though back then, he thought it would be temporary.</p><p>When Frank Forbes had first summoned him after learning that Lucas had impregnated his angel, it was fair to say that Lucas expected to be thrown from the fifty-fifth story.</p><p>Frank Forbes was furious. Lucas couldn\u2019t blame him. \u201cSo you want to marry my daughter, do you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right thing.\u201d Frank shook his head. \u201cHow do you plan to support them, my daughter and grandchild? You won\u2019t be able to work if you\u2019re in law school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I withdrew and got a job with Windy City Construction. I start on Monday. I can join the union after a year.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Forbes gave him a long look, his jaw knotty. The silence was leaden.</p><p>Then he took a sharp breath. \u201cQuit Windy City. You\u2019ll work for this company, on construction, because Johnny Hall says you\u2019re not bad. You\u2019ll earn what all people at your level earn, and you\u2019ll have a health care plan, same as all my employees. Windy City has an abominable safety record, and their work is shoddy at best.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d rather make my own way, Mr. Forbes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, you should\u2019ve thought of that before you got my daughter pregnant!\u201d he snapped. Then he took another deep breath. \u201cYou and Ellen can live in one of my apartment buildings,\u201d he went on. \u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter and grandchild living in a bad neighborhood, and that student apartment of hers isn\u2019t big enough for a baby. You, however, will support your family. You will pay your bills on time, and I will never bail you out financially. You will sign a prenup saying you\u2019ll never get a dime of Ellen\u2019s trust fund. I will pay for Ellen\u2019s law school; you will pay for your family\u2019s living expenses. You will give this marriage a real try. If you hurt, mistreat or cheat on my daughter, I promise you your body will never be found. I love my daughter. She\u2019s the most important thing in the world to me. Do you understand me, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I imagine I\u2019ll feel the same way about my own kids.\u201d</p><p>Because yes. He was going to be a father, and if some kid from the wrong side of the tracks knocked up his baby girl, he imagined he wouldn\u2019t be quite as civilized as Frank Forbes.</p><p>Frank looked at him for a long minute.</p><p>Then, to Lucas\u2019s extreme surprise, he sighed, all the anger seeping out of him like air from a balloon. He walked around his desk and hugged Lucas. \u201cWelcome to the family. I don\u2019t like how it happened, but I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re owning up to your responsibilities. My daughter is smart, and she says you\u2019re honorable and decent. She loves you, and whether I like it or not, you\u2019re part of the family now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You could\u2019ve knocked him over with a feather. Lucas had expected Frank Forbes to try to pay him off or threaten him. Possibly beat the shit out of him, which, Lucas admitted, he deserved.</p><p>Instead, Mr. and Mrs. Forbes took him and Ellen out to dinner that night. They asked about his family, expressed their condolence over the loss of his parents, murmured sympathetically when he told them the truth about his father\u2019s criminal activity. In fact, Frank had already run a background check on him and knew full well how both parents died. And again, Lucas would\u2019ve done the same for his daughter.</p><p>A daughter (or son) who was growing in Ellen\u2019s belly right now.</p><p>Lucas did all the right things. Held her hand, held her chair, asked how she was feeling, went to the obstetrician\u2019s office with her. He cooked for her, which she thought was charming, and listened to her when she talked.</p> <p>He\u2019d always wanted kids.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think about Colleen. That was forbidden now. He was with Ellen, and they were starting a family. The only thing to do was be a man about it.</p><p>Though it had been thrown together at the last minute, the wedding was at a huge downtown hotel with three hundred and fifty guests, five bridesmaids and an eleven-piece band at the reception. Frank made a speech and referred to Lucas as a fine young man who\u2019d put himself through college, who knew the value of a hard day\u2019s work. Hugged him, reminded him to treat Ellen like the princess she was, and seemed to bear him no ill will whatsoever.</p><p>Lucas went to work, worked hard, kept his head down and did what he was told. Came home to the beautiful apartment and talked with Ellen, who really was very nice. Put his hand on her belly and kissed her and smiled at her and slept with her, even if it still felt as though he was cheating on Colleen. If Ellen sensed something was off, she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>And when they\u2019d been married for six weeks, he got the call that Ellen was in the E.R. She wasn\u2019t quite at twelve weeks, and the second he saw her face, he knew the baby was lost. Then he gathered her into his arms and kissed her head as she sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cIt happens more than you might think,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He took her home and lay in bed with her, holding her close. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay married to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know it was only because of the baby.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a long minute. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d he said.</p><p>He\u2019d been willing to stand by her when she was pregnant with his child; he damn well wasn\u2019t going to leave her because of a cruel act of nature.</p><p>He grew to love her. Not the way he loved Colleen, no. But Ellen was good and calm and smart. He loved her parents, too\u2014Grace was funny and generous and a little bit bawdy when she had a drink in her, and Frank...Frank was remarkably open and optimistic for a man who ran an empire. One newspaper article referred to him as \u201cthe Donald Trump of Chicago,\u201d and Frank said, \u201cKill me now,\u201d and laughed.</p><p>No, the Forbes family seemed to embody all the good Midwestern qualities\u2014generosity, kindness, optimism and a very touching sense of innocence. \u201cI\u2019ve found that if you expect the best of a person,\u201d Frank told him once, \u201cyou generally get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cLive and learn. Emphasis on learn.\u201d</p><p>Lucas had always been a worker, ever since he collected bottles at the age of six to return for the deposit (that story had made Ellen cry). He worked harder and longer than his coworkers, hoping to show he wasn\u2019t just some schmuck who was being promoted because of who he was. And he was promoted, moving up through the ranks from construction worker to foreman to project manager.</p><p>It was...well, it was good. But it was also hard; he was never far from the knowledge that he owed the Forbes family more than he could ever repay. That with one night, he\u2019d changed the course of Ellen\u2019s life...and his, of course. But mostly hers. She was the one who\u2019d endured twelve weeks of morning sickness, and the one whose body had to let go of their baby.</p><p>Ellen didn\u2019t get pregnant again. She went back on the Pill, which was fine; she went to law school, and then got hired by a big firm. She worked long hours, as did he, and seemed to love it. They didn\u2019t talk about kids directly. Ellen didn\u2019t seem to want to pursue it just yet. That was fine. They were young. There was time.</p><p>But it would\u2019ve been amazing to have kids, Lucas thought, especially when he saw his nieces. He often thought of the baby who wasn\u2019t...how old his son or daughter would be now, what it would be like to have a little one come running into his arms. To tuck a child in at night, straighten out the covers, to kiss a little head and say, \u201cDaddy loves you.\u201d</p><p>Six years into their marriage, Ellen came home from her swanky office, took off her shoes and poured herself a glass of wine. \u201cSo, Lucas,\u201d she said, very kindly. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to call it quits, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The sorrow he felt was more because he hadn\u2019t been able to make it work, rather than because his heart was broken. She\u2019d loved him a lot once, and he\u2019d done his best, and it wasn\u2019t quite enough.</p> <p>The divorce was so amicable, it was almost shameful. He would\u2019ve preferred some fighting or tears to the calm dissolution of their household. He took only a photo of the two of them; they\u2019d taken his four nieces to the beach, and Mercedes had been fooling around with the camera. He and Ellen had been holding hands, and he said something to make her laugh. It was an indication, maybe, that he hadn\u2019t been a bad husband. He hoped he hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>It was just that his heart belonged to someone else, and they both knew it. They never spoke of it, but it was true just the same.</p><p>They went out to dinner the night before their divorce was final, to Alinea, her favorite restaurant, where the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 knew them both by name. She ordered a martini; he ordered a beer. They talked about work and her parents, about Mercedes getting the lead in her school play. Ellen had assured the girls that she\u2019d still be their aunt, and Frank and Grace had all four girls for a sleepover and said of course they\u2019d still be Grandpa Frank and Nana Grace, because that\u2019s just how they were.</p><p>Finally, Ellen took a deep breath. \u201cI hope this won\u2019t upset you,\u201d she said, tilting her head the way she always did when she had something momentous to say. \u201cBut I\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>He put down his beer. \u201cReally.\u201d Should probably say more than that. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the tablecloth, started to say something, then stopped. Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, leaning forward and covering her hand with his own. She was still his wife, even if only for a few more hours.</p><p>She smiled and shook her head a little, blinked back her tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember this.\u201d She took a deep breath, once again fully composed. \u201cIt was sophomore year, maybe? No, junior, because we had that class with Professor Hayden.\u201d She smiled at someone she knew, then continued. \u201cAnyway, we were eating in the dining hall, and your girlfriend came in. She surprised you, and you stood up so fast the table practically fell over, but you didn\u2019t even notice. And she jumped into your arms and wrapped herself around you and you two were kissing like no one else was around.\u201d</p><p>The memory stole his breath...Colleen\u2019s exuberance, her unabashed happiness and affection.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how this guy makes me feel,\u201d Ellen said quietly.</p><p>He picked up her hand and looked at it for a minute. She\u2019d already taken off her wedding ring. His was still on. \u201cThen I\u2019m glad for you, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>Twelve hours later, they were divorced.</p><p>Frank took it the hardest. Lucas was the son he never had. Since the divorce, Lucas had stayed on to finish the Cambria skyscraper. But they both knew this was his last project with the company.</p><p>He wanted to stay in construction\u2014not to make skyscrapers, but to make homes. He wasn\u2019t an architect, but he\u2019d taken several drafting classes over the years and had a good eye. He wanted to be a general contractor, to work on every stage of the house, from the cellar to the wiring to the walls. He wanted to make people the home they\u2019d live in all their lives. He\u2019d earn about a quarter of what he made as a project manager for Forbes, but he had the connections, the experience, the reputation.</p><p>That\u2019s what waited for him back home. Back in the City of Big Shoulders.</p><p>But for now, it was awfully nice to be doing something other than sitting at Joe\u2019s bedside or coaxing Bryce into a plan for his life.</p><p>That\u2019s what he was supposed to be doing right now, in fact.</p><p>Instead, he was standing in a field, imagining the house he\u2019d build. It was an occupational hazard; wherever he traveled, he tended to scope out a site. This one wasn\u2019t far from the emergency services site; it was on a hill, the lake in the distance, vineyards roping their way down the slopes. The house he\u2019d build here would have lots of windows, cedar planked exterior, a river-stone chimney.</p><p>Right. Well. Maybe he could teach Bryce some construction work. That, or gigolo, because the guy had a way with women, that was for sure.</p><p>Joe had dialysis, Didi would be denying amputees their claims, and Bryce was presumably home. Lucas got into his car and headed to Didi\u2019s.</p><p>Both Joe and Lucas were aware of the fact that Didi would undercut any effort to dislodge Bryce from the family home. She gave Bryce an allowance and a credit card, despite the fact that he was thirty-one years old. Castrated him, in other words.</p><p>Lucas parked the rental car a few houses down from his aunt\u2019s; old habits died hard. Didi hated cars in the driveway or on the street in front of her house; said it looked poor white trash (this with a significant look at Lucas, despite the fact that technically, he was Hispanic and not white).</p><p>Bryce\u2019s car was in the driveway (Didi\u2019s rules didn\u2019t apply to him). Lucas knocked, waited and then went in the front door. From the basement, came the sounds of gunfire and explosions. Lucas let himself in and went down the cellar stairs. The apartment was surprisingly neat and airy. Chances were high that Didi had a cleaning woman come down here each week. Big leather couch, a pool table, a bar, a bedroom and a tiny kitchen that Lucas bet was never used.</p><p>Lucas waited until his cousin had killed another innocent person on-screen, then said, \u201cHey, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude! Good to see you,\u201d Bryce said, grinning up at him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Want to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What can I do you for?\u201d Bryce turned off the game.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things jobwise these days?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bryce nodded. \u201cYeah. Well, I do a little work at the shelter and the gym, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever think about getting certified as a trainer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Sure, I guess. I don\u2019t know, though. Might not be fun anymore if I had to do it for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do for a living, Bryce? You\u2019re past thirty now. Maybe living at home is getting old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Technically, they were the same age. It never felt like that.</p><p>\u201cI guess I want to see you moving forward, buddy,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou know. Have a career, your own place...you mentioned wanting a family someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I love kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to take some steps, Bryce. Those things don\u2019t just happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d He nodded sagely.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe we could work on that while I\u2019m around.\u201d He paused. \u201cI think it\u2019d mean a lot to your dad if he could see you a little more settled, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Uh...what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lucas paused. There was a touching, if somewhat pathetic, innocence in Bryce\u2019s eyes. \u201cBryce, your dad\u2019s not doing well. He won\u2019t be around much longer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bryce stiffened. \u201cActually, he\u2019s doing great.

Besides, he\u2019ll get a new kidney any day.\u201d Bryce started picking at a hole in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not on the transplant list, buddy. The cancer ruled that out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give him my kidney.\u201d Bryce\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d give him mine, if it would help.\u201d Lucas put a hand on Bryce\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHis biggest concern is you. He wants you to have a great life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have a great life. And my dad...I\u2019ll talk to him. But he\u2019s not going anywhere. I won\u2019t let him. Anyway, why are you talking about the job stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some construction work to do while I\u2019m here. Maybe you could help.\u201d Bryce looked unconvinced. \u201cWe could hang out, you know? And you could learn some construction skills, and who knows? You might like it.\u201d</p><p>Bryce mulled that over. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cSure! Swing some hammers, then grab a few beers at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, go down to the lake, maybe pick up some girls.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas closed his eyes briefly. \u201cSure. Sounds good. Pick you up tomorrow morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the window shattered with a crash, causing them both to jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d Bryce said. He ran up the stairs and out the front door, slamming it behind him hard enough to make the house shake.</p><p>But the window was on the side of the house, not the front. Lucas went over to it, his feet crunching on the broken glass, and looked outside.</p><p>Colleen O\u2019Rourke was standing in Didi\u2019s lilacs, staring at the street, talking on the phone.</p><p>He opened the door that led to the backyard and, his feet silent on the grass, went up behind her.</p> <p>Ah. Paulie Petrosinsky was standing in front of her little Porsche, wiping her hands on her thighs. Bryce stood with her, talking amiably.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Paulie,\u201d Colleen muttered, \u201cI want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>She jumped, hitting her head on a branch. \u201cJesus! You scared me!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you scared me!\u201d Paulie barked, her voice clearly heard from the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bryce asked, his voice audible, as well.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Paulie said.</p> <p>For the love of God. \u201cGive that to me,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Paulie echoed.</p><p>Colleen tapped the mute button on her iPhone. \u201cStill good at sneaking around, I see,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>He felt a smile start in his chest. Yep. Once or twice (four times, actually), he\u2019d sneaked into her own yard, climbed the trellis to her bedroom and spent a happy night wrapped around her. They\u2019d drawn the line at actual sex, but just barely.</p><p>Happy times.</p><p>Colleen seemed to be thinking the same things, because her face got pink.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help Paulie make Bryce feel manly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy having her act feminine and helpless,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAh. So she has engine trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slashed her front tire. Think Bryce can change a flat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and Lucas felt it like an electric shock.</p><p>Once, Colleen had been the prettiest girl around.</p><p>Now, she was beautiful.</p><p>And not a girl anymore.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bug me,\u201d she said, tearing her eyes off him. \u201cI have work to do.\u201d She tapped her phone, and once again, they could hear the star-crossed lovers from the street.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, do you know what I should do?\u201d Paulie said, clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cCall Triple A?\u201d Bryce suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh. So you don\u2019t know how to change a flat tire?\u201d Paulie asked, looking rather desperately at Colleen, who pointed at Bryce\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I never could figure out the jack, you know?\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Colleen whispered, \u201cTell him you\u2019re sure he can figure it out. Be feminine. Be helpless. Make him feel strong and manly.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes. \u201cTell me when you\u2019ve ever acted feminine or helpless in your life.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her face suddenly stricken. She took a shaky breath. \u201cLucas, please,\u201d she whispered, blinking back tears. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help my friend. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s stupid. I just didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Her mouth quivered.</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, it works on everyone else.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone, clicked End and put it in his front jeans pocket. \u201cYou want it, you have to come get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll cut it out with my Swiss Army knife, and I won\u2019t be careful of the landscape.\u201d She waited. He didn\u2019t move. \u201cLucas, give me my damn phone.\u201d She reached for his pocket, but he intercepted her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou set this up, Colleen. Let them finish it.\u201d Her hand was smooth and cool and fit into his just right. Same as always. Because he couldn\u2019t resist, he stroked the back of her hand with his thumb, that soft, sweet skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re really turning me on.\u201d She batted her eyelashes at him, then pulled her hand free. Reached into his pocket.</p><p>\u00a1Hola!</p><p>She kept her eyes locked on his. Fumbled around...deliberately, he figured. She gave that wicked smile.</p><p>Still the same Colleen.</p><p>And thank God for that.</p><p>He bent his head so that his unshaven cheek brushed hers. \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d he whispered. God, she smelled good. Better than the lilacs, even.</p><p>\u201cThe ego on you could choke a blue whale,\u201d she said, yanking her hand (and her phone) free. Her cheeks were very encouragingly red. She tapped her phone; a second later, Paulie tapped her Bluetooth. Command Central was once again established.</p><p>Bryce had found the spare tire in the trunk and put the lug wrench on a nut without too much difficulty. \u201cI saw this in a movie,\u201d he said happily, giving the wrench a hard turn. It sprang off and hit him in the arm. \u201cOops. Hang on, let me try that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him how glad you are that you got this flat in front of his house. He\u2019s a regular white knight,\u201d Colleen muttered into the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so lucky I got this flat in front of your house,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cYou\u2019re a prince, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob, dude!\u201d Bryce answered. He seemed to get the lug nuts loosened, but the jack was more perplexing. Paulie waited, cracking her knuckles. Bryce fumbled. Turned the jack on its side to see if it would work better that way, which, shockingly, it didn\u2019t. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he said. \u201cMy cousin\u2019s here. I bet he could do this in ten seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe less,\u201d Lucas murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t let him leave,\u201d Colleen hissed into the phone. \u201cImprovise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cUh...um...here. I\u2019ll lift the front bumper, and you change the tire, okay? Count of three.\u201d</p><p>And sure enough, she hefted the front end of her car.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s magnificent,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Colleen muttered. \u201cAnd she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Bryce exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re superstrong. What\u2019s your workout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarine Boot Camp 360,\u201d Paulie grunted.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding! Me, too!\u201d Bryce exclaimed. \u201cHow much can you bench-press?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull the tire off, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pop a hernia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like watching a p**n o,\u201d Lucas murmured.</p><p>Colleen snorted and hit Mute again on the phone, as her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 apparently couldn\u2019t take orders while lifting a small vehicle. \u201cSo why\u2019d you get a divorce?\u201d she asked after a minute.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I never got over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Good line. I\u2019m serious. Why\u2019d you leave that sweet deal of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were having dinner sometime. I\u2019d rather not discuss my marriage in the bushes.\u201d That being said, he could see down her shirt. Push-up bra, thank you, Lord. She\u2019d never been shy about showcasing her assets, and times like this, he was grateful.</p><p>She seemed to read his mind, because she glanced back at him. Busted. He grinned.</p><p>So did she, completely confident.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Lucas that he was single, and Colleen was single, and he\u2019d be in town for\u2014</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t here for a relationship, and certainly not one that would doubtlessly be as tangled and intense as his and Colleen\u2019s had been ten years ago. She wasn\u2019t the fling type.</p><p>At least, she hadn\u2019t been. She\u2019d been in it with her whole heart, and it came back to him like a tidal wave, what it had been like to be loved by Colleen O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d she whispered, then cleared her throat. \u201cThe whole Heathcliff thing doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seeing anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>Bryce dropped the tire, laughing. It seemed like Paulie\u2019s arms were shaking.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna drop that on his head any minute now,\u201d Lucas observed.</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cSo go help. Be manly and heroic, Lucas. You do it so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNice to see you, hotshot. Stop throwing rocks through windows, okay?\u201d</p><p>With that, he walked toward the front yard.</p><p>\u201cDude, thank God!\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Paulie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can put the car down now. I got this.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, he heard a car start and looked down the street. There was Colleen, behind the wheel of a MINI Cooper convertible.</p><p>Hot girl in a red car.</p><p>Worked every time.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S GOOD TO see you, Lucas. Even if you did break my baby girl\u2019s heart all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, snap,\u201d said Bryce, grinning. Mrs. O\u2019Rourke smiled fondly at him.</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cGood to see you, too, Mrs. O\u2019Rourke.\u201d It was strange to see Colleen\u2019s mother, that\u2019s what it was, and even weirder to be back in the house he\u2019d visited when he was Colleen\u2019s boyfriend. It hadn\u2019t changed much.</p><p>\u201cCall me Jeanette. I\u2019m thinking of going back to my maiden name anyway. Come on, I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d She led the way to the back of the house. \u201cThis was his study. Where he called That Whore for phone sex, no doubt. I\u2019d like you to rip it down. Burn it, if possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter late than never?\u201d Bryce suggested.</p><p>\u201cExactly, sweetheart. It\u2019s been ten years. Men. They really suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, of course,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cWell, not yet,\u201d Jeanette murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have it in you. Are you seeing anyone, Bryce, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You wanna go out sometime?\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s mother smiled and slapped Bryce\u2019s arm.</p><p>Jeanette O\u2019Rourke had tracked Lucas down and said she had a project for him. Given that he was trying to train Bryce, and construction hadn\u2019t started on the public safety building yet, he agreed to come over and take a look.</p><p>The study was typical of 1970s architecture; a long room with a few small windows and some built-in cabinets on one end, and still a shrine to Pete O\u2019Rourke\u2014a picture of him with some minor politician on a golf course, a trophy from high school, a slew of Robert Ludlum novels. A picture of a college-age Colleen, her cheeky smile, gray eyes soft, hair gleaming in the sun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seemed like he was staring.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could remodel, rather than rip it down and burn it,\u201d he said, turning to Colleen\u2019s mother. \u201cSeems a shame to waste the whole room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I could have an art studio, maybe. I\u2019m taking classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of classes?\u201d Bryce asked.</p> <p>\u201cI paint nudes,\u201d she said, giving him a speculative glance. \u201cThey pay the models, you know. We\u2019re always looking for new talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Bryce asked. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cAnyway, we could put in some skylights, since you need a new roof anyway, and bigger windows. You\u2019d have great light. French doors on that wall, maybe a little deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! When can you start?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cAre you sure you want me to do this, Mrs. O\u2019Rourke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeanette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven my history with Colleen, Jeanette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said, so smoothly that he was immediately suspicious. \u201cSo it\u2019d be you both? You and Bryce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI could probably sell tickets. Can you work up some plans? I don\u2019t care how much it costs. My cheating bastard husband had to give me a metric ton of money in the divorce. Blood money. Guilt money. Whore money.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, he\u2019d drawn a rough plan and given her a ballpark estimate. He and Bryce got into the pickup truck Lucas had rented for the duration.</p> <p>Joe would be glad about this. It was a start, at the very least, and hopefully Bryce would have some kind of aptitude for construction.</p><p>They passed a dirt road. He and Colleen had parked there one night, before they\u2019d both gone off to college. He could still remember the impossible silkiness of her skin, the way her eyes went so big and soft when she\u2014</p><p>\u201cDid you see my dad yesterday?\u201d Bryce asked. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling a lot better.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced over at his cousin. \u201cGlad to hear that.\u201d Yes, he\u2019d seen Joe yesterday. He\u2019d been asleep, looking smaller somehow.</p><p>Bryce had had a cat when they were teenagers, a scruffy old thing he\u2019d found abandoned near the school. He brought it home and kept it in the spare room over the garage, an unfinished space that held only some boxes of old toys. Didi hated cats. But eventually, Bryce had worn her down; the woman didn\u2019t refuse him much, and the cat was no exception. It was old and battered, but it had a rusty purr that rattled in its throat. Bryce named it Harley, and the cat loved Bryce. Slept on his bed every night. If Bryce wasn\u2019t around, the cat might give Lucas a few head butts, but it was clear he knew where his bread was buttered.</p><p>Unfortunately, Harley was old and riddled with health problems, which was probably why someone had dumped him in the first place. Despite the myriad pills Bryce coaxed down Harley\u2019s throat each day, despite the vet warning him that the cat wouldn\u2019t see Christmas, despite the fact that the cat slept more and more and ate less and less, Bryce just didn\u2019t believe the cat was sick. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t purr like this if he didn\u2019t feel good,\u201d he\u2019d say, petting the cat\u2019s head, and it seemed almost true.</p><p>Until the day the boys had come home from school and found Harley dead, curled up on Bryce\u2019s bed.</p><p>Bryce had been utterly stunned. Lucas had heard him crying at night, despite his advanced age of sixteen.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t look as if things were going to be much different with Joe. And far, far worse.</p><p>\u201cYou should spend as much time with him as you can, Bryce,\u201d Lucas said now.</p><p>\u201cI already do. I mean, I live there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s time well spent. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been nice to have been able to do the same with his own father. To have said goodbye, to have held his hand in the last minutes.</p><p>But this time, he could be there for Joe. And Bryce, too.</p><p>ON WEDNESDAY, COLLEEN stopped by her mother\u2019s house.</p><p>Mom had called last night to say she was having Dad\u2019s study redone, and thank the baby Jesus. The tenth anniversary of Dad leaving had really lit a fire under her. First the nude modeling, now redecorating.</p><p>Colleen pulled her car onto the street. There was a pickup truck in the driveway and a stack of lumber piled alongside the house, as well as a Dumpster. Carol Robinson\u2019s white Prius was parked on the street, too; Colleen recognized it from the many open houses she\u2019d been to. Mrs. Johnson\u2019s car, too, a monstrous Buick that Mrs. J. (pi\u00f1a colada) tended to drive down the middle of the street, striking fear into the hearts of every living thing.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom!\u201d Colleen yelled, going into the house. The sound of a power saw ripped through the air, then faded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out back!\u201d Mom called.</p><p>Colleen pushed through the door to the backyard. Carol, Mom and Mrs. Johnson\u2014she was Mrs. Holland, technically, though no one called her that\u2014sat in lawn chairs and were sipping something pink.</p><p>\u201cHey, ladies!\u201d she said, bending to kiss each one. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little healthy observation, Colleen dear,\u201d Mrs. J. said. \u201cWe\u2019re not dead yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a chair,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>Colleen obeyed. Looked up at the roof. \u201cIs that Bryce?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucas. His cousin,\u201d Carol said. \u201cJoe\u2019s dying, you know. He has maybe six weeks left. Didn\u2019t you used to date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never dated Joe Campbell,\u201d Colleen murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, Coll,\u201d Bryce yelled.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>Lucas came into view.</p><p>Oh, wow. Wow. He wore carpenter shorts and work boots and a white T-shirt that made his skin seem darker. Blue-collar man and his big, strong...um...hammer. Wasn\u2019t there a p**n o about this? There should be. Someone should make one. Now.</p><p>Seeing her, he gave a nod. Maybe a smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Carol said. \u201cYou did date Lucas. But he married someone else, right? Lucas! Are you still married?\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, Mrs. Robinson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be single in a few hours,\u201d she called. \u201cYou like older women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love older women,\u201d he answered, getting a chorus of giggles from Team Menopause. Colleen just swallowed drily.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tap that, Colleen?\u201d Carol asked. \u201cBecause I sure would if I was your age. Even if I was sixty again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him that,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBut personally, I think I\u2019ll pass. And where do you get off saying \u2018tap that\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only boy Colleen ever really fell for,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>Colleen closed her eyes. \u201cIs there alcohol in those glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in mine, my dear,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cThough when the clock strikes five, there\u2019d better be. But yes, these two are drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little white Zin and 7-Up,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Stab me in the heart. Ladies, have some dignity. At least let me make you mojitos,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Carol said. \u201cBut oh, wait, Bryce is taking off his shirt. Do it, Bryce! Do it!\u201d She giggled most adorably.</p><p>\u201cI feel dirty,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mom said. \u201cBryce, you make me feel dirty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez!\u201d Colleen squeaked. \u201cCome on, ladies! A little decorum.\u201d</p><p>But she watched as Bryce took off his shirt, sure. She wasn\u2019t dead, after all. He was pretty, no doubt about it. Washboard abs, nice muscles, she\u2019d seen it all before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give that an eight and a half,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said.</p><p>\u201cNine,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cNine,\u201d Mom echoed. \u201cColleen, I think you and Lucas should get together again. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace, please make my mom stop talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he kissed you in the bar the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlessed art thou who can change the subject, and blessed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Mom said, slurping down the rest of her hideous drink. \u201cDon\u2019t be coy. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be old and your ovaries will be turning to stone, and still I won\u2019t have a grandchild.\u201d She began fanning herself. \u201cPhew! Is it getting hotter out here? My God. I\u2019m sweating. Colleen, have you ever had a bikini wax? I\u2019m thinking of getting one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, now and as we contemplate matricide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, you two,\u201d Carol ordered. \u201cLucas! Take off your shirt! Your cousin did! You should, too.\u201d</p><p>Carol had a point. And it was pretty hot.</p><p>Lucas looked down at them. His white teeth flashed among that incredibly sexy razor stubble, and Colleen gave what she hoped was a casual wave and not a boneless flop of the hand, as she suspected.</p><p>He pulled off his shirt in one smooth move. Colleen stopped feeling her legs.</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said.</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d Carol and Mom echoed.</p><p>Maybe it was his swarthy skin. The muscles in his shoulders and across his chest. His hard, sweaty, delicious torso, not ripped like Bryce\u2019s gym-perfect boy-toy body, just...just complete, utter masculine alpha perfection.</p><p>\u201cColleen?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>She closed her mouth. \u201cNine,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cWho wants a mojito?\u201d</p><p>They all did. And Colleen could use one, too. Or she could stick her head in the freezer for a few minutes.</p><p>So Lucas would be around. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised; Mom was hardly a master of subtlety. Bryce was a bar fixture, so sure, Lucas would be there, too. It was okay. She could handle it.</p><p>On lust-numbed legs, she stumbled into the kitchen. Checked Mom\u2019s fridge, which was filled with fresh vegetables that, if history served, would melt into one big vegetable which would then be thrown away, but not before Mom called to complain about the price of fresh vegetables. But there was mint, and lime, and of course Colleen kept her stocked up with good quality booze.</p><p>She poured some sugar and water into a pan and heated it, since Mom didn\u2019t have any simple syrup. Took out the white rum, squeezed the limes and rinsed the mint. From outside, she could hear the women laughing and the power saw screeching again.</p><p>Seemed as though any minute now, Lucas would come down and see her.</p><p>Sure enough, she heard the clump of his boots coming down the stairs.</p><p>He\u2019d pulled his shirt back on. Good thing, too, because he looked like sin begging for a taker as it was. A bead of sweat ran from his temple down his cheek, then down his neck. She remembered how it felt to be held in those arms, to lie on top of him and look into those dark, lonely eyes that only ever seemed happy when they were alone together.</p><p>Yeah, right. She\u2019d bet Ellen Forbes had made him look happy, too.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, and her knees went weak. She really had to get a grip.</p><p>His voice had always been a wicked weapon in his arsenal, deep and holding a scrape that made her special places throb with every word. \u201cDo you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen,\u201d she interrupted briskly, pouring the syrup over the crushed ice. \u201cBefore you say something adorable, like, \u2018How can I get that nine to a ten?\u2019 let\u2019s be frank here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a thing once, it was very lovely, and then it ended when you married someone else after saying you didn\u2019t want to marry me. Maybe it was her money, maybe you found out what love really was, I don\u2019t care, Lucas. Water under the bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen.\u201d His voice was more forceful now, but she kept talking, grinding the mint leaves with slightly more force than needed. \u201cYes, I find you attractive. I have a heartbeat, after all, and you\u2019re frickin\u2019 gorgeous. Yes, you find me attractive, because I am.

Didn\u2019t quite make it, unfortunately, not before she cracked her head on the counter. \u201cJeanette!\u201d he called. \u201cWe need you!\u201d He glanced at his cousin. \u201cBryce, you\u2019re dripping blood on the floor. Grab some paper towels and hang on a sec, okay?\u201d</p><p>He cradled Colleen from behind. Very uncool to be thinking lustful thoughts, but she smelled like fresh mint and sunshine, and her hair brushed his face. \u201cM\u00eda,\u201d he said, pushing her head forward a bit to get some blood flow there. \u201cTime to wake up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConnor, why did you punch me?\u201d she muttered, reaching for her head.</p><p>He smiled into her hair. \u201cColleen. You okay, sweetheart?\u201d She sat up straighter and gave him a confused look. \u201cYou fainted,\u201d he said. \u201cBumped your head on the way down, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never faint. Also, you\u2019re supposed to catch me. Haven\u2019t you ever been to a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke your fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she faint?\u201d Carol Robinson asked as the three women bustled into the kitchen like a flock of purposeful chickens. \u201cMy daughter fainted once. She hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast, it was hot, and I said, \u2018Beth, why didn\u2019t you eat breakfast?\u2019 but no one ever listens to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBryce Campbell, whatever did you do to your hand?\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cCome here, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you two look adorable sitting there,\u201d Jeanette said. \u201cIs it wrong to hope for grandchildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m injured. Be nice to me.\u201d</p><p>Jeanette sighed and rustled around in the freezer for a minute, then handed Colleen a pack of frozen Brussels sprouts. Coll went to hold it against her head, but Lucas took it out of her hand and did it for her. She started to protest, but he made that little tsk noise that worked with his nieces, and she settled back against him.</p><p>He pushed her hair to one side\u2014she had a lot of hair. And it smelled really good. And she felt...perfect. His arms were around her, his back to the cabinet, his woman in his arms.</p><p>Dangerous thinking, that. Especially after her little speech.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to get that nine to a ten?\u201d he whispered against her ear, and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou always hit on injured women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adorable together,\u201d Carol said. \u201cAre you Spanish, Lucas? You look like a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half\u2013Puerto Rican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. That\u2019s so exotic,\u201d Carol said, and he had to smile. Manningsport wasn\u2019t exactly a melting pot.</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Rourke was standing in front of the freezer, flapping her shirt. \u201cColleen, you didn\u2019t turn on the heat, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom. I didn\u2019t turn on the heat.\u201d She sighed, the movement sweet against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow hold still, Bryce my darling,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said, grabbing his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, dude! A little warning next time.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Johnson held up the nail. \u201cYou children today. So careless. Now hold on, this might sting a little.\u201d They watched as she poured hydrogen peroxide on Bryce\u2019s hand. He took it like a man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brave, Bryce,\u201d Colleen said, earning a smile from his cousin.</p><p>\u201cHe has a high pain tolerance,\u201d Lucas murmured against the sweet spot just behind her ear. \u201cComes from being dropped on his head as a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who else has a high pain tolerance?\u201d she asked, still talking to Bryce. \u201cPaulie Petrosinsky. She\u2019s totally badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Bryce said. \u201cDid you know she can pick up a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThat is hot, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop matchmaking,\u201d Lucas whispered, his lips touching her soft little earlobe. Good enough to bite.</p><p>She turned her head a little. \u201cCan you stop nuzzling me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI realize you don\u2019t get this close to many women, but it\u2019s getting pervy. You, me, the Brussels sprouts, Team Menopause watching.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her again, smiling as her breath hitched.</p><p>Mrs. Johnson wrapped up Bryce\u2019s hand in gauze. \u201cIs your tetanus shot up to date?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come down with lockjaw.\u201d</p><p>Actually, Lucas wouldn\u2019t mind Bryce coming down with lockjaw. His cousin had not once paused for breath this entire day. Reluctantly, he disentangled himself from Colleen and stood up, then offered his hand and pulled her to her feet. \u201cYou good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. Her cheeks were pink.</p><p>\u201cEat something,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, Bryce, let me take you to the doctor. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, Mrs. O\u2019Rourke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeanette,\u201d she said, rubbing an ice cube on her chest. \u201cBye, boys.\u201d</p><p>Colleen walked them to the front door, the Brussels sprouts still in place. \u201cSee you, Coll!\u201d Bryce said happily, loping to the pickup truck.</p><p>Lucas turned to Colleen. \u201cSee you around, hotshot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with me, Lucas,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>His smile evaporated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not back in Manningsport for me, and I\u2019m betting that as soon as Joe dies, you\u2019ll be back to your life in Chicago. And that\u2019s fine. But the kissing and the flirting and the nuzzling...it has to stop. I don\u2019t have a problem with you, I really don\u2019t. You\u2019re a good guy. I know that. You\u2019re very welcome at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. You\u2019re welcome at my mom\u2019s house. But you left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you left me, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I didn\u2019t marry someone two months after our first fight. And don\u2019t call me m\u00eda.\u201d She seemed to realize she still had the bag of vegetables on her head and lowered her arm. \u201cYou broke my heart, Lucas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a long time ago. But I\u2019m not dumb enough to let history repeat itself. So don\u2019t mess with me. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a long minute, the noise of the chattering women in the background, the birds twittering in the bushes outside. And as much as he would\u2019ve liked to tell her yes, sure, he\u2019d leave her alone, he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Colleen had a pull on him. That same sense he had when he first laid eyes on her in that classroom so long ago, that locked-in feeling, as if he\u2019d waited all his life to see her...that still pulsed between them.</p><p>She felt it, too. She licked her lips, and the pink stained her cheeks again. He could swear he heard her heart beating.</p><p>\u201cWhat seems clear,\u201d he murmured, stepping a little closer so that they were almost touching, \u201cis that this is going to happen. You and me. It\u2019s just a question of when.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him a long minute. Then she pressed her forefinger into the hollow at the base of his throat, gently, forcing him to take a step back.</p><p>Closed the door in his face. Didn\u2019t slam it; just closed it.</p><p>Lucas found he was smiling all the way to the truck.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>IN THE THREE weeks he\u2019d been in Manningsport, Lucas had had no success in pinning Bryce down on his hopes and aspirations, careerwise. Nope. That was a black hole. Lucas, on the other hand, was acting as project manager for the public safety building, had been asked to consult on a new wing for the senior citizen community and was putting on a new room for Colleen\u2019s mother. A couple had asked him about building a superdeluxe chicken coop for their free-range chickens, and while Lucas didn\u2019t particularly want to be building that sort of structure, he\u2019d sketched out a plan for them nonetheless.</p><p>It had always been that way. Work found him.</p><p>Work cowered from Bryce. And his cousin, let\u2019s be honest, excelled at laziness. Bryce had been rather thrilled with his injury, and while it had been a little on the gruesome side, it really was something that he could\u2019ve taken care of with a couple of Band-Aids, rather than the wad of gauze he was currently sporting.</p><p>Since construction was clearly not going to work (Bryce had knocked a pallet of shingles off the roof, lost his hammer seven times and dropped his phone into the roofing tar before mishandling the nail gun), Lucas had talked to a few people, studied Craigslist and had gone over to Didi\u2019s to rouse Bryce out of bed for a little swing through town.</p><p>First stop, the firehouse.</p><p>Lucas had become friendly with Gerard Chartier, winning the man\u2019s loyalty when he agreed that fire services outranked the other two. (Lucas had also told Levi that police services were the most important, and agreed with Kelly Matthews that EMS clearly came first. Hey. It made everyone happy.) At any rate, Gerard told Lucas they were hiring five new people; apparently there\u2019d been a big house fire up at Blue Heron, and the good people of Manningsport had agreed to fund a paid department.</p><p>Perfect job for Bryce\u2019s type. Bryce was in great shape, liked people and...and...well, maybe he\u2019d make a good firefighter.</p><p>Bryce seemed suitably awed as Gerard gave him the talk, staring in childlike wonder at the fire trucks. Lucas felt the same way. Every little boy wanted to be a firefighter, after all.</p><p>\u201cThis would be awesome,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cNot to brag, but I have already saved someone. Lucas? Remember? When I saved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d At Gerard\u2019s questioning look, he added, \u201cI got my foot caught in the train tracks, and Bryce knocked me free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the nick of time, too,\u201d Bryce said happily. \u201cSo what do you have to do to qualify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s twelve weeks at the fire academy,\u201d Gerard began. \u201cFirefighter I, Firefighter II\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. There\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You learn about hazardous materials and how to contain them, incident command system, blood-borne pathogens. Oh, and you have to be an EMT, too, but that\u2019s easy. Just a six-week class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer. That\u2019s really not my thing.\u201d Lucas\u2019s head jerked back a little. \u201cBut thanks for your time, Gerard!\u201d Bryce shook the firefighter\u2019s hand vigorously. \u201cSee you at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Lucas said as they crossed the green, \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem here? Is it fire academy? Twelve weeks will go by like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to school,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be fun,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, jumping out of windows and rescuing dogs and stuff? That would be fun. Hazardous material containment? No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, Bryce,\u201d he said, though he did sometimes fear that his cousin had taken a sharp blow to the head. \u201cYou could pass, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Especially if Lucas tutored him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d his cousin said blithely. \u201cI\u2019m just not interested. Plus, it might interfere with my work at the shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have health benefits, vacation...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the more I think about it, the less I want to do it. I mean, what if I got hurt on the job? I could be disabled for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a good thing I thought this through. Kinda dodged a bullet there.\u201d</p><p>Lucas closed his eyes briefly. Once Bryce made up his mind, there was no talking him down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their next stop was the bakery. Lorelei, the owner, had advertised for an apprentice baker; apparently she supplied quite a few of the local restaurants with bread and desserts. \u201cHi, guys!\u201d she said with a sunny smile. \u201cBryce, what happened to your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said, proudly holding up the heavily bandaged extremity. Honestly, amputees used less gauze. \u201cPut a nail through my hand when my cousin and I were doing this job up on the Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d she said, melting a little as Bryce stepped closer to show her his boo-boo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for help, Lorelei?\u201d Lucas asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes! Do you know anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce might be interested, right, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bryce said amiably.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lorelei said, blushing. \u201cWow. That\u2019d be...that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as I don\u2019t have to get up too early,\u201d Bryce said with a wink.</p> <p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Lucas warned.</p><p>Lorelei wrung her hands. \u201cActually, you\u2019d have to be here at four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face lit up again.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019d get a dinner break, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour in the morning, Bryce.\u201d Lucas sighed.</p> <p>Bryce looked incredulous. \u201cYou actually wake up at four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI wake up at three-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan! Hey, you going to Paulie\u2019s this weekend? We could hang out, maybe.\u201d Code for hook up, of course.</p><p>And that was another thing.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s little matchmaking plan.</p><p>The Petrosinskys were hosting a cookout, and half the town\u2014almost literally\u2014had been invited.</p><p>The bell over the door rang, and speak of the devil\u2014the gorgeous, gray-eyed devil\u2014in she came, along with Faith.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lorelei!\u201d Faith said with the same joy expressed by those reuniting after decades of war. \u201cGot any chocolate croissants today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d Lorelei said. \u201cHi, Colleen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, good people of Manningsport,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, Lucas, always such a delight to see you. Got a sweet tooth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some things, I do,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, are you flirting with me? Give me a second to take off my panties, and I\u2019m yours. Lorelei, I\u2019ll have one of those black-and-white cookies, okay?\u201d But she was blushing, and didn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>Faith was already halfway through her pastry. Rumor had it she was eating for two, and Lucas smiled at her. Good old Faith. \u201cWhat are you boys doing today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust hanging out,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cBryce is looking for work,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cGot anything at the vineyard, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Bryce has already tried working for Blue Heron,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t quite work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not,\u201d he said amiably. \u201cI was in the tasting room. I got a little drunk, I guess. Honor fired me after my first day. She\u2019s kinda scary, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou passed out behind the bar, Bryce,\u201d Faith said, a hint of admonition in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d He shrugged happily. \u201cYou guys make great wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of work are you looking for?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething creative and where I can make my own hours and help people,\u201d Bryce said, and Lucas rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can get you a job,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Bryce shot Lucas a nervous look.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Lucas waited. Colleen raised her eyebrows, looking at him and not Bryce.</p><p>Ah. He got it.</p><p>\u201cBryce, go get a cookie,\u201d he said. When Bryce was out of hearing range, he turned back to Colleen. \u201cWhat will it cost me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou agree not to meddle with him and Paulie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to have this argument again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. Waited.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s a deal,\u201d he said. At least he could tell Joe his son had a job, and that was something.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Bryce,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cCome with me. Faith, back in ten minutes, hon.\u201d</p><p>She took Bryce by the arm and towed him out of the shop. Lucas followed. A couple was approaching the bakery, a little baby strapped to the woman\u2019s chest in a complicated harness.</p><p>\u201cColleen!\u201d the woman cried. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, guys! Look at her! She\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d Colleen peered at the baby. Lucas did, too. Cute little bugger, a tuft of black hair on the tiny head, perfect little ears. Colleen let go of Bryce, and he wandered a bit down the street, eating his cookie.</p><p>Colleen turned to Lucas. \u201cLucas, meet Jordan and Tate Lawrence, and their beautiful little girl, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe named her after Colleen,\u201d the guy explained, grinning. \u201cSince she fixed us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019d be no little Colleen without this Colleen,\u201d the woman added. As if on cue, she reached for her husband\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou two are so cute together!\u201d Colleen gushed with a significant look at Lucas. \u201cHave a great day!\u201d</p><p>She waited until the little family went inside. \u201cAnother couple I can claim. I should be a professional. Want me to find someone for you, Lucas, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how many babies there are in Manningsport named Colleen?\u201d she asked smugly. \u201cSeven. Seven, Lucas. That\u2019s one one-hundredth of the population, named after me with joy and gratitude because I fixed up Mommy and Daddy, and that even includes two boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys named Colleen?\u201d Bryce asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. One is Colin, the other is Cole, but we all know who they\u2019re talking about. Me. Come on. Bryce! Come! Over here, across the street. In we go.\u201d</p><p>Window boxes, which seemed required if you were a shopkeeper in Manningsport, spilled over with blue and orange flowers. The pink-and-gold sign said Happily Ever After. \u201cTo the dress store?\u201d Bryce asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She opened the door and ushered them in. White dresses. Pink couches. More white dresses. Lots of sparkle.</p><p>A woman about their age came into the foyer, and her face lit up. \u201cColleen! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Gwen! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d the woman said. \u201cCan I get you some wine? Coffee? A foot rub? Clean your house for you?\u201d She and Colleen laughed merrily.</p><p>Colleen gave Lucas a smug smile. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a bride or two Gwen\u2019s way,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOr two? Or a dozen, more like it! Honestly, your dress is going to be free when the day comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick out a winner. Anyway, Gwen, I\u2019m wondering if you can help me. Bryce here is looking for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gwen asked with a frown. Bryce smiled. So far, no objections from him.</p><p>\u201cI know how busy you are,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I\u2019m not sure about, um, a straight guy.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the door to a dressing room opened, and a woman came out in\u2014surprise\u2014a wedding gown. Very poufy, and so tight you had to wonder how she\u2019d sit down. Then again, Lucas knew enough about women to know that comfort was pretty low on the list when it came to dressing up.</p><p>\u201cHey. How you doing?\u201d Bryce said. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...hi. Really?\u201d the woman said nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? This is...yeah.\u201d He nodded appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cI do like it,\u201d the bride said, fluffing the skirt as she looked in the mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m not sure. There was this dress I saw in Buffalo\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bryce shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that one was like, but this one just rocks it. Your guy is really, really lucky. Wow. You are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The bride glanced at Bryce and smiled. Looked back at herself.</p><p>Gwen and Colleen exchanged a look.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Gwen had sold an eight-thousand-dollar dress and Bryce had a job.</p><p>Okay, so it might not be the profession Lucas would\u2019ve picked\u2014bridal-gown consultant\u2014but he wasn\u2019t about to argue.</p><p>\u201cThis is so awesome, guys!\u201d he said as they emerged into the sunlight. \u201cAnd I get to look at beautiful women all day!\u201d He held his hand up for a high five, and Colleen obliged. \u201cHey, I gotta run. Gonna go wash some doggies at the animal shelter.\u201d He loped off down the street.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me now,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>Alongside the store was a little alley where they\u2019d kissed once, before they\u2019d been sleeping together, when things were still new. She had taken him by the hand and pulled him in here one summer night, that bittersweet summer between high school and college, and kissed him until his entire being throbbed with wanting her and he couldn\u2019t form actual thoughts, reduced to the primal state of one need, with one girl.</p><p>This one.</p><p>He reached out and pushed a lock of hair behind her ear, trailing his finger along her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off,\u201d she said unconvincingly, her voice husky.</p><p>He leaned in closer, nostalgia and present-day wanting getting the better of him.</p><p>Then her phone buzzed, and she jumped two feet backward. \u201cSign from God,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you around, Spaniard.\u201d</p><p>With that, she ran across the street to the bakery, to the safety of pastries and her friend.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>ONE OF THE best things about Manningsport\u2014aside from the vineyards and the green and the lake and the cute downtown and Lorelei\u2019s cranberry-orange muffins, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, of course\u2014was the town softball league. It was fifty-three years old and had the unusual tradition of mixing players of all ages and both sexes on the teams. It was fiercely competitive, however. Hey. It was New York.</p><p>To play on the team, you had to try out. In other words, you had to be good. Connor, Colleen and Savannah played for the O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team\u2014Savannah was the youngest player in town history to make the team. The kid could hit.</p><p>And it was nice because Colleen and Connor got to play with their little sister. There weren\u2019t too many occasions when the three of them did something together, as Connor kept his distance from Dad and Gail. The Friday night dinners were about it, so when it was game night, both Con and Colleen took the night off to demonstrate the O\u2019Rourke supremacy.</p><p>Tonight, however, Stoakes Candy Store was short a player. As manager, Coll had made the great sacrifice and offered to play for the competition. She donned the candy store shirt; the Stoakes team\u2019s slogan was an insipid Stoakes Candy &amp; Baseball: A Sweet Deal. Not nearly as cool as her own team\u2019s: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s: Smiting the Rest of You Since 2009. Because yes, they were always the town champs. Colleen was pretty great at baseball; Connor was better, and though it was Savannah\u2019s first year, she had first round draft pick written all over her.</p><p>Savannah played in the regular Little League, too, but she loved the game and begged Dad and Gail to let her play on the town league, too. The more baseball, the better. At first, people had been kind of sweet to her, throwing soft pitches last summer...right up until they had to hit the dirt to avoid her wicked line drive. At the ripe old age of nine, Savannah could throw out a runner attempting to steal second. Her batting average was .378 this year, and that was hitting against grown men. On-base percentage? Please. .479.</p><p>It was a balmy night, Monica and Hannah were running the bar, Rafe manning the kitchen, though Con would go by later to obsess and micromanage and irritate their sous chef. Dad and Gail were here to see Savannah; Dad had not yet missed a game. Well, he hadn\u2019t ever missed one of Savannah\u2019s games. He\u2019d missed plenty of hers and Con\u2019s back in the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom was also here, cheerful as the Angel of Death at a wedding. She stood directly in Dad\u2019s line of vision and had on one of her familiar expressions\u2014Hello, my name is Rejected First Wife.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, what are you doing here?\u201d Colleen asked, going over to the bleachers, Rufus at her heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Colleen,\u201d Mom began in that slightly defensive and regal voice she always used when lying, \u201cto support you and your brother. And that sweet little girl from church. She happens to adore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>Mom gave her an irritable look. \u201cSherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no Sherry here, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Irish one. You know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShannon? Shannon Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. Adorable girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Colleen. Mock me. We\u2019ll see how your memory is when you\u2019re fifty-four.\u201d Mom paused. \u201cThere\u2019s that child. Is she really qualified to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavannah? My sister? Is that the child in question? And yes. She\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does this get started? And how long does each round last?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInning, Mom. Baseball has innings.\u201d She muttered a prayer for patience to St. Gehrig of Lou. How could one live in the Empire State and not be a baseball fan? Colleen herself had a photo in her bedroom of the mighty Jeter going into the stands (July 1, 2004, Red Sox/Yankees, greatest game ever, and one she watched repeatedly whenever the YES Network reran it).</p><p>A man approached, and Colleen did a double take.</p><p>\u201cHello, there, Jeanette. So great to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good to see you again,\u201d Mom said as he kissed her cheek, and Mom gave Colleen a smug look. \u201cYou remember Stan, don\u2019t you, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yes. You look...different with clothes on.\u201d It was Stan, Stan the Hairy Man. So those singles things did work, after all, and holy shitake, Mom had a date. So that\u2019s why she was here. She wanted Dad to see.</p><p>Colleen couldn\u2019t help feeling a little bit proud.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Mom said loudly, \u201cnot only is Stan artistic, he\u2019s a doctor.\u201d An arch look of triumph accompanied the statement. \u201cWe met again last week when he did my colonoscopy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Stan smiled. \u201cYour mother\u2019s preparation was perfect. Utterly clean. I haven\u2019t seen such a gorgeous colon in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets that a lot,\u201d Colleen murmured. Stan was wearing a white dress shirt, and she could see his Neanderthal-style chest hair all too clearly. \u201cConnor! Over here, buddy!\u201d This was far too good not to share.</p><p>Her brother gave her a look. What fresh hell are you luring me into now?</p><p>She smiled. You don\u2019t want to miss this.</p><p>\u201cNice meeting you, Stan,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI have to run. I\u2019m playing for Stoakes tonight, Mom. Cheer for me!\u201d She kissed her mother\u2019s cheek and loped off with Rufus. \u201cAsk how they met,\u201d she told her brother in passing.</p><p>There was Savannah, standing with Dad and the Tail. Colleen sighed.</p><p>Being an attractive female was nice, granted, and Coll had no problem enjoying it. She knew she was pretty, and appreciated her good genes. But Gail...Gail advertised sex. Tonight she was wearing a dress that barely cleared her ass. The dress was so low cut her lacy white bra showed, not to mention half her boobage. Two years ago, she\u2019d gotten implants, and the new boobs stuck out at an angle that defied God and nature.</p><p>Maybe Gail, who was no longer as young as she\u2019d been when she was the Hot Young Thing, was afraid of losing Dad.</p><p>Not that he was such a prize.</p><p>At the moment, he was goofing around with Savannah\u2019s hair, pulling a strand, then pretending he wasn\u2019t when she turned around to see. Both of them were smiling and laughing, and Gail would occasionally look at them and smile, her red-painted lips a bit ghoulish in the natural light.</p><p>\u201cHey, Yogi!\u201d Colleen said, using the nickname her sister loved. \u201cReady to kick some patootie? Hi, Dad. Gail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in a candy store shirt?\u201d Savannah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re short a player, so I\u2019m on their team today. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m still rooting for us.\u201d She winked at her sister.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Colleen?\u201d her dad said, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cMarian! Good to see you!\u201d Yes. Schmooze the mayor.</p><p>Gail tossed her shiny red hair. \u201cListen, Colleen,\u201d she said, her voice already tight. \u201cAbout Savvi playing...\u201d Gail was the only one who used Savannah\u2019s sappy nickname, and insisted that it end in an i, preferably topped with a heart. \u201cThis is her last game. We\u2019ll be focusing on cheerleading from here on out.\u201d</p><p>Savannah looked at the ground.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Colleen said. \u201cDo you like cheerleading, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Savannah muttered.</p><p>Colleen gave her father a sharp look. He returned it blankly.</p><p>\u201cCheering will be a better sport for you, sweetie pie!\u201d Gail said. \u201cYou look really pretty in that little outfit, too. Stand up straight, Savvi. It makes you look perky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look great in catcher\u2019s gear, too, Savannah,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cVery kick-ass.\u201d</p><p>Gail narrowed her eyes, then looked away in distaste, as if Colleen were a shmooshed porcupine rotting on the side of the road. Colleen narrowed back. But now wasn\u2019t the time to argue, not in front of Savannah, not in front of the crowd, which was thick tonight with tourists and townies alike.</p><p>Motherhood obviously hadn\u2019t given Gail the type of daughter she\u2019d thought she\u2019d preordered. She\u2019d wanted a gorgeous little doll, a girly-girl who loved clothes and nail polish and long hair...ironically, a little girl like Colleen had been. Not a sturdy tomboy who\u2019d asked for a poster of Jorge Posada for her last birthday.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad, Mother Gail,\u201d Colleen said, earning another glare. \u201cSee you later! Come on, Savannah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get \u2019em, tiger,\u201d Dad said, and Savannah grinned over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be watching!\u201d</p><p>Colleen felt the familiar pang. She should be more like Connor, who\u2019d given up on Dad long ago.</p><p>\u201cCollie, I don\u2019t know if I should be a cheerleader,\u201d Savannah said mournfully. \u201cSome of the girls are mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they mean?\u201d</p><p>Her sister swallowed. \u201cThey just are. The way they look at me.\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cSomeone said I was fat, and no one talked to me at tryouts.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s jaw clamped tight. \u201cYou\u2019re not fat, sweetheart. You\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m chubby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, people come in all shapes and sizes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I looked like you.\u201d</p><p>The words were stated with such hopelessness that Colleen stopped and dropped to her knees. \u201cSavannah, you\u2019re wonderful. Do you know that? You\u2019re so funny and smart and I love being with you. I always have. You also happen to be absolutely adorable. You\u2019re my favorite person in the whole world.\u201d She smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Connor, he\u2019ll get jealous.\u201d</p><p>Savannah smiled, but her eyes stayed sad.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dad\u2019s crazy about you. No one wants you to be anything but exactly who you are.\u201d</p><p>Except Gail-the-Tail-Chianese-Rhymes-with-Easy-Hyphen-O\u2019Rourke. Savannah\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could keep playing baseball,\u201d Savannah whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d Colleen promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can do, okay?\u201d</p><p>Paulie Petrosinsky was coming onto the field. Perfect. A role model of physical strength in an unconventional package. \u201cOver here, Paulie!\u201d Colleen called. \u201cDo you know my sister? Savannah O\u2019Rourke, meet Paulie Petrosinsky, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, kid?\u201d Paulie said, fist-bumping Savannah. \u201cWord on the street is you\u2019re the best player in town.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s face lit up. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>Well, well, well. Colleen owed Paulie a drink on the house.</p><p>The three of them went into the dugout, where the rest of the team was assembled, pulling on gloves and cleats. \u201cColl, wrong shirt,\u201d said Kelly Murphy, Shannon\u2019s sister and part of the Murderer\u2019s Row of the O\u2019Rourke offense.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to play for Stoakes tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna throw the game?\u201d Bryce asked, coming down the steps to the dugout. Paulie\u2019s face began its burn.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have to, because we\u2019re so superior. Gang, today we have a new player. Paulie, welcome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Paulie,\u201d everyone said. Connor cocked an eyebrow, all too aware of the matchmaking in progress.</p><p>\u201cBryce, would you help Paulie with her glove? She\u2019s never played baseball before.\u201d A lie, but hey.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, dude? This is gonna be fun,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cI bet you\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>The goal had been secured: a physically close moment. Paulie had been instructed to ask for help as much as possible.</p><p>Bryce gave the glove a tug, his hand on Paulie\u2019s wrist. \u201cLooks good!\u201d He slapped her shoulder and trotted out to the mound.</p><p>\u201cHe touched me,\u201d Paulie whispered, her breathing fast and shallow.</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t faint. I have to go. Keep an eye on Savannah for me? She\u2019s a little blue.\u201d Plus, if Paulie was good with kids, as she seemed to be, Bryce could see her as the potential mother of his children.</p><p>It was hard to be in charge of the world, Colleen mused as she trotted out to the shortstop position. Savannah was clearly dejected. Gail kept gesturing from the bleachers...probably some horrid advice like \u201csuck in your stomach.\u201d It was throwing off Savannah\u2019s game.</p><p>And if Gail had her way\u2014which she usually did\u2014it would be Savannah\u2019s last.</p><p>Dad watched his youngest intently, cheering every time she came to the plate. The poor kid struck out twice. \u201cGood try, baby!\u201d Dad called both times. \u201cYou\u2019ll get \u2019em next time!\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked away. Paulie had been instructed to high-five Bryce every time he got a hit (he was really good), so Colleen had to keep an eye on that. She was also watching Connor to see if he was giving any significant looks to anyone, because he just wouldn\u2019t crack and tell her who his mystery girlfriend was. He was clever, too; he\u2019d erased his texting history on his phone, which she had stolen that very morning. Damn that twin telepathy thing.</p><p>Mom kept braying with laughter at whatever Stan, Stan the Hairy Man said, then looking over at Dad, who wasn\u2019t watching, which caused Mom to laugh more and more loudly until she sounded like a laboring mule. Brahahaha! Brahahaha! In between innings, Coll texted her. Quiet down, you\u2019re trying too hard.</p><p>Her phone chimed with the answer. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Another donkey bray.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>In the second inning, Colleen led off with a double, then watched as the next three runners struck out. In the fifth, she walked and again didn\u2019t score, since Stoakes\u2019s offense would\u2019ve had trouble hitting a beach ball.</p><p>Then, in the eighth inning as Colleen was walking back onto the field, Lucas appeared with Joe and Didi.</p><p>As usual, Didi Campbell looked pissed off about something. Bryce loped over and said hello, then returned to the dugout, as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was up.</p><p>Lucas helped Joe sit; he\u2019d brought a camp chair, which was good, because the bleachers were uncomfortable. Joe didn\u2019t look so good; his skin was dark and he was moving slowly. The evening was cool; Lucas had brought a blanket, too, and tucked it around his uncle, then sat next to him on the bleachers and said something, making Joe laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was an awfully good nephew.</p><p>Her heart wobbled dangerously.</p><p>He glanced up, and Colleen looked away fast.</p><p>Savannah was coming up to bat. She wiped her eyes with the back of her arm. \u201cTime!\u201d Colleen called, and ran over to her sister. \u201cHoney?\u201d she whispered, kneeling down. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Savannah\u2019s pressed her lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s my last at bat, that\u2019s all,\u201d she whispered, and a tear streaked down her chubby little cheek. She glanced toward the dugout, obviously afraid that her tears would be noticed.</p><p>Colleen squeezed her shoulder. \u201cOh, sweetheart. I\u2019ll talk to them. I told you that already. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you can change her mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Who do you think you\u2019re talking to? Does anyone say no to me?\u201d</p><p>Savannah gave a watery smile. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Colleen glanced over at her father; he was standing, looking concerned. She\u2019d take him aside later and force him to let Savannah stay on the team. Cheerleading was fine; in fact, Colleen herself had done a little in middle school. It just wasn\u2019t for Savannah. \u201cNow come on. I want you to knock it out of the park, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Savannah wiped her eyes once more. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone I was crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha. Here, let me pretend to check your eye.\u201d Colleen examined Savannah\u2019s eye solemnly. \u201cIt looks clear to me,\u201d she said in a regular voice.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d the umpire said.</p><p>\u201cShe had something in her eye. We\u2019re all set now. You ready, Yogi?\u201d</p><p>Savannah grinned. \u201cYeah. Thanks, Colleen.\u201d</p> <p>Coll ran back to her spot between second and third. She felt warm, suddenly, and the back of her neck prickled.</p><p>Lucas was watching her, his eyes steady on her, and for a second, it felt as if they were the only two people here.</p><p>\u201cStee-rike!\u201d called old Mr. Holland, their home plate umpire.</p><p>Colleen smacked her fist into her glove and gave Savannah a smile. Big Frankie, the pitcher for Stoakes and a lug-headed jock, wound up and threw again.</p><p>\u201cStee-rike two!\u201d</p><p>Lucas was still watching her.</p><p>He\u2019d always had a way of looking at her that went right into her bone marrow, making her skin thrum and buzz.</p><p>The crack of the bat made her head snap back to the game. Line drive to the gap, Coll could catch it in three paces, but she\u2019d be damned if she was going to. She took two strides and made a dramatic, full-out lunge for the ball, pulling up an inch short and hitting the dirt hard. The ball flew past her and into the outfield, rolling into no-man\u2019s-land.</p> <p>The crowd roared. Savannah rounded first and chugged toward second\u2014hurry, hurry\u2014and Shannon Murphy scored. Colleen picked herself up and watched as Lefty Moore streaked after the rolling ball. People were screaming and yelling as Savannah hit third and kept going, and Colleen\u2019s toes curled\u2014an in-the-park home run, that never happened, let alone to a nine-year-old girl.</p><p>Lefty fired the ball to Colleen. She caught it and threw it home, timing it so the ball hit Evan Whitfield\u2019s glove just a second after Savannah\u2019s foot hit the plate.</p><p>\u201cSafe!\u201d Mr. Holland shouted, and everyone on both sets of bleachers was on their feet, cheering and screaming and whistling. Connor ran out of the dugout and scooped up their sister, giving Colleen a subtle thumbs-up.</p><p>Savannah\u2019s sweet face shone as the entire O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team swarmed her. Con hoisted her up on his shoulders, and the rest of the team\u2014the fabulous Murphy girls, Bryce and Paulie, Ned Vanderbeek, everyone, all high-fived her, cheering and hooting. Con said something, and Savannah turned and tipped her hat to the crowd, getting another roar, and Colleen guessed this was pretty much the best day of her little sister\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cSo close, Colleen,\u201d said Emmaline Neal, the third baseman, with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cQuite a dive,\u201d Robbie Mack added, slapping her on the butt. From the stands, Faith pointed at her and smiled, then continued clapping.</p><p>\u201cNice try, Colleen,\u201d Jeremy called from first. She held out her hands in the \u201cwhatcha gonna do\u201d gesture and grinned.</p><p>So, sure. She\u2019d thrown the play. She was a good player, and Savannah\u2019s hit had been catchable, especially by the town\u2019s best shortstop. But it was worth it, and her teammates knew it. Just about everyone knew it except Savannah, and Colleen felt a rush of love for her town. No one would ever tell Savannah that she\u2019d been handed that hit.</p><p>Then Dad ran over to home plate, and Savannah wriggled down from Connor and jumped into her father\u2019s arms. \u201cDaddy, Daddy, did you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It was amazing!\u201d he said. \u201cMy little girl hit a homer! I\u2019m so proud of you, baby!\u201d</p><p>Colleen waited for him to glance over at her with that same fond smile she was getting from people on both teams.</p><p>It didn\u2019t come. He only had eyes for Savannah.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s happy bubble deflated a little. She looked away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, batter up,\u201d Mr. Holland said, and Paulie picked up the bat and came to the plate.</p><p>Colleen assumed the position, bending her knees. But she kept looking over at Dad. Savannah was in the dugout, still accepting congratulations from the team, chattering in amazement, her eyes bright, gesturing wildly, completely at home with her peeps. Dad kept looking over at her, beaming and pointing\u2014Who\u2019s my girl?\u2014and accepting some backslaps of his own for having raised such a little prodigy.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>Did he not know? She could\u2019ve had Savannah out easily. Did he not know that she\u2019d deliberately given the little girl a great moment to cherish, especially because his shallow trophy wife was fixated on some stupid idea of what a little girl should be like? Did Dad truly not get it? Did he\u2014</p><p>And then there was a crack, and a thunk, and Colleen was suddenly down on her knees, and holy sphincter, her head! She clapped a hand to the spot that was just yelping in pain and saw the baseball at her feet.</p><p>She\u2019d been hit in the head with a frickin\u2019 ball.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>What would Jeter do? Colleen picked up the ball and tossed it to Robbie, who fired to first. Runner was out.</p><p>And so was she. The dirt rushed up to greet her, and all was quiet.</p><p>BEING CARRIED OFF the field had a certain \u00e9lan to it. A certain horrifying, embarrassing, completely unsexy \u00e9lan.</p><p>Marian Field, the mayor of Manningsport, insisted that she go to the hospital, Jeremy concurred, and the volunteer EMTs, half of whom were at the game, couldn\u2019t have been happier, as they loved pain and misery, especially the accidental kind, since it would give them something to brag about at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s.</p><p>So she was put in a neck brace and on a backboard, which was ridiculous and more uncomfortable than a baseball to the head. And now she was just lying here like that dead porcupine, Ned Vanderbeek holding an ice pack on her head and trying not to laugh.</p><p>Lucas was holding her hand.</p><p>It was a disturbingly wonderful feeling.</p><p>She kept jerking it away. He kept scowling and taking it back.</p><p>\u201cCan we please get this show on the road?\u201d she asked, pulling her hand free for the eighth time. Gurneys. So not her. She tried to get up, and Lucas gently pushed her back down.</p><p>\u201cThe patient is combative,\u201d Ned Vanderbeek said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you combative, little boy. Lean in closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop whining,\u201d Lucas said, taking her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not whining. I\u2019m demanding. And why are you acting all possessive and concerned? I got bumped in the head. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got knocked out cold. Second time this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I also made the play, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re Derek Jeter,\u201d Lucas snapped. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to the hospital. The end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so bossy and alpha male. I think I\u2019m having an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>Ned choked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s always collapsing around me,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cJust come out with it. You want me to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez! The ego! How do you both fit in the same car?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and the orgasm became a possibility. She scowled, then looked around for help. \u201cJeremy! Please let me go home! I need a drink and my dog. Where is he, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Connor appeared in her line of vision. He scowled at Lucas but didn\u2019t punch him and looked down at her. \u201cNice play, Collie Dog Face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, someone appreciates me. Do you know where Rufus is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Her dog\u2019s shaggy head appeared, and he began licking her maniacally. She scratched his ears with her free hand. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? It\u2019s you, Rufus-Doofus! You\u2019re the good boy! Yes, you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that was kind of fun. You went down like a side of beef,\u201d Connor said, because despite the fact that he was an adult, what was better than having your twin sister get hurt?</p><p>\u201cLaugh it up,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cIt will never top the time you sliced open your scrotum when we were six.\u201d Connor, Lucas and Ned winced in unison. Good.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Connor said. \u201cI hear the ice cream truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a Mr. Nutty.\u201d</p><p>And now Paulie was here, her face scrunched in concern. \u201cColl, I am so sorry! Really! You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Nice hit, by the way. Next time, I\u2019ll try to catch it with my glove instead of my head.\u201d She pried free of Lucas\u2019s grip once more and patted Paulie\u2019s muscular forearm. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bud, can you hold this?\u201d Ned asked, handing the ice pack to Lucas. \u201cI see a girl I like. Sarah! Hey! How you doing?\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled down at her and put the ice pack back on her forehead, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou look cute,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her special places crooned. \u201cYou\u2019re a pervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys make the best couple,\u201d Paulie sighed with gusto. \u201cTotally romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, Paulie.\u201d Colleen closed her eyes.</p><p>It was. Lucas was the first person she saw when she woke up; granted, she\u2019d been out all of five seconds, but his worried face was looking down at her, and she could\u2019ve sworn he called her m\u00eda.</p><p>That nickname was dangerous.</p><p>So what if he was divorced now? He\u2019d be leaving soon, and she\u2019d be smart to remember it. No matter how good he was making her feel.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my child?\u201d Mom pushed through the crowd, the smell of Jean Nat\u00e9 foreshadowing doom and despair. \u201cBaby! You poor thing!\u201d</p><p>Colleen heaved a Catholic sigh. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy precious girl! Oh, Lucas, hello, dear. How nice that you\u2019re tending to Colleen. The new windows look fantastic, by the way.\u201d And back to Colleen. \u201cAre we going soon? I\u2019ll ride with her,\u201d Mom announced with great overtones of martyrdom. \u201cI\u2019m her mother, after all.\u201d</p><p>Her twin was back, eating a Mr. Nutty ice cream cone. \u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRan out of cash,\u201d he said, taking a bite. \u201cHey, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital with your sister. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, do not let her come with me,\u201d Colleen hissed. \u201cI will kill you in your sleep if you let her come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa,\u201d Connor said patiently. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you to go. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going! You\u2019re my daughter. You\u2019re my first priority.\u201d Mom was scanning for Dad, eager to win the Concerned Parent award, not that there was any competition. \u201cOh, and Stan had to leave. Ulcerative colitis, very messy.\u201d Mom groped for her free hand, hitting her in the sore spot on her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hand tightened on hers. Was he about to laugh?</p><p>She yanked both hands free from both irritating people. \u201cGerard,\u201d she said to the big guy, \u201cdon\u2019t I get to pick who comes with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually next of kin, usually. How much is nine times seven?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer IQ is somewhere around room temperature,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cJust for that, you can\u2019t ride in the ambulance, either,\u201d she said. \u201cGerard! Can we please get going?\u201d</p><p>As always, it seemed as if the ambulance corps had to work on their novels or something. Emergency services has been ruined by iPads...she could\u2019ve sworn that Jessica was looking at dresses on ModCloth.com. Jeremy, who\u2019d been great the first few minutes after she\u2019d come to, was now manipulating Carol Robinson\u2019s right arm, earning plenty of giggles and squeals of delight.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s twelve times nine?\u201d Gerard asked.</p> <p>\u201cCan we stop with the math?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI want to get this over with and go home. Oh, hey, Levi. Where\u2019s Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou okay? Want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. Thanks, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hang on, I have to puke. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d Colleen said as Faith bolted, Levi on her heels.</p><p>Gerard patted her leg. \u201cReady to take a ride?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ready for thirty minutes, Gerard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you complaining? Because I can tell Ned to hit a lot of potholes on the way to the E.R.\u201d He checked something on his iPad. \u201cHey, Yanks are up by five. So who\u2019s going with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Mom and Connor said in unison.</p><p>Lucas looked at her. \u201cI am,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Colleen agreed.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>THE CHAIRS IN the waiting room were ridiculously uncomfortable. That, and Connor O\u2019Rourke glaring at him made for a long evening.</p><p>When they got to the emergency room, Colleen sent Lucas to wait, and the nurse glared at him until he obeyed. He didn\u2019t like being away from her, and he didn\u2019t like how quiet she\u2019d gotten in the ambulance. She seemed fine, going through her shtick with Gerard, but there was something else going on, too.</p> <p>Things were getting complicated.</p><p>For a long time, he\u2019d very effectively put aside his feelings for Colleen. From that moment when Ellen had told him she was pregnant, he gave up the right to think about Colleen, and certainly to miss her.</p><p>But those feelings ran under his life like a subterranean river, and every once in a while, something would crumble, undermined by the current. He dreamt of her smiling with those clear, dark gray eyes, that wise, knowing smile, and he\u2019d follow her into an empty room, thinking finally, finally they were together again...and then he\u2019d jerk awake, and hear Ellen\u2019s soft breathing and remember that he had a wife now. He\u2019d taken vows. He couldn\u2019t betray that with memories of someone else.</p><p>But.</p><p>She was always there, that river of dark, fast water.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re working for my mother, and you\u2019re nosing around my sister,\u201d Connor said, speaking at last. They\u2019d been waiting for more than an hour now.</p><p>\u201cHe does beautiful work, Connor,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said mildly. She was reading People magazine. \u201cWhich you would know, if you ever came over. Oh, dear. Justin Bieber broke up with his girlfriend. Sad. Connor, what did you think of Stan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very hairy.\u201d Connor resumed the death stare.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t care. He was here, and he\u2019d be here until he could see that Colleen was okay.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her watching her father, not paying attention to the game, and a prickle of warning went through him. Almost before Paulie hit the ball, he was on his feet, somehow knowing Colleen was about to be hurt, and Jesus, her head stopped that ball cold, and then she was on her knees, and for the love of God, made the damn play. And then she went down as if she were dead.</p><p>Then he was kneeling at her side, and someone yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t move her!\u201d He didn\u2019t; he just put his hand on her back to see if she was breathing, and thank the sweet Christ child, she was. \u201cM\u00eda? Sweetheart?\u201d he said, his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she groaned. \u201cMy head! Why did you hit me, Connor?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy Lyon checked her, and Levi called it in. Her little sister had been crying, and both Gail and Pete O\u2019Rourke hustled her away.</p><p>A concussion was serious business these days. Especially when it happened on town property. When Lucas was a kid, he\u2019d fallen out of the second-story window of Tommy O\u2019Shea\u2019s house and was out cold for ten minutes. His biggest concern was the wrath of Mrs. O\u2019Shea, who\u2019d told the boys to be silent during her soap opera. \u201cGot a pretty good lump,\u201d his father had said when Lucas had gone to the garage to show him. \u201cGet some ice on it.\u201d</p><p>Now, though...9-1-1 and ambulances and doctors. Probably a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you even here?\u201d Connor snapped.</p><p>\u201cBecause he cares, Connor. Back off,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThey may be getting back together, right, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting back together with my sister,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s her first love. And you know how powerful that can be, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave me,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>A tiny Asian girl came into the waiting room. She looked to be about thirteen, but she wore a white doctor\u2019s coat and had a stethoscope around her neck. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Dr. Chu! How\u2019s everyone tonight?\u201d She waited for an answer. \u201cIs everyone here for Colleen O\u2019Rourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI figured. It\u2019s a superslow night. She\u2019s the only one here. I was watching Game of Thrones on my phone before she came in, and I was like, yay, finally! A patient!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her brother, and this is our mom,\u201d Connor said. He didn\u2019t bother to explain Lucas.</p><p>\u201cExcellent! Are you twins? You guys look totally alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re twins, all right,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cConnor weighed eight pounds, three ounces, and Colleen was seven-fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a champ!\u201d Tiny Asian Girl said. She looked at him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the husband,\u201d Connor growled.</p><p>\u201cHer first love,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said.</p><p>\u201cAw! Totally romantic!\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWell, she has a closed head injury, which is a cool way of saying, whoopsy, concussion! Right? We just wanted to observe her for a little while, make sure she didn\u2019t puke or anything. That can be a bad sign. But she\u2019s fine! No emesis\u2014that\u2019s medical speak for puking\u2014and no signs of disorientation. She turned down the CAT scan, which is totally what I would do, too. Why expose yourself to radiation for a bump on the noggin, right?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at the three of them, and, getting no response, looked back at her clipboard. \u201cShe needs someone to watch her tonight and just do a couple checks, wake her up and see how she feels. If you can\u2019t wake her up or if she seems confused, or if she stops breathing, most definitely call 9-1-1, okay? No Motrin or aspirin for forty-eight hours. Just an ice pack. Do you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-three. Almost twenty-four. Graduated early, kind of a prodigy, not to brag. Any other questions about Colleen? She\u2019s totally pretty, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople say she looks like me,\u201d Jeanette said.</p><p>\u201cReally? Okay, yeah! I see it! Great rapport with family, check! Well, I think we\u2019re done here, people, so it\u2019s, like, back to the beheadings for me!\u201d She practically skipped off.</p><p>A nurse wheeled Colleen into the waiting room. \u201cSomeone\u2019s ready to go home,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cAnd guess who it is? I\u2019ll give you a hint. It\u2019s me,\u201d Colleen said, pulling a face.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you tonight,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke announced. Lucas tried not to smile as Colleen flinched.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cUm...Lucas can take me home,\u201d she said, and something moved in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cLucas will take me home, bossy-pants. Right, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said you need someone to stay with you tonight,\u201d Connor stated.</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, she wants him to stay with her,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cSo they can make amends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s staying with me,\u201d Colleen repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cFine! Lucas is staying with me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cFor an hour. Now can I please get going? I want to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>HE DROVE HER to her house and followed her up the stairs to the second floor. There was a note taped to the door.</p><p>We walked Rufus. Sorry about the puking. Call me when you get home. xoxox Faith</p><p>Added in different handwriting was Next time, use your glove. Levi.</p><p>Colleen smiled as she read it.</p><p>\u201cYou have nice friends,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d She unlocked the door and went in, and he followed. A deer walked into the kitchen. Check that. It was her giant dog, who bayed a few times, then aimed straight for his crotch. Lucas wrestled the beast\u2019s head away, which resulted in the dog collapsing as if shot and rolling over on his back.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Lucas murmured. \u201cYou should probably get him neutered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is neutered. Okay, I\u2019m gonna take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, winced and left the room.</p><p>Lucas took a look around. The apartment had high ceilings and tall, narrow windows. The kitchen walls were painted warm yellow, the chairs were red and blue, and it was cheerfully cluttered, pictures on the fridge, a bowl of peaches on the counter, a few catalogs, the dog\u2019s tartan-plaid leash. The living room had a fireplace filled with white birch logs and a nice view of the street. Her furniture was cheerful: a polka-dotted chair and a soft-looking red couch, a coffee table with a small bookshelf underneath.</p><p>Family photos, mostly of her and Connor and Savannah, were everywhere. Here was one of her and her cousins, a whole bunch of them. Colleen at age twelve or so on a sailboat. One of Rufus and Savannah, lying on the floor, the girl using the dog as a giant pillow, reading a book. A bride\u2014Faith\u2014hugging her, both of them laughing.</p><p>That thing moved again in his chest.</p><p>All these years, Colleen had stayed in this little town. She seemed to be friends with everyone\u2014Bryce and Levi and the British guy Tom and just about everyone he remembered from high school. She worked with her twin. Adored her sister, that was clear.</p><p>Colleen was tied to this community in a way that Lucas couldn\u2019t imagine. Sure, he was a Southie, but his time away had made him suspect in the eyes of those who\u2019d stayed. He didn\u2019t belong anymore, and that was fine. He\u2019d left when he was fifteen, after all. When he and Ellen divorced, he\u2019d moved from the Gold Coast neighborhood (and where Lucas had always felt like an impostor) to an apartment building near Irving Park.</p><p>But even though he knew Chicago like the back of his hand, sometimes he got lost driving home. Not because he didn\u2019t remember how to get where he was going, but because he wasn\u2019t sure where he was supposed to be.</p><p>Rufus gave a little moan and stretched out his paws. The dog had to be more than six feet long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The water shut off in the bathroom, and he heard the sound of the curtain moving. \u201cYou hungry, Colleen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, cracking the door a little. \u201cI ate before the game. But I\u2019ll probably lay waste to some Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, even so.\u201d</p><p>She came out a few minutes later, wearing white cotton pajamas and looking like a freakin\u2019 supermodel.</p><p>\u201cFeeling okay?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cA lot better.\u201d She checked her answering machine. \u201cOoh! Sixteen messages, and ten more on my cell. I feel like prom queen.\u201d</p><p>Except she hadn\u2019t gone to her prom.</p><p>The memory flickered across her face, too. Before he could say anything, though, she pressed the button to listen to her fans expressing their concern.</p><p>Her face fell with each message. She checked her phone, too. Then she walked over to her computer, touched a key and scrolled through her emails.</p><p>\u201cWell. I guess I can return those tomorrow,\u201d she said. There was a small note of sadness in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cCome sit down,\u201d he said, taking a seat on her sofa. She did. Didn\u2019t look at him, just curled into herself and stared straight forward.</p><p>He put his arm around her\u2014dangerous, that\u2014but he was helpless not to. Pulled her against him, even though she resisted a little.</p><p>She fit the same as she always had, the feeling old and new at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThat was quite a play you didn\u2019t make today,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean stopping the ball with my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant the one before that.\u201d He kissed her damp hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sister.\u201d</p> <p>He heard her swallow thickly. \u201cDid my father check on me?\u201d she asked in a small voice. \u201cWhile I was out?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hesitated. \u201cHe knew you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, no.\u201d Her breathing hitched. \u201cAh, shit,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of a nine-year-old. My father\u2019s a prick, and I still want him to pat me on the head and tell me I\u2019m a good girl. How stupid is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have this thing for men who reject me.\u201d Her dog came over and put his enormous head in her lap. \u201cExcept you, Rufus.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes with her sleeve, then extricated herself from him and the dog and went over to the phone. Dialed in angry jabs. \u201cHi. This is the other daughter, the one who went to the hospital. Yeah. Whatever. Put Savannah on.\u201d She took a shaky breath, then changed her tone to chipper. \u201cHey, sweetie! No, don\u2019t cry, really. I\u2019m perfectly fine. They don\u2019t let you use your phone in the E.R. No, no. I\u2019m home. Yep. Rufus is taking good care of me. I\u2019m gonna eat ice cream and watch movies. Okay, honey. Hey. You did great tonight. I was so proud of you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou bet. Nighty-night.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and stood there for a second, looking into space. \u201cLucas,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cI can\u2019t fall in love with you again.\u201d</p><p>The words hit him hard. As if sensing that, the dog shifted his giant head to Lucas\u2019s leg and licked his chops.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet, I can\u2019t stay away from you. You\u2019re horribly irresistible. It\u2019s very embarrassing.\u201d She gave a half smile, but her eyes were serious.</p><p>He lifted Rufus\u2019s head from his lap and went to her. \u201cColleen,\u201d he began, and he didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve come out of his mouth then, but his phone rang.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>It rang again, and he pulled it out to silence it.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be Joe.\u201d She took a step back and picked up her own phone and started texting.</p><p>He sighed, took his phone out of his pocket and looked. Ellen. He glanced at Colleen, who was still tapping away at her phone. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lucas. How are you? How\u2019s Uncle Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding his own, more or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She paused. \u201cSo I\u2019m coming to town next week. I think I might have a lead on something for you, divorcewise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any idea on where I might stay?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Colleen. \u201cI\u2019ll email you some places.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou okay to fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure. So okay, I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m coming in. It\u2019ll be good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Thanks for calling.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Looked at Colleen. Her face was neutral.</p><p>\u201cThe wife?\u201d she asked, though it was obvious she knew who it was.</p><p>\u201cThe ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo. Back to what I was saying. Thank you for driving me home. But we shouldn\u2019t...get involved. Even if you\u2019re very gorgeous and so am I and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk, Colleen,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFaith will be here any minute. Pajama party. Girls only, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, you have a life back in Chicago. I have one here. It\u2019s just stupid to get all tangled up. I...I can\u2019t do that. I only have flings. Since you, I haven\u2019t had a real boyfriend. Just flings. And that\u2019s fine. I like it that way. I\u2019m kind of a slut, in fact.\u201d</p><p>He remembered her kissing that other guy, and the long-ago memory still ached, like a bruise that had faded but not quite healed. \u201cI doubt that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, read the bathroom walls, then.\u201d She swallowed, and shifted her gaze to outside the window. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I could have a fling with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u00eda, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I mean, as irresistible as you are, I\u2019d get hurt, you\u2019d leave, I\u2019d hate you again, and I don\u2019t hate you now, and I\u2019d rather not hate you ever again. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and in bounded a golden retriever. \u201cDid someone call a landscape architect and her faithful puppy?\u201d Faith said. She came into the living room, cradling four pints of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s in her arms. \u201cOh. Hey, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d</p><p>She looked back and forth between them. \u201cUm...want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colleen answered. \u201cHe was just leaving.\u201d She turned to Lucas. \u201cThank you very much for staying with me. See you around.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He\u2019d be leaving again. Soon. Whatever he found himself thinking whenever he was around her was just that. Thought. She was being the smart one here, and he should be grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d he said, and with that, he extricated himself from the golden retriever, who was attempting to mount his leg, and left.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cTHIS FOOD ISN\u2019T worth eating,\u201d Joe said, pushing back his plate.</p><p>\u201cGive it a try, unc. It\u2019s not that bad.\u201d He pushed the Cream of Wheat back, and Joe took a spoonful and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill for a Big Mac,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Big Mac would kill you,\u201d Lucas answered.</p><p>\u201cBut what a way to go,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAll that gorgeous sodium.\u201d He grinned, a shadow of the old Joe.</p><p>He was at Lucas\u2019s rented apartment in the old opera house\u2014a nice change of scenery, he\u2019d said. But the climb to the second floor seemed to take the last of his energy. Dialysis was supposed to make him feel better, but better was a relative term when you had cancer on top of kidney failure.</p><p>Joe pulled out his pocket watch. Lucas used to love seeing it when Joe came to Chicago to visit, hearing the story of their ancestor and how he\u2019d fought so bravely at Antietam, how the watch was given to him by the major whose life he\u2019d saved. Being the older son, Joe had inherited it from his father. Too soon, Bryce would have the watch, who hopefully would have a son or daughter to give it to someday, as well.</p><p>\u201cI need you to handle some things,\u201d Joe said now. He frowned. \u201cI called Ellen. Hope that was okay. I couldn\u2019t remember if I talked to you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Well. Didi\u2019s idiot brother is our lawyer, and obviously I can\u2019t trust him.\u201d Joe idly stroked the pocket watch. \u201cI sold an app a couple months ago, and I want Bryce to get it for a nest egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Joe.\u201d Lucas smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was fun. Remember \u2018Rat-Whacker\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is slightly more sophisticated.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cEllen said she\u2019ll check on that for me. But about the funeral...Bryce won\u2019t be up for it, and Didi will do whatever she thinks will win her the most social points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that old stone church. Trinity Lutheran. And for the eulogy, I thought it would be nice if...well. I want Bryce to do it.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Lucas had thought Joe had been about to ask him. But obviously, his son would make more sense. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here are some songs I want played at my wake. None of those drippy hymns, okay?\u201d He handed Lucas a list. U2, the Stones, Pearl Jam, and Lucas had to smile. Unc had great taste in music.</p><p>And now for the harder questions. \u201cHow do you want it to be at the end, Joe?\u201d</p><p>His uncle sighed. \u201cWell, as little pain as possible. I\u2019d like you boys to be there. And I\u2019d like Didi not to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Steph? She\u2019d definitely come if you wanted her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. She\u2019s got the girls. You two will be enough.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I miss?\u201d Joe said, looking out the windows. \u201cSailing. Big Macs and sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have the boat?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. We sold that a while ago. Didi said...well, hell, I have what? A month left? Let\u2019s not waste it by talking about Didi.\u201d He was quiet a moment, listlessly stirring his bland lunch. Then he looked up at Lucas. \u201cYou look just like your dad, you know. Except for the eyes. Those are your mother\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave a half smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember her?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she was the most beautiful woman I ever saw.\u201d He paused a second. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll be seeing both your parents before long.\u201d</p><p>The words made Lucas\u2019s stomach twist. He knew Joe was dying.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean it would hurt less to lose him, the last link to his father, his affable, easygoing uncle who\u2019d only ever been kind.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Stephie doing?\u201d Joe said, changing the subject. \u201cShe coming to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Lucas answered. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to see all four girls, too.\u201d</p><p>Joe laughed. \u201cFantastic. They\u2019re firecrackers, those girls. It\u2019ll be nice to have you all together. You know what? I want to have a picnic, all of us Campbells. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right to ask the Forbes contingent? I feel like they\u2019ve been family these past ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Joe took out his phone and dialed. \u201cHi, Didi. Yeah, sorry, whatever, I\u2019m dying, what can I say?\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cLook, I want to have a picnic. Steph and the girls are coming to... No, I haven\u2019t forgotten. Yeah. Fine. No, I thought just us... Oh. No, I\u2014 Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Hanging up now.\u201d He put the phone down. \u201cShe says it\u2019s too much work, we should just go out for dinner, and if we\u2019re doing a family picnic, her pack of hyenas has to be invited, too. Though she didn\u2019t use that phrase, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. I\u2019m seeing another lawyer about your divorce tomorrow,\u201d Lucas said. This one was someone who specialized in complicated cases. \u201cDidi never deserved you, Uncle Joe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWord, nephew. Word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever ask her for a divorce before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cWhen Bryce was about eight. She said she\u2019d move so far away I\u2019d never see him. We signed a prenup, did you know that? At the time, I was the one who was supposed to make more money. But I signed one, too, and as luck would have it, she became the breadwinner.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd then your dad died, so things got more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Two boys to raise, in other words, instead of just one. So Joe had stayed. For him and for Bryce.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of things, Joe. Don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will, son.\u201d</p><p>At the word son, Lucas had to look down at the table.</p><p>\u201cAh, Lucas. You know what they say,\u201d Joe said, covering Lucas\u2019s hand with his own. \u201cOnly the good die young.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT DAY, the news wasn\u2019t what Lucas had hoped to hear.</p> <p>\u201cI do understand, I really do,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cBut given the time frame, it\u2019s probably not possible. If it were uncontested, that would still be tricky, though I know a judge who might do it, given your uncle\u2019s health. As it is, though, I can\u2019t see it happening.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was in Ithaca to see the attorney, who\u2019d been recommended by an old college friend. New York required a yearlong separation, and Joe didn\u2019t have nearly that much time. The law didn\u2019t make exceptions for a man who just wanted to die without being shackled to his bitchy wife.</p><p>The lawyer frowned. \u201cThink we could prove cruel and inhuman treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Lucas said, thinking of Joe\u2019s dark little room off the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBeing a bitch doesn\u2019t necessarily equal cruel and inhuman,\u201d the lawyer said, reading his mind. \u201cHas she had an affair that you know of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I could help you.\u201d</p><p>So that was that. Too freaking bad, because Lucas wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing the look on Didi\u2019s face when she was handed divorce papers. And the look on Joe\u2019s when he could be free of his pinched, sour wife.</p><p>Well. He\u2019d be free soon enough.</p><p>Lucas walked out to the parking lot. He had to check in on the public safety building; the foundation had been poured, and the framing was well under way. He could also bring Bryce to Jeanette O\u2019Rourke\u2019s house and get him started on some sanding\u2014the bridal store job was only part-time. Hopefully, Bryce could handle that without injury.</p><p>His phone rang. \u201cHey, Joe. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother you, but I was wondering if you could come get me. I\u2019m at dialysis, and Didi\u2019s an hour late. She\u2019s not picking up on her cell or at work.\u201d</p><p>He sounded exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m about an hour away,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cBryce isn\u2019t around?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI called you first. I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no problem. I\u2019ll call him right now and call you back.\u201d Someone would have to help Joe into the house and into bed. A cab wouldn\u2019t cut it, if Manningsport even had cabs.</p><p>He hit Bryce\u2019s number on his contacts list. It went right to voice mail, indicating the phone was off. Called the house phone; the answering machine picked up. \u201cBryce, if you\u2019re there, pick up the phone. It\u2019s Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Lucas rubbed his jaw. He only had one option. A second later, he made the call.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Rourke\u2019s, home of the best damn nachos on the face of the earth,\u201d she sang merrily.</p><p>\u201cColleen, it\u2019s Lucas.\u201d His voice was tense, even to his own ears.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked instantly.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle\u2019s stuck at dialysis, and I can\u2019t reach Bryce. Is he there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry, he\u2019s not. I can go get Joe, though, if that\u2019s what you need.\u201d</p><p>He paused only for a second. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Connor! I have to run out. Have Monica come in and cover for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI\u2019m in Ithaca, but I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drive like a maniac,\u201d she chided. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and her voice was softer. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOME ON, YOGI,\u201d Colleen said to her sister. \u201cWe\u2019re off to be angels of mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Savannah said instantly, sliding out of the booth where she\u2019d been drawing. \u201cWhat\u2019s an angel of mercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s us. My friend is sick, and he needs a ride home from the hospital. And boy, is he gonna be happy to see you. He loves kids. Especially the smart, nice kind.\u201d</p><p>They got into the car, stopped to get Rufus (Joe loved Rufus, and who didn\u2019t?). The dog climbed gently over Savannah in the backseat, making her sister laugh; the kid adored the monster.</p><p>The hospital was fifteen minutes away. Colleen kept up a stream of chatter, but her heart felt tight.</p><p>Poor Joe.</p><p>And poor Lucas. He\u2019d sounded so...worried. Worried and clenched and...and grateful.</p><p>That warm, dark chocolate voice of his should be illegal.</p><p>\u201cStay in the car, Rufus, boy. Come on, Savannah, let\u2019s go find our pal.\u201d</p><p>Colleen didn\u2019t waste any time getting up to Dialysis, and there he was, looking small in the uncomfortable chair in the waiting room. He was sleeping. He must\u2019ve looked a lot like Lucas\u2019s father, because she could see the resemblance to Lucas, the strong jaw and straight nose. Bryce and Lucas could\u2019ve passed for brothers themselves.</p><p>She went over and knelt next to him. \u201cHey there, handsome,\u201d she said softly, winking at Savannah, who looked a little worried. Joe opened his eyes, momentarily confused. \u201cDid someone call an escort service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIt must be my lucky day. And who\u2019s this beautiful girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my sister, Savannah,\u201d she said. \u201cSavannah, meet Smiling Joe Campbell, the nicest guy in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were helping Joe into his front door, Rufus trotting around the house to sniff the good spots. She\u2019d left a message for Bryce, but hadn\u2019t gotten a call back.</p><p>\u201cCan you handle the stairs?\u201d she asked, as Joe had struggled in just from the car.</p><p>\u201cMy room\u2019s off the kitchen,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s old room.</p><p>Colleen peeked in. Not a lot of memories here, as they\u2019d always gone to her house whenever possible (or the backseat of her car, or the no-tell motel in Rutledge). But she\u2019d been in here, of course. And it was still basically a big closet. No window.</p><p>This house was frickin\u2019 huge. Living room, family room, den, sunroom, kitchen, dining room, laundry room, and that was just on the first floor.</p><p>And Joe was in a storage room where his nephew had once been banished.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled on the couch,\u201d she said, taking Joe\u2019s arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a gorgeous breeze today, and this room\u2019s a little stuffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Joe said, his voice weak.</p><p>They helped him into the living room, which was stiff and formal. Chintz fabric everywhere, like a giant Laura Ashley explosion. Savannah thoughtfully got a pillow and a blanket, and Rufus, who was an archangel in disguise, sat next to the couch like a guardian.</p><p>\u201cI always thought it\u2019d be nice to have a dog,\u201d Joe said, petting Rufus. Within seconds, he was asleep.</p><p>\u201cHe sleeps in a closet?\u201d Savannah whispered as they went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHis wife is a big poopyhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should make him a cozy spot,\u201d Savannah offered. \u201cI\u2019m good at that.\u201d</p><p>Colleen paused. \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d she said. \u201cCozy spot commencing.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the sunroom was transformed. A multicolored sign hung over the doorway...Joe\u2019s Cozy Spot, courtesy of Savannah taping five pieces of paper together and discovering a stash of Magic Markers in a kitchen drawer.</p><p>\u201cLooks great,\u201d Paulie said, lying on the hospital bed. She closed her eyes. \u201cVery comfy.\u201d Rufus nudged her shoulder with his nose, hoping to climb on, and Paulie smiled.</p><p>Because yes, the troops had been called in. Colleen needed help moving furniture, and she needed it fast. She was afraid Didi the Poopyhead would come home and have a fit, which Colleen guessed she was entitled to do, being that this was her house and all.</p><p>But it was Joe\u2019s house, too. The man was dying, and it was absolutely ridiculous that he was crammed into that sad, dark little room.</p><p>It\u2019d be nice, too, having Paulie do something nice for Bryce\u2019s father. She\u2019d been here five minutes after Colleen made the call. They\u2019d moved the coffee table and two big comfy chairs into the storage room and brought out the hospital bed. There was still a couch and chair, and the big TV, and best of all, the view of the pretty yard, of trees and sky and birds and whatever wildlife might wander in.</p><p>Much better than four walls.</p><p>Savannah had wandered the house like a little thief, lifting whatever she thought might brighten Joe\u2019s spirits\u2014a picture of him and Bryce from years ago, a Yankees sign from Bryce\u2019s apartment downstairs, some throw pillows from one of the empty bedrooms, a blue glass sun catcher from the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d the girl asked now, coming back in with another framed photo. \u201cIs that Joe?\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked at the picture, her heart snagging. \u201cYep. That\u2019s Joe there, and that looks like his brother. And that\u2019s Bryce, and that\u2019s Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Even in the picture, you could see which brother had toughed it out, and which had an easier life. Lucas\u2019s dad and Joe were practically twins, but Dan Campbell was leaner and rougher-looking. The kind of guy who could handle himself, as the saying went.</p><p>Like father, like son.</p><p>The boys must\u2019ve been about ten in this picture, and they were at a ball game. Bryce and Lucas were all cheeky grins and big eyes. Killer lashes, both of them.</p><p>It was quite uncomfortable, sometimes, how much they looked alike.</p><p>Colleen hadn\u2019t seen many pictures of Lucas as a child. None, now that she thought of it.</p><p>He\u2019d been beautiful. Skinny and absolutely beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Colleen jumped. \u201cHi. You\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry it took so long. There was construction.\u201d His eyes took in their handiwork. \u201cHi, Paulie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resting,\u201d she said amiably from the bed. \u201cHow you doing, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looked down. \u201cHello, little girl who plays great baseball.\u201d</p><p>Savannah grinned. \u201cI\u2019m Savannah. Her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You look a lot alike.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s face lit up, and Colleen felt another healthy chunk of her heart melt.</p><p>\u201cWe did some re-org,\u201d Paulie said, getting off the bed. \u201cYour uncle\u2019s sleeping in the other room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks great,\u201d Lucas said. He looked at Colleen, and there he went again, saying everything without words. \u201cHow was he feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d Joe said, emerging from the living room. \u201cOh, Lord, what have you done? Joe\u2019s Cozy Spot? What on earth? Ladies, thank you! This is beautiful!\u201d He went over to the bed and got on it. \u201cWhat a wonderful cozy spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a comfortable pillow?\u201d Savannah asked, offering the red velvet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a comfortable pillow,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the front door opened, and into the kitchen came Didi and Bryce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, gang,\u201d Bryce said affably. \u201cAre we having a party?\u201d</p><p>Didi\u2019s mouth was disappearing, her eyes narrowed, hands on her hips. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked, looking as though she smelled raw sewage.</p><p>\u201cWe figured Joe could use a change of scenery,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cMom, this is Paulie Petrosinsky,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging, Paulie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Paulie said, her face igniting. \u201cUm, nice to see you, Mrs. Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the Chicken Princess? From TV?\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s face grew even more red, and Colleen made a note to use dishwater in Didi\u2019s drink the next time she came into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. \u201cThe power behind the chicken throne, right, Paulie?\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Campbell, Paulie is chief operating officer of her father\u2019s franchise.\u201d</p><p>Didi wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure why any of you are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you forgot to pick me up, Didi, I had to get a ride from someone,\u201d Joe said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd who gave permission for them to rearrange my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lucas said, and Colleen felt a little thrill at the dark edge in his voice. So Heathcliff. \u201cJoe deserves better than the storage room.\u201d He looked at his uncle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t think of it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally great idea,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cDad, we can watch baseball in here, if you fall asleep, you won\u2019t have to schlep off to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone care what I think?\u201d Didi asked, putting on a wounded look. \u201cThis is my house, too! It\u2019s my money that supports us. It\u2019s my hard work...\u201d Her eyes widened with terror, and she staggered back a few steps. \u201cOh, my God! What the hell is that? Help! Bryce, help!\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked around. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dog,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cChill, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet that thing out of here!\u201d Didi commanded. Rufus, sensing fear, felt fear himself and barked back.</p> <p>\u201cStop! Get it out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at him,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring him, and he\u2019s likely to attack when threatened.\u201d Granted, the last thing Rufus had attacked was the bacon she\u2019d left out on her plate last week, but that bacon had been asking for it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Rufus. Don\u2019t mind the scary lady.\u201d</p><p>His tail wagged, sweeping the remote and several doodads from the end table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s destroying everything!\u201d Didi said. Rufus barked again. \u201cGet it out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rufie,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cWanna go for a ride? In the car? You wanna go in the car for a ride?\u201d</p><p>Rufus leaped at the magic words, crashing against Joe\u2019s bed (which only made him smile), jumped onto one of the chairs, barking with joy, then raced through the house to find the door that would lead him to his beloved pastime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside, Collie,\u201d Savannah said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you a cleaning bill,\u201d Didi bit out. \u201cJoe needs quiet. He can\u2019t stay here. Lucas, move all this back to your old room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen and her parents are coming to visit,\u201d Lucas said, and a little jolt of jealousy shot through her. \u201cThey want to see Joe. Can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019d say if he was in that dark little room in the back.\u201d</p><p>Didi paused. The woman had always been an ass-kisser, Colleen recalled. \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a migraine. I\u2019m going to lie down.\u201d</p><p>With that, she tap-tapped across the tiled floor and stomped up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cShe\u2019s under a lot of stress lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course,\u201d Paulie said. She reached out as if to pat his arm, looked at Colleen for approval. Colleen nodded, and the pat was meted out, Paulie drawing in a shaking breath.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Paulie,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cSo, Lucas, is Ellen really coming to visit? That\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>So great, Colleen thought, then chided herself for being petty. \u201cI should get going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so nice seeing you, Joe. See you, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, Paulie, I don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll think of something. Tell your sister she\u2019s my new best girl, okay, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at the gym, Paulie,\u201d Bryce said. Paulie responded with a huge (and adorable) smile. Colleen smiled, too. Her matchmaking skills were working. Again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d Lucas said. He held the door for them, and they went out on the porch. Savannah was throwing a ball to Rufus, then running to catch up to him. They went around back, the dog barking joyfully, and Colleen hoped the sound hurt Didi\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you two make googly eyes at each other,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cSee you around, big man.\u201d She punched Lucas in the shoulder hard enough that he rocked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good people, Paulie,\u201d he said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cMy cousin\u2019s lucky to know you.\u201d</p><p>Well, well, well.</p><p>Paulie\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cShit, Lucas, thanks. That means a lot to me.\u201d She socked him again, gave a watery smile and ran out to her car.</p><p>Savannah was conveniently in the backyard, judging from the sound of Rufus\u2019s barks.</p><p>\u201cWe can probably pass on the googly eyes,\u201d Colleen said, clearing her throat.</p><p>He wrapped her in his arms and hugged her against him, tucking her face against his beautiful, smooth warm neck. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, and her entire side electrified.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling. She tried to pull back, but he just held her tighter.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me tomorrow,\u201d he murmured, his lips so close to her ear. \u201cI promise not to break your heart.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded fast and hard. He smelled so good. Felt so right. Tasted so\u2014 Down, girl, she told herself, resisting the urge to bite his neck. \u201cI can\u2019t tomorrow. It\u2019s the party. The Petrosinsky thing.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, his eyes so dark and liquid and beautiful, those soulful Latin eyes. \u201cThen soon.\u201d</p><p>Rufus came bounding into the front, Savannah right behind, and crashed against them, practically dislocating Colleen\u2019s knee. \u201cOh, my God, are you guys kissing?\u201d her sister asked.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Lucas said, letting her go, and Colleen took a shaky step back. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slay me, Spaniard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do my best.\u201d He smiled, and that just about sealed the deal.</p><p>She was in serious trouble.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>COLLEEN HAD FELT that Bryce needed to see Paulie on her own turf, where, one hoped, she\u2019d feel more confident and secure.</p><p>The Petrosinsky home looked gorgeous in a French surrealism, circusy kind of way...the chicken statues loomed large and ominously cheerful around a yellow-and-red-striped tent on the lawn, and dozens and dozens of chickens were roasting over a huge barbecue pit. There was a table full of salads and summery foods \u0327 a lemonade stand, a full bar. A band played the grotto\u2014yes, there was a grotto\u2014and the Crooked Lake shimmered in the distance.</p><p>Colleen had picked out a dress for Paulie to wear, part of the \u201cI\u2019m a Girl\u201d campaign, and then done her makeup (subtly, just some mascara and lip gloss to give her strong features a little more femininity) and hair, which was a bit of a challenge. But the dress was really cute\u2014yellow and cheery, a full skirt that swished and swirled and showed off Paulie\u2019s chiseled legs. It seemed to be working; Bryce had ambled up to Paulie right away, and, as instructed, she\u2019d led him off on a tour of the many chicken statues that dotted the grounds, her adopted dogs following joyfully.</p><p>The sound of a rooster cut through the air; right. Ronnie Petrosinsky was having a crowing contest.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t seem to be here yet. Should she be having dinner with him at all? Would they end up in bed? Just the thought made her knees buckle.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that every spot in town seemed to hold some wicked-hot memories. Wicked being the operative word. The first time she\u2019d let Lucas put his hand up her shirt. The first time she\u2019d taken his off. The first time, period, when she\u2019d told him she loved him, and it seemed like his heart might break at those words.</p><p>She sighed, either with longing or frustration or nostalgia or lust or all of the above. Her special parts needed attention. This was a problem.</p><p>She needed a drink. Some wine would be nice.</p><p>\u201cSangria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, just when I\u2019m ready to auction you off to a home for unwed mothers, here you are, redeeming yourself.\u201d She took the glass, glancing around at the other guests.</p><p>\u201cLooking for Lucas?\u201d Connor asked. \u201cBecause you\u2019re stupid and want your heart broken all over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice weather, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColl...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my heart broken, Connor. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from him, in that case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your date, brother mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here. Are you kidding? With you and Mom here? Not to mention Dad and Gail.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, there was Mother Dear, tossing back a white Zinfandel and 7-Up, her signature cocktail. \u201cYou think she drinks that just to punish us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes,\u201d Connor answered.</p><p>Colleen took a sip of the sangria. \u201cSo this mystery woman, Con, she must be dying to meet your beloved twin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on three dates, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment. And you\u2019d better not be sleeping with Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally! So you\u2019re doing it. Good. Is she blonde? I bet she is. She is, isn\u2019t she? Lovely. You know, Con, for a while, I thought you were g*y. Figured you and Jeremy would make a great couple\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll shut up about Lucas if you\u2019ll shut up about everything else.\u201d</p><p>She smiled over the rim of her glass. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t come crying to me when he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m gonna go talk to Mom. It\u2019s come to that.\u201d She walked over to their mother. \u201cHi,\u201d she said with a dutiful kiss.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your father and That Whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Savannah was somewhere, then; Colleen scanned for her sister. Hopefully, she\u2019d be off playing with some other kids; but more likely, she was hiding inside, eating in secret so Gail wouldn\u2019t chastise her, poor kid.</p><p>Stan, Stan the Hairy Man was nowhere in sight. \u201cNo date for you, Mom?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mom said, not taking her eyes off Dad and Gail. \u201cThat Stan was quite unappealing, it turns out. A little too fascinated with his work. All he could talk about was infected bowels and intestinal parasites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that put you off, did it?\u201d</p><p>Her mother still stared at Dad, who was excellent at not seeing his ex-wife. His hand was on Gail\u2019s back, just above the legendary ass.</p><p>Poor Mom.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Colleen,\u201d Mom said slowly, and Colleen braced for bitterness. \u201cI never got over him. I should have, I wanted to, I know he cheated on me and I know he\u2019s completely over me, but I still love him.\u201d</p><p>There was no bitterness. And no false na\u00efvet\u00e9, either, no \u201clapse in judgment\u201d excuse. It was, horribly, just a fact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mommy,\u201d she whispered, squeezing her mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a laughingstock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not! You\u2019re great. They love you at Blue Heron, and you have a lot of friends, and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a laughingstock, a menopausal idiot who didn\u2019t know her husband was cheating and made every excuse in the book for him.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyes were full of tears, which made Colleen\u2019s eyes fill, too, because if there was one thing she couldn\u2019t stand, it was her mother crying. \u201cYou deserve better than Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where is better? I\u2019m ready for better! That hairy colon doctor wasn\u2019t exactly better, asking me about how many times a day I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jeanette, how\u2019s it going?\u201d It was Bryce. He leaned in and kissed her mother. \u201cYou look as gorgeous as always. We\u2019re just bringing out the watermelon.\u201d</p> <p>We seemed to mean Paulie, who held a giant watermelon in each arm. And for some reason, she\u2019d donned a yellow Thneed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d Paulie asked, jerking her chin at Mom.</p><p>\u201cI thought we talked about wardrobe,\u201d Colleen murmured as Bryce continued to flirt with her mother.</p><p>\u201cIt got chilly,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Those watermelons had to weigh fifteen pounds each. \u201cLet him carry one of those and feel manly and stuff,\u201d Colleen suggested in a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cManly, right. I get it. But his hand is really hurt.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Bryce\u2019s hand was still bandaged to boxing-glove proportions. \u201cHe can hold a watermelon, Paulie. Give him a chance to be strong and helpful. Right? Remember? Girl/boy stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna dance with me later on, right, Jeanette?\u201d Bryce was saying. \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable, you know that?\u201d Mom said, much cheered. \u201cOh, there\u2019s Mrs. Johnson, probably gloating about Faith being pregnant. There\u2019s Carol, too. She has eleven grandchildren, Colleen. Eleven.\u201d She leveled the famed Catholic martyr look over her shoulder. Colleen merely raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she said, turning back to the project at hand, \u201chelp Paulie out, okay? What a champ you are, Paulie, but heck, those must be getting heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re fine,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cOh! Wait, I mean yeah, they\u2019re pretty heavy. Really heavy. So heavy. Uh, Bryce maybe you could hold one of my watermelons?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Colleen smiled as Bryce fumbled for a watermelon, Paulie\u2019s face practically bubbling as her blushing took hold. All good, Bryce groping in the general area of Paulie\u2019s chest.</p><p>She left the young lovers and headed inside to look for Savannah. The sound of her father\u2019s fake laugh floated over on the breeze, and Colleen looked in his direction. He saw her...but instead of a smile or a nod, he gave her the drive-by glance, his eyes passing over her but not acknowledging her in any meaningful way.</p><p>Her chest felt hollow.</p><p>When she was little, Colleen had been prone to stomach bugs, and Dad would sit on the edge of her bed and read to her. Mom would get the sympathy pukes if she was too nearby, so it was just Dad and his good smell, his starched shirt and steady voice that marked those nights, making them almost fun, the vomiting aside.</p><p>Dad laughed again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time they\u2019d had a real conversation.</p><p>Swallowing the lump in her throat, she headed inside. The house was quiet; everyone was outside, and who could blame them? It was a beautiful night.</p> <p>She heard a voice. The voice, as it were. Impossibly deep, with that rumble that scraped her special places in a most satisfying and yearnful way.</p><p>Lucas and Savannah were sitting on a curved-back sofa. He was reading to her...The Wind in the Willows, a book Colleen had read over and over as a kid. Lucas had on a pair of glasses; that was new. And hot. He looked sinfully well-educated, like a professorial Lucifer. And she felt like the slutty college girl who was about to offer whatever it took for that B to become an A.</p><p>\u201c\u2018But Mole stood still a moment, held in thought. As one wakened suddenly from a beautiful dream, who struggles to recall it, but can recapture nothing but a dim sense of the beauty in it, the beauty!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lucifer\u2014er, Lucas\u2014was a good reader. Savannah was pressed against his arm, looking at the pictures. She could read to herself, of course. Then again, if Lucas had offered to read Colleen something...anything...the instructions on how to use her three-in-one remote, for example...she\u2019d fall over herself saying yes. Especially if she could cuddle with him on the couch. Naked.</p><p>\u201cHi, Collie!\u201d Savannah said, catching sight of her.</p><p>Colleen jumped guiltily, then feigned surprise. \u201cHey, you two,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWant to see the secret room I found?\u201d Savannah asked, wriggling off the couch.</p><p>\u201cUm, maybe we shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Savannah was already running up the stairs.</p><p>Lucas stood and slipped his glasses into his shirt pocket. \u201cAfter you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she breathed. She went up the stairs, Lucas close behind her. Could he see up her dress? Was she wearing nice underwear? Well, of course she was, she was Colleen Margaret Mary O\u2019Rourke, after all, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cUp here!\u201d Savannah called. There was another staircase, this one not so ornate as the first, going to the third floor.</p><p>At the top of the stairs was a little hallway. \u201cSweetheart, we probably shouldn\u2019t be sneaking around the house,\u201d Colleen began.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. Where\u2019s your sense of adventure, m\u00eda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m a grown-up now,\u201d she said, cocking an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSo? Grown-ups can have a sense of adventure,\u201d Savannah said, opening a door. \u201cLook! You can see everything from up here! We can be like Harriet the Spy.\u201d</p><p>The room\u2019s ceilings slanted down; though it was finished, it was still the attic, and hot and musty in this weather, too. It held a few cardboard boxes; otherwise, nothing except for two small dormered windows.</p><p>But yeah, the view was great. Especially for spying. The picnic guests seemed to be having a blast, and why not? The band was playing, smoke rose up from the chicken pit and Keuka glittered in the distance, white sails sharp against the cobalt water.</p><p>Colleen felt Lucas behind her, and she had to resist the urge to back into him, feel his arms around her, pressing against his\u2014</p><p>You really are trashy, said her brother\u2019s voice in her head.</p><p>She focused on the crowd below. There was Faith, distinguishable by her red hair. Rufus and Faith\u2019s dog were romping joyfully around, making toddlers scream with joy (or terror, maybe). And oh, nice. Bryce was pushing a youngster on a swing\u2014looked like Cole Richards, one of her namesakes. Paulie was there, too, visible thanks to the yellow Thneed. The band started playing in earnest now\u2014\u201cDevil with a Blue Dress On.\u201d Mr. Petrosinsky had spared no expense. Hopefully, it\u2019d pay off for Paulie.</p><p>\u201cIt smells so good down there,\u201d Savannah said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, honey? Want to eat with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, baby!\u201d As if summoned by those words, Gail appeared in the doorway. \u201cThere you are! What are you doing? Spying?\u201d She walked over. High heels, even though it was a picnic.</p><p>\u201cHi, Gail,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cColleen.\u201d She gave Lucas a big, bleached smile. \u201cHi there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d Lucas said. He didn\u2019t offer more.</p><p>\u201cMommy, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d Savannah said, tugging Gail\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease let me get a hamburger. Please? And potato salad? I love potato salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, baby. No bun, though, okay, and maybe a green salad instead of potato. Carbs, remember?\u201d She flashed the teeth at Lucas again. \u201cWe have to watch our figures, especially if we\u2019re going to be cheerleaders!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be cheerleaders, Gail,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI mean, I just don\u2019t see Lucas doing all those flips. I\u2019m past thirty, and you\u2019re what, forty-two now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly, Colleen,\u201d Gail said sharply. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? They\u2019re doing great things with Botox these days. You should check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Savannah said, whining now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull on me, Savvi!\u201d Gail sang, batting the two-inch eyelash extensions that sat like tarantulas on the end of her eyelids. \u201cYou know how it is, Lucas. Kids.\u201d</p><p>She turned, smoothed her dress over her ass and sashayed to the door, swinging her h*ps so violently that Colleen was surprised she didn\u2019t fall over.</p><p>\u201cThanks for reading to me,\u201d Savannah said over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he answered, his voice all rumbly.</p><p>Gail and Savannah left, the door closing behind them.</p><p>It was hot up here. Also, she was here with the Prince of Darkness, which made it hotter still.</p><p>Maybe it was having her mom admit her feelings, seeing her still hung up on the guy who\u2019d left her for someone else. Like mother, like daughter, after all. Falling for Lucas again...hell, she already was. And if she wasn\u2019t careful, soon she\u2019d be just like Mom, drawing hairy na**d men in order to fill up her days.</p><p>Lucas was looking at her, doing the fallen angel thing.</p><p>She took a deep breath, the air close and dry. \u201cThanks for being sweet to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was hiding under the couch when I came in.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s heart pulled. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Eating cookies.\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cGail\u2019s had her on a diet for years already. She has food issues.\u201d</p><p>Lucas made a noncommittal noise.</p><p>\u201cHow could she not? To Gail, everything is about how you look. Savannah\u2019s a little pudgy. Big deal. She\u2019ll outgrow it. I was pudgy when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was. A little. Not really. Fine, I wasn\u2019t. So what? What\u2019s it to you?\u201d</p><p>His mouth pulled up in one corner. \u201cNervous, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>Damn it! That dark, scraping voice. He used to call her from college and talk dirty once in a while, and my! God! The things that voice did to her!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous. I\u2019m just...irritable. I love Savannah, and I don\u2019t want to see her either obese or anorexic or hating the way she looks because she\u2019s got Gail for a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing she has you, then.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him sharply. \u201cAre you being sarcastic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her, saying nothing more, and a breeze drifted through the window, rustling the maple leaves across from them, ruffling his beautiful, thick hair. His eyes always held so much more than what he managed to say.</p><p>Well. That\u2019s what she\u2019d always thought, anyway, and look where that got her. A woman who was the town flirt, who was probably unhealthily attached to her brother and still didn\u2019t trust men, who hadn\u2019t had a real relationship in ten years.</p><p>\u201cWow, look at the time! I\u2019m starving,\u201d she said, reaching for the doorknob. It stuck, so she tugged it, and the damn thing came off in her hand. Huh.</p><p>She tried to put it back, but it was one of those old glass things, and the metal rod was still stuck inside. She shoved it in again, but it fell off immediately. Tried again. Wiggled it. Nothing. \u201cLucas, can you fix this, please?\u201d</p><p>He came over\u2014did he stand this close to everyone? Glanced down at the doorknob in her hand and said, \u201cYou broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. It slipped out. Just put it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s broken, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please just try to fix it, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u00eda. I\u2019ll try, just for you.\u201d</p><p>He knelt on the floor and you know, sigh. He was kneeling at her feet, and if she didn\u2019t knock it off with these thoughts, she was going to slap herself. Hard. Lucas pushed the doorknob onto the, uh, shaft, gave it a shove, then tried to turn it. Once again, the doorknob fell to the floor with a thud. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She banged on the door. \u201cHello? We\u2019re stuck in here. Can you open the door?\u201d</p><p>They waited. Nothing. Lucas smiled, as if she\u2019d just agreed to sign over her soul.</p><p>He stood in one graceful move. \u201cThis gives us a chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we needed to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk to yourself, then! Talk away, Lucas! Jeesh! It\u2019s too hot in here. It\u2019s like one of those Swedish saunas where they kill people. Who can talk?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to believe you were once so good with men, because you are now officially a babbling idiot. She went to the window. Great, plenty of people down there, and a little cooler.</p><p>\u201cHello! Hi! We\u2019re stuck up here! Hello!\u201d Nope. Apparently, the band was too loud\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s Spend the Night Together,\u201d perfect\u2014and not one person looked up. Connor, get your ass up here, she thought, hoping the psychic twin thing would work this time.</p><p>Twilight was falling softly over the party, the sky a beautiful shade of slate blue.</p> <p>\u201cSit, Colleen,\u201d Lucas said. He was already on the floor, his back against the wall, long legs crossed. Jeans. White shirt. That skin, that beautiful olive skin.</p><p>She sighed again and obeyed, crossing her arms grumpily. She sat kitty-corner from him. The better to see you, my dear.</p><p>A faint smile played on his mouth. He had a perfect mouth. Full and perfectly shaped and just a little sulky.</p><p>You really have it bad, Connor\u2019s voice informed her.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the bracelets?\u201d she asked, nodding her chin at the little woven strands around his wrist.</p><p>\u201cTiffany made this one for me. Cara did this one. My nieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Hard to believe those girls would be, what...thirteen? Fourteen?</p><p>Lucas had always been a sweet uncle. And now he wore his nieces\u2019 friendship bracelets, the kind that would have to stay on until you cut them off, which Colleen knew he wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Dangerously appealing.</p><p>\u201cYou seem happier,\u201d she said unexpectedly, and while she honestly wouldn\u2019t have wished him to be miserable, the acknowledgment stabbed her.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAre you still working for your father-in-law?\u201d Hey. Google didn\u2019t exist for nothing.</p> <p>\u201cEx-father-in-law. And yes, though I won\u2019t be doing that much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting your own company?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>She tugged her skirt to cover her knees. \u201cIt just seems like a better fit for you. You\u2019re a loner. Or you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, m\u00eda? Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me m\u00eda, okay? I might think all sorts of deliciously romantic things and start writing your name in my notebook.\u201d She glanced out the window to the leaves of the big maple, which were rustling in the wind. \u201cYes, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNever what?\u201d she asked a bit sharply.</p><p>\u201cNever got married? Never came close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, I\u2019m insulted you never stalked me on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did.\u201d</p><p>And why would he? He had a life, a wife, a different time zone. He lived in the City of Big Shoulders, he was Frank Forbes\u2019s son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered the question,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI thought I came close once. With you. Otherwise, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re happy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Trying to soothe your guilty conscience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I always hoped you were.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. Her cynical heart gave a tug. He always had a way of cutting through her usual shtick with that wretchedly effective weapon\u2014sincerity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bar is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart of the town, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She sure hoped it was. That was kind of the point. \u201cI work at the nursing home a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you there on Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m consulting on a new wing. You were with your grandfather. I didn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>Gramp had been having a bad day. Completely unresponsive, only accepting a sip of water if she held the glass to his lips, like a baby bird.</p><p>The noise from the party floated up to them, laughter and music, in little waves on the summer air.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAnd your marriage? Was it good?\u201d Crap. This talking stuff was very difficult.</p><p>His eyes were so dark. \u201cFor the most part, yes.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit. She was going to have to ask. It was the elephant in the attic, after all. \u201cLucas,\u201d she said, and her voice shook a little, \u201cwhy her and not me? You said you didn\u2019t want to get married so young. Was it who she was? Her family? The money? I won\u2019t judge you. I just want to know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cShe was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The words seemed to suck the hot air out of the attic completely, leaving nothing to feed her lungs.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d always known. She\u2019d asked him that that horrible day, and she still remembered the pause before he said no. For nine months, she waited to hear news of a baby, not proud of it, but waiting and waiting.</p><p>No birth announcement. Back then it had been a relief.</p><p>But now... \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded once and looked at the floor. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>For a few minutes, they didn\u2019t say anything else. Colleen surreptitiously wiped her eyes.</p><p>Lucas was looking at her again, his face somber. \u201cI came to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter you broke up with me. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d</p><p>She already knew why he never followed through.</p><p>\u201cYou were with someone else,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cIt seemed like you were serious about breaking up. I went back home, ran into Ellen a few weeks later, slept with her. One time. And that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you, though. When you came back, I asked if she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want anyone to know, outside of her parents. I didn\u2019t...I didn\u2019t want to hurt you more than I already was. And I had to respect what Ellen wanted.\u201d He paused. \u201cShe miscarried about a month after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He gave her a small smile. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Colleen swallowed.</p><p>Ellen Forbes had gotten pregnant, and Lucas married her. That was completely in keeping with his sense of honor and responsibility...and the fact that he was a family man.</p><p>And she knew without him speaking the words what the loss of that baby must\u2019ve meant to him. Lucas, who would have made the best father. He never would have left Ellen, not after that kind of shared sorrow.</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>He never had said that to her\u2014\u201cI love you.\u201d The thought came unbidden, and it filled her throat with tears. Lucas looked at her, his dark eyes liquid. He reached out and wiped her cheek because it seemed a tear had slipped out.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you get a divorce?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked at the floor, then up at her. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t love her enough,\u201d he said.</p><p>She kissed him then, of course she did, because those words, they broke her heart, sliced it in a sweet, hot cut. The kiss was soft and tender and almost shy, as if she was kissing him for the first time again. His heart had been broken, too, she realized, if not by her, then by that sad, helpless loss. And Lucas had lost so much in life.</p><p>Her hands slid through his hair, that gorgeous, thick, waving hair, and her mouth opened. He dragged her across his lap to hold her, one hand cupping her face. His arms were safe and strong, pulling her against his solid chest, and the kissing changed now, harder and less sweet and more wonderful, because it had always been like this between them, that raw heat that practically lifted her off the ground with its force. All she wanted was this, and she wondered how she\u2019d lasted so long without him, without the hot, red force that made her heart shudder. The scrape of his cheek, the heat of his hands, the way they fit together, made her shake.</p><p>Slow down, slow down, slow down, her brain chanted.</p><p>She pulled back, her breath shaking out of her. His eyes were heavy-lidded, his breath coming hard, and he looked at her the way no other man had ever looked at her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, Spaniard,\u201d she said, and he laughed, that low, smoky sound. She always could make him smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, m\u00eda, what am I going to do with you?\u201d he whispered, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cAgain with the m\u00eda. I\u2019m not yours. I\u2019m a rental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>The words caused a sunburst in her chest. \u201cI\u2019m definitely writing your name in my notebook.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but his eyes held a note of worry. \u201cI\u2019ll be going back to Chicago soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>That dampened the moment a bit. \u201cRight. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t seem to stay away from you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause; her heart counted out the beats.</p><p>\u201cShould I leave you alone, Colleen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He was giving her a chance to back out, or at least, to stall. And yes, she felt as na**d and vulnerable as a newborn kitten. She should ask him about the future. She should go slowly, make sure this time, not jump\u2014</p><p>But last time, she\u2019d had the whole future mapped out. The house, the kids, the plan. Maybe this time, she could just...be.</p><p>His black eyes were half-closed, and he looked more like a Spanish pirate than ever, about to claim his woman.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d she said, and his mouth was on hers again, his hands sliding under her dress to her hips, pulling her closer, his tongue sliding against hers, and this was it. He was the one, and she knew it, no matter how scary it was, how big and deep and easy to get lost in, she was simply, undeniably his.</p><p>The door banged open, and there was Connor. \u201cColl, where have you\u2014 Oh, for the love of God.\u201d</p><p>Colleen hurtled off Lucas\u2019s lap and straightened her skirt.</p><p>\u201cGreat! This is just great,\u201d he said, turning his back. \u201cPaulie and Bryce are missing, and you two are up here, making out.\u201d He gave them a second, then turned back with a disapproving look. \u201cThe Chicken King wants you to help find his little princess, Coll. Mind getting your ass in gear?\u201d</p><p>THERE WAS LOGIC, Lucas thought as he followed the O\u2019Rourke twins downstairs, and there was...this.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense to get involved with Colleen. She wasn\u2019t a quick, sweet summer romance. She was forever. And he\u2019d be leaving in too short a time, back to his life in Chicago, where he\u2019d worked so hard to build something. A life. Friends. A career in which he was respected. He had family there, Steph and the girls, Frank and Grace.</p><p>And Ellen was, arguably, his best friend.</p><p>Colleen was Manningsport. She was the heart of the town, and she wouldn\u2019t leave, and he wouldn\u2019t stay.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt Colleen again; he hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt her ever.</p><p>But they were adults now. They could talk about things better. They could make something work.</p><p>Until Lucas had met Colleen, everything had always been...tainted, somehow. Complicated. His father had been a good man, and yet he\u2019d dealt drugs. Ask the mother of a meth addict how good a man Dan Campbell was. Lucas\u2019s memories of his mother were that she was too sick, too fragile, and he always had to be careful and quiet. Steph...of course he loved Steph, but until the past five or six years, she\u2019d been something of a screwup. Bryce was the good-hearted idiot, and Joe was the uncle who couldn\u2019t quite stand up to Didi. Ellen was the woman he\u2019d made a life with because of their circumstances, and try as he might, he hadn\u2019t made that work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Colleen had been perfect. Pure in the sense that...well, hell, he didn\u2019t know exactly, but that\u2019s what it felt like.</p><p>You didn\u2019t just turn your back on that.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my daughter?\u201d Ronnie Petrosinsky asked. He looked furious, as if Paulie were a fifteen-year-old who\u2019d just slipped off with a college senior. \u201cIs she with that idiot friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Mr. Petrosinsky,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBut they\u2019re both adults.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not adults!\u201d the man yelped. \u201cThat Bryce is a complete loser, and my daughter is a very innocent and protected person, Colleen! I am not a happy man! If Bryce is compromising her, he\u2019s in for a world of hurt. You think the Chicken King becomes king without a lot of bloodshed?\u201d</p><p>Colleen bit her lip, trying unsuccessfully to look contrite (and not laugh, Lucas thought). \u201cNo, no. I respect that, Mr. Petrosinsky. But the little chicks have to leave the nest sometime, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that moment, a door slammed and in came Paulie and Bryce.</p> <p>Paulie\u2019s sweater was on inside out, and her face was pink. Bryce, too, was sweaty, grinning ear to ear. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get killed,\u201d Lucas murmured.</p><p>\u201cDude! Having a good time?\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cPaulina! Where have you been? What have you been doing?\u201d her father barked. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. I was showing Bryce the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can bench-press my weight,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cI mean, she can literally bench-press me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought I\u2019d drop you,\u201d Paulie said, beaming.</p> <p>\u201cYou were lifting weights?\u201d Ronnie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cWell, I was lifting Bryce.\u201d Her face flushed, and she shot Bryce a little smile. Bryce returned it.</p><p>Well, well, well.</p><p>Colleen caught Lucas\u2019s eye and lifted an eyebrow in an unmistakable \u201ctold you\u201d expression. Had to hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Mr. Petrosinsky said. \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Paulie said. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend. Don\u2019t kick him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Paulie,\u201d Bryce said with a warm smile. \u201cYou rock, girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, get out.\u201d Ronnie turned to Paulie. \u201cYou. No more gallivanting with this joker. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d Paulie said, \u201cI\u2019m thirty-one years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with this goofball, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Lucas scrubbed a hand over his face to hide a smile.</p><p>Bryce looked confused. \u201cDude\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ronnie\u2019s head snapped around to glare at Bryce. \u201cI am not a dude. Do I look like a cowboy? Because I\u2019m not. You are forbidden to see my daughter.\u201d He turned to Paulie. \u201cYou want a husband? I\u2019ll find you a husband. Dmitri\u2019s been working for me for years.\u201d He glanced at Bryce. \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of slaughtering. You get my meaning, pal? Paulie, if you want to get married, Dmitri will marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cNo one\u2019s talking marriage, Mr. P. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d He glanced at Paulie. \u201cI have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. Lucas closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Colleen blurted. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cThat chick from the bridal store? The bride? She left her fianc\u00e9, and we\u2019ve been dating. She\u2019s totally hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce...\u201d Lucas sighed.</p><p>Poor Paulie. Her hands went over her mouth, then dropped. She turned stiffly and walked out of the room, but as she reached the stairs, she bolted, her face twisted with crying.</p><p>Damn it, Bryce, Lucas thought. Just once, it\u2019d be nice if you could get it right.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWell, shit. I feel bad now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Ronnie said.</p><p>Lucas turned to Colleen. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me,\u201d she said, gnawing on her thumbnail. \u201cDon\u2019t even start.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a minute. \u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cOkay. If you don\u2019t, beware. I\u2019ll spit in your beer again.\u201d</p><p>Again.</p><p>That was his girl.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S NOT YOUR fault,\u201d Paulie said, tears leaking out of her eyes. \u201cI never had a chance with him. At least we got to hang out a little, though.\u201d She took a shuddering breath and reached for the Chicken King bucket. Rufus, who hated when people cried, gave a moan of sympathy (and chicken-lust) from where he lay with Paulie\u2019s pug and two of her cats.</p><p>\u201cPaulie, I\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d Colleen patted her friend\u2019s calf. \u201cI talked to Gwen, and apparently she fired him his second day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really.\u201d She smiled, then choked a little, then resumed eating. Hey. comfort eating. No judgment from Colleen, that was for sure.</p><p>It was the day after the party; the Chicken King had banned Colleen from his princess\u2019s room the night before, though Colleen had been up until 2:00 a.m. talking to her on the phone. This morning, Mr. Petrosinsky had barely let her in, and Colleen couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cYou want a wing?\u201d Paulie asked thickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Haitian JooJoo Spice, deep fried twice for deliciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d It was nine o\u2019clock in the morning. The chicken did smell good, though. Rufus agreed, licking his scruffy chops. He put his head on Paulie\u2019s shin and gave her his best \u201cthey\u2019re going to gas me in an hour\u201d look. As usual, it worked; Paulie gave him a chunk of chicken, which he inhaled.</p><p>\u201cPaulie...\u201d Colleen paused. \u201cMaybe Bryce isn\u2019t good enough for you. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>Paulie took a tissue and blew her nose so loudly Rufus jumped. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t because he is. He\u2019s funny and smart and nice and generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You\u2019re not just hoping he\u2019s all those things?\u201d She winced as she said it, not wanting to disillusion Paulie. But Bryce had done what he always did\u2014picked up some shallow, attractive woman for sex, rather than see that Paulie was worth ten of them.</p><p>\u201cYou should see him at the animal shelter, Colleen,\u201d Paulie said, wiping her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s so dedicated! I mean, it\u2019s a crap job, literally, and he doesn\u2019t care! He talks to the dogs while he does it, says things like, \u2018You deserve a nice clean place, don\u2019t you, pal?\u2019 And he\u2019s gotten every single animal adopted since he started there. Even that smelly old Boxer with the hip dysplasia who bit everyone. Lorena Iskin took him, and the dog is like a new person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s good at that. He got me Rufus, after all. But maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis problem, Colleen, is that he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s worth anything. When he was a kid, he always had Lucas around, being perfect. Then there\u2019s his mother, basically telling him all he should do is live with her forever and be a mama\u2019s boy. His father was always just the fun dad, never making him stay in college or get a job. That\u2019s why he takes the easy way out. Because no one believes he can do the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Wow. \u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her eyes filled again. \u201cIt\u2019s not just those blue eyes.\u201d She took another wing. \u201cThough they don\u2019t hurt the cause, either.\u201d</p><p>Colleen took a deep breath. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think this bride person is going to last. Let it run its course, and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Paulie tossed the chicken bone in the bucket. \u201cNo. I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t want to keep embarrassing myself. I have some pride. He doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>The words stabbed right through Colleen\u2019s heart. \u201cPaulie, don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a good try,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cAnd I really appreciate your help.\u201d Paulie looked at the bedspread (fuzzy yellow chicks with pink flowers in their beaks, utterly adorable). \u201cSo you and Lucas seem to have something going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything except a past,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it looked to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m about to be stupid and get my heart broken again, if it makes you feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Paulie said, grabbing a piece of chicken rather violently. Rufus and Mrs. Tuggles looked at it with great hope. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Colleen. Do you know what I\u2019d give to have someone come alive when he saw me? I mean, yeah, it would be so amazing if it was Bryce, but anyone! Anyone, Colleen! And you have this beautiful pirate of a man who looks at you like you\u2019re na**d and covered in Krispy Kremes! So what if things didn\u2019t work out the first time? So frigging what?\u201d</p><p>Colleen closed her mouth. \u201cRight,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Paulie gave her a hard shove. \u201cGet out. Go rock that man\u2019s world. You owe it to the rest of us who\u2019d sell body parts for just one kiss from a guy like Lucas. Or Bryce. So just go and stop trying to protect yourself from a little heartbreak, because you know what? Just once, I\u2019d love to be heartbroken because someone loved me and left me, instead of heartbroken because I never got on that train at all.\u201d</p><p>COLLEEN\u2019S THOUGHTS WERE muddled at work. She had the lunchtime shift today, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was mobbed with tourists and locals alike. Rafe was in the kitchen, singing opera, serenading her whenever she came in. She went through the motions, joking with her staff, ruffling the hair of children, asking out-of-towners which vineyards they\u2019d visited, suggesting places to go if the forecast for rain held up.</p><p>Around two, when the crowds had left for the vineyards or sails on the lake or a nap, Colleen was wiping down the bar as the blender screeched, pulverizing more watermelon for the cocktail of the day (watermelon mojitos, terribly delicious). The only customers were a family of Swedes at a booth in the back, Victor Iskin, who came in every afternoon for a little mental health break from his wife, and Prudence and Carl Vanderbeek, who were pretending to be strangers meeting over a game of pool, despite the fact that they\u2019d been married almost twenty-five years.</p><p>The door opened, and in came her father.</p><p>That was a rarity. He usually only came here to pick up Savannah, and then he texted from the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey. Is Connor here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s at the farmer\u2019s market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dad stood there a second.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d she said. \u201cWant something to drink? A menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Colleen, I\u2019m not here for food. I ate already.\u201d</p><p>Yes, of course. He never did come in here, a fact that both relieved and irritated her. \u201cWell, sit down. You\u2019re making me nervous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m divorcing Gail.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The Swedish father came over and handed Colleen the bill. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d the children chorused, beautiful little blonds all. The beautiful mother waved, as well.</p><p>\u201cBye, guys!\u201d Colleen said. \u201cCome again!\u201d</p><p>She waited until they\u2019d left, then turned to her father. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have cooled off between us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, who cares? What about Savannah?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a frosty look. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know? Is she handling it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t told her yet. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe better be, I guess. God forbid her emotional state gets in your way. Do you have a younger mistress on the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, don\u2019t make everything about you, okay? I waited till you and Connor were grown to divorce your mother. I think you\u2019d be over it by now.\u201d He paused. \u201cI wanted you to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that, he turned and left.</p><p>Colleen unclenched her jaw. Note how he didn\u2019t answer the question about a girlfriend, the ass.</p><p>Savannah was going to be wrecked. Colleen pulled out her phone and sent her sister a quick text: Thinking of you, Yogi! How\u2019s your day going? xoxox</p><p>A second later, the answer came. I miss you too! That party was fun! Guess what? I lost three pounds!</p> <p>Colleen closed her eyes. A nine-year-old shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight issues. Can\u2019t wait for Friday, she texted back. Love you!</p><p>The bar phone rang, waking up Victor. \u201cO\u2019Rourke\u2019s, home of the finest watermelon mojitos in the known universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucas.\u201d</p><p>The rush of heat was fast and thrilling. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner tonight?\u201d There were hammers in the background; he must be at her mom\u2019s or the public safety building.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. World\u2019s shortest phone convo, but hey. He never was good at talking in the first place. She was going to sleep with him tonight. Or, more likely, not sleep with him. It was time.</p> <p>Connor came in through the back, his arms laden with whatever he\u2019d picked up at the farmer\u2019s market for today\u2019s special. He took one look at her face and stopped. Scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the brotherly concern. Dad and Gail are getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d her brother said. \u201cPoor Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Dad\u2019s being his prickish self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would today be any different?\u201d He pushed through the swinging doors to the kitchen, where Rafe was wiping down the counters.</p><p>\u201cCiggie break for the beautiful people,\u201d Rafe said, tossing the dishrag into the sink and grabbing his backpack. He zipped out the back door.</p><p>Colleen sat on the stainless steel counter. \u201cGet off,\u201d Connor said. \u201cSome people care about where their food is prepared, unlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once ate a Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup I found on the sidewalk,\u201d she said. \u201cYet here I am, still walking the earth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make you less gross. Come on, off.\u201d He shoved her toward the stool and sprayed down the counter, full of martyrish zeal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Gail, God knows,\u201d Colleen said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see Savannah being better off with them divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you asked Dad why they were splitting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t answer. My money\u2019s on Hot Young Mistress 2.0.\u201d Poor Gail. Her whole identity was being hot young mistress/wife...and even if she wasn\u2019t quite as young as she used to be, she was still a helluva lot younger than Dad.</p><p>Poor Gail. That was a new thought.</p><p>\u201cCon,\u201d she said, \u201cyou ever miss the old Dad?\u201d</p><p>Her brother stopped his anal-retentive cleaning and looked up. \u201cWhat old Dad? He\u2019s always been a prick, Coll.\u201d He gave her shoulder a squeeze as he passed to the sink and began rinsing cilantro.</p><p>\u201cNot always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. He just liked you more, so you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem that simple.\u201d She looked at her brother\u2019s face. He was in the Food Zone, hypnotized by the smells and textures of his work. \u201cWhy did you get all the Zen genes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlso the smart genes, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what your woman tells you? Oh, by the way, I figured out who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne from the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Okay, I\u2019m leaving. Monica and Hannah are both on tonight, and that dopey Annie. Have a good one.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said after a beat.</p><p>\u201cYep. No drinking and driving, no unprotected sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no tuna fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cooking, or is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you cook for us? I can come pick it up just before seven.\u201d</p><p>A jaundiced look. \u201cNo, Colleen. I\u2019m not making you two your pre-sex meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a postsex meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disgust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need you. If you can read, you can cook. You don\u2019t need to go to the CIA.\u201d She stuck out her tongue and smacked him on the back of the head as she left.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I won\u2019t be coming home tonight,\u201d he called. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to hear a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me. Go to her, your ladylove.\u201d She paused in the doorway. \u201cIs it Lorelei? Because I thought Gerard and she would be perfect together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my kitchen. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tuna for anyone!\u201d she called as she left.</p><p>THE PROMISED RAIN started to fall around six.</p><p>The apartment was quiet; Rufus and she had gone for a run earlier, and her dog seemed to be in a coma, out cold in front of the couch. No music because Colleen needed to concentrate. She didn\u2019t spend a lot of time cooking\u2014what was the point of owning a chef-brother if you couldn\u2019t eat for free? But for this night, she wanted to make her man a meal.</p><p>\u201cIf you can read, you can cook,\u201d she repeated aloud, then surveyed the groceries she\u2019d bought. Tonight\u2019s menu was meant to impress, yes. To start, beet, almond and goat cheese salad, followed by braised scallops in a white wine reduction over celery root and potato puree and topped with fresh dill; a roasted carrot and parsnip side dish topped with freshly grated Romano cheese; and vanilla bean cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche pudding topped with fresh raspberries.</p><p>She may have overcommitted.</p><p>Frowning, she checked the recipes she\u2019d pulled up online. Damn. The carrot thing had to cook for three hours. Really? Were carrots worth cooking that long? Honestly, that smacked of hubris, didn\u2019t it? I, the lowly carrot, formerly growing in the dirt, demand three hours in the oven.</p><p>Speaking of vegetables with attitude...the celery root was grotesque and vaguely homoerotic, somehow. The produce guy at the market had to show her where it was. Thirty-one years old, and Colleen had never seen a celery root before, despite having a twin who viewed cooking dinner on the same level as performing open-heart surgery on a child in the middle of a field after a plane crash.</p><p>Ah, well, time to get to work. Because raw seafood made her sick to her stomach, she figured she\u2019d cook the scallops first. Melted the butter (not hard at all!), opened the container and dumped the nasty little creatures in. Speaking of nausea, she hadn\u2019t talked to Faith in eighteen entire hours.</p><p>She found her phone, wandered out on the little balcony and called her pal. Faith and Levi\u2019s house was on the next block, two houses down, so their backyards almost adjoined.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said when Faith answered. \u201cI\u2019m looking at your house. If I get a telescope, I could totally spy on you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good stuff happened an hour ago, the second that man walked through the door,\u201d Faith said, a smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cLe sigh. How\u2019s my godchild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s official, by the way. We told my dad. There were tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You Hollands! Please ask your father to adopt me, since he threw me over for that slutty housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling Mrs. J. you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d She could hear Levi\u2019s voice in the background.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you and Lucas?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you two were missing for an hour at the picnic yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...he\u2019s coming here for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that code for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d There was no probably about it. \u201cAm I being stupid, Faith?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pause concerns me.\u201d She glimpsed Mr. Wong in the yard next door doing tai chi (or swatting a mosquito in slow motion). \u201cI might be stupid. This isn\u2019t a sure thing at all, him and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it ever? I mean, Jeremy and I were a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtenuating circumstances, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then, for a while, I thought Honor and Tom weren\u2019t going to make it, and look at them. Hey, are you bringing Lucas to the wedding next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! So romantic! Levi, don\u2019t you think Colleen should bring Lucas to Honor\u2019s wedding? He does.\u201d</p><p>There was a funny smell out here...someone was burning leaves or trash. \u201cI should probably go,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI have to do stuff. Food stuff. I also have to change into slutty underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p><p>Colleen smiled. \u201cThanks, hon. Talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She turned, froze, then bolted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t leaves that were burning. It was scallops.</p><p>She yanked the frying pan off the burner. The smell was thick, but not quite acrid. More of a tarry, oily smell. \u201cSphincter,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Well, great chefs were innovators, right? She dumped the scallops onto a paper towel, let them cool a bit...crap, the carrots and parsnips needed to get cooking, didn\u2019t they? She grabbed another pot, filled it with water, figuring she\u2019d boil them a bit to soften, then roast them. Not to mention the stupid puree. Whose idea was this whole thing? Would it have been so hard to go to a restaurant?</p><p>She chopped the carrots and parsnips, figuring they\u2019d cook faster that way, and threw them into the pot. Turned back to the scallops. She\u2019d just trim off the burnt bottom edges. But wait, weren\u2019t blackened scallops kind of good?</p><p>Time to call for backup. \u201cHey, Con,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re slammed. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackened scallops\u2014delicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re great. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Perfect! Necessity, the mother of invention.</p><p>Who said cooking was hard?</p><p>AN HOUR LATER, right on time, a knock came at the door.</p><p>Shit. \u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d she yelled. \u201cNot yet, don\u2019t come in! And don\u2019t look through the window, either! I will gouge your eyes out if you do. Sorry! That sounded mean. I didn\u2019t intend it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a nice way to say \u2018gouge your eyes out\u2019?\u201d Lucas asked, his voice full of laughter.</p><p>That voice was foreplay incarnate. She damn well better have the same effect on him, or life was just not fair.</p><p>But first, she had to feed the man. She wasn\u2019t ready to fall into bed (give her an hour). And before they could eat, she had to get rid of the, er, evidence. She resumed flapping the dish towel at the window, trying to dispel the thin veil of smoke layering the kitchen. Who knew roasting beets was so hard? How dare they be hard? It wasn\u2019t like they were the world\u2019s most popular vegetable.</p><p>Rufus wandered into the kitchen, started to snuff at the scallops, then hung his head and slunk away. Perhaps not a good sign.</p><p>It didn\u2019t smell so good in there. She dashed around, grabbing scented candles from various and sundry surfaces throughout the apartment.</p><p>Lucas knocked again. \u201cColleen? Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bugging me! I know you\u2019re here! Just...give me a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Why would you even ask that? It\u2019s fine. Just...I\u2019m changing, that\u2019s all.\u201d And yes, she had to change because at the moment, she was wearing a now-filthy, beet-stained, scallop-stained, everything-stained O\u2019Rourke\u2019s T-shirt with the sweatpants she\u2019d stolen from Connor last month and hemmed by hacking off four inches at the bottom, and it wasn\u2019t as sexy as it sounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The smoke could dissipate on its own. She had to beautify. She yanked off her shirt, tripping over Rufus. \u201cSorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Lucas asked. He may have been laughing.</p><p>\u201cShut up! Just wait for me!\u201d The shirt caught on her hair clip, tugging painfully, and she whacked her knee on the door frame, then staggered into the door so that it slammed into the wall.</p><p>\u201cColleen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming! Just keep your pants on.\u201d</p><p>Seven minutes later, she was slightly sweaty but totally gorgeous, please God. Tight black dress, hair down (if perhaps smelling of charred mollusks), some lip gloss, long silver earrings, barefoot because she\u2019d spilled some boiling water on her foot and her slutty shoes were a bit painful to begin with.</p><p>Oh, crikey. She needed a nap. And possibly the fire department.</p><p>But no, no, Lucas was here. Her one and only love, etc., etc., and yes, she was excited about that. It would\u2019ve been nice if she had time for a shower, but hey. What was a girl to do? She opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, trying for dew-kissed and sultry, and her voice did sound huskier, thanks to the smoke inhalation from earlier. \u201cCome on in.\u201d Rufus began his Serenade of the Visitor. Ah rah! Ah rah! Ah rooroo rah!</p> <p>\u201cIt smells so good in here,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWere you burning feathers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, boy. It\u2019ll be delicious. I had a slight fire. It was nothing. Wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like I\u2019ll need some.\u201d He held out a bouquet of yellow roses.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>They were her favorite. He remembered.</p><p>Le sigh.</p> <p>Lucas surveyed the kitchen. \u201cWow. Look at all this. Did you just make dinner for China?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to eat tonight or not?\u201d she asked. But yeah, okay, she was seeing the kitchen through his eyes. Plates, pots, bowls, spatulas, three frying pans, a Dutch oven, several whisks and three cookie sheets. Oh, and the baseball bat she used because she couldn\u2019t find a rolling pin.</p><p>\u201cHow many people are coming tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re it.\u201d She poured some wine and downed it, then refilled her glass and got him one. \u201cSo. What\u2019s new? Oh, shit, I forgot about those conceited beets! Go in the living room and stay out of my way. Sorry! I meant that in a nice way. Get. Go. Come on, I\u2019m losing the war here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want help, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Just get out. Scratch my dog\u2019s stomach.\u201d</p><p>He left, Rufus following, and Colleen yanked on an oven mitt, grabbed the beets out of the oven (they looked like charcoal briquettes, for the love of God, maybe jacking the heat to five hundred hadn\u2019t been wise). The Pyrex dish slipped from her hands and clattered against the oven door, spilling half the ashen vegetable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d she called. \u201cDo not come in here.\u201d</p> <p>Forty-five minutes later, feeling as if she\u2019d just fought off an army of rabid mountain gorillas, she sat down at the table. \u201cBeet salad with goat cheese and roasted almonds over a bed of arugula,\u201d she said.</p><p>Not that she was hungry, not after seeing all this food for the past eternity. But hey. Maybe she\u2019d feel better after she started eating.</p><p>She tried to cut a beet. It was harder than perhaps it should\u2019ve been. She had sawed off the burnt parts, and they were the requisite color of blood, but they weren\u2019t exactly tender. She kept trying. Nope, nothing. More pressure, perhaps? The knife snapped, her hand thunking down on the table, clattering the dishes.</p><p>Lucas raised an eyebrow\u2014Prince of Darkness, Sardonic Edition\u2014but said nothing.</p><p>Well, how about an almond? Harmless creatures, almonds. Except this one appeared to be petrified. Onto the goat cheese. That, at least, was delicious. A little clot of it fell off her fork and shot right down into her cle**age. Colleen opted to pretend that didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Lucas smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd how was your day, dear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d He tried to cut a beet, failed and took a bite of arugula, chewed, winced and washed it down with a lot of water. Sue her. It wasn\u2019t arugula season, and yes, fine! It was bitter. \u201cHow\u2019s Paulie today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad. Hungry.\u201d She tried another almond. Crikey, the thing was as hard as a pebble. Hopefully her molar hadn\u2019t just cracked. \u201cHow\u2019s Bryce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnemployed once again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard about that.\u201d From the kitchen came a popping sound.</p><p>Damn it! She\u2019d turned up the heat under the scallops to warm them up, as she maybe cooked them a tiny bit early (like, two hours too early). \u201cBack in a flash.\u201d</p><p>Scallops, she learned, could be both leathery, burnt and yet still undercooked. The celery root and potato puree was the consistency of water; perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have boiled the ingredients quite so much, but she\u2019d been trying to speed things up. The carrots and parsnips were okay, if you liked tasteless, rubbery vegetables.</p><p>Ah. Here was one small scallop that was only charred and not raw. She ate it, cringing at the carbon flavor, and heard the unmistakable crunch of sand.</p><p>\u201cThis is delicious,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cMaybe we can go out for cheeseburgers later on.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes in defeat. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a disaster. You\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful. You get an A for effort. Next time, I\u2019ll cook for you instead.\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him through her lashes.</p><p>When the Prince of Darkness was smiling, women everywhere should lock up their special places.</p><p>A hot, electric ripple spread through her, nearly painful, it was so intense.</p><p>Her special places weren\u2019t going to be locked up, nuh-uh.</p><p>\u201cI did have some success with dessert,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s have dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we leave ground zero and eat in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the wine and their glasses, and she took a few candles that were failing to mask the odor of char, and set them on the coffee table. It smelled better in here, at least, and it was cozy and neat, except for the magazine Rufus had apparently eaten and regurgitated at some point when she was wrangling veggies. She sighed and went to the kitchen, returning with the paper towels.</p><p>\u201cLet me do that,\u201d Lucas offered.</p><p>\u201cJust sit there and look pretty.\u201d</p><p>The rain had picked up, and it was such a lovely sound, the patter and tap, the occasional car passing. Rufus crooned at Lucas and splayed himself obscenely.</p><p>Colleen ignored her slutty pet (though she knew the feeling) and went into the kitchen, washed her hands twice in the crowded sink, then got two servings of pudding from the fridge and put the berries on top. Beautiful. At least they\u2019d have this. She might suck as a chef, but she could handle dessert. The necessities in life, that was the theory.</p><p>Carrying the ramekins into the living room, Colleen decided that all was not lost. There was Lucas, sitting on the floor in front of the couch, idly scratching her dog\u2019s belly. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed on the furniture, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good here,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Yes, he was. He\u2019d be even better in her bed.</p><p>She swallowed a bite of pudding, which unfortunately had a raspberry in it. An unchewed raspberry. Some very racy choking ensued.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she wheezed, grabbing a tissue to wipe her streaming eyes. \u201cGood, good. It\u2019s all good. If you can choke, you can breathe.\u201d She choked again, involuntarily. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>He waited until she was breathing more or less normally, then resumed eating the pudding. Which was excellent, thank you very much.</p><p>A flash of lightning lit up the living room, and thunder rumbled in the distance, and shit, Rufus hated thunder. On cue, he bolted upright, knocking Lucas\u2019s pudding onto the floor and racing straight for Colleen\u2019s womb.</p><p>\u201cNo, boy! No! Calm down! It\u2019s okay!\u201d She oophed as he head-butted her abdomen, seeking shelter. \u201cOff, boy. Down.\u201d</p><p>Roooo, he moaned, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Colleen muttered, trying to stand, which was not that easy, not with a hundred and sixty pounds of terrified mammal on her lap. \u201cI have a tranquilizer for him.\u201d</p><p>Ah rooo rooo rooo, her beloved pet moaned.</p><p>\u201cCome here, boy,\u201d Lucas said, standing up. He hauled the dog off her, and she got up and scrambled for the kitchen. For the love of St. Patrick...the mess in here seemed to have grown. It would take weeks to clean up.</p><p>She found Rufus\u2019s meds, took a scoop of peanut butter and went back to the living room. \u201cHere you go, boy. Sleepy time. That\u2019s a good puppy.\u201d</p><p>He licked obediently, his eyes still tragic, and she knelt down and hugged him. \u201cGood puppy. Good boy. Come on, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d She led him into the bedroom, told him to lie down, then stroked his giant head until his pretty eyes closed.</p><p>Doggy all set. God bless the vet who\u2019d prescribed those drugs. They worked fast and wore off fast, just what you needed for a thunderstorm. Alas, her black dress was now covered with rough gray fur, but that was the price of dog ownership. Dry-cleaning bills up the wazoo.</p><p>Lucas had cleaned up the pudding and was sitting back in front of the couch. \u201cCome sit over here,\u201d he said, patting the floor next to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, one sec,\u201d she said, sitting on the floor on her side of the room. Because the truth was, she was starving, and she, at least, had some pudding left. She shoveled a few bites into her mouth (sustenance for the exertion to come, please God) and watched him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shaved today, and a faint smile played in his eyes. His hands\u2014his big, beautiful hands\u2014rested in his lap, and his shirt glowed in the flickering light of the candles.</p><p>It was time. Adrenaline flooded through her arms and legs\u2014and special places.</p><p>And yes, Colleen O\u2019Rourke knew what she was doing in the old boudoir (or living room, whatever). Granted, most of what she knew she\u2019d learned with this man in front of her, but maybe she could show him a thing or two.</p><p>She maneuvered to her hands and knees and started to crawl toward him, like in that hot movie whose title was eluding her right now. Her knee cracked (he probably didn\u2019t notice) and her hair fell into her face (sexy? Or just blinding?). She pushed it back with what she hoped was a come-hither smile (but her knee kind of hurt, actually), lost her balance and sort of tilted (just a little, maybe not noticeable?) jostling the coffee table.</p><p>And because this night had been against her from the start, two of her lemon-scented candles (which cost seventeen dollars apiece), fell, and there was a small flare of light (because she\u2019d just started a fire).</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d she yelped. \u201cThis is so unfair!\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed a throw pillow and smothered the flames. The pretty blue throw pillow that Rufus liked best, the one with the ruffles on it. Ruffles which were now melting, adding to that dee-licious burnt smell her apartment seemed to be sporting. She dumped her wine on top of the pillow, and there was a hiss, some foul-smelling smoke, that was that.</p><p>Lucas checked under the pillow. \u201cFire\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. At least we won\u2019t be dying tonight. Something to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>He checked the melted pillow, then looked at her.</p><p>Time to admit defeat. She sighed, sitting back on her heels. \u201cI usually do better than this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear what you usually do,\u201d he answered. Then he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her, and oh, his mouth, and the sound of the rain, and the memory of them together, the way they fit, the softness of his mouth and the scrape of five-o\u2019clock shadow, the good clean smell of him.</p><p>He pulled her closer, his hands going into her hair, tugging gently so her neck was exposed for his kiss, the soft scrape of his teeth in the sweet spot just above her collarbone, and she shuddered with the feeling. Her hands were under his shirt, clever hands, and his skin was hot and smooth and velvet. Colleen seemed to have forgotten how to breathe, because shallow little gasps were coming out of her, and she kissed him, hard, urgently, wrapping her arms around him and pressing against him until he lowered her to the floor, shoving the melted pillow aside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And my God, how it felt to have him on top of her, at last, again, finally. He was so hard and solid and incredible that her whole body was just one aching, throbbing pulse, and finally, finally, they were together again, Lucas and Colleen, the way it was meant to be.</p><p>He stood up and pulled her to her feet and led her to the bedroom. Thunder rumbled and shook the house, and Rufus snored gently from his bed.</p><p>And then, all of a sudden, Colleen was nervous.</p><p>Even though she\u2019d been with him so many times in the past, even though she was far from inexperienced with men, even so. This wasn\u2019t men. This wasn\u2019t some guy.</p> <p>This was the only man who\u2019d ever meant anything to her.</p><p>He sat on her bed and looked at her, his Spanish eyes black and unfathomable in the dim light of the fading day. Turned her hand over and kissed the soft side of her wrist, and looked at her again, his thumb sliding over the spot he\u2019d just kissed, and suddenly, Colleen realized her eyes were full of tears.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispered, and he stood again and kissed her softly, softly, then wiped her tears away and kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cOh, m\u00eda,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>Then he unzipped her dress and pushed it off her shoulders, the fabric skimming against her skin to the floor. His hands were callused and warm and thorough, skimming her skin, unhooking her bra and sliding it off. His mouth lingered on her neck, her shoulders, and her blood felt slow and heavy and sweet.</p> <p>This was love. This was what had been missing all the other times, when she tried to find what she and Lucas had.</p><p>No wonder nothing had worked. No one else was him.</p><p>She opened her eyes, realizing that he was waiting. Then he smiled, just a little, and that smile blossomed in her heart in a warm, heavy wave. She sank down on the mattress and pulled him down with her, her hands going to his belt.</p><p>\u201cVanquish me, Spaniard,\u201d she whispered, then bit his earlobe, and the sound of his laugh was like the sound of thunder, reverberating in her heart.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>AROUND MIDNIGHT, LUCAS woke up. The rain had stopped, and a cool breeze fluttered the curtains. From the dim glow of the streetlight, he saw that Colleen was sound asleep on her stomach, mouth slightly open, possibly drooling, her lashes smudged on her cheeks, hair matted and tangled. Utterly beautiful, in other words.</p> <p>Ten years ago, he\u2019d married another woman. Shattered Colleen\u2019s heart and walked away, leaving the shards scattered behind him.</p><p>And yet here he was, staring at her. He pushed her hair back from her face. She groaned a little and swatted his hand, then rolled over, presenting him with her shoulders and more matted hair.</p><p>She smelled like lemons, despite her foray into arson this night. He leaned his forehead against her neck and just breathed her in. Kissed her shoulder once. Then again. Then a third time.</p><p>This got a little sigh.</p><p>Her dog\u2019s tail started thumping on the floor.</p><p>He put his arm around her. Her breast fit into his hand perfectly, soft and plump and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey, creepy man, stop fondling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do, m\u00eda. You were meant to be fondled.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled over and before she even opened her eyes, she was kissing him, wrapping herself around him, pulling him against her, his generous, beautiful, smiling Colleen, and he didn\u2019t waste time, just pushed her on her back made her laughter turn into a gasp, and then a sigh, and then his name on her lips.</p><p>And when she was once again smiling at him, her cheeks flushed and her skin glowing, he said, \u201cGet dressed, hotshot. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>With Rufus draped over the entire backseat of the truck, they headed to the nearest Chicken King, which was open until 2:00 a.m., and ordered a bucket of Texas Cowboy Big \u2019n\u2019 Hearty Extra Spicy (\u201cmade with real lard!\u201d) from the beleaguered teen behind the counter. Colleen directed him to a spot way up on top of a hill, in a field where tree frogs sang from the nearby woods and an impossible number of fireflies winked and flitted.</p><p>He grabbed one of the drop clothes he kept in the back of the truck, as well as the blanket he\u2019d grabbed from her apartment, and set up a picnic, shooing Rufus away from the food.</p><p>They ate and watched the fireflies, the sliver moon giving just enough light. From somewhere not too far away, an owl called and was answered. There was a sweet smell to the air, and the chicken was fantastic, if taking years off their lives.</p><p>It was one of those perfect moments in life, like the time before his mother got sick, when the family had gone to the lake and he\u2019d swum underwater for the first time, surfacing to hear Stephanie cheering and his parents clapping. The time he\u2019d hit a grand slam his freshman year of high school off the opposing team\u2019s best pitcher, one of the few games his father had been able to make. The first time he kissed Colleen, and known what he\u2019d been trying not to know\u2014that she was The One.</p><p>The One smiled at him now, and took another bite of the life-threatening chicken, then wiped her hands on one of the many wipes supplied by the Chicken King. Lucas lay down with his head in her lap, her hand idly stroking his hair, and it was like it had been back then, when she was the only thing he had that was real and unconditional and his.</p><p>She\u2019d have to come back with him to Chicago. She just would. She could be happy there. She\u2019d have to be.</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about constellations, Spaniard?\u201d she asked, looking up into the sky.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d She smiled, then lay down next to him. The dog cantered over and flopped down next to her, putting his head on her hip. \u201cSo about...this. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. About that.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cLet\u2019s not overthink it this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to read too much into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just have now. Because this is pretty damn perfect, and I don\u2019t want to ruin things by making plans.\u201d</p><p>He propped himself up on an elbow to see her face. She looked serious, but not unhappy.</p><p>She reached up and touched his lips, traced them, and a little smile came to her own. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love you, Spaniard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m smarter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, seize the day. Or the woman. Live for today. Look both ways crossing the street. Don\u2019t use your teeth as tools.\u201d Her hand went to his hair, tugging a strand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin whatever we have together by looking too far down the road. I know why you\u2019re here, and I know you\u2019re not going to stay, and I don\u2019t want to think about that right now.\u201d She looked away and scratched her dog\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cColleen, you could always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Don\u2019t you know I\u2019m the queen of flings? Enjoy me.\u201d</p><p>His smile dropped. \u201cThis is not a fling,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cBe careful what you say to me, Lucas,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a fling,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen. This. Is not. A fling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re a bully, you know.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her then, softly, and tasted her, and she opened her mouth to him, her hands fisting in his hair.</p><p>\u201cIf you break my heart, I will sic this vicious dog on you,\u201d she said against his mouth. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll sic Connor on what\u2019s left of you, and then I\u2019ll bring your remains to the Chicken King, and he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever stop talking?\u201d he asked, and gave her mouth something better to do, and they kissed, and kissed, and kissed more, tongues and teeth, lips and whispers, and yes, a smile or two as well, and he slid his hand under her shirt, feeling the soft skin of her breast, relishing the quick intake of breath.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stayed out all night with a girl for a long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow about with a boy?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot with a boy, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember the time we went out on my father\u2019s boat and fell asleep and woke up in Urbana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember your black bra,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one with the little pink flower in the front.\u201d He undid the button of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cAnd the time in Chicago, when we watched the fireworks. We stayed out all night then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember the fireworks. I do remember you doing something you\u2019d never done before that night.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cDo you? I have no recollection of that event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you remember. It involved you, me, your mouth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine, I remember. And I might be tempted to relive it if you\u2019re a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good. I thought I proved that. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man. The ego on you is\u2014 Oh. Okay.\u201d She finally stopped talking as he slid his hand into her jeans.</p><p>Lucas turned his head and looked at the dog. \u201cGo away,\u201d he said, and Rufus gave him a wounded look and heaved himself up.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt his feelings,\u201d Colleen whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t get you naked, right now, I might not.\u201d</p><p>She tugged his shirt off over his head. \u201cThen shut up and put up, Spaniard.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd stop laughing or someone\u2019s gonna hear us. This is public property, you know. We could get arrested for lewd acts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it our best shot,\u201d he said, pulling off her jeans.</p><p>A good while later, after he\u2019d worshipped her sufficiently, when she was trembling and weak and her eyes were closed, Lucas felt her breathing slow, felt her grow heavier against him and covered her with the blanket. The stars burned and blazed overhead, the night was soft and dark, and at this moment, he couldn\u2019t think of a single thing he wanted that he didn\u2019t have right here.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>WHEN COLLEEN GOT into her car later that week, she was humming. Because yes, life was good. Life was actually kind of perfect, in fact. Rufus seemed to agree; he put his cement-block head on her shoulder to better see where they were heading.</p><p>Happiness. Bliss, maybe. She\u2019d forgotten what it was like to be with a man who really...knew her. In the years she and Lucas had been apart, her dealings with men had been frivolous, by and large. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t wanted to meet someone; she had. It was just that she could tell within about ten seconds if there was real potential.</p><p>There never had been, and she\u2019d made sure that on those rare occasions when flirting progressed to actual physical contact, it wasn\u2019t with someone who was going to get hurt. She\u2019d left the hometown crowd alone, in other words. God forbid she\u2019d had a thing with Levi, for example; she saw him almost every day, and now the guy was married to her best friend. Tom Barlow had been extremely appealing, but within seconds, she could see that he was (a) in need of a friendly bartender buddy, and (b) not really emotionally available...unless your name was Honor Holland, which Colleen\u2019s was not.</p><p>And so, Greg the waiter from Hugo\u2019s last summer and his type. A fling. And flings, Colleen now admitted, hadn\u2019t been worth the effort, really. Because there was sex, and then there was Lucas.</p><p>Lucas, who took his time. Whose smile alone could weaken her knees and get the special places purring. Whose hands were strong, whose body was warm and solid and\u2014</p><p>\u201cSphincter!\u201d she yelped, jerking the wheel of her car. \u201cSorry, Rufie.\u201d</p><p>The street was mobbed with cars. Was there a funeral or something? A wedding? Bar mitzvah? How did she not know, she who knew everything?</p><p>Oh, man. Her mother\u2019s driveway was full, and Lucas\u2019s truck was boxed in. Rufus gave a joyful bark\u2014Grandma, always good for some bacon\u2014and cantered into the backyard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sure enough, Team Menopause was in full force in the backyard, and indeed, their number had multiplied. Mom, Mrs. Johnson, Carol Robinson, Laura Boothby, Cathy and Louise. Guess those two being lesbians didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t appreciate some good-looking men. Faith was here, as well.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be ogling your hot husband?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way over. Traffic control,\u201d Faith answered. \u201cI\u2019m supposedly picking up Mrs. Johnson so we can all have dinner, but she\u2019s not going anywhere, she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till I have to,\u201d Mrs. J. said, jerking her drink away from Rufus\u2019s enormous and thieving tongue.</p> <p>Bryce Campbell was pouring a day-glow lime-green liquid from a pitcher. Shirtless. Louise was tipping him. \u201cHey, Coll!\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHas Chippendales relocated?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a prude,\u201d her mom said. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucas\u2019s last day.\u201d Mom gestured with her plastic cup to the roof.</p><p>There he was, in full blue-collar glory. And though he\u2019d made her quite happy\u2014multiply happy\u2014just last night, Colleen felt her entire female anatomy squeeze and swell and blossom and bark.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God, that voice,\u201d Carol said. \u201cLucas, say my name. Say, \u2018Carol, you\u2019re still a fine-looking woman.\u2019 Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had Jeremy Lyon for that sort of thing,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Colleen,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI have to get my jollies somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, you\u2019re still a fine-looking woman,\u201d Lucas said with a pirate grin. Carol squealed, giggled merrily, then held up her empty glass for Bryce to refill. He obliged, winking at Colleen.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colleen,\u201d Carol said, \u201cI have a house for you to look at. This one might actually be perfect, and it\u2019s not even listed yet. I thought I\u2019d give you first dibs.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the words gave Colleen a twinge. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d she asked, sneaking a look at Lucas. He was kneeling on the roof, doing something at the base of the chimney.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s on Ivy Lane. The Lowensteins\u2019 place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that house is very charming!\u201d Mrs. Johnson exclaimed. \u201cThe roses, the hydrangeas, the little sunroom in the back!\u201d</p><p>Colleen knew the house, a little fairy cottage made of stone. It did indeed have a beautiful garden, and a shady front yard. And a brook in the back. \u201cThanks, Carol. I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should do it, Jeanette,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of boos and protests went up from Team Menopause. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even take off your shirt,\u201d Carol complained.</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, being objectified like this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBoo-hoo-hoo,\u201d Colleen called. \u201cJust do it, Spaniard.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, sighed, obeyed. Got a hearty round of applause. \u201cTen,\u201d Mom called.</p> <p>\u201cTen,\u201d Carol and Mrs. J. echoed.</p><p>\u201cNine and a half,\u201d Colleen said. Didn\u2019t want him to get cocky.</p><p>\u201cJeanette, do you have a license for this?\u201d Levi Cooper approached, shaking his head. \u201cLadies, I\u2019m disappointed in all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt, Levi,\u201d Carol said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate, Carol,\u201d he said, his eyes resting on Faith. \u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Jeanette sighed. \u201cMrs. Johnson, you\u2019re so lucky to have a grandchild on the way.\u201d She gave Colleen a pointed look, then turned her eyes to Lucas. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t object if you knocked up my daughter, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone\u2019s cut off,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cLevi, do a quick sobriety check, will you, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Bryce approached her, pulling on his shirt. \u201cColl, got a minute?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, bud.\u201d They went a few yards away from the ladies (though not before Laura Boothby had tucked a ten into his pocket). \u201cSo, uh, the whole Paulie thing. I feel really bad about that.\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cYeah. She likes you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why she adopted all those animals,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile. \u201cNot lot of people really like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Everyone likes you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, I guess. Just...you know. Not when they get to know me and find out I\u2019m just...good-looking and stupid. No one ever gives me a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce! You\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Did you ever give me a second thought?\u201d</p><p>He had a point.</p><p>\u201cI got fired from the wedding dress place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bride went back to her husband. Fianc\u00e9. Whatever. She wasn\u2019t really that fun, turns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Bryce, Paulie really does like you. Not just because you\u2019re beautiful. And she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she does now, I bet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, I just wondered how she\u2019s doing. I called her the other day and said I hoped we were still friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>Bryce fiddled with a button on his shirt. \u201cShe said I had some growing up to do. But she was really nice about it, too. She didn\u2019t lecture me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she has a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWell. I should go. See you, Colleen.\u201d He walked away, and Colleen couldn\u2019t help feeling a little sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cSo, hotshot.\u201d</p><p>She looked behind her, and there stood Lucas. \u201cSpaniard.\u201d The slow curl of warmth unfurled in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou busy later?\u201d he said, pulling on his shirt. Pity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always busy,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come over when you\u2019re not? Set my apartment on fire this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a metaphor for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yes.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her, gave her a quick, hard kiss, copped a feel and went off, smiling over his shoulder.</p><p>Le sigh.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, when Team Menopause had been wrangled out (and Levi had ticketed Carol for parking in front of a hydrant), Mom gave Rufus his third piece of bacon, put her hands on her h*ps and gave Colleen a look. \u201cSo? Are you staying or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. That\u2019s so sweet, Mom. Why? You have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes.\u201d Rufus stole a fourth bacon strip, then licked Mom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cStrip clubs with Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStan, Stan the Hairy Man getting a second chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s over. He sent me a picture of his junk, and if you thought his back was hairy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stop. Please. I beg you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her mother looked at her watch. \u201cI do have a date, and you must have plans with that Lucas. Are you getting married, you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a purely physical relationship right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mom raised an eyebrow. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Colleen shrugged, looking away. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mom. I\u2019m not looking too far down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarpe diem and all that?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Don\u2019t eat tuna.\u201d</p><p>Mom gave a faint smile. \u201cWell, off with you. Time to go. Get out. Bye, honey. Don\u2019t forget your dog.\u201d She walked Colleen to the front door. \u201cYou never come over anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel welcome when you\u2019re about to hurl me down your front steps\u2014\u201d The doorbell rang. \u201cCould this be the mystery man?\u201d Colleen exclaimed. She opened the front door. \u201cHi, I\u2019m the daughter.\u201d Her smile froze, then dropped. \u201cBut I guess you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>Her father stood on the stoop, holding a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to end well,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>IT WAS UNEXPECTED, her parents told her. Early days yet. Just testing the waters. But obviously they had a history.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a history!\u201d Colleen snapped. \u201cI am your history!\u201d</p><p>It was so frickin\u2019 weird to have them both in the newly renovated yoga studio/artist garrett/greenroom/whatever the heck Lucas had built. The last time they\u2019d been there all together was when Dad had stonily informed them about the Tail and her pregnancy, Mom sobbing hysterically, Connor white-faced.</p><p>Connor, at least, was at the bar. Lucky bastard.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy about this,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>Colleen eyed him, started to speak, then stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just undo everything, Dad. You have Savannah now. Ten years have passed. And are you and Mom together? Or are you just jealous because she started dating?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Mom, whose expression didn\u2019t betray much. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved your mother.\u201d</p><p>Colleen snorted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved her enough to cheat on her. Loved her enough to make her a laughingstock while you and your disgustingly young wife moved to a bigger house in the same town because you didn\u2019t even have the decency to move ten miles away, enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Colleen, we know where you stand,\u201d Mom said. \u201cI appreciate your concern and understand you have to express your emotions, but maybe you could do this in a more positive and healthy way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop buying those self-help books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found that kickboxing works well.\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cI have to go see Gramp. Your father, Dad, in case you forgot. Come on, Rufus.\u201d</p><p>It would be nice, she thought as she drove to her shift at Rushing Creek, to have a normal family. Like Faith\u2014the three siblings, the perfect father, the lovely stepmother, a niece, a nephew. Instead, she had her whackadoo parents, a stepmother who wore clothes in the style of Child Prostitute and a mute grandfather whose poor body just wouldn\u2019t give out. She had Savannah, at least, and Connor.</p><p>And maybe she had Lucas, too.</p><p>But that was a dangerous thought. For ten years, she\u2019d done pretty well not getting her heart broken, and not breaking anyone\u2019s. And not heartbroken...not ruined...that was a whole lot better than the alternative.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>A FEW NIGHTS later, Colleen twisted her hair up, pulled down a few wisps and put on her Swarovski crystal earrings that Con had given her for their birthday in a rare fit of thoughtful metrosexuality. Tonight, she wore a long red dress (because you know what they say about women in red dresses), high in front and low in back, the fabric falling in a silky rush to her toes. It was a halter top secured at the back of her neck, so hopefully Lucas could give one tug later on, when they were alone, and remove said dress in a hurry. Or a not-hurry. Nice and slow. His mouth could follow the fabric...and hopefully, he hadn\u2019t shaved today, because she quite loved the scrape of his beard against her skin, the contrast of his smooth, full mouth, the hot, wet slide\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou almost ready?\u201d Connor bellowed up the laundry chute, which served as a magical portal between their apartments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ready for twenty minutes,\u201d she lied. \u201cAre you ready? Are we picking up your date? You may as well tell me who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor! I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you more,\u201d he said, grinning up the chute. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her wet towel on his head, closed the chute door. \u201cBye, pal,\u201d she said to Rufus, who was mournfully chewing his plastic bone. \u201cI love you more than Connor. A lot more.\u201d With that, she went downstairs, the heels of her strappilicious sandals tapping away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE BARN AT Blue Heron Vineyard looked incredible this night, the sky a beautiful slate blue, fairy lights in the trees, and the flowers! Hydrangeas everywhere, and ivory roses\u2014Laura Boothby had outdone herself. Candles flickered, and the wine-bottle light sconces glowed, and it was so romantic and beautiful that Colleen found herself getting choked up.</p><p>Good for Honor, going all out for her wedding. She deserved it...all those years of living with her dad, holding down the fort and running the corporate end of Blue Heron Vineyard. Most of the town did business with Honor, who would make a fine president if the mood ever struck, and everyone had a soft spot for Tom, the transplanted Brit who was so devoted to Charlie, the teenager who was his best man. Especially her own self, who had met Tom his first night in town this past winter. Sure enough, Tom gave her a grin and a wave.</p><p>Aha! Connor was talking to Jessica Dunn. \u201cHey, Jess!\u201d Colleen said. \u201cAre you Connor\u2019s mystery woman? If so, we should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace,\u201d Connor muttered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, too, Colleen,\u201d Jess said drily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes, isn\u2019t it? I knew it. Listen. I\u2019ll make a great sister-in-law, you can put that in the plus column to help balance out Connor\u2019s many flaws. And I want you to know I\u2019ve been dropping hints about you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating,\u201d Jess said.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Colleen said. \u201cWell, you have my blessing if you change your mind. Just saying.\u201d</p><p>They took a seat close to the front; Jessica worked at Blue Heron, after all.</p> <p>And so did Mom. All the Blue Heron staff, full-and part-time, had been invited, but Mom \u201chad plans.\u201d And plans probably meant something with Dad. Something icky.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told Connor about their parents in a rare episode of twin secrecy. First of all, he\u2019d be furious. Secondly...well, she kind of hoped this was a flash in the pan. Mom would sort it out and realize Dad was still...still...whatever.</p><p>But of course, Colleen could relate.</p><p>How many people want another chance with their first love?</p><p>Speaking of first loves... She stood on her tiptoes and scanned the crowd.</p><p>\u201cLooking for me?\u201d came that voice. Busted.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m looking for Mr. Holland. I\u2019ve been in love with him since I was eight.\u201d She turned, her breath stopping. \u201cYou look unfairly handsome, Spaniard,\u201d she said, and yes, her voice shook a little.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just let his gaze drift down her body, then back up, his eyes dark as...as...as coffee or something, she wasn\u2019t doing too well in the rational thought department. Suffice it to say, one look from him was reducing her to a puddle.</p><p>He took her hand and kissed it. Soon, Colleen thought, she\u2019d be dead of lust. And what a way to go.</p><p>They took a seat with the other guests. Tom and Charlie stood up at the front with Reverend Fisk and a shorter, older version of Tom who must be his dad, all the way from England.</p><p>Then the music started, Jack Holland walked Mrs. Johnson down the aisle, and the bridesmaids followed\u2014Faith, Pru and Pru\u2019s daughter, all looking beautiful in shades of lavender.</p><p>And then came Honor on her father\u2019s arm, and Colleen glanced at Tom. It was her favorite thing to do, to see the groom\u2019s face when he first saw his bride, and Tom did not disappoint. He looked stunned, then covered his mouth with one hand, and, bless him, welled up. Charlie, his best man, put his arm around Tom\u2019s shoulders and smiled.</p><p>Honor looked amazing, and Colleen felt a little proud of that, having done her makeup earlier that afternoon. She glowed, she really did, smiling at Tom, those nice dimples of hers. She looked so in love that tears came to Colleen\u2019s eyes, too. And her dress was fantastic\u2014an ivory, Regency-style gown, utterly romantic and soft, unstructured, flowing softly to her toes. She wore her mom\u2019s pearls, Honor\u2019s trademark jewelry, and matching earrings, all very subtle and classic and lovely. And hey! She was barefoot, her pink-polished toes peeping out from underneath the dress. Very nice touch, Coll had to admit.</p><p>Then Mr. Holland kissed the bride and shook Tom\u2019s hand, wiped his own eyes and sat down, and the ceremony began.</p> <p>Lucas held her hand throughout, and try as she might, Colleen couldn\u2019t help a few wedding thoughts of her own. Marriage thoughts, even better\u2014the ordinary, wonderful days that she and Lucas could have...maybe in that little stone house Carol had mentioned the other day, waking up late on a Sunday morning, making French toast and drinking coffee on the slate patio. A black-haired baby or three. It would be so wonderful.</p><p>Then Tom kissed his wife and the crowd cheered.</p><p>All night long, Lucas was a perfect date. They didn\u2019t talk about Bryce and Paulie, which was nice, him not pointing out that he\u2019d been right all along. He flirted with her, kept giving her those hot Latin looks. He danced with her (not the paso doble, as Colleen suggested, making him laugh, but he was pretty good nonetheless).</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Joe doing?\u201d she asked as they danced to Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d \u201cI saw him at the hospital the other day.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cNot too well. The cancer\u2019s pretty fast-moving.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew wet. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll get to divorce Didi.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told her about that. Five attorneys had said the same thing. Colleen put her head against his shoulder. Poor Lucas, about to lose someone else. \u201cYou know what you should do?\u201d she said, pulling back to look at him. \u201cThreaten her reputation. She\u2019d hate for anyone to know Joe wanted a divorce, even if he couldn\u2019t get one. Especially Bryce. Maybe she\u2019d do it if you said you\u2019d keep it quiet. She could spin it however she wanted after he...passes away.\u201d</p><p>Those pirate eyes smiled, and a second later, his mouth followed. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, Colleen O\u2019Rourke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that all the time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI bet you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also hear \u2018extremely pretty\u2019 and \u2018quite hot in the sack.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d attest to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about that,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe only thing I want to hear is that you never got over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You can think that if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s say that it is for the sake of your huge Latin ego.\u201d She put her head on his shoulder again. Guilt twinged in her knees, and her smile faded.</p><p>She had slept with other men. Not that many, but if Lucas knew\u2014</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for the best man\u2019s toast,\u201d the DJ said, and any further thoughts were cut off. She was with Lucas at a wedding, and he loved her. She was almost certain. She pushed any other, more complicated thoughts aside.</p><p>They toasted the bride and groom and had cake, and after Connor and she had done the electric slide, and when Emmaline Neal (St. Germain and vodka) had caught the bouquet, Lucas finally turned to her and said, \u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p><p>It was a command...a velvety promise of deliciousness.</p><p>Colleen grabbed her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cWalk Rufus for me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, gross. Listen, Campbell,\u201d Connor growled. \u201cBreak her heart, and I\u2019ll kill you. I mean it. The last time, you just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, thank you for sharing,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBye, Con.\u201d</p><p>They said goodbye to the happy couple and the Hollands, and then went off into the soft, sweet night air. A rumble of thunder came from across the lake, and a flicker of lightning lit the low-bellied clouds. Rain later tonight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that you and Connor are still so close,\u201d Lucas said as they drove down the Hill into town.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. How could we not be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flight from Chicago\u2019s just over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Buffalo-Niagara to O\u2019Hare\u2014how many times had she made that flight?</p><p>But wait a sec. What was he saying?</p><p>They were here, in front of the opera house. Lucas got out, opened her door and smiled. She tried to return it.</p><p>The flight being an hour...as in she could visit? Visit him? Visit Connor?</p><p>Well. They could talk about it inside. Or not. Maybe this was the exact conversation they should avoid.</p><p>They walked up to the second floor, and Lucas turned to her and kissed her, his hand on her neck. \u201cI had a very nice time tonight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYour nice time is about to get better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d He opened the door, stood back. He always had such nice manners. Those parents of his had done a good job.</p><p>She went in, then leaped back in surprise, a little squeak escaping her. Someone was already here.</p><p>Someone blonde. Someone female.</p><p>Someone pregnant.</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Ah, shit. The last thing Lucas wanted was the tension that instantly coiled between the two women, but there it was in the middle of the room, like a snake.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want something to drink?\u201d he asked. Very uncool to have his pregnant ex-wife sitting on his couch. \u201cColleen?\u201d Her face was white.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Ellen stood up. \u201cI already helped myself.\u201d She looked at Colleen. \u201cI\u2019m Ellen Camp\u2014Forbes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe met when you visited Lucas in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014I remember. You\u2019re expecting. I didn\u2019t hear that. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Ellen smiled. \u201cThanks. My fianc\u00e9 and I are really thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Getting married September first, the twins are due in late November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins?\u201d Colleen squeaked. \u201cWow. Mazel tov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She smiled. \u201cLucas, I\u2019m really sorry to be here. There was a screwup at the bed-and-breakfast, and they double-booked my room. The other couple was already there. I called you, but you weren\u2019t picking up. The innkeeper knows the owner of this building, so she let me in when I told her who I was.\u201d She paused. \u201cI thought I could stay in your second bedroom for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Great. Lucas glanced at Colleen, who stood there, silent. Not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, suddenly realizing he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cOf course you can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obviously interrupting your plans. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She smiled again at Colleen.</p><p>Colleen seemed to snap out of her funk. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s...it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll talk to you soon, Lucas. Uh, Ellen, it was nice to see you.\u201d With that, she turned and left. Fast.</p><p>Lucas glanced at his ex-wife. \u201cBe back in a few minutes. I\u2019ll just walk her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I\u2019m really sorry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. These things happen. Make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>By the time he got out on the street, Colleen was halfway across the green. He ran to catch up to her, took her arm. She shook him off.</p><p>\u201cSo your ex is coming to visit. Thanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, slow down. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It is to me. And hey, she\u2019s pregnant. Wow.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to a stop. \u201cM\u00eda, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She made a hissing noise. \u201cNow is not the time for m\u00eda, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She stopped in front of the Civil War monument and sighed the universally recognized men are idiots sigh of the female. \u201cLucas. First of all, the woman you threw me over for is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd second of all, she\u2019s engaged. And pregnant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight. Why is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>Another disgusted look. \u201cSo you only...wanted...\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. She was crying.</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d he breathed. \u201cSweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shut up! Don\u2019t sweet-talk me! How dare you sweet-talk me! So she moved on, she found someone else, she\u2019s having a baby\u2014and even then, did you ever think about me? No! Not until I was directly in your line of vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so far from the truth, it\u2019s almost funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How long have you been divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Officially!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you call me two years and three months ago? Or two years ago? Or a year ago? Or six months ago? Why is it only now, when Joe needed you and Ellen is breeding twins with some other guy, that you even bothered to think of me again?\u201d</p><p>Women. He could really use a decoder ring where they were concerned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t think of you. It was because I didn\u2019t feel like I had any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter, Lucas. You know how many times I\u2019ve seen men sling those smarmy lines? A trillion and six, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, don\u2019t make this into something it\u2019s not. Look. We\u2019re together now, you and I. Aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one with the pregnant woman in my apartment, Lucas!\u201d</p> <p>An older couple was walking their dog and gave him a sharp look. \u201cEverything okay there, Collie?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really, Bob, but thank you!\u201d she called. \u201cHi, Sue. Hi, Muffin.\u201d</p><p>Lucas waited until the couple was inside. \u201cYes, Ellen is in my apartment. Should I ask her to sleep in the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014I\u2014it\u2019s\u2014you know what? Bite me. Go to your ex-wife who\u2019s perfect in every way and not messy or emotional or just a stupid bartender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a stupid bartender. Colleen. Settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why I think you\u2019re with me, Lucas? Because I\u2019m here. You\u2019re here for your uncle, you\u2019re sad, and hey, what\u2019s this, it\u2019s that girl you used to be with, and lookee here! She\u2019s still single! And easy, apparently, because it only took you what? Three weeks to get into my pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour plus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour plus. Wow. I\u2019m a regular chastity belt. All I am is convenient, Lucas. Your wife divorced you and found someone else, and only now are you interested in me. And you\u2019re not even here for me. And I knew that. I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColleen, this is ridiculous.\u201d Poor choice of words, perhaps, because she answered with her middle finger, then turned and stomped away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not convenient,\u201d he called at her retreating back. \u201cYou\u2019re extremely inconvenient, Colleen!\u201d Nothing. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow when you\u2019ve had time to calm down.\u201d</p><p>And again, not the smartest thing to say. This time her gesture was more creative.</p><p>With a sigh, Lucas scrubbed a hand through his hair. This had been a pretty fantastic night until fifteen minutes ago.</p><p>Well. Ellen was indeed back at his apartment, and she was an attorney, and his dying uncle needed an attorney, and Colleen could just...just...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t really believe she was convenient.</p><p>He ran the two blocks to her apartment. There was a light in her window, though the first floor was dark. Hopefully, her brother wasn\u2019t about to come out and beat him up.</p><p>\u201cColleen!\u201d he yelled up at her window.</p><p>No answer, though the giant dog\u2019s head appeared in the window.</p><p>\u201cColleen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, or I\u2019ll call the police!\u201d she barked. \u201cThis is a nice neighborhood.\u201d She yanked up the screen and stuck her head out, then glanced next door. \u201cSorry, Mr. Wong. My idiot boyfriend. Do you have a gun? Just to scare him or maim him slightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Colleen,\u201d the neighbor called. \u201cI\u2019m antigun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity. Sorry for the noise.\u201d She turned back to Lucas. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me, you inconvenient woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am mad. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m about to start power-eating Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>The question brought a smile to her lips, which she quickly smothered. \u201cPeanut Butter Cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Coffee Heath Bar myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go get some and choke on it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSleep tight, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not off the hook just because you\u2019re pulling a Romeo, Spaniard. You\u2019re about to break my heart again. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d She pulled her head in and lowered the screen. \u201cCall me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>BACK AT HIS apartment, Ellen had made herself some scrambled eggs. \u201cEating for two. I plan to milk that every second of this pregnancy, by the way.\u201d She took a bite and smiled. \u201cSorry about ruining your night. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cStill so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk about Colleen with Ellen.</p><p>They had discussed Colleen once before, because to not talk about her, ever, would\u2019ve made it seem like more. Which it was, but what was he supposed to do? He\u2019d wanted their marriage to work, figured he\u2019d burned bridges with Colleen forever and wasn\u2019t going to moon after his high school sweetheart when Ellen had been nothing but open and decent and nice. So he told his wife about Colleen, and said that it was a typical young love situation, very intense until it burned itself out.</p><p>He lied, in other words.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Joe,\u201d she said, taking out her razor-thin laptop. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still getting dialysis,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cHe...he maybe has a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small smile. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve got on the divorce issue.\u201d She paused. \u201cMy dad misses you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave a nod. \u201cThe Cambria\u2019s almost done,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked to the interior designers yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tolerant look. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about at all. He loves you like a son, and nothing will change that. Not even Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll be back in Chicago soon.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the words sounded vaguely...smug.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>SINCE LUCAS WAS busy with his ex-wife, and Uncle Joe, and Bryce, and the public safety building, and making sure his hair was beautiful and wavy and arrogant and whatever else occupied his time, Colleen did what she always did when she was stressed. She cleaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Connor said when he saw her scrubbing the bar with her beloved citrus-scented Clorox Clean-Up. \u201cWhat did he do? Should I kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tempting,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHow\u2019s the lovely Jessica? You sure you two aren\u2019t dating?\u201d</p><p>Connor leaned on the part of the bar she\u2019d already cleaned. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to talk about Lucas and how I told you this wouldn\u2019t end well, and how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, placenta hog. Just because you were born three minutes sooner doesn\u2019t mean you know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because I do. Where you\u2019re concerned, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, guys.\u201d Savannah came into the bar dressed in an ill-fitting, too-short skirt and lacy top, Gail\u2019s credit card at work, no doubt. Her eyes were swollen and pink. \u201cMom said I should stay here because she\u2019s at the lawyer\u2019s.\u201d With that, their little sister burst into sobs.</p><p>When both Connor and Colleen had said soothing things and administered a slab of Rafe\u2019s caramel cheesecake, Colleen took Savannah back to her place. Rufus would make her feel better, or die trying.</p><p>But Colleen remembered what it had felt like to have her family life crumble, and hell, she\u2019d been a lot older than Savannah. Everything would change for her sister\u2014holidays, weekends, home life, maybe even home. Where was Gail even from? Colleen didn\u2019t think it was New York.</p><p>She painted her sister\u2019s nails (Zombie Skin Gray) and let Savannah do her toenails (Flirtini Fuschia). They watched an episode of SpongeBob, and Savannah fell asleep on the couch, Rufus keeping guard.</p><p>Poor kid; she was exhausted from crying. Colleen stroked her sister\u2019s wispy hair, kissed Rufus on the head and went to the kitchen. She\u2019d make peanut butter cookies, Savannah\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Being in the kitchen made her recall her cooking fiasco last week. Lucas had cleaned up the entire kitchen while she was sleeping. Forget the roses he\u2019d brought\u2014that was romantic.</p><p>She wondered what he was doing now.</p><p>When the first batch was done, a knock came on the door. It was her stepmother.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Gail didn\u2019t look so hot. She was dressed in the usual jeans, cut so low you could practically see her cesarean scar, and a cropped, silky shirt. She wore the requisite heels, but there were circles under her eyes. \u201cConnor said she was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s sleeping on the couch. Worn out from crying, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an accusation, Colleen? Because I\u2019ll have you know, I don\u2019t want this divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Come on in. Want a cookie? They\u2019re still warm.\u201d</p><p>Gail gave her a suspicious look, but sat at the table, and Colleen put five cookies on a plate and poured her a glass of milk. \u201cThanks,\u201d Gail muttered.</p><p>Colleen took a breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry for Savannah\u2019s sake that this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not for my sake, of course.\u201d</p><p>Colleen raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo. Not for your sake. Keep in mind that you\u2019re the home-wrecking whore who broke my mother\u2019s heart ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I left my scarlet letter at home.\u201d</p><p>Well. That was surprising\u2014a literary reference from the Tail.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised,\u201d Gail said. \u201cI can read, you know.\u201d She paused, taking a cookie from the plate and breaking it in half. \u201cI think he\u2019s seeing someone else.\u201d</p><p>And of course, Dad was seeing someone else, namely Mom. Though Colleen saw doom painted all over that one, there was certainly some poetic justice at work.</p><p>Gail put half of a cookie in her mouth and chewed. \u201cI know you hate me, Colleen,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I was the other woman. But I love your father. I was very naive ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I think you came out of the womb with a calculator in one hand and a pair of Manolo Blahniks in the other.\u201d</p><p>Gail sighed and ate the other half. \u201cFine. If you want to think of it that way, go ahead. But it hasn\u2019t all been fun, you know. You think I\u2019d choose a guy with two grown kids? You think I wanted to be a slut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho put the gun to your head, Gail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me he was married. Not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That did sound like her father, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cAnd by then, the damage was done. I was in love with him. He said he was in the process of getting a divorce, and I believed him. And then I got pregnant. I know you don\u2019t think so, but I love Savvi. She\u2019s everything to me.\u201d Much to Colleen\u2019s surprise, Gail\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you trying to make her into a Barbie doll?\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cThe diets, Gail! The cheerleading and the horrible clothes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want her to be...\u201d Gail\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cPretty?\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cShe is pretty! It\u2019s not that. I want her to...belong. To be popular and happy and fit in. She\u2019s overweight, Colleen, and you and Connor stuffing her full of nachos and pie and cheeseburgers doesn\u2019t help. It just makes me the bad guy. Do you know the statistics on childhood obesity?\u201d</p><p>Colleen felt a stab of guilt. \u201cShe\u2019s not obese, Gail. She\u2019s chubby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen more pounds and she\u2019s medically obese, according to her doctor,\u201d Gail whispered vehemently. \u201cYou like to think of me as the evil stepmother, and you do it very well, but the truth is, I\u2019m trying to keep my daughter healthy. I broil her fish and make her salads and take her for hikes and walks. We don\u2019t all have your metabolism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t make her into your image, Gail. She\u2019s her own person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that! I\u2019ve taken her to gymnastics and tap and karate, and the only thing she likes is baseball, which isn\u2019t exactly an aerobic sport. Cheerleading would get her moving, at least.\u201d She grabbed another cookie. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s stress-eating. And so am I. These are fantastic.\u201d Gail gave a muffled sob, spewing crumbs, and tears spilled over.</p><p>Colleen handed Gail a napkin and took out the next batch of cookies, moving slowly. Okay, yeah. Savannah was overweight, and maybe a little more than just chubby. And Colleen did like to spoil her with the food she never got at home (and so did Connor). Taking her for a swim now and again might be a better way to spend time with their sister, instead of just movies and popcorn and Milk Duds (though if you couldn\u2019t have Milk Duds once in a while, what was the point of living?).</p><p>Still, she wasn\u2019t used to being wrong. It was an itchy feeling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do to help, Gail?\u201d she asked as Gail polished off the last cookie.</p><p>Gail didn\u2019t look at her, only folded up her napkin into a tiny square. \u201cMaybe you could just...put in a good word about me once in a while. With Savannah. I don\u2019t want her to feel like there are battle lines, the O\u2019Rourkes on one side, and me on the other.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That was exactly how it had always been, after all. Not that Gail had helped the cause, but still. Connor and Colleen had never befriended the Tail and never wanted to.</p><p>Maybe Gail had always clung to Dad not just to prove she was the hottest thing on earth, but because she didn\u2019t have anyone else. And Colleen Margaret Mary O\u2019Rourke, famed for being friends with every living creature in Manningsport, had never once offered friendship.</p><p>Colleen cleared her throat. \u201cYou bet. You know how much I love Savannah. I\u2019ll make sure she doesn\u2019t feel caught in the middle.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure we throw some vegetables her way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Gail wiped her eyes and looked down at the table.</p> <p>\u201cBut let her stay in baseball. She\u2019s so good, Gail. She\u2019s scholarship good. Drop the cheerleading\u2014I\u2019ll take her to kickboxing with me. Maybe Tom Barlow will let her join his boxing club, even though it\u2019s for high school kids. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Gail whispered. \u201cCan I have more of these?\u201d She pointed to the empty plate.</p><p>\u201cComing up,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>Yep. Savannah\u2019s mother needed a friend, and even though it went against God and nature, Colleen was going to be that friend.</p><p>BUSINESS AT O\u2019ROURKE\u2019S was freakishly slow that night, and thank God for it because it had been mobbed for the past two months. Everyone needed a break. Colleen sent Monica home, put Annie behind the bar to serve the four people there, and poked her head in the kitchen. Her brother was cleaning the grill.</p><p>\u201cClose up, brother mine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then come join the girls and me so we don\u2019t have to talk about you behind your back.\u201d</p><p>Faith, her sister Pru and Emmaline Neal were sitting at the Girls Night Out table, and Levi and Jeremy Lyon were in a booth, nursing beers, though Levi kept shooting his wife those hot sleepy looks of his.</p><p>\u201cLevi, enough!\u201d Colleen called. \u201cThe testosterone is choking me, okay? No wonder Faithie\u2019s knocked up. Jeremy, can\u2019t you distract him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Coll,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cYou should try working with him,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cHe calls her constantly. \u2018How you feeling, babe? You need anything, sweetheart?\u2019 It sickens me.\u201d She smiled at Faith, then looked over at Levi. \u201cYou\u2019re a horrible boss,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cThen quit,\u201d he answered easily. \u201cJeremy would hire you in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Emmaline,\u201d Jer said. \u201cI pay better, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can I carry a gun in a doctor\u2019s office?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt does tend to send the wrong message,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of love,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cOh, are we gonna talk about Carl and me?\u201d Prudence asked. \u201cI have to say, doing it in a car was a lot more awkward than I remembered. My back started to spasm when he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Faith put her hand over her sister\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhen he what?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI wanted to talk about Paulie. What happened with her and Bryce, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cOne of my rare failures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce Campbell?\u201d Jessica asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of a slut, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Paulie,\u201d Faith said. \u201cShe\u2019s so nice.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWell, how are things with you and Lucas, Coll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about Connor instead, how\u2019s that? Does anyone know who he\u2019s seeing? Other than his blow-up doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cReally. What a shock.\u201d At that moment, her phone rang. She looked at it. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucas. I\u2019m going to make him wait because I\u2019m just not the type to throw over my friends for a guy\u2014 Con, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving. I have to call my mystery woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tapping your phone.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, too,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cInk Wars is on. See you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Prudence said. \u201cIt\u2019s RPG night at the Vanderbeek household. Abby\u2019s sleeping over at Helena\u2019s house, thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s RPG?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cRole playing game,\u201d Pru said blithely. \u201cProfessor Snape and McGonagall.\u201d She gave a lurid wink.</p><p>\u201cHarry Potter? You\u2019re ruining Harry Potter?\u201d Faith yelped. \u201cIs nothing sacred anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ruining anything,\u201d Pru said. \u201cEnhancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just threw up in my mouth,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, Pru,\u201d Colleen said as Pru, married for twenty-some-odd years, sauntered off. \u201cYou have to admire the creativity,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI admire nothing,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSo. You and Lucas. Spill. Why didn\u2019t you take his call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Colleen didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI just...I wonder if we\u2019re only sleeping together because we\u2019re in the same town. Because it\u2019s convenient. His ex-wife\u2019s in town, and I understand that she was part of his family for years, and he was part of hers, but I\u2019m still seething with jealousy. Oh, and she\u2019s engaged and pregnant, but she and Lucas are still best friends forever, apparently. She\u2019s staying at his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. That\u2019s bad, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just murmuring over the seething part.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhy is she staying with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Black Swan double-booked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. They did that in January, when Liza and Mike came out for the wedding, remember? Anyway.\u201d She took a sip of water. \u201cIs he staying here after Joe...passes away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The thought of him leaving made her throat clamp shut.</p><p>\u201cWould you move to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cNot that he\u2019s asked. I mean, we haven\u2019t talked about it, because...well, shit, Faith, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m afraid. The truth is, I\u2019m ridiculously inexperienced with serious relationships. Tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019ve had two relationships, and they\u2019re sitting in that booth over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do I know?\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cI\u2019m the queen of flirting but I haven\u2019t had a boyfriend in years. I\u2019ve fixed up dozens of people, and I give out advice like Dr. Phil, and what has that ever gotten me? I\u2019m thirty-one years old, I\u2019ve been in love once, and I\u2019m utterly terrified that Lucas is going to break my heart, same as last time.\u201d</p><p>And much to her surprise, Colleen burst into tears.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>\u201cUNCLE JOE, YOU handsome devil.\u201d Stephanie bent down and gave Joe a big hug, then kissed his cheek and wiped off the red lip imprint. \u201cGirls, remember Uncle Joe?\u201d</p><p>The older girls gave out hugs with good-natured duty. Chloe, on the other hand, stared him down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dying,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>Didi looked as though she\u2019d just stepped in a Rufus-sized pile of dog shit. Joe, on the other hand, laughed. \u201cThanks, honey. For a minute, I thought I\u2019d already died, because you girls are as pretty as angels. You, too, Stephie!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s sister and kids\u2014and Frank and Grace Forbes\u2014had flown in that morning and taken a limo from the airport straight here, to the park by the lake, where you could reserve picnic areas and grills.</p><p>\u201cFrank, Grace, I would\u2019ve been happy to have had this at our house,\u201d Didi simpered, shooting Lucas a death glare. \u201cIf only I\u2019d known you were coming. Of course, our place is nothing like yours, but we think it\u2019s sweet, and I would\u2019ve loved to have had you.\u201d That hadn\u2019t been the case when Didi thought it was just going to be the Campbells, of course, and Lucas had taken a small modicum of pleasure in denying his aunt the opportunity to kiss up to his former in-laws.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d Grace said. \u201cEllen, honey, sit down and drink something.\u201d</p><p>The girls ran and splashed; Lucas had bought some little balsa-wood boats at the hardware store, and in the face of good old-fashioned fun, the electronic devices were cheerfully forgotten. Didi cooed over Ellen and tried to act rich, mentioning her Coach bag and how you had to pay for nice things, of course Grace knew all about that, no, it wasn\u2019t as if Didi and Joe were anywhere nearly as comfortable as Grace and Frank, of course not, but they did all right, not that she was bragging, but New York wasn\u2019t a cheap place to live, and she was smart with her finances, not Forbes-smart, of course not, no, but she admired quality. Ellen caught his eye and gave the slightest grin; both she and her mother were too polite to do anything more than that.</p><p>Frank and Joe talked and laughed, Joe doing his best to act robust. He\u2019d sleep like the dead after this.</p><p>An unfortunate choice of words.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way, little brother,\u201d Stephanie said with an ungentle shove. \u201cI always made these better than you.\u201d She took the spatula from him and checked the foil-wrapped sandwiches he was grilling\u2014chicken and ham and pickles, replicas of the cubanos Joe always used to get from Diego\u2019s in the old neighborhood when he\u2019d visit.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t these bad for him?\u201d Steph asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and a tear fell onto the grill with a small hiss. \u201cSo how much time has he got?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe dialysis can keep him indefinitely,\u201d Lucas answered. \u201cBut the cancer\u2019s spreading, and he wants get while the getting\u2019s good. Or at least, before it gets horrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame him, I guess.\u201d Steph swallowed thickly, then added more mustard to the rolls. \u201cHow\u2019s Bryce holding up?\u201d she asked, nodding over at their cousin, who was hurling the girls into the water, much to their shrieking delight.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Bryce. He won\u2019t talk about Joe actually dying, and he won\u2019t let Joe talk about it, either.\u201d</p><p>Steph\u2019s mouth wobbled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as close to Uncle Joe as you were, obviously, but he was\u2014is\u2014so sweet. I wasn\u2019t ready for how old he looked.\u201d She wiped her eyes subtly, then waved to Mercedes, who had eyes like a hawk. \u201cWhen are we having the talk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little later.\u201d</p><p>For now, Joe could eat a few bites of regular food, take a few sips of beer, and be with his family. There was salad and coleslaw and ribs and watermelon, and chocolate chip cookies from the smiling woman at the bakery, as well as a cooler full of iced teas, soda and beers, and a bottle of wine for Grace; a Blue Heron dry Riesling, sold to him by Colleen\u2019s mother this very morning.</p><p>A couple hours later, when they had all eaten and Joe had taken a nap on the lounge chair in the shade, Lucas asked Bryce to take the girls out on one of the tour boats that ran every two hours.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to come, Uncle Lucas?\u201d Chloe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here and talk to the grown-ups,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThen I want to stay, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about banking. It\u2019s very boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love banking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time you had a job. But for now, off you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe, don\u2019t be a twit,\u201d Mercedes said, taking her little sister by the hand. \u201cWe\u2019re being ostracized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice word,\u201d Lucas said.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m in AP English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ve told me seven or eight times now.\u201d He winked at her, and she smiled as she walked away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, girls,\u201d Bryce said, scooping up a twin under each arm. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t fall overboard. You know there\u2019s a monster in this lake, and it loves little girls.\u201d They shrieked obligingly, and if Bryce wondered why he was the only adult going out on the lake, he didn\u2019t ask about it.</p><p>When they were off, Lucas got Ellen another bottle of water. Didi was asking about Ellen and Steve\u2019s wedding and trying to finagle an invitation in her unsubtle way. \u201cWill you have many guests? Oh, I just love Chicago in September! I haven\u2019t been since that wonderful party your parents had in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get down to business?\u201d he interrupted, sitting between his sister and Ellen. Joe gave him a nod and folded his hands. \u201cDidi, I\u2019ll get right to it. Joe would like a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Her sycophantic smile froze, and her head jerked back a fraction. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s...\u201d She shot a nervous glance at Frank and Grace, who stared back impassively. \u201cVery funny, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is! I wouldn\u2019t divorce my sick husband!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to divorce you, however,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Didi\u2019s face was white, and for a second, Lucas almost felt bad for her...right up until he remembered that she\u2019d stuck Joe in that dark, windowless room where he used to sleep.</p><p>\u201cDidi,\u201d Ellen said, her hand on her stomach, \u201cNew York State law says that a couple has to be separated for six months before they get a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be dead in six months,\u201d Didi said. \u201cProbably long before.\u201d</p><p>Grace Forbes closed her eyes briefly, the only indication of her disapproval.</p><p>\u201cWe know a judge who\u2019ll push it through, so long as you don\u2019t contest it,\u201d Ellen continued.</p><p>The Forbes name was far-reaching, after all.</p><p>\u201cI will contest it!\u201d Didi snapped. \u201cWhat would people think if I divorced Joe a month before he died? Is this some ploy to cut me out of your will, Joe? Not that I need your pathetic life insurance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy money\u2019s in a trust for Bryce until he gets married,\u201d Joe said calmly. \u201cLucas is in charge of it until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt very much he\u2019ll ever get married. He\u2019s not the type. And a trust fund? For twenty thousand dollars? Why bother?\u201d</p><p>And so Joe told her how Apple had bought his new app for $1.5 million.</p><p>Didi\u2019s face bloomed with red. \u201cI\u2019ll fight this,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cThe will is iron-clad,\u201d Ellen said calmly, pushing her blond hair behind her ears. \u201cAnd remember that prenup? You don\u2019t get any proceeds from Joe\u2019s intellectual property. No judge in the world would have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>In other words, the prenup that had forced Joe to stay with Didi was now biting her in the ass. It had a certain karmic justice to it.</p><p>\u201cDidi,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cJoe\u2019s going to file the papers one way or another, even if he dies before a divorce can go through. If you fight it, I\u2019m guessing that everyone will wonder why that nice Joe Campbell wanted to get away from you so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you grant him an uncontested divorce,\u201d Lucas said, \u201che\u2019ll keep it quiet, and no one will have to know. Not even Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I think Bryce should know that his father is behaving like an ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidi,\u201d Grace said in her gentle voice, \u201cI understand how shocking this is. And honestly, I think it\u2019s awfully bighearted of you to even consider it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not considering it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014granting the father of your son his last wish. Even if it seems hard to comprehend, since you\u2019ve been such a loving wife all these years.\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm was lost on Didi.</p><p>\u201cBut if this is Joe\u2019s last wish, it seems so...uncouth to disregard it.\u201d</p><p>Didi\u2019s eyes flickered. Colleen had been right. Reputation was everything to Didi.</p><p>This was, of course, why Grace and Frank were here. That, and to say goodbye to Joe.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, we\u2019d still think of you as part of the family,\u201d Grace went on, giving Lucas a wry glance. \u201cWe\u2019d hope you\u2019d still come visit for New Year\u2019s and such.\u201d</p><p>Didi\u2019s expression turned speculative.</p><p>She\u2019d always loved that New Year\u2019s Eve party, after all. She glanced at Joe, and Lucas could practically see her doing the math. Bryce would have his own money, enough for his own place. He wouldn\u2019t live in his mother\u2019s basement anymore, not with more than a cool million in the bank.</p><p>But if she got invited to the famous Forbes New Year\u2019s Eve party, she could find some rich guy. After all, there was no accounting for some people\u2019s taste.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stressful, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Frank said. \u201cOnce all the paperwork is filed and the dust has settled, you should plan on spending some time at the lake house for a little rest.\u201d</p><p>That sealed the deal. The Forbes lake house was more like a compound, acres and acres of waterfront property in Wisconsin, several wooden boats and a live-in housekeeper. Triumph shone in Didi\u2019s pale eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s so generous of you, Frank,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love that. But only if it\u2019s what Joe wants.\u201d</p><p>LATER, WHEN THE details had been agreed on and Didi had left, and after Steph took the girls back to Lucas\u2019s apartment, where they\u2019d be spending the night, and Ellen and her parents had headed back to Chicago, Lucas wheeled Joe down to the dock, Bryce alongside him.</p><p>\u201cPush me in,\u201d Joe said merrily. \u201cSave me the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t even joke about that. You look great. What are we doing down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d take a sail,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind going out on the water again, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not a bit. I love boats.\u201d</p><p>Carol Robinson owned a rarely used sailboat, and when Lucas asked if he could take his uncle out on it, she only charged him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cUse it, use it!\u201d she said. \u201cThat Joe is a nice man.\u201d</p><p>He and Bryce lifted Joe into the boat, which was a sweet little sloop. Lucas wasn\u2019t a great sailor, but he was good enough to take the boat out; Colleen had taught him back in the day. The past couple of years, when his divorce created too many solitary nights, he\u2019d taken some lessons, too.</p><p>The sun was setting, that time of evening when daylight seemed reluctant to go, and filled the air with golden light. Joe sat in the bow and immediately closed his eyes, Lucas in the back with his hand on the rudder, his cousin next to him. The sails caught the wind and the boat slid out into the deep blue water.</p><p>Lucas looked at Bryce. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Just...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the reality of his father\u2019s condition was dawning on him. It was hard to believe it hadn\u2019t yet.</p><p>\u201cI miss Paulie,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Not what Lucas expected to hear. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Doesn\u2019t judge and stuff.\u201d</p><p>They rounded Meering Point. A bunch of kids were playing under a waterfall, their gleeful shrieks carrying on the wind. \u201cBryce,\u201d Lucas said after a minute, \u201cyou ever think you sell yourself short?\u201d</p><p>Bryce gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got more going on than you think,\u201d Lucas continued. \u201cYou\u2019re like your dad. Heart of gold, not a mean bone in your body. Why do you think you\u2019re so good with animals? And kids? You saw how the girls love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re great.\u201d He picked at a hole in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to believe in yourself a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Lucas paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Bryce shrugged and glanced at his father, who appeared to be sound asleep. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Lucas. Maybe because I\u2019ll never be as good as you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, not that there\u2019s a competition. You have a great job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014you married a Forbes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd divorced a Forbes.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and you never left Chicago. Dad thinks you walk on water.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s why he sent for you. To take care of me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not the only reason. But yeah, he\u2019s worried about you. He wants to see you settled.\u201d</p><p>Bryce swallowed. \u201cSettled how? Married with kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you could start with getting a job, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing anything. No shame in hard work.\u201d The boat was really skipping along now, the waves slapping sharply against the hull.</p><p>\u201cMy mom says I should wait till I have something I\u2019m totally into. No need to do grunt work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can start out with grunt work. I did. Lots of successful people did. Right? Paulie\u2019s father used to clean chicken shit, if you believe his commercials.\u201d</p><p>Bryce pondered that. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s better to be unemployed and kinda cool, or have a job doing grunt work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce. You\u2019re thirty-one years old. Being unemployed is not cool. Get a job.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He paused. \u201cMaybe Paulie would think...well. That I grew up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. Show her you\u2019re worth a second chance,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I like her that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever missed a girl you\u2019d broken up with before?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Bryce glanced at him and smiled. \u201cBut Paulie\u2019s not my usual type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your usual type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlutty and beautiful. The fling type.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. Colleen had said something like that, too. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to try something else, then. Have some faith in yourself, Bryce. You can be good at something other than video games and dog adoptions, you know.\u201d He squeezed his cousin on the shoulder, and Bryce smiled.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re right, dude. Thanks for the pep talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. Now go sit with your father.\u201d</p><p>Joe woke up as his son sat next to him, and he put his arm around Bryce\u2019s shoulders. Bryce kissed his father\u2019s head, and the two sat in the breeze, the sun making the water quiver in the shimmering light.</p><p>Lucas turned his head, sensing that this was the goodbye Joe so wanted with his son.</p><p>He would\u2019ve given a lot to have been able to say goodbye to his own father this way...or any way. To have felt his father\u2019s arm around him once more, to have held his hand when he finally slipped away, instead of knowing he died alone on a cold cement floor in the prison basement in a state he\u2019d never seen except through bars.</p> <p>He would\u2019ve given anything to have been able to just have seen his father\u2019s face once more.</p><p>But at least Bryce would have that. And if Lucas couldn\u2019t have been there for his father, he was here for Joe.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>ONCE AGAIN, COLLEEN was indulging in a little Clorox therapy, this time in the ladies\u2019 room of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s.</p><p>Things hadn\u2019t been right between her and Lucas since two weeks ago, when Ellen the Perfect had swept into town in all her pregnant radiance.</p><p>They weren\u2019t fighting. It was more like there was a tremor in the Force.</p> <p>Because a judge had apparently been a member of the same secret society at Yale as Frank Forbes, Joe Campbell was now quietly divorced. Lucas had thanked her for the idea...but still, it couldn\u2019t have been done without perfect Ellen. Not that Colleen was insecure or jealous (cough). No, Ellen was completely nice and classy and engaged and preggers, and why the hell did she bother Colleen so much, anyway? Ellen was back in Chicago now, as were Lucas\u2019s sister and nieces. They\u2019d come into the bar to say hello and stayed for dinner, and Colleen had had to go into the office and cry for a second\u2014the girls were so big! Once upon a time, she and Lucas had babysat Mercedes and the infant twins. She\u2019d never even met the fourth one.</p><p>Didi had gone off to visit a friend in Boca and would stay for the duration. It had only cost Lucas about four grand, he\u2019d told her, and it was money very well spent. Joe could now die in peace.</p><p>The loo was now spotless. With a sigh, Colleen returned to the bustle. But all through the evening, she obsessed. Worried, fretted, mulled and, ironically, tried not to think about Lucas.</p><p>Their time together was drawing to a close. They were still sleeping together, but it was almost too much\u2014the intensity, the meaning, the poignance. Soon, one of these times would be their last. Or not. Or they\u2019d try a long-distance thing.</p><p>But without saying the actual words, Lucas had made it clear: Manningsport was not his home. Chicago was. Manningsport was where he had lived for a short time and no more. A place that meant nothing to him, and everything to her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to leave.</p><p>Not that he had asked, mind you.</p><p>At the end of her shift, she called the nursing home to check on her grandfather.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Coll,\u201d said Joanie. \u201cHe\u2019s a little restless right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pop over, then,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>A half hour later, she was sitting at Gramp\u2019s bedside, holding his hand, talking about her day, the specials Connor had whipped up, how she\u2019d taken Savannah for a swim in Keuka and how cold and clear the water had been. \u201cI remember how you told me about you and Gran, taking a row in the moonlight on your honeymoon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said she looked like an angel, and you could hear a whip-poor-will calling.\u201d Gramp didn\u2019t respond, but she hoped he could picture it, those long-ago days with the love of his life.</p><p>But then, she ran out of things to say. Rufus, whom she\u2019d brought in for company, was lying on the floor, twitching in sleep. Aside from his sighs (it sounded like a pretty good dream), the place was quiet.</p><p>Gramp made a whimpering sound, and Colleen kissed his hand. Rufus\u2019s tail thumped the floor as if to reassure the old man. \u201cI\u2019m still here, Gramp. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Connor came to visit about once a week, more than anyone else except Colleen herself. The other O\u2019Rourke cousins felt\u2014perhaps legitimately\u2014that their visits did nothing more than confuse Gramp, because the staff did report he\u2019d be agitated afterward.</p><p>Dad never came. Once, Colleen had brought Savannah, but Gail and Dad had both had fits over it...exposing their innocent flower to the ravages of time, etc., etc. So it was just Colleen. She sometimes thought that if she could, she\u2019d move in to Rushing Creek because she and Gramp had always had a special bond.</p><p>Her grandfather pulled his hand away and rubbed his forehead, his classic move when he was agitated.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m in love again, Gramp,\u201d she said, more so he could hear her voice than anything else. Well. Except it was good to say out loud. \u201cSame guy as last time. Dumb, huh? No live and learn here. He\u2019ll be leaving pretty soon. We try not to talk about it. I think he wants me to live in Chicago, and I want him to stay here, and neither one of us is going to get our way.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She adjusted her grandfather\u2019s blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Live life for the moment. Eat dessert first. I brought you some cookies, by the way. Peanut butter. Your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She jumped. Lucas stood in the doorway. Hopefully, he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cHi. What are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way out, actually.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey just admitted Joe to Hospice. He took a turn for the worse this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lucas. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now. Pretty doped up. He had a bad coughing fit and brought up some blood, so he discontinued dialysis and...\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look in on him.\u201d</p><p>He gave a ghost of a smile. \u201cHe always liked you.\u201d Another pause. \u201cHow\u2019s your grandfather?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same as ever.\u201d</p><p>Lucas went over and took Gramp\u2019s hand. \u201cHi, Mr. O\u2019Rourke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucas Campbell. Good to see you again, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Colleen said, though her eyes were full.</p><p>Gramp turned away and closed his eyes. Pulled his hand free and rolled onto his side. \u201cHe\u2019ll sleep for a while now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d</p><p>She roused her dog, and she and Lucas walked down the silent hallway.</p><p>\u201cIs that your bike?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I drive you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a headlight and stuff. A reflective vest.\u201d It was a mile to her house, and Rufus could use the run (though he was even now flopping down on the floor once again). And at this hour, she\u2019d be there almost as fast as she would if she took Lucas up on his offer.</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was,\u201d he said, his voice scraping her with sweet, dark yearning, \u201ccan I drive you to the opera house, and will you stay over, Colleen, in my bed, and let me make love to you?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t smiling, which made it all the more devastating.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, and he kissed her then, a gentle, long, tender kiss, and it was all she could do not to cry because she knew the clock had almost run out.</p><p>A FEW NIGHTS LATER, Lucas stood outside O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, hoping to grab a quick dinner and a glimpse of Colleen before returning to Rushing Creek to sit with Joe, who was winding down. Mostly, his uncle slept, but if he was awake, he liked the company...and Bryce had been avoiding him, which Lucas just couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>What the future held for him and Colleen, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She was trying to be her normal self, cheerful and flirty and wry, but there was something in her eyes that didn\u2019t bode well, and when he asked her about it the other night, she just put on a smile and kissed him, and no amount of coaxing could get her to open up.</p><p>That was a problem because he needed to get back to Chicago, finish the Cambria building and leave Forbes Properties behind for good. Not Mr. and Mrs. Forbes, not Ellen, not completely. But he didn\u2019t want to be attached to them in any way other than the occasional visit. He\u2019d been a part of their family once, and he knew that Frank especially would want to keep up with the dinners, the sails on Lake Michigan. They\u2019d invite him for the holidays, same as always, but things were changing. He didn\u2019t belong there anymore.</p><p>Steph and the girls had a different relationship with Frank and Grace (and Ellen, for that matter; the two women had become best friends, however unlikely a pairing\u2014Steph the single mom with her tattoos and piercings, Ellen with her WASPy good looks and quiet money). But an ex-husband, an ex-son-in-law...no.</p><p>Ellen would be married soon. There\u2019d be another son-in-law, and two babies, and while Lucas knew he\u2019d failed Ellen on some deep, emotional level despite his best efforts, and he couldn\u2019t resent the divorce in any way, there was still a feeling that he was once again on the outside looking in.</p><p>Time to do his own thing, with the woman he\u2019d fallen for in one glance. Time to set things right.</p><p>But her idea of right and his were very different, and it was becoming apparent just how big a problem this was going to be.</p><p>He went inside, and she looked up right away as she made a martini, expertly pouring the vodka, adding a squeeze of lime. A quick smile, the same kind she gave him lately whenever she\u2019d been quiet too long, flashed across her lips. \u201cHello, Spaniard,\u201d she said as he sat down. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away, and a faint blush crept into her cheeks. \u201cWhatever the house special is, and a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the house special,\u201d she said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI want the house special, then, too,\u201d said the guy sitting one stool down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taken,\u201d Lucas said, not looking away from Colleen.</p><p>\u201cCajun crab cake sandwich with Hungarian cucumber salad, coming up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, Greg, I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d She pulled two glasses from the overhead rack and filled them both with beer. \u201cSince you didn\u2019t specify, Spaniard, I gave you what he\u2019s having. The Ithaca Flower Power IPA.\u201d</p><p>She went into the kitchen, stopping to admire a baby. Probably one of the Colleens or Colins named for her.</p><p>\u201cYou guys together?\u201d the guy, Greg, asked.</p><p>Lucas gave him a slow look. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cWell, good luck. Hope you don\u2019t catch anything.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was dragging him across the floor by his shirt before he was even aware that he\u2019d moved. The noise of the bar barely wavered, though Tom Barlow, back from his honeymoon, did hold the door.</p><p>\u201cJesus, man!\u201d Greg yelped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Lucas let him fall on the sidewalk, and Greg scrabbled up, his hands in front of him. \u201cJust calm down, okay? Christ. I figured I\u2019d give you a warning. She\u2019s slept with half the guys in this town. Myself included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lucas took a step closer, and the little ass**le hesitated, then turned and fled.</p><p>He went back inside, his heart thudding. \u201cWell done, mate,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWhatever it was he did, I\u2019m sure he deserved that.\u201d Lucas nodded, then went back to the bar and drained his beer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colleen came back out. \u201cWhere\u2019s Greg?\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHe had to leave,\u201d Lucas muttered.</p><p>Now granted, he knew that Colleen hadn\u2019t been celibate for the past ten years (no matter how nice that would\u2019ve been to imagine). But it didn\u2019t mean he felt good, hearing that kind of shit.</p><p>\u201cLucas threw his ass out,\u201d Gerard offered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was rude,\u201d Lucas answered.</p><p>\u201cI see. So he told you I slept with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss this in a bar.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI own this bar, Spaniard. Try not to be too retro, okay? Sorry I wasn\u2019t sitting home alone, knitting bandages for injured soldiers as I waited for you to come back to me.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a hot look. She returned it, then went to the end of the bar to get someone a drink.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lucas.\u201d Faith wriggled onto the stool next to him, Levi at her side. Probably a good thing Levi hadn\u2019t been here five minutes ago, or Lucas might be on his way to the new holding cell at the police station. He took a breath and unclenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThe public safety building looks incredible,\u201d Levi said. \u201cWent up fast.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. The job had been easy compared to a fifty-seven-story skyscraper, and had gone without significant hiccups. As soon as the painters were done, the three emergency departments could start moving in.</p><p>\u201cHi, gorgeous!\u201d Colleen said, leaning over the bar to kiss Faith. \u201cHow\u2019s my godchild percolating in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d she said happily, and Levi touched her cheek.</p> <p>Lucas remembered that feeling. The awe of having a baby on the way, the protectiveness over your woman.</p><p>The broken feeling in his chest when he saw Ellen, white and sobbing in the hospital.</p><p>He said a quick prayer that Faith and Levi wouldn\u2019t know that sorrow. No one deserved that. And while he was at it, that Ellen and Steve\u2019s twins would be healthy and hearty.</p><p>Colleen plopped his plate in front of him with a clatter, deliberate, he was sure. Probably another hearty dose of whatever evil hot sauce she\u2019d used on his burger that time.</p><p>Then she reached over and messed up his hair. \u201cFaith, have you ever seen hair as beautiful as this?\u201d she asked, and just like that, she was done being mad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m partial to blonds myself,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBut no, I haven\u2019t. Unless it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask you to stop sulking, Spaniard,\u201d Colleen said, leaning down so he could get the full power of the view down her shirt, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s kind of hot.\u201d</p><p>He took a bite of the sandwich. It was excellent. No burning esophagus anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cHey, bro!\u201d Bryce stood in front of him, beaming. \u201cGuess what! I got a job!\u201d He offered his fist for a bump.</p><p>Lucas obliged. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Bryce,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019m celebrating! I\u2019m employed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d she said, glancing down the busy bar as she pulled him an IPA. \u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>Bryce sat down and accepted his beer. \u201cMenopause Boot Camp,\u201d he announced proudly.</p><p>Lucas choked. \u201cWow. What does that entail, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColl, it was your mom who gave me the idea,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cYou know? All these old chicks starting to fall apart, complaining about their creaky knees and hot flashes, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Girls, you need to get out there a little more, get the blood flowing, right?\u2019 and your mom says, \u2018Bryce, if the instructor looked like you, I\u2019d do it.\u2019 So I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, what an awesome idea!\u2019 And she got all those other chicks to sign up. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my grandmother just joined that class,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cShe did!\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWhat do you think, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>As ever, his cousin wanted his approval. \u201cSounds good, buddy. You\u2019ll be great at it.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou need insurance and waivers and a place and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cCarlos Mendez said if I started working on getting certified as a personal trainer, he\u2019d let me work out of the gym, so long as my clients joined.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m not good at that much, but I know how to work out, and I like women.\u201d He smiled and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Bryce,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s genius,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou could also call it Women Who Love Looking at Bryce. Half the town would join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be grandfathered in,\u201d Bryce said with a wink, and Lucas wasn\u2019t sure, but for a second, Colleen looked almost...stricken.</p><p>But a moment later, she was laughing at something Faith said and flirting with an old guy in a flannel shirt.</p><p>Hannah O\u2019Rourke came out of the kitchen. \u201cCollie, Connor wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d she said. She went into the kitchen, attracting a good amount of male attention, Lucas\u2019s included.</p><p>At that moment, his phone buzzed. Rushing Creek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get here as soon as you can, Mr. Campbell,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWE SHOULD TELL my mom,\u201d Bryce objected as Lucas towed him down the hallway toward the hospice wing. \u201cI\u2019ll call her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Lucas said. Didi and Joe had kept the divorce from Bryce as if he was a fragile eight-year-old. \u201cCome on, buddy.\u201d</p><p>For the past eleven days, Lucas had spent a lot of time in this room. He\u2019d brought in photo albums, meticulously kept since Bryce\u2019s birth onward, and listened as Joe told him who was who in the pictures, or described where they\u2019d been\u2014here\u2019s the one from the Cascades...this was in Zion National Park. Oh, the river walk in San Antonio! And here\u2019s when we were in France.</p><p>The room felt different now, heavy with the sound of Joe\u2019s labored breathing. His uncle\u2019s face was puffy, and he appeared to be sleeping.</p><p>Bryce hesitated in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cJoe? We\u2019re here,\u201d Lucas said. He went to his uncle\u2019s bedside and took his hand, gesturing for Bryce to come closer. Bryce stayed put.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Joe whispered. He opened his eyes with effort, and saw Bryce. \u201cHi, honey-boy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Bryce took a shuddering breath. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on over here,\u201d Joe said, and Bryce obeyed, tears sliding down his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad. Please don\u2019t die.\u201d There was a note of panic in his voice, poor kid. Bryce sat down in the bedside chair and took his father\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, son,\u201d Joe whispered. There was a rattle in his breathing now.</p><p>Lucas moved to Joe\u2019s other side and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat can we do for you, Joe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to say goodbye to his own father, but he was here now.</p><p>His uncle looked up. \u201cLucas...\u201d He closed his eyes for a moment. \u201cWould you mind...leaving Bryce and me alone?\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinked. He glanced at his cousin, who was sobbing softly, his head on his father\u2019s arm. \u201cUm...sure. Of course.\u201d He paused, leaned down and kissed his uncle\u2019s forehead. \u201cThank you, Joe,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor taking me in.\u201d</p><p>But Joe\u2019s eyes were on his son, and so Lucas had nothing left to do but obey, the door wheezing shut behind him.</p><p>The hallway was dark and quiet. A nurse went by, her eyes kind.</p><p>He could call Colleen. She\u2019d wait with him.</p><p>He had no one else, after all.</p><p>Instead, he just stood there. After a while, he sat, looking at the closed door, and it was hard to breathe because of the pain in his chest, like a cold, thick spike had been driven through it.</p><p>He\u2019d call Steph after it was over. Didi, too, and Ellen. He\u2019d do what needed to be done, what Joe had asked him to do, and then he wanted to leave this little town and not come back, because all he\u2019d ever been here was an outsider, an impostor.</p><p>Except with Colleen.</p><p>The door opened, and Lucas lurched to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHe\u2019s really gone.\u201d</p><p>He burst into racking sobs, and Lucas opened his arms and hugged his cousin.</p><p>He could see Joe in the bed, undeniably still.</p><p>\u201cI got to tell him about my job,\u201d Bryce wept, \u201cand he said he was proud of me, and I was an entrepreneur, like him, and I\u2019d do great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what else he said?\u201d Bryce said wetly, pulling back to mop his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I was everything he ever hoped for in a son.\u201d Bryce\u2019s face crumpled again.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d said the kindly nurse. \u201cDo you need some more time with your dad, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my dad,\u201d Bryce corrected. \u201cNot his.\u201d</p><p>And that about summed it up.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>COLLEEN HAD JUST come out of the shower and was contemplating a binge of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s to help resist the urge to call Lucas. He had shit going on and didn\u2019t need her bugging him with stupid texts like Thinking of you! or Hey, wanna come over? And it was 1:33 a.m. He could well be asleep, and it had hurt her heart to see how tired he looked earlier.</p><p>Yep. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s it was, the only two men who\u2019d never let her down. Vanilla Heath Bar, or Peanut Brittle? Peanut Brittle it was, the crystal meth of the ice cream world. She\u2019d bought eleven pints last week, terrified that Faith would hit the market first and clean them out.</p><p>Rufus lumbered to his feet. Ah rah! Ah rah! Ah rooroo rah! he bellowed in his mighty baritone. Sure enough, a knock came at the door.</p><p>She tossed the ice cream back in the freezer and opened the door.</p><p>It was Lucas, and those pirate eyes were unbearably sad.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d she said, and wrapped her arms around him because it was written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Lucas said. He let her hold him, but he seemed...lost.</p><p>Ah rah! Ah rah roo! her beastie said.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAre you hungry? Want a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Colleen\u2014\u201d He stopped. She waited.</p><p>He didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Rufus, however, began his typical \u201care you a boy or a girl\u201d investigation. \u201cOkay, Rufus, no. Go away, boy.\u201d</p><p>Her dog obeyed. Lucas, however, just stood there.</p><p>Shit. A white-hot brand of fear and guilt rammed through her heart. He knew. Oh, sphincter, he knew. Maybe she should\u2019ve told him before, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her throat so dry it clacked. She wished she was wearing something other than a Tweety Bird T-shirt and a pair of boxer shorts.</p><p>\u201cUm...want to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He just looked at her, then rather shockingly cupped her face in his hands. \u201cColleen...the only thing that\u2019s ever really been mine is you.\u201d</p><p>God. The words hit her like a sledgehammer. A good sledgehammer. \u201cOh, Spaniard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a kid, I only remember my mom being sick, and then my dad worked all the time, and Steph was always out with some guy. And then when I came to live with Didi and Joe\u2014\u201d He scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t belong there, and Didi made sure I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Colleen whispered, tears slipping out of her eyes. \u201cI know Joe loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent me out of the room tonight. At the end.\u201d</p><p>No. No, that was just not fair. Oh, Joe, why did you do that?</p><p>\u201cI always thought if I was...good enough, quiet enough or helpful enough, I\u2019d earn a place, you know? But I didn\u2019t. And then it hit me, hard...the only thing I\u2019ve ever had that was really mine was you, Colleen. Bryce got everything handed to him, he had a home and parents who loved him and did everything for him, but once I met you, it didn\u2019t matter. I had you. You were everything to me, and I ruined it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...I ruined it, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. You were upset, and you deserved to be. I handled everything wrong. I should\u2019ve tried harder and done better by you, and I\u2019ve regretted it every day for the past ten years. You\u2019re mine, Colleen, and I\u2019ll do better this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas...\u201d she said, but it was the only word she managed to get out.</p><p>He kissed her then, and she kissed him back with everything she had, wrapped herself around him, his hot skin and Spanish eyes, and though he\u2019d finally said everything, almost, that she wanted to hear, finally, finally, there was a cold trickle of dread slicing through the sunburst his words had caused.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t matter, she told herself as she led him to bed, to comfort him, to show him how much she loved him. That was nothing, and this\u2014he\u2014was everything.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE came to Joe Campbell\u2019s wake. He had never been a mover or shaker in this town, not the type to join the school board or be a volunteer EMT, but the man had no enemies, either.</p><p>Bryce was doing okay; heartbroken, but able to smile and shake hands. Didi was there at the head of the room, accepting condolences with her son. She had a brittle smile on her face that most people attributed to grief, rather than pissiness.</p><p>Lucas and Stephanie and the girls came next, and that was it for family. Well, aside from Ellen Forbes and her parents, and her fianc\u00e9, all sitting in the second row of chairs. Which was nice, of course. Far be it from the Forbes contingent to do anything other than what Emily Post recommended. Should we all attend the wake of my ex-husband\u2019s uncle?</p> <p>But of course! Especially if you\u2019re on good terms.</p><p>Which Ellen and Lucas certainly were.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Lucas looked over to her and smiled.</p><p>He loved her. Still hadn\u2019t said the three magic words, but please. That was just a technicality. And good God, she loved him back.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d said Gerard, giving her a hug so mighty that he picked her up. \u201cHave I thanked you for fixing me up with Lorelei? That woman can bake, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so can Norine Pletts, so if things don\u2019t work out with Lorelei, you can try her. Seventy-one years young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Gerard said.</p><p>The four horseman of the Holland family were here with their spouses, except for horrifyingly single Jack, who\u2019d stopped in earlier. (Colleen reminded herself to do something about that; his gene pool was too good to waste.)</p><p>Everyone knew Bryce, of course, and Lucas had become a part of the community, thanks to handling the public safety building. There were Marian Field, the mayor of Manningsport, and Everett, her son. Victor and Lorena, also bar regulars, had been quite friendly with Joe. Connor gave her a look\u2014Hang in there, you\u2019re doing great. She smiled back gratefully.</p><p>As usual, Con had read her mind. It was awkward, being the once and future girlfriend, as it were, not quite the other woman, but somehow feeling that way. She didn\u2019t belong in the reception line (though she would\u2019ve been if Lucas had asked), but she wanted to be here nonetheless. Every time she thought of what he said the other night, about feeling so...alone...her heart broke again.</p><p>The only thing I\u2019ve ever had that was really mine was you.</p><p>They\u2019d work. They had to. They\u2019d figure something out.</p><p>The wake was supposed to end at eight; it was quarter of now. The line had dwindled, and Grant Jacobs, the funeral director, was now standing in the back of the room, giving the subtle sign.</p><p>Hopefully, Lucas would be able to come to her place tonight. Probably not, though, not with his sister and nieces...and the Forbes contingent. All Colleen wanted to do was comfort him. Have him lie on her couch with his head in her lap, or rub his shoulders, or make him smile however the hell she could. Her heart felt swollen and achy with love.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d came a voice to her left.</p><p>\u201cPaulie! How are you? I haven\u2019t seen you in so long,\u201d Colleen said, giving her a hug. Granted, so long was anything over a week in Colleen\u2019s book, but Paulie hugged back hard, making Colleen wheeze a little.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d she asked, jerking her chin in Bryce\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking it hard.\u201d They both looked at Bryce, who was indeed weeping at the moment. Poor kid. Lucas put his hand on his cousin\u2019s shoulder and said something, and Bryce nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go say hi, then,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cUm...come with me? These things are so freaking awkward. Can I say \u2018freak\u2019 in a funeral home? I was thinking the other word. Saved at the last second, I guess. Shit, I\u2019m babbling. Oh, great, I just swore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, girl.\u201d Colleen gave her biceps a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Paulie sighed. She looked nice, if a little stiff, in her black dress. \u201cIt\u2019s just my heart is breaking, looking at that.\u201d Her eyes filled as she looked at Bryce.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be glad to see you. Come on.\u201d</p><p>They went up to Joe\u2019s casket, and Colleen swallowed the lump in her throat at the sight of Smiling Joe Campbell, who would never again sit at the end of the bar, nursing his Empire Cream Ale. Paulie put her hand on Joe\u2019s shoulder and wiped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPaulie,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d she said, and offered her hand. Bryce enveloped her in a hug, bending down since Paulie was so short, and burying his face on her shoulder. \u201cAw, buddy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were a great son.\u201d</p><p>Bryce\u2019s shoulders shook with a sob.</p><p>Dang it. Colleen seemed to be crying, too.</p><p>Bryce straightened up. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d He turned to his mother. \u201cMom, you remember Paulie Petrosinsky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, Mrs. Campbell,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Didi looked over Paulie\u2019s head and shot Mr. and Mrs. Forbes a smile. \u201cBryce, would you get me some water, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, Mrs. Campbell,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBryce, you must be tired. Why don\u2019t you sit down for a few minutes, catch up with Paulie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Paulie, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, not at all,\u201d Paulie said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t blushing. No, she looked entirely normal.</p><p>\u201cHow about that water, Kathleen?\u201d Didi said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Colleen, Mrs. Campbell, and you bet.\u201d Far be it from her to be impolite at a wake.</p><p>She went to the watercooler in the back, filled a cup and turned to see Stephanie Campbell standing in front of her. \u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Steph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice seeing you and Lucas back together, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say. See you tomorrow.\u201d She smiled, gave Colleen\u2019s shoulder a squeeze, then herded her children out the front door.</p><p>A sisterly blessing. She\u2019d take it.</p><p>When Colleen returned to the front of the room, the Forbeses were gathered around, and Colleen stood there awkwardly with the water. Didi wouldn\u2019t make eye contact, as she was too busy ass-kissing. Colleen waited. Lucas was talking to Ellen and her fianc\u00e9, Steve, and damned if Colleen didn\u2019t feel like the waitress once again.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, please,\u201d she said pleasantly, and Mr. Forbes leaped back.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, my dear,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHere\u2019s your water, Mrs. Campbell.\u201d She forced a smile, then drifted toward Lucas. Or maybe she shouldn\u2019t. Maybe she should go. Crap, this was awkward.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll see you at the benefit next week, right?\u201d she overheard Ellen say.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m so sorry we can\u2019t stay for the funeral,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cBut you know I\u2019m thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d he said, shaking Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cYou guys have a safe trip back. Make sure you get enough rest, Ell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think I missed the fact that you were limping. Get some ice on that knee.\u201d</p><p>Knee? Which knee? Lucas had a problem with his knee?</p><p>\u201cShe has eyes like a hawk,\u201d Steve said, pushing some hair behind Ellen\u2019s ear. \u201cBut he\u2019s right, baby. You should get your feet up.\u201d</p><p>Not just one, but two men, basking in Ellen\u2019s pregnant glow.</p><p>Bryce and Paulie were still in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. The Hollands had left; most people had, and she didn\u2019t want to stand around like a lump, watching Lucas kiss Ellen on the cheek (but bugger and damn, she did catch that out of the corner of her eye). She went to the back of the room and texted Savannah. How\u2019s everything? I\u2019m at a wake. What are you doing?</p><p>A few seconds later, she had her answer. Mom &amp; I r doing pedis. Fun!!!</p><p>That was nice. Mother-daughter time. Great! she texted back. Have fun, sweets! Tell your mom I said hi.</p><p>Oddly enough, she and Gail were becoming...well, not friends. Allies, maybe. They\u2019d had a glass of wine the other night at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, the first time Gail had come in alone. Gail had asked for her opinion on letting Savannah do the travel league for baseball in the fall (which Colleen had been all for).</p><p>They hadn\u2019t talked about Dad. If Gail suspected he was dating his ex-wife, she didn\u2019t say anything, and Colleen appreciated it.</p><p>\u201cM\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>Colleen jumped. \u201cSpaniard. How are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Things seem to be winding down here.\u201d He picked up her hand and kissed it. Twice.</p><p>He looked so amazing in his suit, a dark gray with a white shirt and dark red tie. He needed to shave. Colleen reminded herself to stop lusting in a funeral home, but he made it hard, that gorgeous mouth, those tragic eyes, so dark and deep...and maybe, there was a little glow of happiness in there, too. Maybe, just maybe, she had something to do with that.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two,\u201d said Bryce, approaching with Paulie.</p><p>\u201cPaulie,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cNice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said, punching him on the shoulder.</p><p>He punched her back, lightly, then took Colleen\u2019s hand.</p><p>Bryce smiled. \u201cSo you guys are really together again, huh? Good. I\u2019m so glad Coll and me hooking up didn\u2019t bother you, bro.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s heart stopped. Literally. She felt the blood drain to her feet, then flood back up as her pulse shot into the danger zone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare move.</p><p>No one else did, either, except Bryce, who waved to someone.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lucas said very, very quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, Colleen and me,\u201d Bryce answered, and oh, sphincter damn and blast, Colleen\u2019s legs turned to water.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you and Colleen?\u201d Paulie asked, her brows coming together.</p><p>Realization dawned on Bryce\u2019s perfect face. \u201cOh. Uh...um...nothing?\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked at Lucas, then immediately wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>This was very bad. Very, very bad.</p><p>\u201cDid you guys...date?\u201d Paulie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t, uh, call it dating,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really the time,\u201d Colleen began, her voice tight and strange.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWhat would you call it, Bryce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, um, I mean, we slept together, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>More silence, and then Paulie barked, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Lucas was granite-still.</p><p>\u201cThis definitely isn\u2019t the time,\u201d Colleen whispered.</p><p>Paulie\u2019s mouth was open. \u201cYou slept with Bryce, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>And the thing was, Paulie\u2019s inside voice was more of an outside voice, and Didi and the minister and Mr. and Mrs. Forbes froze, and the song on the speakers was \u201cYellow Ledbetter\u201d by Pearl Jam, for some reason, and who knew what that song was about, anyway?

Lucas, see you around.\u201d With that, she left.</p><p>Colleen swallowed. \u201cUm...\u201d</p> <p>Lucas was glaring at Bryce, who gave her a panicky glance, then looked back at his cousin. \u201cLucas, bud, uh, remember the time I saved you?\u201d</p><p>Then Lucas looked at her, and man, Colleen wished he hadn\u2019t, because those black eyes were burning into her, and so not in a good way. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this in private,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he said. He stood there a horribly long second, then turned and he walked out, dragging her heart behind him.</p><p>\u201cI have a bad feeling about this,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cBryce...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit, Coll, I\u2019m sorry. I mean, I just...my dad and stuff, I guess I was feeling sentimental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one time, and we both agreed never to mention it again! And come on! It wasn\u2019t exactly meaningful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he said.</p><p>She realized they were at his dad\u2019s wake, after all, and put her hand on his arm. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Bryce gave a half smile. \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t. I really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, which did nothing to slow her heart rate. \u201cWell, it\u2019s done. I should go. Hang in there, Bryce. I\u2019ll see you at the funeral.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry again, Coll.\u201d</p><p>And she knew he was. Bryce was a gentle idiot.</p><p>But not as much of an idiot as she was.</p><p>SIX YEARS AGO, for no good reason, Colleen typed Lucas Campbell, Chicago into Google.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. Every once in a while, she did it. He didn\u2019t have a Facebook page, or Twitter, like a normal person. But he was married to the daughter of one of Chicago\u2019s most prominent citizens, and there was mention of him once in a while.</p><p>She\u2019d seen their wedding write-up in the Chicago newspaper online. The bride was attended by her closest friend from Miss Porter\u2019s School, the article said, as well as the groom\u2019s sister and eldest niece. His twin nieces served as flower girls. The groom\u2019s best man was his cousin, Bryce Campbell. The reception was held at The Drake, where guests were treated to music by the Moonlight Jazz Orchestra. The renowned Sylvia Weinstock designed the cake. The bride\u2019s dress was custom-made by Isaac Mizrahi, a family friend. The couple had met in college. Lucas Campbell was a proud son of the South Side and worked for Forbes Properties in construction\u2014so much for law school, Colleen had thought, and why bother when you could marry into one of Chicago\u2019s wealthiest families?</p><p>But it didn\u2019t seem right. It didn\u2019t seem like him.</p><p>Then again, she didn\u2019t really know him as well as she\u2019d thought.</p> <p>After that, she vowed not to look ever again. Bryce was living out of town at the time, and Joe was kind enough not to mention Lucas when he came into the bar. If she didn\u2019t want to hear about Lucas, she didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Her iron resolve lasted about eight months, until her birthday when she drank an entire bottle of Blue Heron Chardonnay by herself, and looked up baby announcements on Google.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She looked again every few months after that, because for some masochistic reason, she wanted to know if Lucas had become a father. She didn\u2019t want to be slammed with that news when she was working at the bar, because she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to hide how she felt.</p><p>But there were no baby announcements. Not for two years, and Colleen finally stopped looking.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t help thinking about him. She and Faith discussed many times the unfair power of first love. After every guy who turned out to be less than Lucas, after every wine and roses festival that marked another year of not being with Lucas, Colleen missed him so much it felt as if her soul ached.</p><p>And then late one snowy night when she was practically alone in the bar, without any good reason, she looked him up on Google again, and boom. The Chicago Sun-Times came through.</p><p>He was laughing in the photo, and so was his wife. They looked gorgeous, her blond hair, his black. Ellen wore a yellow gown with chunky diamond studs in her ears, and Lucas, damn him to hell, looked like a high-class pirate in his tux, just slightly dangerous and utterly, horribly beautiful.</p><p>Lucas Campbell and Ellen Forbes-Campbell enjoy comments from the master of ceremonies at the annual Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital gala, the caption read.</p><p>Colleen couldn\u2019t look away, even though the picture made it feel like a branch was being rammed through her chest.</p><p>She still loved him.</p><p>What an idiot she was. She still loved a man who was having a marvelous time with his wife, far, far away.</p><p>She closed the site, deleted the browser history so Connor wouldn\u2019t know how pathetic she was, and went back into the bar, and there sat Bryce Campbell. For a second, he looked so damn much like Lucas that she shuddered with missing the boy who\u2019d once treasured her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bryce. What can I get you?\u201d</p><p>She pulled him a beer, and they chatted. Bryce was sweet. Easy. Uncomplicated. And there on a night when no one else was around, when Bryce had nowhere better to be and neither did she, it was nice to have a friend.</p><p>He walked her home, as the snow was heavy, and it was courtly of him. As he stood in front of her house, looking up at the sky, he asked, \u201cYou ever wish you left this town, Colleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said after a beat. \u201cBut yeah. Once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never really thought I\u2019d end up here. At my parents\u2019 house. I always figured I\u2019d be...I don\u2019t know. Cooler. Smarter.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he was asking, but he looked so sad. She reached up and brushed some snow from his hair. \u201cI think you\u2019re fine the way you are, Bryce,\u201d she said.</p><p>Then he kissed her.</p><p>Oh, sure, she knew it was insanely stupid. But then, on that quiet, lonely night, when if you looked at him a certain way, you might mistake Bryce for Lucas...when she had seen proof that Lucas was happy without her\u2014well, shit.</p><p>Two lonely people. A snowstorm. A few beers. The combination doesn\u2019t usually lead to the smartest decisions in the world, and sure enough, forty-two minutes later, Colleen hated herself.</p><p>And, to his credit, Bryce kind of hated himself, too.</p><p>\u201cThis was probably a mistake,\u201d he said, pulling his clothes back on.</p><p>\u201cYeah. No offense. But yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really nice, Coll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She wanted a shower, her skin was crawling so bad. Not because Bryce was disgusting...because it was so wrong. \u201cBryce, if we could just forget about this, I think that\u2019d be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Yeah. Definitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Lucas,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJesus, no. Listen. It\u2019s already forgotten, okay? I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>And that was it. Meaningless, mediocre, mistake. Bryce was no Lucas. Not even close. Worse than being a vengeful act on her part, it was pathetic. Colleen O\u2019Rourke, who was supposedly so smart about relationships, and so good with men, had been reduced to abject loneliness and shagged a guy who reminded her of her first love.</p><p>As for Bryce, well, he was all foam and no beer. He was an \u201cOh, look, shiny!\u201d type of guy, and she\u2019d been shiny.</p><p>So Colleen spent a miserable month or two. Bryce still came into the bar, and bless his heart, he really did seem to forget about it. There were no lingering looks, no simmering chemistry (please), and no signs of resentment whatsoever.</p><p>Eventually, Colleen shook it off. It was a lapse in judgment, that old familiar phrase, and not one she was going to make again. Time to get over Lucas Campbell. She\u2019d find someone else, eventually. No harm, no foul, and no one had to know about it.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>First stop was the Petrosinsky home. Paulie\u2019s father answered the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do now?\u201d he barked. \u201cShe\u2019s power-eating a bucket of Double Deep-Fried Buttermilk Bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Petrosinsky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cGo talk to her.\u201d He held open the door, and Colleen sidled past the statue of a rooster dressed like a butler and went up to Paulie\u2019s room. The door was open, and there was her friend, bucket in hand, eating, crying and watching Terminator 2 on her enormous TV.</p><p>\u201cPaulie?\u201d she said.</p><p>Paulie wadded up another tissue and tossed it toward the trash, where it joined its many brothers. \u201cCome on in,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Colleen tiptoed closer and sat on the edge of the massive bed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I never said anything,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Paulie gave her a watery glare, then glanced back at the TV. \u201cWant some chicken?\u201d</p><p>There was probably no better person on earth than Paulie Petrosinsky, and Colleen\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The chicken was horrifyingly good. She chewed and swallowed, watching Arnold\u2019s motorcycle outrun the 18-wheeler.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made a scene,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just...embarrassing. Like I could be with Bryce when he could get someone like you. I was shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulie, you\u2019re ten times better than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Look in the mirror, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks are meaningless.\u201d</p><p>Paulie snorted. \u201cRight. If I looked like you, Bryce would be climbing me like a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy looks have gotten me nowhere,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty, so what? I\u2019m single, and I\u2019ve had one meaningful relationship in my life, and everyone thinks I\u2019m the town slut and I let them. In fact, I like them thinking that. It\u2019s better than knowing I\u2019m kind of a wreck. Whereas everyone takes one look at you and they know how decent you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecent. A very decent virgin, so cry me a river,\u201d Paulie said, taking another piece of chicken. \u201cHave some more. This batter is made with crushed Frosted Flakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s so good,\u201d Colleen said, taking another massive breast. \u201cPaulie, I didn\u2019t say anything about Bryce because it was a mistake. A one-time mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it because you were mad at Lucas? Because it seems like a really shitty thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Colleen swallowed. \u201cNo. It was because I was lonely. I loved him, and he was married, and I was still stuck.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd really, really lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulie, I\u2019m so sorry it hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The other woman sighed and flopped back on the bed. On-screen, the cool, newer terminator stuck his arm into a nurse, killing her. \u201cOkay. I accept your apology, Coll. I mean, it sucks, picturing you beautiful people bumping uglies, but I appreciate you trying to get me with Bryce. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. Hope sucks.\u201d Paulie sighed again. \u201cThink Lucas will forgive you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really picture that right now.\u201d She lay on the bed, too. Paulie took her hand and squeezed it, then handed her the box of tissues.</p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve a friend like Paulie. But man, she sure would like to.</p><p>\u201cPaulie?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about sixth grade. I wish I\u2019d done better by you.\u201d</p><p>Paulie was quiet for a long minute. \u201cWell, no one else had the guts. I mean, yeah, I hated you for a while. But I watched you. You\u2019ve always been really nice.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colleen swallowed and wiped the tears that were trickling into her hair. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get off my bed and let me wallow. Shouldn\u2019t you go talk to Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get out of here.\u201d She sat up and handed Colleen another slab of chicken. \u201cTake this for the road.\u201d</p> <p>IT TOOK ALL the courage she had to knock on Lucas\u2019s door. Still, her hands were shaking. Legs, too. Throw heart on the list as well, because it was beating so fast it felt like a hummingbird\u2019s wings, and Colleen wasn\u2019t 100 percent sure she wasn\u2019t about to faint.</p><p>The door opened. It wasn\u2019t Lucas. It was Mercedes. \u201cHey, Colleen!\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cIs your uncle here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hang on. Uncle Lucas!\u201d she bellowed, making Colleen jump. \u201cYour girlfriend is here!\u201d She turned back to Colleen. \u201cSorry, but you guys are totally obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>Mercedes gave her a strange look\u2014Weren\u2019t you good at conversation once?\u2014and then left, and there he was, filling the doorway with scalding vats of testosterone.</p><p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>It actually felt like his eyes were burning her. He turned, said something to Stephanie, and stepped into the hall.</p><p>\u201cCan we go somewhere more private?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Not a great start. Then again, he had reason to be furious.</p><p>He stood with his arms folded, looking at her, his face blank.</p><p>Colleen took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, well, this is very awkward.\u201d She started to gnaw on her thumbnail, then put her hand down. \u201cUm...so yes, I did sleep with Bryce once. It didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cIt was a long time ago, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that excuse it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lucas. I wish to God I hadn\u2019t done it, we both do, Bryce and I, and it really meant\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of men to sleep with in this town, Colleen. From what you\u2019ve told me, you know that very well.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked back. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Feels that way. I feel quite judged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my cousin.\u201d His voice was like acid.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t just your cousin, I mean, it wasn\u2019t because he was your cousin, but also, yeah, he wasn\u2019t the only one that I, uh...\u201d Great. Here came the Tourette\u2019s of Terror again. \u201cWhat I mean is, he wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about all the men you\u2019ve slept with, Colleen!\u201d he barked. Someone in the apartment across the hall muted the TV. Couldn\u2019t blame them.</p><p>She twisted her hands together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI really am, Lucas. But don\u2019t forget you were married at the time. Married! It\u2019s not like I cheated on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis entire summer, you haven\u2019t said a word. You knew this would matter to me. You had to know, but instead, you let me make an idiot of myself.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and swallowed against the sharp knot in her throat. \u201cHow does being with me make you an idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s been answered tonight. At the wake. In the funeral home. In front of the minister. And my former in-laws.\u201d</p><p>She went to bite her nail again, then clenched her hands. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, Lucas. I\u2019m not perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not on my list of adjectives for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stop being mean! It was wrong, I know that, believe me. But I was just trying to find someone after you got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up with me, Colleen. Remember? It was get married or get lost, your way or the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you quote Road House to me. I\u2019ve seen every Patrick Swayze movie ever made.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that glittered with fury. \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, Colleen. You can\u2019t take anything seriously. Not us, not Bryce, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m nervous! I\u2019m taking this very seriously!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with my cousin. You\u2019re the only one who knew what Bryce did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, how he saved your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I had, he wanted, and God forbid Bryce had to go without anything. Even you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an ice cream cone, Lucas. It\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took away my last chance to see my father, Colleen! And my God, he slept with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s just...let\u2019s just settle down. What about what you said the other night? About us? That matters, too, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d She bit her thumbnail, the small sharp pain the only thing feeling real right now.</p><p>Lucas almost smiled. Not in a good way. \u201cYou mean, how I said you were the only thing that was really mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I guess I was wrong about that, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but his eyes weren\u2019t exactly brimming with forgiveness, either, and Colleen felt the last of her hope leak out of her. Paulie was right. Hope sucked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have a great time being holy and perfect, Lucas. Good luck with that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were flat.</p><p>\u201cThat was sarcasm. You\u2019re not perfect, you know. You never told me you loved me. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing, too, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her heart, which had taken so damn long to heal over, split right in half again. Without another word, she turned and left before she started sobbing.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d ruin her all over again. And she\u2019d been right.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>\u201cDUDE, YOU\u2019RE NOT mad, are you?\u201d Bryce asked for what had to be the thirtieth time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Lucas said through gritted teeth, willing his hands not to curl into fists. Didi smirked.</p><p>They were in the limo en route to the church for Joe\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cBecause you know...it was just sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Colleen, you know how she is. She kinda gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to beat you up, Bryce?\u201d he growled. \u201cOn the day of your father\u2019s funeral? Because if you say another word, I will.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say that about her.\u201d</p><p>Bryce slumped back against the seat of the limo. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is something of a tramp,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>\u201cDidi, shut up, or you can walk the rest of the way to church. I\u2019m the one paying for this funeral, after all.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of money, Didi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cReally, Lucas. No need to be rude.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother answering.</p><p>\u201cMom, you should stick around,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cYou really going to Wisconsin tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, sweetie, you know how I am. I\u2019d rather do my grieving privately. And I had vacation time to use up.\u201d</p><p>Lucas suspected she was already on the prowl for a new husband. Play the widow card ASAP. She wouldn\u2019t be around for the reading of Joe\u2019s will, either. Bryce was still unaware of how much he\u2019d inherit, and that Lucas would be trustee.</p><p>Lucas wouldn\u2019t need to stick around, either. The will was straightforward, with only a sealed letter from Joe addressed to Bryce.</p><p>There was no letter for him.</p><p>They pulled up to the church. Bryce and Lucas were both pallbearers, along with four of Joe\u2019s friends, two from college, two from Manningsport. They slid the casket from the back of the hearse and lifted it, carrying it slowly into the cool stone church.</p><p>This was the last thing he\u2019d do for Joe. He was leaving after the funeral, and honestly, he\u2019d be glad to get away.</p><p>The church was packed. There were Steph and the girls, all of them weepy. Faith and Levi, Tom and Honor. Gerard and the pretty woman from the bakery. Everett and Emmaline, the Manningsport cops, and the mayor. The woman who lived on his floor and watched Game of Thrones all the time. Jeremy Lyon, who\u2019d been Joe\u2019s primary doctor, and Jeremy\u2019s boyfriend, whom Lucas had met one night at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Paulie Petrosinsky, wearing a long black sweater that dangled almost to the floor, stood in the back, as the church was packed. She gave him a sad smile, and he nodded in return.</p><p>Everyone had loved Smiling Joe.</p><p>And there was Colleen, sitting with her family\u2014her mother, Connor and her little sister.</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>They set the casket down, and the minister began. Mercedes did a reading, from the Bible, and Stephanie read a sad poem by Robert Frost.</p><p>Then it came time for the eulogy. Bryce stood up, took his notes from his pocket with shaking hands and went onto the altar.</p><p>He cleared his throat. Took a deep breath. \u201cMy dad...my dad...my dad was...\u201d</p><p>And then Bryce was crying so hard he bent over. He tried to get control of himself, failed, and just clung to the podium, sobbing.</p><p>Any anger Lucas had toward him\u2014over Colleen, over Bryce\u2019s easy, shallow life, over the love that was so endlessly showered on him and that seemed so taken for granted\u2014evaporated.</p><p>Bryce was just a big kid. A big, sweet, dopey kid who wasn\u2019t sure how to be an adult.</p><p>Lucas got up and went to his cousin. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he said softly, putting his arm around Bryce\u2019s shoulders and pulling him away a few steps. \u201cHey. You can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d Bryce sobbed.</p><p>Lucas pulled him into a full hug. \u201cSure, you can. You need to. For your dad, and for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Bryce wiped his eyes on the heels of his hands. \u201cWill you do it for me?\u201d he asked. \u201cRead what I wrote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is yours. You can do it.\u201d</p><p>Bryce looked at him with his blue eyes, so like Joe\u2019s, swallowed and nodded.</p><p>Then Lucas squeezed his shoulders and sat down again, stepping over Didi without looking at her.</p><p>Bryce took a shuddering breath. \u201cMan, this is hard,\u201d he said, and a sympathetic laugh rose from the congregation. \u201cMy dad was...well, he wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHe made mistakes. He was kind of lazy. But he loved me. He loved his family, and he loved the White Sox.\u201d This got a few laughs. \u201cHe always wanted what was best for me. I can\u2019t remember a single time my dad was mad at me, or yelled at me. Maybe he should have. I mean, I got away with murder.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh, and Lucas felt himself smile a little, too.</p><p>\u201cMy dad just didn\u2019t have it in him, though. He was never impatient, and he always seemed to be smiling. He was smart, too, a lot smarter than he let on. He probably could\u2019ve done more with his life, but he was content with what he had.\u201d</p><p>Steph leaned forward. \u201cSounds like Dad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lucas had been thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cThe best thing about my father, though,\u201d Bryce continued, \u201cwas that he always saw the best in people. He wasn\u2019t fooled by what was on the outside. He knew who the good guys were.\u201d There was a long pause. Bryce was no longer crying, though...he was looking toward the back of the church. Staring.</p><p>Then he looked back at his notes. \u201cI have a lot to do if I want to be even half the guy he was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna try.\u201d He looked to the ceiling. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d His voice broke again. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Then Bryce left the altar and walked past the first pew and kept going until he reached the back of the church. He went straight to Paulie, whispered something, and took her hand and kissed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet us pray,\u201d said the minister.</p><p>THE RECEPTION WAS held at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, as Joe had requested. There was a sign on the door: Closed for Private Function. Colleen\u2019s cousins were manning the bar, but she was there, making sure things got done, giving directions, bustling in and out of the kitchen. She looked different, her hair pulled up into a sleek twist, a high-necked, sleeveless black dress.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t smiling. More than anything, that was the difference.</p><p>He tried not to look at her. Visions of her kissing Bryce, pulling off Bryce\u2019s shirt, underneath Bryce\u2014no. He couldn\u2019t go there. Not now. Last night, he hadn\u2019t slept a minute, tormented by those same thoughts, but today was about Joe.</p> <p>Drinks were flowing, toasts were made, food was served. Someone put the jukebox on, and it became festive as people told stories about Joe.</p><p>His uncle would\u2019ve loved this.</p><p>Bryce looked happier, too. Lucas checked in on him from time to time, told him the eulogy was perfect. He had an arm around Paulie, who was attractively flushed. \u201cGood to see you, Paulie,\u201d Lucas said as Bryce listened to one of the college friends telling him about a prank Joe had pulled.</p><p>\u201cGood to be seen,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cThanks for giving him a second chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like a fourteenth chance, but I think he could be worth it this time.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. You deserve a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m that smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, gesturing with her Genesee to Colleen, who was hefting a crate of glasses. \u201cWhat are you gonna do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He felt his blood pressure rising.</p> <p>\u201cAll I can say is,\u201d Paulie continued, \u201cshe\u2019s been a good friend. And in her own special way, she\u2019s a ball of insecurities, Lucas, but so aren\u2019t we all, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Seemed as if he was looking at Colleen again. And she was looking back. She nodded at something someone said, then started over, weaving her way through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHey, Paulie,\u201d she said, biting her thumbnail. Her eyes were on him, though.</p><p>\u201cHey, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Lucas. Bryce. Um...it was a lovely service.\u201d She seemed on the cusp of saying more, but Didi shoved past her.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Didi said, \u201cI need a word with you.\u201d She elbowed her way past Paulie and took her son\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSure, Ma.\u201d</p><p>Didi whispered into Bryce\u2019s ear.</p> <p>Bryce jerked back. \u201cNo way, Mom. You have it backward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it very much, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>Bryce looked at Paulie. \u201cNo. You\u2019re definitely wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Didi said, her voice getting harder, \u201cdo you really want to be with someone called the Chicken Princess? You can do better.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s face went purple with embarrassment. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said with terrible dignity. She turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you move a muscle,\u201d Bryce said, gently grabbing her arm and pulling her closer. He turned to his mother. \u201cNo, Mom, I can\u2019t. Paulie is a great person. You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said sharply. People were quieting down around him. \u201cYou judge everything on how much it cost or how it looks. Where have you been these past two weeks while Dad was dying? What kind of a wife leaves then, huh? Paulie has been a great friend to me, and if I want to date her, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like your father,\u201d Didi said, her voice dripping with contempt. \u201cBefriending every loser who comes along.\u201d</p><p>Bryce stood up straighter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t give me a higher compliment, Ma. And you\u2019re the one who\u2019s losing.\u201d</p><p>With that, Bryce took Paulie by the shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he said, and without further ado, he kissed her. Hard. Paulie\u2019s hands flapped a little (like a chicken, Lucas couldn\u2019t help thinking), then settled on Bryce\u2019s waist. Bryce pulled back, then kissed her again, more gently this time.</p><p>Lucas looked at Colleen. She was smiling, just a little, at Bryce and Paulie, and for some reason, it sliced him in half.</p><p>It was time for him to go.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>COLLEEN WAS CLEANING the bar the next morning at ten, indulging in the healing powers of Clorox Clean-Up, when a knock came at the door.</p><p>It was Bryce.</p><p>She opened it. \u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked...great.</p><p>And he was wearing the black Thneed.</p><p>In a weird way, it had a certain metrosexual charm on him, dangling over his tank-top T-shirt and gym shorts.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that sweater mean what I think it means?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cA gentleman doesn\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ironic to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, actually. I wanted to apologize for ruining things with you and Lucas.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo. I should\u2019ve told him. But I figured it would only hurt him, and here we are, hurt anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I fix that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you? Because that would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Sphincter. She figured he would, but damn and blast, the words made her eyes well anyway.</p><p>\u201cI also wanted to thank you for helping me notice Paulie. She told me about it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You\u2019re a lucky guy, Bryce. She\u2019s a really, really great person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like how you told off your mom, by the way. High time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It felt kinda good. I\u2019m moving out, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into the Chicken Palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cToo early for that. I\u2019m taking Lucas\u2019s apartment in the opera house. Talked to the landlady this morning. Now that I have a job and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Connor came in. \u201cHey, Bryce. Sorry again about Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Bryce\u2019s eyes filled, but he slapped the counter and stood up. \u201cI should get going. Got Menopause Boot Camp in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s in that, by the way,\u201d Colleen told her brother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a saint, Bryce,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cWord, brother. Word.\u201d With that, he smiled again and left, the Thneed tails flapping rakishly behind him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Connor said. \u201cGet to work, you lazy whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard about Bryce, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for years.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth wobbled. \u201cNot one of my better moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Lucas taking it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. I love that ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get a life. Has anyone told you you\u2019re unhealthily attached to me, brother mine? What\u2019s today\u2019s special, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever my heartbroken sissy wants.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cJust when I\u2019m ready to put you up for adoption, you go and say something like that. Turkey club, crispy bacon, and that horseradish and basil mayonnaise I love. See? You are good for something.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT WEEK crawled by. Colleen went running with Rufus in the town conservation land where her pup could put his ridiculously long legs to use and gallop through the meadows, returning covered in pollen and happiness. She took Savannah for a private boxing lesson with Tom Barlow, and her sister was elated afterward. Then they watched Harry Potter and ate veggies and hummus, with just one small brownie each afterward. Gail had a point about how Colleen spoiled Savannah with food, and Colleen was trying to do better. Not to be a Nazi about it...just to be more aware.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t call. Didn\u2019t email. Didn\u2019t text. Didn\u2019t send flowers, didn\u2019t send a dead squirrel in a box.</p><p>She started to write to him a dozen times. Stood in the shower, talking aloud, trying to find the words that would make everything right.</p><p>The words didn\u2019t come.</p><p>Paulie came in for happy hour on Tuesday. She looked the same\u2014love hadn\u2019t changed anything about her on the outside, which was oddly reassuring. \u201cSo the whole Chicken King\u2019s virgin daughter...\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cThe title no longer applies,\u201d Paulie said, holding her hand up for a high five.</p><p>Colleen laughed. \u201cThink you guys will work out? Now that you\u2019ve seen him up close and personal?\u201d</p><p>Paulie pulled a protein drink from her gym bag, twisted off the cap and took a chug. \u201cPour a little vodka in that, what do you say?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>With a wince, Colleen obliged. Worse than Mom\u2019s 7-Up and white Zin.</p><p>Paulie took a sip and sighed with satisfaction. \u201cThings are great,\u201d she said. \u201cBryce is the sweetest man on earth. He cooked me a cheeseburger last night, heated up some French fries, and guess what? He inherited a shitload of money, and he\u2019s donating a huge lump to the animal shelter. He could\u2019ve bought a Maserati or Porsche, but no, he put some in a nice mutual fund. And he\u2019s taking classes to become a real trainer.\u201d She chugged some more of her unusual cocktail. \u201cSeems like everyone kind of underestimated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept me.\u201d She smiled proudly.</p><p>\u201cHe seems smitten.\u201d</p><p>Paulie\u2019s smile was so bright that it could power a good-sized car. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best. Got any sex tips for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, sister. My advice days are over. But you know who would? Prudence Vanderbeek. She\u2019s in the back booth there with Honor. Go on, ask her. You\u2019ll make her day.\u201d</p><p>WHEN SHE COULDN\u2019T avoid it any longer, Colleen went to see her mom. Dear old Mother had been silent lately, not using her typical guilt-trip tactics of stopping by the bar looking homeless, or texting things like Have you been in an accident? I haven\u2019t heard from you in weeks. Is this still your phone number?</p><p>The silence was not reassuring.</p><p>She pulled into the driveway, and woe unto her, saw Dad\u2019s stupid Porsche Cayenne, meant to advertise his lowering testosterone levels and thinning hair. Well. She may as well face both parents at once.</p><p>She went inside. \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d Mom said. \u201cYour father\u2019s naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! Haven\u2019t I had enough psychological trauma for one summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m painting him,\u201d Mom said. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a twist. It\u2019s safe now, come in, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Feeling very much like Sisyphus shoving his rock, Colleen approached. \u201cHello, parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. Nude modeling, huh? I would\u2019ve thought the car and another divorce would cover your male menopause.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cShe asked me to pose, and I wanted to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter late than never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Collie?\u201d Mom asked. She wore a paint-smeared, oversize shirt, leggings and bare feet. Two inches of gray roots showed on her head. She looked relaxed, which wasn\u2019t the typical case when Dad was around.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s cut to the chase,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cAre you guys really getting back together? Is Gail the Tail over?\u201d</p><p>Dad didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWould it be a bad thing, honey?\u201d Mom asked carefully.</p><p>Colleen looked at her father a long minute. There was no going back to the vision of her father as some kind of rock star among fathers. He was a shallow, selfish man.</p><p>He always had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The realization lifted a weight off her heart. Oddly enough, she suddenly felt fond of her father. That being said...</p><p>\u201cI think you could do a lot better, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, Colleen,\u201d her father said wearily. \u201cI think I deserve a little more gratitude, having raised you and put you through college, but I suppose it\u2019s more fun to demonize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Demonize\u2019 sounds cooler than you deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, Dad. You\u2019re a man who doesn\u2019t appreciate what he has, and thinks he has carte blanche to pop in and out of people\u2019s lives when he feels like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you for that assessment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were a crappy father to Connor and me. You were condescending toward Mom, and you only paid attention to us when you felt like it, not when we needed it. And the second the Tail got pregnant with Savannah, all we were was inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were also adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t miss you, Dad. Even if you were an ass and remain an ass to this day. So far as I can tell, you have one redeeming quality. You\u2019re great with Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Anyway, I\u2019m just here to say hi. I love you both, even if you drive me crazy. Mom, let\u2019s have lunch this week, okay? Get back to your disgusting hobbies, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWait a second.\u201d She was frowning, looking at Dad. \u201cColleen has a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cWhat point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor ten years,\u201d Mom said slowly, \u201cI would\u2019ve given my right arm to have you back. I loved you, I missed you, and I would\u2019ve forgiven anything.\u201d She looked around the studio, which was so much brighter and cleaner and happier since Lucas had redone it. \u201cBut Collie\u2019s right. I deserve better.\u201d She looked surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want you anymore, Pete. These past two weeks have been a little...boring, actually. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d Dad said. \u201cAll this renaissance woman thing you\u2019ve been doing, the painting and the new clothes...I thought that was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Colleen said.</p> <p>Dad ignored her. \u201cI thought getting rid of my stuff and making this ridiculous studio was to get my attention, and you did, Jeanette! You succeeded. You\u2019ve become an interesting woman, and I still find you attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, the thing is,\u201d Colleen said, \u201cshe\u2019s always been an interesting woman, and she\u2019s always been attractive, dummy. You just stopped noticing. Come on. We can walk out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Pete,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be Colleen and Connor\u2019s parents, after all. No need to be uncivil. Maybe we can even be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be friends,\u201d Dad said. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, no one cares,\u201d Colleen said, taking his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>HER FATHER CAUGHT up with her a week after Mom had dumped his scrawny white Irish ass, knocking on her door on her night off, just as she was digging into a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said.</p><p>In the three years she\u2019d lived here, he\u2019d never been over to visit.</p> <p>\u201cCute place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Have a seat.\u201d She paused the Bradley Cooper movie she had been about to watch (for the fifth time) and told Rufus to get his nose out of Dad\u2019s crotch. The dog reluctantly obeyed, then trotted off to her bedroom for a power nap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d she asked, taking a bite of the ice cream.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Colleen,\u201d he said irritably, not looking at her, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a better father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice. I accept expensive gifts. Cars, for example. Islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be serious?\u201d He sighed and ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. \u201cLook. I thought I was a pretty good father, up until the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp until the cheating, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever hear that expression? The best thing a man can do for his children is love their mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But let me finish, okay?\u201d He fixed her with a look. \u201cI was always very proud of you and Connor. You were good kids. Smart and funny. I guess I didn\u2019t show that enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hard to know how to deal with you after the divorce. I was afraid you\u2019d cut me out of your life completely, so I tried to get ready for that. Connor did it right away, and I was steeling myself for losing you.\u201d</p><p>Much to Colleen\u2019s shock, her father\u2019s voice broke.</p><p>\u201cI know I disappointed you, Collie. I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Gail was pregnant, and I had to focus on that.\u201d He bowed his head. \u201cI was always grateful that you took to Savannah. Babysat her and all that. I got to see you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYou can see me other ways, too. We can have lunch and go for a run and that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor...he still can\u2019t tolerate me.\u201d Her father\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Colleen reached out for her father\u2019s hand. \u201cKeep trying,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you two. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her poor father. Yep. Poor Dad. Emotionally strangled by testosterone and trying to be fabulous.</p><p>Nice that he\u2019d been force-fed a dose of humility, and by Mom of all people.</p><p>\u201cWant some ice cream?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can stay for the movie, too.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a grateful look. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>THREE WEEKS BACK in Chicago, and Lucas was still edgy and irritable. Sitting at his computer in the apartment he\u2019d lived in since the divorce wasn\u2019t as rewarding as he\u2019d imagined it would be. His desk was impressive, his Mac expensive, his chair comfortable. The apartment was immaculate, thanks to the cleaning lady who came in once a week.</p><p>But aside from the photos of his nieces and a few of their drawings on the fridge, the place was...soulless, and Lucas wondered how he\u2019d missed that. The furniture was fine, the walls were off-white, the kitchen counters were granite. Everything was new and still rather shiny.</p><p>Not like the opera house apartment, with its hundred-year-old floors and the smell of bread from Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery. And not like Colleen\u2019s old Victorian with the tall, narrow windows and crotch-sniffing dog. And red couch. And soft bed.</p><p>Yeah. No. Best not to think those thoughts.</p><p>He\u2019d left Forbes Properties for good; the only thing left was the building dedication, and who really cared about that stuff? Lucas was proud of the building and how smoothly it had gone up, but he wasn\u2019t the architect, and he wasn\u2019t the owner. He\u2019d always love the Forbes family; he\u2019d always stay in touch, but his time was over.</p><p>Steph would be working for his new company, which would finally get his full attention now. He\u2019d already been approached about general contracting a senior housing development and a corporate headquarters on the outskirts of town.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t what he really wanted to do. He wanted, simply, to build houses for regular people. Steph rolled her eyes at this because of course the big money was in bigger properties\u2014strip malls and shopping centers. But strip malls wouldn\u2019t be the kind of thing he would proudly point out to a future son or daughter and say, \u201cSee that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and the Supercuts? Daddy built that.\u201d</p><p>Not that he was going to be a father anytime soon.</p><p>The image of the meadow back in Manningsport kept inserting itself into his brain, usually around two in the morning. Where the porch would face, the way the deer would wander through the yard. How he could build a slate patio in the back so sitting out there, you\u2019d hear the sound of the river that led to Keuka. The maple tree that would be perfect for a swing.</p><p>There was no meadow on a hill in this area; there was only flatness. And heat. Two months away, and the heat of the Midwest got baked into him like never before, and he found himself thinking about the nights in New York when it had been cold enough to sleep with a blanket to keep you warm.</p><p>Or a woman.</p><p>Or a woman and her dog, more accurately.</p><p>And then thoughts of Bryce and her would slice through that pretty image.</p><p>His buzzer rang, and Lucas got up from the computer. Crap, it was already dark, and he still hadn\u2019t eaten. \u201cHello,\u201d he said in the intercom.</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s Bryce.\u201d</p><p>Speak of the devil. \u201cCome on up.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hadn\u2019t heard much from him since the funeral, other than his shock that he was now a wealthy man. If he was smart (and Lucas intended to make sure he would be), Joe\u2019s money could keep Bryce modestly comfortable for life.</p><p>He opened the door, and there was his cousin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, bro?\u201d Bryce said, hugging him.</p><p>Bryce had brought a six-pack, which was a first. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t call. I wanted to see you. Just jumped in the car and drove to the airport, grabbed a cab here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p><p>They ordered a pizza (\u201cNothing like Chicago pie,\u201d Bryce said happily) and opened a couple beers. Lucas listened as Bryce told him his plans for the future; he was getting his personal trainer\u2019s license and was thinking about possibly opening a women-only gym (which would be a frickin\u2019 gold mine, let\u2019s be honest). Still washing dogs and finding them homes. He and Paulie were still together, really happy, having lots of fun. Didi was back in Manningsport and kind of a pain, always dropping by unannounced, but Bryce hadn\u2019t given her a key, so at least she couldn\u2019t come barging into his place at the opera house.</p><p>\u201cSounds like things are good,\u201d Lucas said, clearing their plates.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I might need you to free up some money from my trust fund,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cFor the gym. I\u2019m working on getting a business plan. Paulie and her dad are helping me, and you\u2019re smart about that stuff. Maybe you could take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d His cousin paused. \u201cSo about...you know. Colleen. You over that, dude?\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked at his beer and didn\u2019t answer for a minute. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that...\u201d He broke off. That I loved her, he\u2019d been about to say.</p><p>Bryce gave a sad smile. \u201cYeah. It occurred to me. But you were gone and married and living the life, right? And Colleen and I were still in Manningsport, and the thing was, I always liked her, from high school on. I mean, I\u2019m a straight guy. Straight guys love Colleen. Gay guys, too, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you had no problem taking her to bed.\u201d</p><p>Bryce sat back in the leather chair and looked at him. \u201cYou ever wonder what it was like to be your cousin? You were the smart one. The cool one. You were from the South Side, and that was all my dad ever talked about, the good old days, life in Chicago. I was some spoiled kid from the \u2019burbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life wasn\u2019t really that great, Bryce. Mother dead, father in prison, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still you were better at everything. I don\u2019t know if you remember that first day of school in Manningsport, walking into that classroom. And there was the prettiest girl in town, and she was staring at you like she\u2019d been blind up until that second.\u201d</p><p>Lucas remembered, all right.</p><p>\u201cShe was the one mistake you made, wasn\u2019t she? Leaving her, marrying Ellen?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo yeah,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cI hooked up with her, but to be honest, I have no idea why she hooked up with me. Even then, it was pretty obvious she was still hung up on you. She just looked so lonely that night.\u201d</p><p>The thought made his chest hurt. Colleen, who was always so bright and smiling\u2014lonely, even with her twin, her friends, her sister. Lonely, because he made her that way.</p><p>His eyes stung suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I did it,\u201d Bryce said, and his voice was gentle. \u201cI took advantage of her being sad. I think I just wanted to see what it\u2019d be like to be you, just for a little while. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas looked at him, the cousin who\u2019d always looked up to him, who\u2019d always wanted what he had.</p><p>The cousin who had risked his life to save him, that day on the tracks.</p><p>\u201cAre we okay, Lucas?\u201d Bryce asked.</p><p>Lucas got up from the couch and hugged him. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because there\u2019s another reason I\u2019m here.\u201d He reached into his backpack, pulled out a small box and handed it to Lucas. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas opened it.</p><p>It was Joe\u2019s silver pocket watch. The Civil War watch, handed from father to son for five generations now.</p><p>Warm and heavy in his hand, the watch\u2019s curling design was faint but still legible. Lucas opened it. The numbers were elaborate and old-fashioned.</p><p>On the inside of the cover, the engraving read To My Cherished Son from Your Loving Father.</p><p>\u201cThis is your watch, Bryce,\u201d Lucas said, clearing his throat. Could his cousin honestly not want this? \u201cIt\u2019s been passed down from father to son since the 1860s.\u201d</p><p>Bryce pulled a piece of paper from his knapsack and handed it over. \u201cAbout halfway down.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas took the paper, the sight of Joe\u2019s blocky handwriting giving him a pang.</p><p>Lucas won\u2019t need anything, but take care of him anyway. I want him to have the Civil War watch, Bryce. I hope you don\u2019t mind, but he deserves it. He\u2019s always been such a good son to me, and a wonderful brother to you.</p><p>Make sure you stay close with him. I always missed my own brother so much. Picture me with your uncle Dan, okay, son?</p><p>There was more, but Lucas couldn\u2019t see it, because suddenly his eyes were full of tears.</p><p>Maybe Joe hadn\u2019t sent him out of the room because he hadn\u2019t wanted him there. Maybe Bryce just needed to get his father\u2019s final blessing, when Lucas had had it all along.</p><p>LUCAS AND STEPHANIE took Bryce out for breakfast the next day at Lula\u2019s, then put him in a cab to the airport.</p><p>\u201cI love that idiot,\u201d Stephanie said. \u201cGranted, I couldn\u2019t spend more than a day with him, but he\u2019s sweet. Gorgeous, too. Man! We have an amazing gene pool, us Campbells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>His sister fixed him with an irritated stare. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You look like the dog died, and you don\u2019t even have a dog. This is about Colleen, isn\u2019t it? So she screwed Bryce. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. You men. You irritate me. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be. By the way, I hate to tell you this, but I\u2019m staying with Forbes. Frank doubled my salary and gave me a promotion. Sayonara, sonny.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hands. \u201cWow. Thanks, Steph. Family loyalty and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m a single mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I vaguely remember.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know how Frank is. The job offer includes college tuition for the girls and a month of vacation to start. I already have the Rolls Royce health benefits, that freaking amazing gym, and now a wardrobe allowance at Bergdorf. You can\u2019t do that for me, youngster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad would be extremely disappointed in you, you materialistic monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to the hand. The face is planning to take the girls to St. Croix.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t want me working for you. I\u2019d take over in about half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re free to leave and go back to Manningsport.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause (a) I hate it there, and (b) you\u2019re here. You and the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, (a) you\u2019re insane, because that place is f**king paradise, not to mention much better weather, and (b) have they not invented phones? FaceTime? Skype? Planes? Trains? Automobiles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ll really miss me.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him hard. \u201cGet out of town, Lucas. Go get married and make me an aunt, for crying out loud. I gotta run. Chloe has a half day. Love you, bye, sorry I took a better offer, call me from New York.\u201d She pecked him on the cheek. \u201cOh, by the way, I thought of your new slogan.\u201d She paused for dramatic effect. \u201cCampbell Construction\u2014It\u2019s Time to Come Home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>ANOTHER FRIDAY NIGHT happy hour at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, and Colleen was doing her thing. Con was in the kitchen. They\u2019d already sold out of the tuna tacos. The Hollands took up two tables, and the fire department was having another of their \u201cmeetings,\u201d which seemed to involve a contest for the filthiest joke involving a hose or a pole or both. Jessica Dunn was ahead by a mile.</p><p>Connor had broken up with his mystery woman. He wasn\u2019t heartbroken, and Colleen once again had high hopes for Jess. Even now, Connor was giving her the eye. About time he listened to his sister.</p><p>Mother Dear was on a date in the back of the pub (drinking her disgusting white Zin and 7-Up) and discussing art with Ronnie Petrosinsky. Poultry art, specifically, though Mom was still extolling the thrill of painting nudes. Savannah had just left with Gail; Gail was debating whether or not to take Dad back.</p><p>As for Bryce and Paulie, Coll was thinking she\u2019d wear violet as maid of honor, because it seemed as if those two were just a matter of time.</p><p>Lucas would be best man, of course.</p><p>Best not to think of him, but her throat tightened just the same.</p><p>\u201cColleen, would you make me one of those grapefruit gimlet thingies I had last time?\u201d Louise asked, and Colleen snapped back to attention.</p><p>She made drinks, pulled beers, wiped up spills, flirted with the patrons and made sure Monica and Hannah didn\u2019t need help bringing out orders. She called Rushing Creek to check on Gramp. Joanie, his favorite nurse, said he was sleeping comfortably.</p><p>Maybe Coll would stop by later.</p><p>She turned to check on Jessica and the gang to see if they needed anything, and there was Lucas.</p><p>For a second, it seemed as though she was imagining him, his dark eyes and curling hair and rough, fallen angel beauty.</p><p>But no, Carol Robinson walked past him, patted his ass, and said, \u201cHi, hottie,\u201d and he smiled a little, not looking away from Colleen, and good God, the smile just nailed her to the spot.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to. He was here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and her eyes filled with a rush and spilled right over. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sorry, m\u00eda.\u201d</p><p>That word never failed to get her, and he damn well knew it.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she whispered. Couldn\u2019t manage anything else.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said.</p><p>The bar was quieting, and Colleen realized that yes, she had four beer glasses in her hands and hadn\u2019t moved, and this was quite unusual, and maybe people were catching on, and what was she wearing, anyway, heck, it didn\u2019t matter, probably, at least there was the push-up bra, because every day there was a push-up bra, and Lucas was here, and he was sorry.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever be the same.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Colleen,\u201d he said, and no, she wouldn\u2019t be the same, not ever.</p><p>Then Hannah took the glasses from her, but still Colleen couldn\u2019t move, but her breath was jerking a little, and those tears just kept slipping down her cheeks.</p><p>Then Connor was there, behind the bar with her, and he put a protective arm around her shoulders. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry your sister,\u201d Lucas answered, his eyes on her still, those deep, dark eyes that always said so much.</p><p>Connor bristled. \u201cOver my cold, dead, stiff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Connor,\u201d she said, and with that, she scootched up on the bar, swung her legs over and then Lucas had her in his arms, and she was crying and laughing, and Lucas\u2019s face was against her neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet me come home to you, m\u00eda. Marry me. I\u2019ll beg if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so tempting, but you know me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m easy.\u201d</p><p>Then she kissed him, and a cheer went up from the gang, and Colleen held her man tight, the one she\u2019d been waiting for, the only man she ever loved.</p><p>She pulled back, and Lucas wiped her eyes and kissed her forehead, and Colleen turned to the crowd. Faith was crying, Tom Barlow winked, Mom was blowing her nose into a napkin.</p><p>Then she kissed Lucas again and felt him smile against her mouth, and hugged him hard.</p><p>She looked over to see her brother smiling, albeit grudgingly I guess I can live with it.</p><p>Thanks, brother mine.</p><p>\u201cDrinks are on the house!\u201d he called.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>IN THE GREAT tradition of the O\u2019Rourke and Campbell families, Colleen got pregnant before she got married.</p><p>The Hollands had offered her the beautiful stone barn for her wedding, but Colleen wanted it held on the land she and Lucas had just bought\u2014a couple of acres of hilltop meadow, Keuka glinting dark and blue in the distance, the vine-covered hills of Blue Heron to the east. Next week, construction would start on their home; they hoped to be in before the baby came. But for today, there was a white tent on the property, and Rufus galloped around the field, chasing Faith\u2019s dog and Paulie\u2019s fat little pug and dirty-mop dog.</p><p>It was a sparkling October afternoon, the sky a heart-wrenching blue, the red and gold leaves glowing on the hills. It would be a simple wedding\u2014a tent, a justice of the peace, lots of good food (nachos, of course) and drinks and music.</p><p>Savannah was her maid of honor, and Bryce was best man, Faith and Paulie were bridesmaids. Mom had a date\u2014Ronnie (he\u2019d given them a lifetime pass for free chicken at any Chicken King franchise, and Colleen seemed to have a craving for it, now that she was six weeks knocked up). Dad and Gail were there in the second row, right behind Mom, not quite back together, not quite separated.</p><p>All the people Colleen loved, except one.</p><p>Gramp had finally slipped away, about two weeks after Lucas proposed. Colleen and Connor had been there, and Dad, too, Colleen with her head on Gramp\u2019s chest, crying quietly because even though it was more than his time, and she firmly believed he\u2019d be in a better place, she\u2019d miss him terribly.</p><p>It occurred to her, late that sad night as Lucas held her close and stroked her hair, that maybe on some level, Gramp had waited for her to be taken care of. That maybe he knew she and Lucas had finally found their way back to each other, and felt he could leave her now. That all this time when she\u2019d been taking care of him, he\u2019d been taking care of her, too.</p><p>But while pregnancy was making her weepier than normal, today was a happy, happy day.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty, yadda yadda,\u201d Connor said. But his eyes were a little teary, too. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Because yes, he was giving her away. No one else could do the job.</p><p>\u201cI was born ready,\u201d she said, and he grinned and rolled his eyes. \u201cCon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Irritating Sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your best woman when you finally listen to me and marry Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, eyes filling.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, idiot. Come on. Your song is playing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>And there he was, Lucas Damien Campbell, smiling at her.
