They were also supposed to be quiet, subservient, and obedient, not to mention deferential to the master of the house. Leo, Lord Ramsay, wondered in exasperation why they couldn\u2019t have gotten one of those. Instead the Hathaway family had hired Catherine Marks, who, in Leo\u2019s opinion, cast an unflattering shadow upon the entire profession.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that Leo found fault with Marks\u2019s actual abilities. She had done an excellent job of instructing his two youngest sisters, Poppy and Beatrix, in the finer points of social etiquette. And they had needed an inordinate amount of help, since none of the Hathaways had ever expected to mingle in the upper circles of British society. They had been reared in a strictly middle-class environment, in a village west of London. Their father, Edward Hathaway, had been a medieval history scholar, considered a man of good blood but hardly an aristocrat.</p><p>However, after a series of unlikely events, Leo had inherited the title of Lord Ramsay. Although he had trained to be an architect, he was now a viscount with land and tenants. The Hathaways had moved to the Ramsay estate in Hampshire, where they had struggled to adjust to the demands of their new life.</p><p>One of the greatest challenges for the Hathaway sisters had been to learn the absurd multitude of rules and graces expected of privileged young ladies. Had it not been for Catherine Marks\u2019s patient instruction, the Hathaways would have rampaged through London with all the finesse of stampeding elephants. Marks had done wonders for all of them, especially Beatrix, who was undoubtedly the most eccentric sister of an already eccentric family. Although Beatrix was happiest romping through the meadows and woods like a wild creature, Marks had managed to impress on her that a different code of behavior was required in the ballroom. She had even written a series of etiquette poems for the girls, with such literary gems as:</p><p>Young ladies must display restraint</p><p>When speaking with a stranger</p> <p>Flirtations, quarrels, or complaints</p><p>Put our reputations in danger</p><p>Naturally Leo hadn\u2019t been able to resist mocking Marks\u2019s poetic abilities, but he had to admit privately that her methods had worked. Poppy and Beatrix had successfully navigated a London season, at last. And Poppy had recently married a hotelier named Harry Rutledge.</p><p>Now only Beatrix was left. Marks had assumed the role of chaperone and companion to the energetic nineteen-year-old. As far as the rest of the Hathaways were concerned, Catherine Marks was practically a member of the family.</p><p>Leo, for his part, couldn\u2019t abide the woman. She aired her opinions at will and dared to give orders to him. On the rare occasions when Leo tried to be friendly, she snapped at him or turned away in scorn. When he stated a perfectly rational opinion, he could hardly finish a sentence before Marks had listed all the reasons why he was wrong.</p><p>Faced with the immutable fact of her dislike, Leo couldn\u2019t help but respond in kind. All during the past year he had tried to convince himself that it didn\u2019t matter if she despised him. There were many women in London who were infinitely more beautiful, engaging, and appealing than Catherine Marks.</p> <p>If only she didn\u2019t fascinate him so.</p><p>Perhaps it was the secrets she guarded so zealously. Marks never talked about her childhood or her family, or why she had taken a position with the Hathaways. She had taught at a girls\u2019 school for a short time, but she refused to discuss her academic tenure or explain why she had left. There were rumors, passed on by former students, that she might have been a poor relation of the headmistress, or that she was a fallen woman whose loss of status had obliged her to go into service.</p><p>Marks was so self-contained and tenacious that it was often easy to forget she was still a young woman in her early twenties. When Leo had first met her, she had been the perfect embodiment of a dried-up spinster, with her spectacles and forbidding scowl and her stern hyphen of a mouth. Her spine was as unbending as a fireplace poker, and her hair, the dull brown of apple moths, was always pinned back too tightly. The Grim Reaper, Leo had nicknamed her, despite the objections of the family.</p><p>But the past year had wrought a remarkable change in Marks. She had filled out, her body slender but no longer matchstick thin, and her cheeks had gained color. A week and a half ago, when Leo had arrived from London, he had been absolutely astonished to see Marks with light golden locks. Apparently she had been dyeing her hair for years, but after an error on the part of the apothecary, she had been forced to abandon the disguise. And whereas the darker brown locks had been too severe for her delicate features and pale skin, her own natural blond was stunning.</p><p>Which had left Leo to grapple with the fact that Catherine Marks, his mortal enemy, was a beauty. It wasn\u2019t really the altered hair color that made her look so different ... it was more that Marks was so uncomfortable without it. She felt vulnerable, and it showed. As a result, Leo wanted to strip away more layers, literal and physical. He wanted to know her.</p><p>Leo had tried to keep his distance while he pondered the ramifications of this discovery. He was confounded by his family\u2019s reaction to Marks, which amounted to nothing more than a collective shrug. Why weren\u2019t any of them even a fraction as curious about her as he was? Why had Marks deliberately made herself unattractive for so long? What the devil was she hiding from?</p><p>On a sunny Hampshire afternoon when Leo had ascertained that most of the family was otherwise occupied, he went in search of Marks, reasoning that if he confronted her in private, he would get some answers. He found her outside in a hedged garden filled with flowers. She occupied a bench at the side of a graveled path. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was not alone.</p><p>Leo stopped at twenty yards\u2019 distance, drawing into the shade of a heavily foliated yew.</p><p>Marks was sitting beside Poppy\u2019s new husband, Harry Rutledge. They were engaged in what appeared to be an intimate conversation.</p><p>Although the situation wasn\u2019t precisely incriminating, neither was it appropriate.</p> <p>What in God\u2019s name could they be talking about? Even from this remote vantage, it was clear that something of significance was being said. Harry Rutledge\u2019s dark head was inclined over hers protectively. Like a close friend. Like a lover.</p><p>Leo\u2019s mouth fell open as he saw Marks reaching beneath her spectacles with a delicate hand, as if to wipe away a tear.</p><p>Marks was crying, in the company of Harry Rutledge.</p><p>And then Rutledge kissed her on the forehead.</p><p>Leo\u2019s breath stopped. Holding still, he sorted through an emulsion of emotions and separated them into layers ... amazement, worry, suspicion, fury.</p> <p>They were hiding something. Plotting something.</p><p>Had Rutledge once kept her as a mistress? Was he blackmailing her, or was she perhaps extorting something from him? No ... the tenderness between the pair was evident even at this distance.</p><p>Leo rubbed the lower half of his jaw as he considered what to do. Poppy\u2019s happiness was more important than any other consideration. Before he went dashing over to beat his sister\u2019s new husband to a bloody pulp, he would find out exactly what the situation was. And then, if circumstances warranted, he would beat Rutledge to a bloody pulp.</p><p>Taking slow, measured breaths, Leo watched the pair. Rutledge stood and went back to the house, while Marks remained seated on the bench.</p><p>Without making a conscious decision, Leo approached her slowly. He wasn\u2019t certain how he was going to treat her, or what he was going to say. It depended on which impulse leaped out most strongly the moment he reached her. It was entirely possible that he would throttle her. It was equally likely that he would pull her to the sun-warmed grass and ravish her. He found himself stewing in a hot, unpleasant rush of feeling that wasn\u2019t at all familiar. Was it jealousy? Christ, it was. He was jealous over a skinny termagant who insulted and nagged him at every opportunity.</p><p>Was this some new level of depravity? Had he developed a spinster fetish?</p> <p>Perhaps it was her very reserve that Leo found so erotic ... he had always been fascinated by the question of what it would take to demolish it. Catherine Marks, his fiendish little adversary ... naked and moaning beneath him. There was nothing he\u2019d ever wanted more. And that made sense, actually: When a woman was easy and willing, there was no challenge in it. But taking Marks to bed, making it last a long time, tormenting her until she begged and screamed ... now, that would be fun.</p><p>Leo walked toward her casually, not missing the way she stiffened at the sight of him. Her face became pinched and unhappy, her mouth strict. Leo imagined taking her head in his hands, kissing her for long lascivious minutes, until she was limp and gasping in his arms.</p><p>Instead he stood with his fists in his coat pockets, surveying her without expression. \u201cCare to explain what that was all about?\u201d</p><p>The sun glinted on the lenses of Marks\u2019s spectacles, momentarily obscuring her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spying on me, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. Whatever spinsters do in their personal time doesn\u2019t interest me in the least. But it\u2019s difficult not to notice when my brother-in-law is kissing the governess out in the garden.\u201d</p><p>One had to give Marks credit for composure. She showed no reaction except for the tightening of her hands in her lap. \u201cOne kiss,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many kisses, or where they landed. You\u2019re going to explain to me why he did it. And why you let him. And try to make it credible, because I\u2019m this close\u201d\u2014Leo held his thumb and forefinger a mere quarter inch apart\u2014\u201cto dragging you bodily to the coach road and putting you on the next cart bound for London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the devil,\u201d she said in a low voice, and sprang to her feet. She had taken only two strides before he caught her from behind. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p> <p>Leo turned her to face him, controlling her easily. His hands closed over her slender upper arms. He could feel the warmth of her skin through the thin muslin of her sleeves. As he held her, the innocent scent of lavender water rose to his nostrils. There was a faint dusting of talc at the base of her throat. The fragrance of her reminded Leo of a freshly made bed with pressed sheets. And oh, how he wanted to slip into her.</p><p>\u201cYou have too many secrets, Marks. You\u2019ve been a thorn in my side for more than a year, with your sharp tongue and your mysterious past. Now I want some answers. What were you discussing with Harry Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>Her fine brows, several shades darker than her hair, gathered in a scowl. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked you. \u201d Met with her mulish silence, Leo decided to provoke her. \u201cWere you a different kind of woman, I\u2019d suspect you of casting your lures at him. But we both know you don\u2019t have any lures, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I certainly wouldn\u2019t use them on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Marks, let\u2019s attempt a civil conversation. Just this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you take your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019d only run. And it\u2019s too hot to chase after you.\u201d</p><p>Catherine bristled and pushed at him, her palms flattening against his chest. Her body was neatly packaged in stays and laces and countless yards of muslin. The thought of what was beneath ... pink and white skin, soft curves, intimate curls ... aroused him instantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shiver ran through her, as if she could read his thoughts. Leo stared down at her intently. His voice softened. \u201cAre you afraid of me, Marks? You, who bludgeon and cut me down to size at every opportunity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, you arrogant ass. I only wish you would behave like a man of your station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like a peer?\u201d He raised his eyebrows mockingly. \u201cThis is how peers behave. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t noticed by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve noticed. A man fortunate enough to inherit a title should have the decency to try and live up to it. Being a peer is an obligation\u2014a responsibility\u2014but instead you seem to regard it as a license to engage in the most self-indulgent and disgusting behavior imaginable. Moreover\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarks,\u201d Leo interrupted in a velvety tone, \u201cthat was a perfectly wonderful attempt at distracting me. But it\u2019s not going to work. You\u2019re not getting away from me until you tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and tried to look everywhere but at him, which wasn\u2019t easy when he was standing right in front of her. \u201cThe reason I was talking privately with Mr. Rutledge ... the scene you witnessed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was because ... Harry Rutledge is my brother. Half brother.\u201d</p><p>Leo stared at her downbent head, trying to absorb the information. The sense of being duped, betrayed, ignited a bonfire of rage. Holy hell. Marks and Harry Rutledge were siblings?</p> <p>\u201cThere could be no good reason,\u201d Leo said, \u201cfor such information to have been kept secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation is complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have neither of you said anything before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me before he married Poppy. You were obligated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLoyalty, damn you. What else do you know that might affect my family? What other secrets are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Catherine shot back, now twisting in his grip. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I find out what you\u2019re plotting. Is Catherine Marks even your real name? Who the hell are you?\u201d He swore as she began to struggle in earnest. \u201cHold still, you little she-devil. I just want to\u2019ouch!\u201d This last as she turned and jabbed a sharp elbow in his side.</p><p>The maneuver gained Marks the freedom she sought, but her spectacles went flying to the ground. \u201cMy spectacles!\u201d With an aggravated sigh, she dropped to her hands and knees and began feeling for them.</p><p>Leo\u2019s fury was instantly smothered by guilt. From the looks of it, she was practically blind without the spectacles. And the sight of her crawling on the ground made him feel like a brute. A jackass. Lowering to his knees, he began to hunt for them as well.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the direction they went in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I did,\u201d she said, fuming, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need spectacles, would I?\u201d</p><p>A short silence. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d she said acidly.</p><p>For the next few minutes the two of them traversed the garden on their hands and knees, searching among the daffodils. They both chewed on the gristly silence as if it were a mutton chop.</p><p>\u201cSo you actually need spectacles,\u201d Leo finally said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Marks said crossly. \u201cWhy would I wear spectacles if I didn\u2019t need them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they might be part of your disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy disguise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Marks, disguise. A noun describing a means of concealing someone\u2019s identity. Often used by clowns and spies. And now apparently governesses. Good God, can anything be ordinary for my family?\u201d</p><p>Marks glared and blinked in his direction, her gaze not quite focused. For a moment, she looked like an anxious child whose favorite blanket had been set out of reach. And that caused an odd, painful twinge in Leo\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find your spectacles,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cYou have my word. If you like, you can go into the house while I keep searching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. If I tried to find the house on my own, I\u2019d probably end up in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Seeing a metallic glimmer in the grass, Leo reached out and closed his hand around the spectacles. \u201cHere they are.\u201d He crawled to Marks and faced her in an upright kneeling position. After polishing the spectacle lenses with the edge of his sleeve, he said, \u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do it, hardhead. Arguing comes to you as naturally as breathing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said immediately, and colored as he gave a husky laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no fun to bait you when you make it so easy, Marks.\u201d He placed the spectacles on her face with great care, running his fingers along the sides of the frame, viewing the fit with an assessing glance. Gently he touched the tips of the earpieces. \u201cThey\u2019re not fitted well.\u201d He ran an exploring fingertip over the upper rim of one ear. She was remarkably pretty in the sunlight, her gray eyes containing glimmers of blue and green. Like opals. \u201cSuch small ears,\u201d Leo continued, letting his hands linger at the sides of her fine-boned face. \u201cNo wonder your spectacles fall off so readily. There\u2019s hardly anything to hang them on.\u201d</p><p>Marks stared at him in bewilderment.</p><p>How fragile she was, he thought. Her will was so fierce, her temperament so prickly, that he tended to forget she was only half his size. He would have expected her to slap his hands away by now\u2014she hated being touched, especially by him. But she didn\u2019t move at all. He let his thumb brush the side of her throat, and felt the tiny undulation of her swallow. There was something unreal about the moment, something dreamlike. He didn\u2019t want it to end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs Catherine your real name?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill you at least answer that?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, fearful of yielding any part of herself, even that scrap of information. But as his fingertips slid along her neck, the light caress seemed to disarm her. A bloom of color rose from her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she choked out. \u201cIt\u2019s Catherine.\u201d</p><p>They were still kneeling together, her skirts having billowed and settled everywhere. Folds of flower-printed muslin had been caught under one of Leo\u2019s knees. His body reacted strongly to her nearness, heat sliding beneath his skin and gathering in inconvenient places. Muscles tightened, thickened. He would have to put an end to this, or he was going to do something they would both regret.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you up,\u201d Leo said brusquely, making to rise. \u201cWe\u2019ll go inside. I warn you, however, I\u2019m not through with you yet. There\u2019s more I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he broke off, because as Marks had tried to struggle upward, her body had brushed against his. They went still, caught front to front, their breath mingling in uneven surges.</p><p>The dreamlike feeling intensified. The two of them were kneeling in a summer garden, the air weighted with the perfume of hot crushed grass and scarlet poppies ... and Catherine Marks was in his arms. Her hair shimmered in the sunlight, her skin petal-soft. Her upper lip was nearly as full as the lower, the curves as delicate and smooth as a ripe persimmon. Staring at her mouth, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck lift in reflexive excitement.</p><p>Some temptations, Leo decided hazily, should not be resisted. Because they were so persistent that they would only keep returning, time and again. Therefore such temptations absolutely had to be yielded to\u2014it was the only way to be rid of them.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said raggedly, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Even knowing I\u2019ll be annihilated afterward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do what?\u201d Marks asked, her eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>And his mouth descended to hers.</p><p>At last, every muscle in his body seemed to sigh. At last. The sensation was so pleasurable that for a moment Leo couldn\u2019t even move, just felt her mouth with his mouth. Sinking into the feeling, Leo let it take him. He stopped thinking altogether and did everything and anything he wanted ... tugging at her upper lip and then her lower one, sealing their mouths together, touching his tongue to hers, playing with her. One kiss started before another had finished, a chain of erotic strokes and skims and nudges. The delight of it went all through him, echoing in every vein and nerve.</p><p>And God help him, he ached for more. He was dying to put his hands inside her clothes, and feel every inch of her body. He wanted to drag his mouth over her in intimate trails, kiss and taste every part of her. Marks responded helplessly, curling her arm around his neck. She moved against him as if sensation were coming from all directions. And it was. They both struggled to press closer, tighter, their bodies pursuing a new and unsteady rhythm. Had they not been separated by so many layers of clothing, it would have been outright lovemaking.</p><p>Leo continued to kiss her long after he should have stopped, not only for the sheer pleasure of it, but also because he was reluctant to face what would happen afterward. Their cantankerous relationship could not resume as usual after something like this. It had been set on a new track with an unknown destination, and Leo was certain that neither of them were going to like where it led.</p> <p>Finding that he couldn\u2019t release her all at once, he did it by degrees, letting his mouth nuzzle the edge of her jaw, following to the vulnerable hollow behind her ear. Her pulse was swift and vibrant against his lips.</p><p>\u201cMarks,\u201d he said on a rough breath, \u201cI was afraid of this. Somehow I knew...\u201d Breaking off, he lifted his head and looked down at her.</p><p>She squinted through the mist that had accumulated on her lenses. \u201cMy spectacles ... I\u2019ve lost them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. There\u2019s steam on the lenses.\u201d</p><p>As the fogged spectacles cleared, Marks shoved at him. She struggled to her feet, frantically swatting away his efforts to help.</p><p>They stared at each other. It was hard to say which one of them was more appalled.</p><p>But judging from her expression, it was probably Marks.</p><p>\u201cThis never happened,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIf you have the gall ever to mention it, I\u2019ll deny it to my last breath.\u201d She gave her skirts a few agitated whacks to remove the bits of leaves and grass, and shot Leo a fierce warning glance. \u201cI\u2019m going to the house now. And don\u2019t follow me!\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Their paths didn\u2019t intersect again until dinner, a crowded affair that included his sisters Amelia, Win, and Poppy, and their respective husbands Cam Rohan, Kev Merripen, and Harry Rutledge. Catherine Marks sat with Beatrix at the far end of the table.</p><p>So far none of Leo\u2019s sisters had chosen conventional men to wed. Rohan and Merripen were both Romany Gypsies, which accounted in part for their ability to fit in easily with the off-kilter Hathaways. And Poppy\u2019s husband, Harry Rutledge, was an eccentric hotelier, a powerful man whose enemies reputedly liked him more than his friends did.</p><p>Could it be true that Catherine Marks was Harry\u2019s sister?</p><p>Leo glanced from one to the other of them at dinner, searching for similarities. Damned if I can\u2019t see a resemblance, he thought. The high cheekbones, the straight lines of the brows, the slight feline tilt at the outward corners of the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you,\u201d Leo said to Amelia as soon as dinner had concluded. \u201cIn private.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her blue eyes widened with curiosity. \u201cOf course. Shall we walk? It\u2019s still light outside.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a curt nod.</p><p>As the two oldest Hathaway siblings, Leo and Amelia had had their share of arguments. However, she was his favorite person in the world, not to mention his closest confidant. Amelia had a great deal of common sense, and she never hesitated to say what she thought.</p><p>No one had ever expected the pragmatic Amelia to be swept off her feet by Cam Rohan, a dashing Romany Gypsy. But Cam had managed to seduce and marry Amelia before she had quite known what was happening. And as it had turned out, Cam was able to provide the levelheaded guidance the Hathaways had needed. With his black hair worn a trifle too long and a diamond stud glittering in one ear, he was hardly the image of a staid family patriarch. But it was Cam\u2019s unconventionality that allowed him to manage the Hathaways so adeptly. Now he and Amelia had a nine-month-old son, Rye, who had his father\u2019s dark hair and his mother\u2019s blue eyes.</p> <p>Walking leisurely along the private drive with Amelia, Leo cast a proprietary glance at their surroundings. In summer, the Hampshire sun lingered until at least nine o\u2019clock, illuminating a mosaic of woodland, heath, and grass meadows. Rivers and streams scored the landscape, feeding bogs and wet meadows teeming with prolific wildlife. Although the Ramsay estate was certainly not the largest in Hampshire, it was one of the more beautiful, with an ancient timber forest and three thousand acres of arable land.</p><p>In the past year Leo had come to know the estate tenants, he had made improvements in irrigation and drainage, repaired fences, gates, and buildings ... and the devil knew he had learned far more than he\u2019d ever wanted to know about farming. All part of Kev Merripen\u2019s merciless instructions.</p><p>Merripen, who had lived with the Hathaways since childhood, had undertaken to learn as much as possible about estate management. Now he was intent on teaching this accumulated knowledge to Leo.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really your land,\u201d Merripen had told him, \u201cuntil you\u2019ve put some of your own blood and sweat into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Leo had asked sarcastically. \u201cOnly blood and sweat? I\u2019m certain I can find one or two other bodily fluids to donate if it\u2019s that important.\u201d</p> <p>But privately he acknowledged that Merripen had been right. This feeling of ownership, of connection, couldn\u2019t be acquired any other way.</p><p>Shoving his hands in his pockets, Leo let out a taut sigh. Dinner had left him restless and irritable.</p><p>\u201cYou must have had a row with Miss Marks,\u201d Amelia remarked. \u201cUsually you\u2019re slinging arrows at each other across the table. But tonight you were both quiet. I don\u2019t think she looked up from her plate even once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a row,\u201d Leo said curtly.</p><p>\u201cThen what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me\u2014under duress\u2014that Rutledge is her brother.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia glanced at him suspiciously. \u201cWhat kind of duress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that. Did you hear what I just said? Harry Rutledge is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Marks has been under quite enough duress without you adding to it,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cI do hope you weren\u2019t cruel to her, Leo. Because if so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, cruel to Marks? I\u2019m the one you should worry about. After a conversation with her, I usually walk away with my entrails dragging behind me.\u201d His indignation doubled as he saw his sister trying to suppress a grin. \u201cI gather you already knew Rutledge and Marks were related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for a few days,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked me not to, and I agreed out of respect for her privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil knows why Marks should have privacy when no one else around here does.\u201d Leo stopped in his tracks, obliging her to stop as well. They faced each other. \u201cWhy is it a secret that she\u2019s Rutledge\u2019s sister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain,\u201d Amelia admitted, looking perturbed. \u201cAll she would say is that it\u2019s for her protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtection from what?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head helplessly. \u201cPerhaps Harry might tell you. But I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, someone\u2019s going to explain it to me, or I\u2019ll throw Marks out on her arse before she can blink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she said in astonishment. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of Beatrix, and how upset she would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking of Beatrix. I won\u2019t have my youngest sister being looked after by a woman with a possibly dangerous secret. If a man like Harry Rutledge, who has ties to some of the most nefarious characters in London, can\u2019t acknowledge his own sister ... she may be a criminal. Has that occurred to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amelia said stonily, beginning to walk again. \u201cHonestly, Leo, even for you this is a bit dramatic. She is not a criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be na\u00efve,\u201d he said, following her. \u201cNo one is exactly who he or she pretends to be.\u201d</p><p>After a curtailed silence, Amelia asked warily, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for London on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cBut Merripen is expecting you to take part in the turnip planting, and the fertilizing, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what Merripen expects. And I do hate to miss his fascinating lectures on the wonders of manure. All the same, I\u2019m going. I want to spend some time with Rutledge and pry some answers out of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amelia frowned. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you talk to him here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s on his honeymoon, and he won\u2019t be willing to spend his last night in Hampshire chatting with me. Besides, I\u2019ve decided to take on a small commission to design a conservatory for a house in Mayfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you want to be away from Catherine. I think something happened between you.\u201d</p><p>Leo glanced at the last brilliant orange and purple vestiges of daylight. \u201cThe light is going,\u201d he remarked in a pleasant tone. \u201cWe should head back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run from your problems, you know.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted in annoyance. \u201cWhy do people always say that? Of course you can run from your problems. I do it all the time, and it never fails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with Catherine,\u201d Amelia persisted. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s being dramatic?\u201d he asked, striding back toward Ramsay House.</p><p>\u201cYou watch everything she does.\u201d Amelia stubbornly kept pace with him. \u201cWhenever her name is mentioned, you\u2019re all ears. And lately, every time I see you talking or arguing with her, you seem more alive than you have since...\u201d She paused, seeming to think better of what she\u2019d been about to say.</p> <p>\u201cSince when?\u201d Leo asked, daring her to continue.</p><p>\u201cSince before the scarlet fever.\u201d</p><p>It was a subject they never discussed.</p><p>The year before Leo had inherited the viscountcy, a fatal epidemic of scarlet fever had swept through the village where the Hathaways had lived.</p><p>The first to go had been Laura Dillard, Leo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Laura\u2019s family had let him stay at her bedside. For three days he had watched her die in his arms, hour by hour, until she had slipped away.</p> <p>Leo had gone home and collapsed with the fever, and so had Win. By some miracle they had both survived, but Win had been left an invalid. And Leo had emerged an entirely different man, scarred in ways that even he couldn\u2019t fully catalog. He had found himself in a nightmare he couldn\u2019t wake from. He hadn\u2019t cared if he lived or died. The most unforgivable part was that in his torment, he had hurt his family and caused no end of problems for them. At the worst of it, when Leo had seemed bent on destroying himself, the family had made a decision. They had sent Win to recover at a clinic in France, with Leo accompanying her.</p><p>While Win\u2019s weak lungs had regained their strength at the clinic, Leo had spent hours walking through the heat-drowsed pantiled villages of Provence, up switchback footpaths scattered with flowers, across arid fields. The sunshine, the hot blue air, the lenteur, or slowness of life, had cleared his mind and calmed his soul. He had stopped drinking except for a single glass of wine at dinner. He had sketched and painted, and finally he had grieved.</p><p>When Leo and Win had returned to England, Win had wasted no time in achieving her heart\u2019s desire, which had been to marry Merripen.</p><p>Leo, for his part, was trying to make amends for the way he had failed his family. And above all, he was determined to avoid falling in love ever again. Now that he was aware of the fatal depth of feeling he was capable of, he would never give another human being such power over him.</p><p>\u201cSis,\u201d he told Amelia ruefully, \u201cif you have some lunatic notion that I have any kind of personal interest in Marks, forget it at once. All I intend to do is find out what skeleton she has in her closet. Knowing her, it\u2019s probably a literal one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know about Cat\u2019s existence until I was twenty,\u201d Harry Rutledge said, stretching out his long legs as he and Leo sat in the Rutledge Hotel\u2019s clubroom. The quiet and luxurious spot, with its numerous octagonal apses, was a popular gathering place in London for foreign nobility, travelers of means, aristocrats and politicians.</p><p>Leo regarded his brother-in-law with thinly veiled skepticism. Of all the men he would have chosen to marry one of his sisters, Rutledge would certainly not have topped the list. Leo didn\u2019t trust him. On the other hand, Harry had his good points, among them his obvious devotion to Poppy.</p> <p>Harry drank from a snifter of warmed brandy, considering his words carefully before he continued. He was a handsome man, capable of great charm, but he was also ruthless and manipulative. One would expect no less from a man of his achievements, among them creating the largest and most opulent hotel in London.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to discuss Cat for several reasons,\u201d Harry said, his green eyes guarded. \u201cAmong them the fact that I\u2019ve never been particularly kind to her, nor did I protect her when I should have. And I regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have regrets,\u201d Leo said, taking a sip of brandy, letting the velvet fire slide down his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s why I cling to my bad habits. One doesn\u2019t have to start regretting something unless one stops doing it.\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned, but sobered quickly as he stared into the flame of a small candle lamp that had been set on the table. \u201cBefore I tell you anything, I want to ask what the nature of your interest in my sister is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking as her employer,\u201d Leo said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the influence she may have over Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never questioned her influence before,\u201d Harry shot back. \u201cAnd from all accounts she\u2019s done an excellent job with Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has. However, the revelation of this mysterious connection to you has me worried. For all I know, the two of you have been hatching some kind of plot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry stared at him directly. \u201cThere\u2019s no plot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why all these secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain without telling you something of my own past\u2014\u201d Pausing, Harry added darkly, \u201cWhich I hate doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d Leo said without a trace of sincerity. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>Harry hesitated again, as if weighing the decision to tell him anything. \u201cCat and I had the same mother. Her name was Nicolette Wigens. She was British by birth. Her family moved from England to Buffalo, New York, when she was still an infant. Because Nicolette was an only child\u2014the Wigens had her fairly late in life\u2014it was their desire to see her married to a man who would take care of her. My father Arthur was more than twice her age, and fairly prosperous. I suspect the Wigens forced the match\u2014there was certainly no love in it. But Nicolette married Arthur, and I was born soon after. A bit too soon, actually. There was speculation that Arthur wasn\u2019t the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he?\u201d Leo couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><p>Harry smiled cynically. \u201cDoes one ever know for certain?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIn any case, my mother eventually ran off to England with one of her lovers.\u201d Harry\u2019s gaze was distant. \u201cThere were other men after that, I believe. My mother wasn\u2019t one for limiting herself. She was a spoiled, self-indulgent bitch, but very beautiful. Cat looks very much like her.\u201d He paused reflectively. \u201cOnly softer. More refined. And unlike our mother, Cat has a kind and caring nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Leo said sourly. \u201cShe\u2019s never been kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you frighten her.\u201d</p> <p>Leo gave him a disbelieving glance. \u201cIn what possible way could I frighten that little virago? And don\u2019t claim that she\u2019s nervous around men, because she\u2019s perfectly amiable to Cam and Merripen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feels safe with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not with me?\u201d Leo asked, offended.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d Harry said thoughtfully, \u201cit\u2019s because she\u2019s aware of you as a man.\u201d</p><p>The revelation caused Leo\u2019s heart to jolt. He examined the contents of his brandy snifter with studied boredom. \u201cDid she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I saw it for myself, in Hampshire.\u201d Harry turned wry. \u201cOne has to be particularly observant where Cat is concerned. She won\u2019t talk about herself.\u201d He tossed off the rest of his brandy, set down the glass with care, and leaned back in his chair. \u201cI never heard from my mother after she left Buffalo,\u201d he said, lacing his fingers together and resting them on his flat midriff. \u201cBut when I reached the age of twenty, I received a letter bidding me to come to her. She had contracted a wasting disease, some form of cancer. I assumed that before she died, she wanted to see what had become of me. I left for England at once, but she died just before I arrived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that was when you met Marks,\u201d Leo prompted.</p><p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t there. Despite Cat\u2019s wishes to stay with her mother, she had been sent to stay with an aunt and grandmother on her father\u2019s side. And the father, apparently unwilling to keep vigil by the sickbed, had left London altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoble fellow,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>\u201cA local woman had taken care of Nicolette during the last week of her life. It was she who told me about Cat. I gave a brief thought to visiting the child, but I decided against it. There was no place in my life for an illegitimate half sister. She was nearly half my age, and in need of female guidance. I assumed she was better off in her aunt\u2019s care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that assumption correct?\u201d Leo brought himself to ask.</p><p>Harry gave him an inscrutable glance. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>An entire story was contained in that one bleak syllable. Leo wanted very much to hear it. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to stay in England and try my hand at the hotel business. So I sent Cat a letter, telling her where to send word if she ever needed anything. Some years later, when she was fifteen, she wrote to me, asking for help. I found her in ... difficult circumstances. I wish I had reached her a little sooner.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling a tug of unaccountable concern, Leo found it impossible to maintain his usual veneer of carelessness. \u201cWhat do you mean, difficult circumstances?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s as much as I can tell you. The rest is up to Cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rutledge, you\u2019re not leaving it there. I want to know how the Hathaways got involved in this, and why I had the misfortune to end up as the employer of the most ill-tempered and interfering governess in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat doesn\u2019t have to work. She\u2019s a woman of independent means. I settled enough money on her to allow her the freedom to do anything she wished. She went to boarding school for four years, and stayed to teach for another two. Eventually she came to me and said she\u2019d accepted a position as a governess for the Hathaway family. I believe you were in France with Win at the time. Cat went for the interview, Cam and Amelia liked her, Beatrix and Poppy clearly needed her, and no one seemed inclined to question her lack of experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Leo said acidly. \u201cMy family would never bother with something so insignificant as job experience. I\u2019m sure they started the interview by asking what her favorite color was.\u201d</p><p>Harry was trying unsuccessfully not to smile. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019re right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did she go into service, if she had no need of money?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cShe wanted to experience what a family was like, if only as an outsider. Cat believes she\u2019ll never have a family of her own.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s brows drew together as he tried to make sense of that. \u201cNothing is stopping her,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou think not?\u201d A hint of mockery varnished Harry\u2019s hard green eyes. \u201cYou Hathaways would find it impossible to understand what it\u2019s like to be brought up in isolation, by people who don\u2019t give a damn about you. You have no choice but to assume it\u2019s your fault, that you\u2019re unlovable. And that feeling wraps around you until it becomes a prison, and you find yourself barricading the doors against anyone who wants to come in.\u201d</p> <p>Leo listened intently, perceiving that Harry was talking about himself as well as Catherine. Silently he acknowledged that Harry was right: even in the worst despair of Leo\u2019s life, he had always known that his family loved him.</p><p>For the first time he understood fully what Poppy had done for Harry, how she had broken through the invisible prison he had described.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Leo said quietly. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for you to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d And in absolute seriousness, Harry murmured, \u201cOne thing I should make clear, Ramsay: If you hurt Cat in any way, I will have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Dressed in her nightgown, Poppy sat in bed with a novel. She heard someone enter the elegantly appointed private apartments, and she looked up with a smile as her husband came into the room. Her pulse quickened pleasurably at the sight of him, so dark and graceful. Harry was an enigmatic man, dangerous even in the view of those who professed to know him well. But with Poppy, he relaxed and showed his gentle side.</p> <p>\u201cDid you talk with Leo?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, love.\u201d Harry shrugged out of his coat, draped it over the back of a chair, and approached the bedside. \u201cHe wanted to discuss Cat, as I expected. I told him as much about her past\u2014and mine\u2014as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you make of the situation?\u201d Poppy knew that Harry was brilliant at discerning other people\u2019s thoughts and motives.</p><p>Harry untied his cravat, letting it hang on either side of his neck. \u201cRamsay is more concerned for Cat than he\u2019d like to be, that\u2019s clear. And I don\u2019t like it. But I won\u2019t interfere unless Cat asks for help.\u201d He reached down to the exposed line of her throat, drawing the backs of his fingers over her skin with a sensitive lightness that caused her breath to quicken. His fingertips rested on the rapid tattoo of her pulse, and caressed softly. Watching a delicate tide of pink rise in her face, he said in a low voice, \u201cPut the book aside.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s toes curled beneath the bed linens. \u201cBut I\u2019ve reached a very interesting part,\u201d she said demurely, teasing him.</p><p>\u201cNot half so interesting as what\u2019s about to happen to you.\u201d Drawing the covers back with a deliberate sweep that left her gasping, Harry lowered his body over hers ... and the book dropped to the floor, forgotten.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Catherine hoped that Leo, Lord Ramsay, would stay away from Hampshire for a good long while. Perhaps if enough time passed, they would be able to pretend the kiss in the garden had never happened.</p><p>But in the meantime, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder ... why had he done it?</p><p>Most likely he had merely been amusing himself with her, finding a new way to set her off balance.</p><p>If life were at all fair, she thought dourly, Leo would have been pudgy, pockmarked, and bald. But he was a handsome man with a strapping six-foot build. He had dark hair and light blue eyes and a dazzling smile. The worst part was that Leo didn\u2019t look at all like the rogue he was. He looked wholesome and clean and honorable, the nicest gentleman one could ever hope to meet.</p><p>The illusion was dispelled as soon as he opened his mouth. Leo was a thoroughly wicked man, articulate in all circumstances. His irreverence spared no one, least of all himself. In the year since they had first met, he had exhibited nearly every objectionable quality a man could possess, and any attempt to correct him only made him worse. Especially if that attempt had been made by Catherine.</p><p>Leo was a man with a past, and he didn\u2019t even have the decency to try and hide it. He was frank about his dissolute history, the drinking and skirt-chasing and brawling, the self-destructive behavior that had nearly brought catastrophe to the Hathaway family on more than one occasion. One could only conclude that he liked being a scoundrel, or at least being known as one. He played the part of jaded aristocrat to perfection, his eyes glinting with the cynicism of a man who, at the age of thirty, had managed to outlive himself.</p><p>Catherine wanted nothing to do with any man, least of all one who radiated such dangerous charm. One could never trust such a man. His darkest days might still be ahead of him. And if not ... it was entirely possible that hers were.</p> <p>Approximately a week after Leo had left Hampshire, Catherine spent an afternoon outside with Beatrix. Unfortunately these outings were never the kind of well-regulated walk that Catherine preferred. Beatrix didn\u2019t walk, she explored. She liked to go deep into the forest, investigating flora, fungi, nests, webs, and holes in the ground. Nothing delighted the youngest Hathaway so much as the discovery of a black newt, a lizard\u2019s nest, or a rabbit warren, or the tracking of badgers\u2019 marks.</p><p>Injured creatures were caught, rehabilitated, and set free, or if they could not fend for themselves, they became part of the Hathaway household. And the family had become so accustomed to Beatrix\u2019s animals that no one so much as batted an eye when a hedgehog waddled through the parlor or a pair of rabbits hopped past the dinner table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pleasantly tired after the long ramble with Beatrix, Catherine sat at her dressing table and took down her hair. She scrubbed her fingers over her scalp and through the loose blond waves, soothing the little aches left from tight braids and hairpins.</p><p>A happy chatter came from behind her, and she turned to see Beatrix\u2019s pet ferret, Dodger, emerging from beneath her dresser. His long, sinuous body arced gracefully as he loped toward her with a white glove in his teeth. The mischievous thief liked to filch things from drawers and boxes and closets, and hide them in secret piles. To Catherine\u2019s frustration, Dodger especially loved her possessions. It had become a ritual humiliation to go through Ramsay House in search of her own garters.</p><p>\u201cYou overgrown rat,\u201d Catherine told him as he stood tall and braced his tiny paws on the edge of her chair. She reached out to pet his sleek fur, tickled the top of his head, and carefully pried the glove from his teeth. \u201cHaving stolen all my garters, you\u2019re moving on to gloves, are you?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her affectionately, his eyes bright in the dark stripe that formed a mask across his face.</p> <p>\u201cWhere have you hidden my things?\u201d she asked, setting the glove on the dressing table. \u201cIf I don\u2019t find my garters soon, I\u2019ll have to keep my stockings up with pieces of old string.\u201d</p><p>Dodger twitched his whiskers and appeared to grin at her, displaying tiny pointed teeth. He wriggled invitingly.</p><p>Smiling reluctantly, Catherine picked up a hairbrush and drew it through the loose locks of her hair. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have time to play with you. I\u2019m getting ready for dinner.\u201d</p><p>In a liquid and lightning-fast movement, the ferret leaped to her lap, snatched the glove from the table, and streaked from the room.</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d Catherine exclaimed, dashing after him. \u201cBring that back!\u201d She went out into the hallway, where maids were rushing back and forth with unusual haste. Dodger disappeared around the corner.</p> <p>\u201cVirgie,\u201d Catherine asked one of the maids, \u201cwhat is happening?\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired girl was breathless and smiling. \u201cLord Leo has just come from London, miss, and the housekeeper told us to ready his room and set another place for dinner, and unpack the luggage when the footmen bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Catherine asked, feeling the color drain from her face. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t send word. No one expected him.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect him, was what she meant.</p><p>Virgie shrugged and hurried away with an armload of folded linens.</p><p>Catherine put a hand to her midriff, where nerves were leaping, and retreated into her room. She wasn\u2019t ready to face Leo. It wasn\u2019t fair that he had come back so soon.</p> <p>Of course, it was his estate. But still ...</p><p>She paced in a tight circle and tried to marshal the chaos of her thoughts. There was only one solution: She would avoid Leo. She would plead a headache and stay in her room.</p><p>In the midst of her turmoil, there was a tap on the door. Someone entered without waiting for a response. Catherine nearly choked on her own heartbeat as she saw Leo\u2019s tall, familiar form.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you come into my room without...\u201d Her voice faded as he closed the door.</p><p>Leo turned to face her, his gaze sweeping over her. He was travel-rumpled and a bit dusty. His hair wanted a good brushing, the dark brown locks disheveled and falling over his forehead. He looked self-possessed but cautious, the ever-present mockery in his eyes replaced by something she couldn\u2019t identify. Something new.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s hand drew into a fist against her midriff, and she struggled to catch up with her own breathing. She held still as he approached her, while her heart pounded with a dizzying mixture of dread and excitement.</p><p>Leo\u2019s hands went on either side of her shrinking body and gripped the edge of the dressing table behind her. He was too close, his masculine vitality surrounding her. He smelled like outside air, like dust and horses, like a healthy young male. As he leaned over her, one of his knees pressed gently into the mass of her skirts.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d she asked weakly.</p> <p>He stared directly into her eyes. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>Before Catherine could stop herself, her gaze dropped to the firm contours of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCat ... we have to talk about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head slightly. \u201cWould you like me to remind you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...\u201d She shook her head for emphasis. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cOne \u2018no\u2019 is enough, darling.\u201d</p><p>Darling?</p><p>Filled with anxiety, Catherine fought to keep her voice steady. \u201cI thought I made it clear that I wanted to ignore what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect that will make it go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what one does with mistakes,\u201d she said with difficulty. \u201cOne sets them aside and moves on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Leo asked innocently. \u201cMy mistakes are usually so enjoyable that I tend to repeat them.\u201d</p><p>Catherine wondered what was wrong with her that she was tempted to smile. \u201cThis one will not be repeated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s the governess voice. All stern and disapproving. It makes me feel like a naughty schoolboy.\u201d One of his hands lifted to caress the edge of her jaw.</p><p>Her body raced with conflicting impulses, her skin craving his touch, her instincts warning her to move away from him. The result was a kind of stunned immobility, every muscle drawing up taut. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave my room this instant,\u201d she heard herself say, \u201cI\u2019ll make a scene.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarks, there is nothing in the world I would enjoy more than watching you make a scene. In fact, I\u2019ll help you. How shall we start?\u201d Leo seemed to enjoy her discomfiture, the wash of uncontrollable color over her face.</p><p>The pad of his thumb stroked the thin, soft skin beneath her jaw, a coaxing motion that caused her head to tilt back before she quite knew what she was doing. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such eyes,\u201d he said almost absently. \u201cThey remind me of the first time I saw the North Sea.\u201d His fingertips followed the edge of her jaw. \u201cWhen the wind chases the waves before it, the water is the same green-gray your eyes are now ... and then it turns to blue at the horizon.\u201d</p><p>Catherine could only assume that he was mocking her again. She scowled at him. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Leo took a long time to answer, his fingers trailing to her earlobe, massaging lightly. \u201cI want your secrets. And I\u2019ll get them out of you one way or another.\u201d</p> <p>That gave her the impetus to swat his hand away. \u201cStop this. You\u2019re amusing yourself at my expense, as usual. You are a dissipated scoundrel, an unprincipled cad, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget \u2018lecherous libertine,\u2014\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>He pushed away lazily from the dressing table. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go. Obviously you fear that if I stay, you won\u2019t be able to control your desire for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only desire I have for you,\u201d she said, \u201cinvolves maiming and dismemberment.\u201d</p> <p>Leo grinned and went to the door. Pausing at the threshold, he glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYour spectacles are fogging again,\u201d he said helpfully, and slipped through the door before she could find something to throw.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Amelia said as Leo entered the breakfast room the next morning, \u201cyou have to get married.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a warning glance. His sister knew better than to start a conversation with him so early. He preferred to ease his way into the day, whereas Amelia liked to fling herself at it full tilt. Moreover, he\u2019d slept badly the night before, plagued by erotic dreams involving Catherine Marks.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll never marry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Marks\u2019s voice came from the corner. She was perched on a small chair, a sunbeam glancing off her fair hair and causing dust motes to glitter around her. \u201cJust as well, since no rational woman would have you.\u201d</p> <p>Leo took up the challenge without hesitation. \u201cA rational woman...\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever met one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know if you did?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be interested in her character. You would be far too busy examining her ... her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cHer dress measurements,\u201d she finally said, and he laughed at her prudishness.</p><p>\u201cIs it really so impossible for you to name ordinary body parts, Marks? Breasts, hips, legs\u2014why is it indecent to talk about the human anatomy in a straightforward manner?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cBecause it leads to improper thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Leo smirked at her. \u201cMine already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, mine aren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would prefer them to remain that way.\u201d</p> <p>His brows lifted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have improper thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you do, what are they?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an indignant glance.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever been involved in your improper thoughts?\u201d Leo persisted, causing her face to flame.</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t have any,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said \u2018hardly ever.\u2019 Which means one or two are rattling around in there.\u201d</p><p>Amelia broke in. \u201cLeo, stop tormenting her.\u201d</p><p>Leo barely heard her, his attention fixed on Catherine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think badly of you at all if you did,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like you much better for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you would,\u201d Catherine shot back. \u201cYou probably prefer women with no virtues at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtue in a woman is like pepper in the soup. A little makes for a nice seasoning. But overdo it, and no one wants very much of you.\u201d</p><p>Clamping her mouth shut, Catherine pointedly looked away from him, putting an end to the rapid-paced argument.</p><p>In the silence, Leo became aware that the entire family was staring at him with collective bemusement.</p><p>\u201cHave I done something?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? And what the devil are you all reading?\u201d</p><p>Amelia, Cam, and Merripen had spread papers over the table, while Win and Beatrix appeared to be looking up words in a massive legal tome.</p><p>\u201cA letter was just delivered from our London solicitor, Mr. Gadwick,\u201d Merripen said. \u201cIt seems there are legal issues that weren\u2019t made clear when you inherited the estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprise there,\u201d Leo said. He went to the sideboard, where breakfast had been laid out. \u201cThe estate and title were tossed in my direction like used fish wrappings. Along with the Ramsay curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no Ramsay curse,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Leo smiled darkly. \u201cThen why did the last half-dozen Lord Ramsays die in quick succession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure coincidence,\u201d she replied. \u201cObviously that particular branch of the family was clumsy and inbred. It\u2019s a common difficulty for bluebloods.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we certainly don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d Leo returned his attention to Merripen. \u201cTell me about our legal issues. And use small words. I don\u2019t like to think at this hour of the morning. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>Looking none too happy, Merripen sat at the table. \u201cThis house,\u201d he said, \u201cand the parcel of land it stands on\u2014about fourteen acres in total\u2014were not part of the original Ramsay estate. It was added later. In legal terms, it\u2019s a copyhold portion, which is a separate property within the main estate. And unlike the rest of the estate, the copyhold can be mortgaged, bought, or sold at the will of the lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Leo said. \u201cSince I\u2019m the lord, and I don\u2019t want to mortgage or sell anything, it\u2019s all fine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d Leo scowled. \u201cAccording to the rules of entailment, the lord always retains his land and manor home. It\u2019s nonpartible. And nothing can change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Merripen said. \u201cYou are entitled to the ancient manor home. The one on the northwest corner of the estate where two streams meet.\u201d</p><p>Leo set down his half-filled plate and stared at him blankly. \u201cBut that\u2019s a pile of rubble covered with scrub. It was built at the time of Edward the Confessor, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Merripen said in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cThat\u2019s your true home.\u201d</p><p>Becoming more and more irritated, Leo said, \u201cI don\u2019t want that bloody wreckage, I want this house. Why is there a problem with that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I tell him?\u201d Beatrix asked eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve looked up all the legal words, and I know it better than anyone.\u201d She sat up with her pet ferret Dodger draped around her shoulders. \u201cYou see, Leo, the original manor home was left to ruin a few centuries ago. And one of the ancient Lord Ramsays acquired this fourteen-acre parcel and built a new home on it. Ever since then, Ramsay House has been handed down to each new viscount by special custom in the manor. But the last Lord Ramsay\u2014the one just before you\u2014found a way to leave all partible property, including the copyhold, to his widow and daughter. It\u2019s called an award of enfranchisement, and it\u2019s theirs for life. So Ramsay House and the fourteen-acre parcel it stands upon have been left to Countess Ramsay, and her daughter Vanessa Darvin.\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head incredulously. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we learned of this before?\u201d</p><p>Amelia answered in a glum tone. \u201cIt seems that the widow had no previous interest in the house, because it was a shambles. But now that it\u2019s been restored so beautifully, she has informed our solicitor that she intends to move in and take possession.\u201d</p><p>Leo was filled with outrage. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let anyone take Ramsay House from the Hathaways. If necessary, I\u2019ll bring this to chancery at Westminster.\u201d</p><p>Merripen pinched the corners of his eyes wearily. \u201cChancery won\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur solicitor has talked to the copyhold specialist at his firm. Unfortunately, there was never an entail placed on Ramsay House, only on the original manor home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about purchasing the copyhold from the widow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has already stated that no amount of money would induce her to part from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen\u2019s minds are frequently changed,\u201d Leo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make her an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. But if she refuses to negotiate, there\u2019s only one way for us to keep this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear this,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>\u201cThe last Lord Ramsay made a provision that you would retain the copyhold, including the house, if you married and produced legitimate male issue within five years of ennoblement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy five years?\u201d</p> <p>Win answered gently. \u201cBecause in the last three decades, no Ramsay has managed to live longer than five years after receiving the title. Nor have any of them sired a legitimate son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the good news, Leo,\u201d Beatrix said brightly, \u201cis that it\u2019s been four years since you became Lord Ramsay. If you can stay alive for just one more year, the family curse will be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd furthermore,\u201d Amelia added, \u201cyou have to marry and sire a son as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Leo stared at them all blankly in the expectant silence. A disbelieving laugh escaped him. \u201cYou\u2019re all mad if you think I\u2019m going to be forced into a loveless marriage just so the family can continue living at Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>Coming forward with a placating smile, Win handed him a piece of paper. \u201cOf course we would never want to force you into a loveless marriage, dear. But we have put together a list of prospective brides, all of them lovely girls. Won\u2019t you take a glance and see if any of them appeals to you?\u201d</p><p>Deciding to humor her, Leo looked down at the list. \u201cMarietta Newbury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Isabella Charrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Blossom Tremaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Leo, that\u2019s not her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I can\u2019t have a wife named Blossom. Every night I would feel as if I were calling in one of the cows.\u201d Leo lifted his gaze heavenward. \u201cI might as well marry the first woman off the street. Why, I\u2019d be better off with Marks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>Still tucked in the corner of the room, Catherine Marks looked up slowly as she realized that she was the focus of the Hathaways\u2019 collective gaze. Her eyes turned huge behind the spectacles, and a tide of pink rushed over her face. \u201cThat is not amusing,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect solution,\u201d Leo said, taking perverse satisfaction in annoying her. \u201cWe argue all the time. We can\u2019t stand each other. It\u2019s like we\u2019re already married.\u201d</p><p>Catherine sprang to her feet, staring at him in outrage. \u201cI would never consent to marry you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, because I wasn\u2019t asking. I was only making a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not use me to make a point!\u201d She fled the room, while Leo stared after her.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Win said thoughtfully, \u201cwe should have a ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ball?\u201d Merripen asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cYes, and invite all the eligible young women we can think of. It\u2019s possible one of them will strike Leo\u2019s fancy, and then he could court her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to court anyone,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>They all ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI like that idea,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cA bride-hunting ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be more accurate,\u201d Cam pointed out dryly, \u201cto call it a groom-hunting ball. Since Leo will be the item of prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like Cinderella,\u201d Beatrix exclaimed. \u201cOnly without the charming prince.\u201d</p><p>Deciding to calm the brewing squabble, Cam lifted his hand in a staying gesture. \u201cEasy, all of you. If it happens that we lose Ramsay House\u2014God forbid\u2014we can build another one on the freehold portion of the estate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would take forever, and the cost would be enormous,\u201d Amelia protested. \u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the same. We\u2019ve spent too much time restoring this place, and putting our hearts into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially Merripen,\u201d Win added quietly.</p><p>Merripen gave her a slight shake of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s only a house.\u201d</p><p>But they all knew it was more than a structure of brick and mortar ... it was their home. Cam and Amelia\u2019s son had been born there. Win and Merripen had been married there. With all its haphazard charm, Ramsay House was a perfect expression of the Hathaway family itself.</p><p>And no one understood that better than Leo. As an architect, he knew well that some buildings had an inherent character that was far more than the sum of their parts. Ramsay House had been damaged and restored ... it had gone from a neglected shell to a thriving, happy home, all because one family had cared. It was a crime that the Hathaways would be displaced by a pair of women who had invested nothing in it, through what amounted to nothing more than a legal sleight of hand.</p><p>Swearing beneath his breath, Leo dragged his hand through his hair. \u201cI want to have a look at the ruins of the old manor home,\u201d he said. \u201cMerripen, what\u2019s the best way to reach it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain,\u201d Merripen admitted. \u201cI rarely go out that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Beatrix volunteered. \u201cMiss Marks and I have ridden there to sketch the ruins. They\u2019re very picturesque.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to ride there with me?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d she said.</p><p>Amelia frowned. \u201cWhy do you want to visit the ruins, Leo?\u201d</p><p>He smiled in a way he knew would annoy her. \u201cWhy, to measure for curtains, of course.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cThunderbolts,\u201d Beatrix exclaimed, entering the library where Leo had been waiting, \u201cI can\u2019t go with you to the ruins after all. I\u2019ve just checked on Lucky, and she\u2019s about to have her babies. I can\u2019t leave her at such a time.\u201d</p><p>Leo smiled quizzically, replacing a book on a shelf. \u201cWho\u2019s Lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot you hadn\u2019t met her. She\u2019s a three-legged cat who used to belong to the cheesemaker in the village. The poor thing got her paw caught in a rat trap, and it had to be amputated. And now that she\u2019s no longer a good mouser, the cheesemaker gave her to me. He never even named her, can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven what happened to her, the name \u2018Lucky\u2019 is something of a misnomer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it might improve her fortunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will,\u201d Leo said, amused. Beatrix\u2019s passion for helping vulnerable creatures had always worried and touched the other Hathaways in equal measure. They all recognized that Beatrix was the most unconventional person in the family.</p><p>Beatrix was always sought after at London social events. She was a pretty girl, if not classically beautiful, with her blue eyes, dark hair, and tall, slender figure. Gentlemen were attracted by her freshness and charm, unaware that she showed the same patient interest to hedgehogs, field mice, and misbehaving spaniels. And when it came time for active courtship, men reluctantly left Beatrix\u2019s engaging company and turned to more conventional misses. With each successive season, her chances at marriage diminished.</p><p>Beatrix didn\u2019t seem to care. At the age of nineteen\u2014nearly twenty\u2014she had yet to fall in love. It was universally agreed among the Hathaways that few men would be able to understand or handle her. She was a force of nature, unhampered by conventional rules.</p><p>\u201cGo take care of Lucky,\u201d Leo said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to have any difficulty finding the ruins by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not going alone,\u201d she told him. \u201cI arranged for Miss Marks to accompany you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou did? And she was willing?\u201d</p><p>Before Beatrix could answer, Catherine entered the library, her slim figure dressed in riding clothes, her hair pulled back in a tight braided chignon. A sketchbook was clasped beneath her arm. She stopped short at the sight of Leo, who was wearing a gentleman\u2019s riding coat, close-fitting breeches, and well-worn boots.</p><p>Her wary gaze went to Beatrix. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you changed into your riding habit, dear?\u201d</p><p>Beatrix replied apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Marks, I can\u2019t go after all. Lucky needs me. But it\u2019s just as well\u2014you can show Leo the way even better than I.\u201d Her sunny smile encompassed them both. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day for riding, isn\u2019t it? Have a good outing!\u201d And she left the library in her long, lithe stride.</p> <p>Catherine\u2019s slender brows rushed downward as she looked at Leo. \u201cWhy do you want to visit the ruins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to look at them. Hang it all, do I have to explain myself to you? Just refuse if you\u2019re afraid to go somewhere alone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of you? Not in the least.\u201d</p><p>Leo gestured to the doorway in a parody of gentlemanly manners. \u201cAfter you, then.\u201d</p><p>As a result of the strategic importance of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, Hampshire was filled with ancient castles and picturesque ruins of forts and Saxon dwellings. Although Leo had known that there were remains of an old manor on the Ramsay estate, he hadn\u2019t yet found the opportunity to visit them. Among the concerns of farming, the accounting of rents, rates, and labor, the timber cutting and the architectural commissions Leo took on occasion, there hadn\u2019t been much time left for idle touring.</p> <p>Together he and Catherine rode past fields of flowering turnips and wheat, and clover pastures where fat white sheep grazed. They crossed through the timber forest to the northwest of the estate, where heavy streams cut through green hills and limestone crags. The ground was less arable here, more rock than loam, but its location was a solidly defensible position for an ancient fortified manor home.</p><p>As they ascended a hill, Leo took covert glances at Catherine. She was slim and graceful on horseback, guiding the horse with a smooth economy of motion. An accomplished woman, he mused. Poised, articulate, competent in nearly everything she did. And yet when another woman would have advertised such qualities, Catherine went to great lengths to keep from drawing attention to herself.</p><p>They reached the site of the original manor, where the remains of ancient walls protruded from the ground like the vertebrae of fossilized creatures. Inequalities in the scrub-covered ground marked the locations of the manor\u2019s outbuildings. A shallow circular ring, approximately twenty-five feet wide, revealed the dimensions of the moat that had surrounded a sixty-square-foot elevation of land.</p><p>After dismounting and tethering his horse, Leo went to assist Catherine. She disengaged her right leg from the pommel and took her foot from the stirrup, letting Leo control her descent. She alighted on the ground, facing him. Her face lifted, the brim of her riding hat partially shadowing her opalescent eyes.</p><p>They stood together with her hands on his shoulders. Her face was flushed with exertion, her lips parted ... and all at once Leo knew how it would be to make love to her, her body light and supple beneath his, her breath rushing against his throat as he moved between her thighs. He would bring her to ecstasy, slowly and ruthlessly, and she would claw and moan and sigh his name ...</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cYour ancestral home.\u201d</p> <p>Tearing his gaze from her, Leo regarded the crumbling ruins. \u201cCharming,\u201d he said. \u201cA little dusting and sweeping, and the place will be as good as new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go along with the family\u2019s plan to find a bride for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you have the makings of a decent husband. You haven\u2019t the character for it.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s sentiments exactly. Except that it rankled to hear her say it.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you a fit judge of my character?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her shoulders lifted in an uncomfortable shrug. \u201cOne can\u2019t help hearing about your exploits when all the dowagers and matrons are together at the balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And you believe every rumor you hear?\u201d</p> <p>She was silent. Leo expected her to argue, or insult him. To his surprise, however, she stared at him with something like remorse. \u201cYou have a point. And whether the rumors are true or false, it was wrong of me to listen.\u201d</p><p>Leo waited for her to follow that with some stinging insult, but she appeared genuinely chastened. Which was a surprise. It made him realize there was much he didn\u2019t know about her, this solitary and serious young woman who had hovered at the edge of his family for so long.</p><p>\u201cWhat do the gossips say about me?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>She gave him a wry glance. \u201cYour prowess as a lover is much vaunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, those rumors are definitely true.\u201d He clucked his tongue as if shocked. \u201cDo dowagers and chaperones really prattle about such things?\u201d</p><p>Her slender brows arched. \u201cWhat did you imagine they talked about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting. Jelly recipes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and bit back a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow tedious these affairs must be for you,\u201d Leo said. \u201cStanding at the side of the room, listening to gossip and watching everyone else dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it. I don\u2019t like dancing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever danced with a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen how can you be sure you wouldn\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have an opinion about something even if I haven\u2019t done it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s so much easier to form opinions without being troubled by experience or facts.\u201d</p><p>She frowned but kept silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me an idea, Marks,\u201d Leo went on. \u201cI\u2019m going to allow my sisters to plan the ball they mentioned earlier. Only for this reason: I\u2019m going to come to you in the middle of it and ask you to dance with me. In front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>She looked appalled. \u201cI would refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask nevertheless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo make a mockery of me,\u201d she said. \u201cTo make fools of us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice gentled. \u201cJust to dance, Marks.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked in a long, fascinated stare.</p><p>And then to Leo\u2019s surprise, Catherine smiled at him. A sweet, natural, brilliant smile, the first she had ever given him. Leo felt his chest tighten, and he went hot all over, as if some euphoric drug had gone straight to his nervous system.</p><p>It felt like ... happiness.</p><p>He remembered happiness from a long time ago. He didn\u2019t want to feel it. And yet the giddy warmth kept washing over him for no reason whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Catherine said, the smile still hovering on her lips. \u201cThat is kind of you, my lord. But I will never dance with you.\u201d</p><p>Which, of course, made it the goal of Leo\u2019s life.</p><p>Catherine turned to retrieve a sketchbook and roll of pencils from the saddle pouch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you sketched,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at it.\u201d</p><p>He gestured to the book in her hands. \u201cMay I see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd give you reason to mock me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. My solemn promise. Let me see.\u201d Slowly Leo extended his hand, palm up.</p> <p>Catherine glanced at his open hand, and then his face. Hesitantly she gave the book to him.</p><p>Opening the book, he glanced through the sketches. There was a series of the ruins from different angles, perhaps too careful and disciplined in places where a bit of looseness would have given the sketch more vitality. But on the whole it was very well done. \u201cLovely,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a nice feeling for line and form.\u201d</p><p>She colored, seeming uncomfortable with the praise. \u201cI understand from your sisters that you are an accomplished artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompetent, perhaps. My architectural training included a number of art classes.\u201d Leo gave her a casual grin. \u201cI\u2019m especially good at sketching things that stay still for long periods of time. Buildings. Lampposts.\u201d He leafed through the book. \u201cDo you have any of Beatrix\u2019s drawings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the last page,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cShe began to sketch a protruding section of the wall, over there, but she became preoccupied with a squirrel that kept hopping into the foreground.\u201d</p><p>Leo found a perfectly rendered and detailed portrait of a squirrel. He shook his head. \u201cBeatrix and her animals.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a grin.</p><p>\u201cMany people talk to their pets,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but very few understand the replies.\u201d Closing the sketchbook, Leo gave it back to her and began to walk the perimeter of the manor enclosure.</p><p>Catherine followed, picking her way among the gorse studded with yellow flowers and shiny black pods. \u201cHow deep was the original moat, do you estimate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would guess no more than eight feet where it cuts into the higher ground.\u201d Leo shielded his eyes as he surveyed their surroundings. \u201cThey must have diverted one of the streams to fill it. You see those mounds over there? They were probably farm buildings and serf quarters, made of clay and stud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the manor home like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe central keep was almost certainly made of stone, with the rest a combination of materials. And it was likely crowded with sheep, goats, dogs, and serfs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the history of the original overlord?\u201d Catherine sat on a portion of the exposed wall and arranged her skirts.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the first Viscount Ramsay?\u201d Leo stopped at the edge of the circular depression that had once been the moat. His gaze traveled across the broken landscape. \u201cHe started as Thomas of Blackmere, known for his lack of mercy. Apparently he had a talent for pillaging and burning villages. He was regarded as the left arm of Edward the Black Prince. Between them, they virtually destroyed the practice of chivalry.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he smiled at the sight of Catherine\u2019s wrinkled nose. She sat with schoolgirl straightness, the sketchbook in her lap. He would have liked to snatch her off the wall and do some pillaging of his own. Reflecting that it was a good thing she couldn\u2019t read his thoughts, he continued the story.</p><p>\u201cAfter fighting in France and being held prisoner for four years, Thomas was released and returned to England. I suppose he thought it was time to settle down, because he subsequently rode on this keep, killed the baron who had built it, seized his lands and ravished his widow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide. \u201cPoor lady.\u201d</p><p>Leo shrugged. \u201cShe must have had some influence on him. He married her afterward and sired six children by her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they live to a peaceful old age?\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head, approaching her leisurely. \u201cThomas went back to France, where they put an end to him at Castillon. But the French were quite civilized about it and raised a monument to him on the field.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he deserved any kind of tribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on the fellow\u2014he was only doing what the times demanded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a barbarian,\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cRegardless of the times.\u201d The wind had teased a lock of light golden hair loose from her tight chignon, and sent it straying over her cheek.</p><p>Unable to resist, Leo reached out and stroked the tendril back behind her ear. Her skin was baby-fine and smooth. \u201cMost men are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only that they have more rules now.\u201d He removed his hat, set it on the wall, and stared into her upturned face. \u201cYou may put a man in a cravat, teach him manners, and make him attend a soiree, but hardly any of us are truly civilized.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I know of men,\u201d she said, \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a mocking glance. \u201cWhat do you know of men?\u201d</p><p>She looked solemn, the clear gray irises now tinged with ocean green. \u201cI know not to trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say the same of women.\u201d He shed his coat, tossed it over the wall, and went to the hill at the center of the ruins. Surveying the surrounding land, Leo couldn\u2019t help wondering if Thomas of Blackmere had stood on this exact spot, looking over his property. And now, centuries later, the estate was Leo\u2019s to make of what he would, his to shape and order. Everyone and everything on it was his responsibility.</p><p>\u201cHow is the view from up there?\u201d he heard Catherine\u2019s voice from below.</p> <p>\u201cExceptional. Come see it, if you like.\u201d</p><p>She left the sketchbook on the fence and began up the slope of the mound, lifting her skirts as she climbed.</p><p>Turning to watch Catherine, Leo let his gaze linger on her slender, pretty figure. She was fortunate that medieval times were long past, he thought with a private smile, or she would have found herself snapped up and devoured by some marauding lord. But the touch of amusement faded quickly as he imagined the primitive satisfaction of claiming her, picking her up and carrying her to a soft patch of ground.</p><p>For just a moment he let himself dwell on the idea ... lowering himself to her writhing body, tearing her dress, kissing her br**sts\u2019</p><p>Leo shook his head to clear it, troubled by the direction of his thoughts. Whatever else he was, he was not a man to force himself on a woman. And yet the fantasy was too potent to ignore. With an effort, he bludgeoned the barbaric impulses back into submission.</p><p>Catherine was halfway up the slope when she gave a low cry and seemed to stumble.</p> <p>Concerned, Leo started for her immediately. \u201cDid you trip? Are you\u2019bloody hell.\u201d He stopped in place as he saw that the ground had partially given way beneath her. \u201cStop, Cat. Don\u2019t move. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked, her face bleached of color. \u201cIs it a sinkhole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a bloody architectural miracle. We seem to be standing on a portion of a roof that should have caved in at least two centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>They were approximately five yards apart, with Leo on higher ground.</p><p>\u201cCat,\u201d he said with great care, \u201cslowly lower yourself to the ground to redistribute your weight over a greater surface. Easy. Yes, like that. Now you\u2019re going to crawl back down the slope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d she asked, and the tremor in her voice wrenched his heart.</p><p>He answered in a thick voice that didn\u2019t sound like his own. \u201cSweetheart, I would love nothing more. But joining my weight to yours could collapse the roof entirely. Start moving. If it makes you feel better, with all the debris in there, it can\u2019t be too far to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that doesn\u2019t make me feel better at all.\u201d White-faced, she moved slowly on her hands and knees.</p> <p>Leo stayed in place, not taking his gaze from Catherine. The ground that seemed so solid beneath his feet was possibly nothing more than a layer of earth and ancient rotted timber. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said in a soothing tone, while his heart pounded with anxiety for her. \u201cYou weigh no more than a butterfly. It\u2019s my weight that\u2019s put a strain on what\u2019s left of the beams and bridging joints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re not moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If I cause a collapse when I try to get off, I\u2019d like you to be out of harm\u2019s way first.\u201d</p><p>They both felt the ground shift beneath them.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Catherine asked, her eyes wide, \u201cdo you think this has anything to do with the Ramsay curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that hadn\u2019t occurred to me yet,\u201d Leo said. \u201cThank you so much for bringing it to my attention.\u201d</p><p>The roof collapsed, and they simultaneously plunged amid a torrent of earth, rock, and timber into the dark space below.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Catherine stirred and coughed. There was grit in her mouth and eyes, and she was sprawled on a wretchedly uncomfortable surface.</p><p>\u201cMarks.\u201d She heard Leo shove debris aside as he made his way to her. His voice was unsteady and urgent. \u201cAre you hurt? Can you move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... I\u2019m all in one piece...\u201d She sat up and rubbed her face. Evaluating the collection of aches and pains in her body, she decided they were all insignificant. \u201cJust a bit bruised. Oh, dear. My spectacles are gone.\u201d</p><p>She heard him swear. \u201cI\u2019ll try to find them.\u201d</p><p>Disoriented, she tried to make out what she could of their surroundings. Leo\u2019s lean form was a dark blur nearby as he searched the rubble. Dust clouded the air, settling slowly. From what little she could see, they were in a pit, perhaps six feet deep, with sunlight drizzling in through the broken roof. \u201cYou were right, my lord. It wasn\u2019t far to fall. Is this the keep?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo\u2019s breathing sounded strained as he replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It could be an undercroft beneath the keep. I see the remains of a stone partition over there ... and hollows in the side wall where transverse joints would support\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a burst of fresh terror, Catherine launched herself at his indistinct form, scrabbling to reach him in the dimness.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leo\u2019s arms closed around her.</p><p>Gasping, she buried her face against the solid surface of his chest. They were half sitting, half lying amid heaps of rotted timber, stone, and earth.</p> <p>One of his hands came to her head, curving over her skull protectively. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was muffled in his shirt. \u201cUndercroft.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her hair and pressed her even closer into the protection of his body. \u201cYes. Why does that frighten you?\u201d</p><p>She could hardly speak between panting breaths. \u201cIsn\u2019t that ... where they keep the bodies?\u201d</p><p>The tremulous question hung in the air as Leo puzzled over it. \u201cOh. No, it\u2019s not that kind of undercroft.\u201d A quiver of rueful amusement ran through his voice, and she felt his mouth touch the rim of her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of one of the rooms beneath modern churches, where the deceased are put away. But a medieval undercroft is different. It\u2019s only a storeroom beneath the keep.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine didn\u2019t move. \u201cThere are no s-skeletons in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nor skulls, nor coffins.\u201d His hand continued to stroke tenderly over her hair. \u201cPoor darling. It\u2019s all right. Nothing fearsome down here. Take a deep breath. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Catherine continued to lie in his arms as she caught her breath. She tried to take in the fact that Leo, her enemy and tormentor, was calling her \u201cpoor darling\u201d and petting her. His lips brushed her temple and lingered gently. Holding still, she absorbed the sensation. She had never been attracted to men of his size, preferring those of less intimidating stature. But he was strong and comforting, and he seemed so genuinely concerned, and his voice was like dark velvet wrapping around her.</p><p>How perplexing.</p><p>Had anyone told her that she would one day be trapped alone in a filthy pit with Leo, Lord Ramsay, she would have said that was her worst nightmare. And yet it was turning out to be a rather agreeable experience. No wonder Ramsay was so sought after by the ladies of London ... If this was how he set about seducing them, all this lovely soothing and stroking, Catherine could easily understand how he got his way with them.</p><p>To her regret, he gently eased her away from him. \u201cMarks ... I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not going to be able to find your spectacles in this wreckage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have another pair at home,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Leo sat up with a quiet grunt of discomfort. \u201cNow, if we stand on the highest pile of debris, it\u2019s only a short distance to the surface. I\u2019m going to hoist you up, get you out of here, and then you\u2019re going to ride back to Ramsay House. Cam trained the horse, so you won\u2019t need to guide him. He\u2019ll find his way back home with no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked, bewildered.</p><p>He sounded rather sheepish. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to wait here until you send someone for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a\u2014\u201d He paused, searching for a word. \u201cSplinter.\u201d</p><p>She felt indignant. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me ride back alone and unescorted and virtually blind, to send someone to rescue you? All because you have a splinter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA large one,\u201d he volunteered.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is it? Your finger? Your hand? Maybe I can help to ... Oh, God. \u201d This last as he took her hand and brought it to his shoulder. His shirt was wet with blood, and a thick shard of timber protruded from his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not a splinter,\u201d she said in horror. \u201cYou\u2019ve been impaled. What can I do? Shall I pull it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it might be lodged against an artery. And I wouldn\u2019t care to bleed out down here.\u201d</p><p>She crawled closer to him, bringing her face close to his to examine him anxiously. Even in the shadows, he appeared pale and gray, and when she pressed her fingers to his forehead, she felt cool moisture.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt looks worse than it is.\u201d</p><p>But Catherine didn\u2019t agree. If anything, it was worse than it looked. She was infused with panic as she wondered if he were going into shock, a condition in which the heart did not pump enough blood to maintain the body. It had been described as a \u201cmomentary pause in the act of death.\u201d</p><p>Stripping off her riding coat, she tried to lay it over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTrying to keep you warm.\u201d</p><p>Leo plucked the garment off his chest and made a scoffing sound. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. First, the injury isn\u2019t that bad. Second, this tiny thing is not capable of keeping any part of me warm. Now, about my plan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is obviously a significant injury,\u201d she said, \u201cand I do not agree to your plan. I have a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he replied sardonically. \u201cMarks, for once would you do as I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to leave you here. I\u2019m going to pile up enough debris for both of us to climb out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even see, damn it. And you can\u2019t move these timbers and stones. You\u2019re too small.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is no need to make derogatory remarks about my stature,\u201d she said, lurching upward and squinting at her surroundings. Identifying the highest pile of debris, she made her way to it and hunted for nearby rocks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being derogatory.\u201d He sounded exasperated. \u201cYour stature is absolutely perfect for my favorite activity. But you\u2019re not built for hauling rocks. Blast it, Marks, you\u2019re going to hurt yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d Catherine said sharply, hearing him push some heavy object aside. \u201cYou\u2019ll worsen your injury, and then it will be even more difficult to get you out. Let me do the work.\u201d Finding a heap of ashlar blocks, she picked one up and lugged it up the pile, trying not to trip over her own skirts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough,\u201d Leo said, sounding aggravated and out of breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I lack in physical strength,\u201d she replied, going for another block, \u201cI make up for in determination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow inspiring. Could we set aside the heroic fortitude for one bloody moment and dredge up some common sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you, my lord. I need to save my breath for\u201d\u2014she paused to heft another block\u2014\u201cstacking rocks.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere amid the ordeal, Leo decided hazily that he would never underestimate Catherine Marks again. Ounce for ounce, she was the most insanely obstinate person he had ever known, dragging rocks and debris while half blind and hampered by long skirts, diligently crossing back and forth across his vision like an industrious mole. She had decided to build a mound upon which they could climb out, and nothing would stop her.</p><p>Occasionally she stopped and put her hand on his forehead or throat, checking his temperature and pulse. And then she would be off again.</p> <p>It was maddening not to be able to help her\u2014humiliating to let a woman do such work without him\u2014but every time he tried to stand, he became dizzy and disoriented. His shoulder was on fire, and he couldn\u2019t use his left arm properly. Cold sweat dripped from his face and stung his eyes.</p><p>He must have drifted off for a few minutes, because the next thing he was aware of was Catherine\u2019s urgent hands shaking him awake.</p><p>\u201cMarks,\u201d he said groggily. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He had the confused impression that it was morning, and she wanted him to awaken before his usual hour.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said with an anxious frown. \u201cI\u2019ve built the pile high enough that we can climb out now. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>His body felt as if it had been encased in lead. He was overwhelmed with weariness. \u201cIn few minutes. Let me doze a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, my lord.\u201d Clearly she would bully and badger him until he obeyed. \u201cCome with me. Up with you. Move.\u201d</p> <p>Leo complied with a groan, lurching until he had staggered to his feet. A cold burst of pain radiated from his shoulder and arm, and a few helpless curses slipped out before he could stop himself. Oddly, Catherine didn\u2019t rebuke him.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t trip\u2014you\u2019re too heavy for me to catch.\u201d</p><p>Profoundly irritated but aware that she was trying to help him, he concentrated on placing his feet and maintaining his balance.</p><p>\u201cIs Leo short for Leonard?\u201d she asked, confusing him.</p><p>\u201cConfound it, Marks, I don\u2019t want to talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d she persisted.</p><p>He realized she was trying to keep him alert. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, breathing heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s just Leo. My father loved the constellations. Leo is the ... constellation of high summer. The brightest star marks his heart. Regulus.\u201d He paused to stare blearily at the pile she had made. \u201cWell. How efficient you are. The next time I take an architectural commission\u2014\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll recommend you as the contractor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think if I\u2019d had my spectacles,\u201d she said. \u201cI could have made proper stairs.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a huff of laughter. \u201cYou go first, and I\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to my skirts,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Marks, that\u2019s the nicest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>They climbed out together laboriously, while Leo\u2019s blood turned to ice and his wound ached and his brains went to mush. By the time he\u2019d flopped to the ground in an awkward sideways sprawl, he was infuriated with Catherine for making him go to such effort when he\u2019d wanted to stay in the pit and rest. The sun was blinding, and he felt hot and strange. A ferocious ache had settled behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch my horse,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cWe\u2019ll ride back together.\u201d</p><p>The prospect of mounting a horse and riding to Ramsay House was exhausting. But faced with her ruthless insistence, he had no choice but to comply. Very well. He would ride. He would bloody well ride until he expired, and Catherine would appear at the house with his corpse seated behind her.</p><p>Leo sat there fuming and boiling until Catherine brought the horse. The anger gave him the strength for one last massive effort. He swung up behind her, sat the horse, and put his good arm around her slim body. He held on to her, shivering with discomfort. She was small but strong, her spine a steady axis that centered them both. Now all he had to do was endure. His resentment evaporated, dispersed by thrills of pain.</p><p>He heard Catherine\u2019s voice. \u201cWhy have you decided never to marry?\u201d</p><p>His head bobbed closer to her ear. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair to ask personal questions when I\u2019m nearly delirious. I might tell you the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>Did she realize she was asking for a piece of him, of his past, that he never gave to anyone? Had he been feeling even a little less wretched, he would have cut her off at once. But his usual defenses were no more effective than the broken stone wall surrounding the manor-house remains.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of the girl who died, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Catherine stunned him by asking. \u201cYou were betrothed. And she perished from the same scarlet fever that afflicted you and Win. What was her name...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura Dillard.\u201d It seemed impossible that he could share this with Catherine Marks, but she seemed to expect that he would. And somehow he was obliging her. \u201cBeautiful girl. She loved to watercolor. Few people are good at that, they\u2019re too afraid of making mistakes. You can\u2019t lift the color or hide it, once it\u2019s put down. And water is unpredictable\u2014an active partner in the painting\u2014you have to let it behave as it will. Sometimes the color diffuses in ways you don\u2019t expect, or one shade backruns into another. That was fine with Laura. She liked the surprises of it. We had known each other all during childhood. I went away for two years to study architecture, and when I came back, we fell in love. So easily. We never argued\u2014there was nothing to argue over. Nothing in our way. My parents had both died the previous year. My father had a heart ailment. He went to sleep one night and never woke up. And my mother followed him just a few months later. She couldn\u2019t stop mourning him. I hadn\u2019t known until then that some people could die of grief.\u201d</p> <p>He was quiet then, following the memories as if they were leaves and twigs floating on a stream. \u201cWhen Laura caught the fever, I never thought it would be fatal. I thought I loved her so much that the power of it would be greater than any illness. But I held her for three days and felt her dying a little more each hour. Like water trickling through my fingers. I held her until her heart stopped beating, and her skin finally turned cool. The fever had done its work and left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly, when he fell silent. She covered his good hand with her own. \u201cTruly sorry. I ... oh, what an inadequate thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Leo said. \u201cThere are some experiences in life they haven\u2019t invented the right words for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hand remained over his. \u201cAfter Laura died,\u201d she said in a moment, \u201cyou fell ill with the same fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a relief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to die. Except that Merripen, with his bloody Gypsy potions, wouldn\u2019t let me. It took a long time for me to forgive him for that. I hated him for keeping me alive. Hated the world for spinning without her. Hated myself for not having the bollocks to end it all. Every night I fell asleep begging Laura to haunt me. I think she did for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean ... in your mind? Or literally, as a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I suppose. I put myself and everyone around me through hell until I finally accepted that she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still love her.\u201d Catherine\u2019s voice was bleak. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll never marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have an extraordinary fondness for her memory. But it was a lifetime ago. And I can\u2019t ever go through that again. I love like a madman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might not be like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it would be worse. Because I was only a boy then. And now who I am, what I need ... it\u2019s too damned much for anyone to manage.\u201d A sardonic laugh rustled in his throat. \u201cI overwhelm even myself, Marks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>By the time they reached the timber yard, set a short distance from Ramsay House, Catherine was desperately worried. Leo had become monosyllabic, and he was leaning on her heavily. He was shivering and sweating, his arm a cold weight across her front as he held on to her. A portion of her dress stuck to her shoulder where his blood had soaked it. She saw a blurry group of men preparing to unload a timber wagon. Please, dear God, let Merripen be among them.</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Merripen with you?\u201d she called out.</p><p>To her vast relief, Merripen\u2019s dark, lean form emerged. \u201cYes, Miss Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ramsay has been injured,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cWe took a fall\u2014his shoulder was pierced\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him to the house. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p> <p>Before she could reply, he had already begun to run to the house with smooth, ground-eating speed.</p><p>By the time Catherine had guided the horse to the front entrance, Merripen was there.</p><p>\u201cThere was an accident at the ruins,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cA shard of timber has been lodged in his shoulder for at least an hour. He\u2019s very cold, and his speech is disoriented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my usual way of talking,\u201d Leo said behind her. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly lucid.\u201d He tried to descend from the horse in a kind of slow topple. Reaching up for him, Merripen caught him deftly. He wedged his shoulder beneath Leo\u2019s and guided his good arm around his neck. The pain jolted Leo and caused him to grunt. \u201cOh, you sodding filthy whoreson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are lucid,\u201d Merripen said dryly, and he looked at Catherine. \u201cWhere is Lord Ramsay\u2019s horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill at the ruins.\u201d</p><p>Merripen gave her an assessing glance. \u201cAre you injured, Miss Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Run into the house and find Cam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Accustomed as the Hathaways were to emergencies, they managed the situation with brisk efficiency. Cam and Merripen helped Leo into the manor and up the stairs, one on either side of him. Although a bachelor\u2019s house had been built beside the estate for Leo\u2019s use, he had insisted that Merripen and Win live there instead, pointing out that as a fairly recently married couple, they needed the privacy far more than he. When he came to Hampshire, he stayed in one of the guest rooms in the main house.</p><p>They formed a fairly harmonious triad, Cam and Merripen and Leo, each with his own area of responsibility. Although Leo was the holder of the estate, he had no objection to sharing authority. Upon returning from France after a two-year absence, Leo had been grateful to see how Cam and Merripen had rebuilt the Ramsay estate in his absence. They had turned the ramshackle property into a thriving and prosperous enterprise, and neither of them had asked for anything in return. And Leo had recognized that he had much to learn from both of them.</p><p>Running an estate required far more than lounging in the library with a glass of port, as the aristocrats in novels did. It took extensive knowledge of agriculture, business, animal husbandry, construction, timber production, and land improvement. All that added to the responsibilities of politics and Parliament was more than one man could undertake. Therefore, Merripen and Leo had agreed to share the timber and agricultural concerns, while Cam handled the estate business and investments.</p><p>In medical emergencies, although Merripen was competent in such matters, Cam usually took charge. Having learned the healing arts from his Romany grandmother, Cam was relatively experienced at treating illness and injury. It was better, safer even, to let him do what he could for Leo rather than send for a doctor.</p> <p>The established practice in modern medicine was for doctors to bleed their patients for every imaginable ailment, despite controversies within the medical community. Statisticians had begun to track case history to prove that bloodletting did no good whatsoever, but the procedure persisted. Sometimes bloodletting was even used to treat hemorrhaging, in accordance with the belief that it was better to do something than nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d Cam said as he and Merripen settled Leo into his bed, \u201cwe\u2019ll need cans of hot water sent up from the kitchen, and all the toweling you can spare. And Win, perhaps you and Beatrix might take Miss Marks to her room and help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Catherine protested, \u201cthank you, but I don\u2019t need assistance. I can wash by myself and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her objections were overridden, however. Win and Beatrix would not relent until they had overseen her bath and helped to wash her hair and change her into a fresh gown. The extra pair of spectacles was found, and Catherine was relieved to have her vision restored. Win insisted on tending Catherine\u2019s hands and applying salve and bandages to her fingers.</p><p>Finally Catherine was allowed to go to Leo\u2019s room, while Win and Beatrix went to wait downstairs. She found Amelia, Cam, and Merripen all crowded around the bedside. Leo was shirtless, and heaped with blankets. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised her that he was arguing simultaneously with the three of them.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need his permission,\u201d Merripen said to Cam. \u201cI\u2019ll pour it down his throat if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will,\u201d Leo growled. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you try\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to force you to take it,\u201d Cam interrupted, sounding exasperated. \u201cBut you have to explain your reasons, phral, because you\u2019re not making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to explain. You and Merripen can take that filthy stuff and shove it up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Catherine asked from the doorway. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>Amelia came out into the hallway, her face taut with worry and vexation. \u201cYes, the problem is that my brother is a pigheaded idiot,\u201d she said, loudly enough for Leo to hear. She turned to Catherine and lowered her voice. \u201cCam and Merripen say the wound isn\u2019t serious, but it could become very bad indeed if they don\u2019t clean it properly. The piece of timber slipped in between the clavicle and the shoulder joint, and there\u2019s no way of knowing how deep it went. They have to irrigate the wound to remove splinters or clothing fibers, or it will fester. In other words, it\u2019s going to be a bloody mess. And Leo refuses to take any laudanum.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine regarded her with bafflement. \u201cBut ... he must have something to dull his senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But he won\u2019t. He keeps telling Cam to go ahead and treat the wound. As if anyone could do such painstaking work when a man is screaming in agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t scream,\u201d Leo retorted from the bedroom. \u201cI only do that when Marks starts reciting her poetry.\u201d</p><p>Despite her consternation, Catherine almost smiled.</p><p>Peering around the doorjamb, she saw that Leo\u2019s coloring was terrible, his sun-browned complexion lightened to an ashy pallor. He was trembling like a wet dog. As his gaze met hers, he looked so defiant and exhausted and miserable that Catherine couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking, \u201cA word with you, my lord, if I may?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d came his sullen reply. \u201cI would so love to have someone else to argue with.\u201d</p><p>She entered the room, while Cam and Merripen moved aside. With an apologetic expression, she asked, \u201cIf I might have a moment of privacy with Lord Ramsay...?\u201d</p><p>Cam gave her a quizzical glance, clearly wondering what influence she thought she could have with Leo. \u201cDo what you can to persuade him to drink that medicine on the bedside table.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Merripen added, \u201ctry a hard knock on the skull with that fireplace poker.\u201d</p><p>The pair went out into the hallway.</p><p>Left alone with Leo, Catherine approached the bedside. She winced at the sight of the stake embedded in his shoulder, the lacerated flesh oozing blood. Since there was no bedside chair to sit on, she perched carefully on the edge of the mattress. She stared at him steadily, her voice soft with concern. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you take the laudanum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Marks...\u201d He let out a harsh sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t. Believe me, I know what it\u2019s going to be like without it, but I have no choice. It\u2019s...\u201d He stopped and looked away from her, setting his jaw against a new spate of shivering.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Catherine wanted so badly to reach him, to understand, that she found herself touching his hand. When no resistance was offered, she became emboldened and slid her bandaged fingers beneath his cold palm. \u201cTell me,\u201d she urged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s hand turned and enclosed hers in a careful grip that sent a response through her entire body. The sensation was one of relief, a feeling of something fitting exactly into place. They both stared at their joined hands, warmth collecting in the sphere of palms and fingers.</p><p>\u201cAfter Laura died,\u201d she heard him say thickly, \u201cI behaved very badly. Worse than I do now, if you can conceive it. But no matter what I did, nothing gave me the oblivion I needed. One night I went to the East End with a few of my more depraved companions, to an opium den.\u201d He paused as he felt Catherine\u2019s hand tighten in reaction. \u201cYou could smell the smoke all down the alley. The air was brown with it. They took me to a room filled with men and women all lying pell-mell on pallets and pillows, mumbling and dreaming. The way the opium pipes glowed ... it was like dozens of little red eyes winking in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a vision of hell,\u201d Catherine whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes. And hell was exactly where I wanted to be. Someone brought me a pipe. With the first draw, I felt so much better, I almost wept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d she asked, her hand clutched fast in his.</p><p>\u201cIn an instant, all is right with the world, and nothing, no matter how dark or painful, can change that. Imagine all the guilt and fear and fury you\u2019ve ever felt, lifting away like a feather on a breeze.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps once Catherine would have judged him severely for indulging in such wickedness. But now she felt compassion. She understood the pain that had driven him to such depths.</p><p>\u201cBut the feeling doesn\u2019t last,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. And when it goes, you\u2019re worse off than before. You can\u2019t take pleasure in anything. The people you love don\u2019t matter. All you can think of is the opium smoke and when you can have it again.\u201d</p><p>Catherine stared at his partially averted profile. It hardly seemed possible that this was the same man she had scorned and disdained for the past year. Nothing had ever seemed to matter to him\u2014he had seemed utterly shallow and self-indulgent. When in truth, things had mattered far too much. \u201cWhat made you stop?\u201d she asked gently.</p> <p>\u201cI reached the point at which the thought of going on was too damned exhausting. I had a pistol in my hand. It was Cam who stopped me. He told me the Rom believe that if you grieve too much, you turn the spirit of the deceased into a ghost. I had to let Laura go, he said. For her sake.\u201d Leo looked at her then, his eyes a riveting blue. \u201cAnd I did. I have. I swore to leave off the opium, and since then I\u2019ve never touched the filthy stuff. Sweet Christ, Cat, you don\u2019t know how hard it was. It took everything I had to turn away. If I went back to it even once ... I might find myself in the bottom of a pit I could never climb out of. I can\u2019t take that chance. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo...\u201d She saw him blink in surprise. It was the first time she had ever used his name. \u201cTake the laudanum,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t let you fall. I won\u2019t let you turn into a degenerate.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cYou\u2019re offering to take me on as your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too much for you to manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Catherine said decisively, \u201cyou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He let out a mirthless laugh, followed by a long, curious stare. As if she were someone he ought to know but couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>Catherine could hardly believe that she was perched on the edge of his bed, holding the hand of a man she had battled so fiercely and for so long. She had never imagined that he would willingly make himself vulnerable to her.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can.\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head slightly, holding her gaze. At first she thought he was refusing her. But it turned out that he was shaking his head in rueful wonder at his own actions. He gestured for the small glass of liquid on the bedside table. \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbefore I have a chance to think better of it.\u201d She handed the glass to him, and he downed it in a few efficient gulps. A shudder of revulsion swept through him as he gave the empty glass back to her.</p><p>They both waited for the medicine to take effect.</p><p>\u201cYour hands...\u201d Leo said, reaching for her bandaged fingers. The tip of his thumb brushed gently over the surface of her nails.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust a few scrapes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The blue eyes turned hazy and unfocused, and he closed them. The pained grooves of his face began to relax. \u201cHave I thanked you yet,\u201d he asked, \u201cfor hauling me out of the ruins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks are necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the same ... thank you.\u201d Lifting one of her hands, he cradled her palm against his cheek while his eyes remained closed. \u201cMy guardian angel,\u201d he said, the words beginning to slur. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever had one until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you did,\u201d she said, \u201cyou probably ran too fast for her to keep up with you.\u201d</p> <p>He made a quiet sound of amusement.</p><p>The feel of his shaven cheek beneath her hand filled her with astonishing tenderness. She had to remind herself that the opium was exerting its influence on him. This feeling between them wasn\u2019t real. But it seemed as if something new were emerging from the wreckage of their former conflict. A thrill of intimacy went through her as she felt the ripple of his swallow in the space beneath his jaw.</p><p>They stayed like that until a noise from the doorway caused Catherine to start.</p><p>Cam entered the room, glanced at the empty glass, and gave Catherine an approving nod. \u201cWell done,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will make it easer on Ramsay. And more importantly, on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger you,\u201d Leo replied mildly, slitting his eyes open as Cam and Merripen went to the bedside. Amelia followed with an armload of clean rags and toweling. Reluctantly, Catherine pulled away from Leo and retreated to the doorway.</p> <p>Cam looked down at his brother-in-law with a mixture of concern and affection. The abundant sunlight from the window slid over the shiny black layers of his hair. \u201cI can take care of this, phral. But we could send for a gadjo doctor if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. Anything he did would be far worse than your blundering. And he\u2019d start with his damned jar of leeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo leeches here,\u201d Cam replied as he eased the pillows from behind Leo\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Amelia asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Cam helped Leo to lower to the mattress. \u201cWhen I was a boy still living with the tribe, I went wading in a spring-fed pond with a few of the other children. We all came out with leeches attached to our legs. I would say I screamed like a girl, except the girls were much quieter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Cam,\u201d Amelia said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cPoor Cam?\u201d Leo echoed, sounding indignant. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to give you too much sympathy,\u201d Amelia replied, \u201cin light of my suspicion that you\u2019ve only done this to get out of the turnip planting.\u201d</p><p>Leo replied with two choice words that made her grin.</p><p>Pulling the bed linens to her brother\u2019s waist, Amelia carefully tucked towels beneath his injured shoulder and side. The sight of his lean, smoothly muscled torso\u2014and that intriguing dusting of hair on his chest\u2014caused Catherine\u2019s stomach to dive in an odd little swoop. She retreated farther behind the door, not wanting to leave and yet knowing it was improper for her to stay.</p><p>Cam dropped a kiss atop his wife\u2019s head and nudged her away from the bed. \u201cWait over there, monisha\u2014we need room to work.\u201d He turned to the nearby tray of supplies.</p><p>Catherine blanched as she heard the rattle of knives and metal implements.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to sacrifice a goat or perform a tribal dance?\u201d Leo asked woozily. \u201cOr at least chant something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did all that downstairs,\u201d Cam said. He handed a piece of leather strap to Leo. \u201cPut this between your teeth. And try not to make too much noise while we\u2019re working on you. My son is napping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore I put this in my mouth,\u201d Leo said, \u201cyou might tell me the last place it\u2019s been.\u201d He paused. \u201cOn second thought ... never mind. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He put the strap between his teeth, then removed it temporarily to add, \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t amputate anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we do,\u201d Merripen said, swabbing carefully around the injured shoulder, \u201cit won\u2019t be intentional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady, phral?\u201d she heard Cam ask gently. \u201cHold him still, Merripen. All right. On the count of three.\u201d</p><p>Amelia joined Catherine in the hallway, her face tense. She wrapped her arms around her middle.</p><p>They heard Leo\u2019s low groan, followed by a voluble flow of Romany between Cam and Merripen. The foreign language was brisk but soothing.</p><p>It was clear that despite the effects of the opium, the procedure was difficult to endure. Every time Catherine heard a grunt or pained sound coming from Leo, she tensed all over and knotted her torn fingers together.</p><p>After two or three minutes had passed, Amelia looked around the doorway. \u201cDid it splinter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little, monisha, \u201d came Cam\u2019s reply. \u201cIt could have been much worse, but\u2014\u201d He paused at a muffled sound from Leo. \u201cSorry, phral. Merripen, take the tweezers and\u2014yes, that part right there.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s face was pale as she turned back to Catherine. And she astonished her by reaching out and drawing her close in the same way she might have hugged Win, Poppy, or Beatrix. Catherine stiffened a little, not in aversion but awkwardness. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t harmed, Catherine,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThank you for taking care of Lord Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded slightly.</p><p>Drawing back, Amelia smiled at her. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, you know. He has more lives than a cat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Catherine said soberly. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t a result of the Ramsay curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in curses, or spells, or anything of the sort. The only curse my brother faces is self-imposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... you mean because of his grief over Laura Dillard?\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s blue eyes turned round. \u201cHe talked to you about her?\u201d</p> <p>Catherine nodded.</p><p>Amelia seemed caught off guard. Taking Catherine\u2019s arm, she drew her further along the hallway, where there was less risk of being overheard. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she liked to watercolor,\u201d Catherine replied hesitantly. \u201cThat they were betrothed, and then she caught the scarlet fever, and died in his arms. And that ... she haunted him for a time. Literally. But that couldn\u2019t be true ... could it?\u201d</p><p>Amelia was silent for a good half minute. \u201cI think it might be,\u201d she said with remarkable calmness. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t admit that to many people\u2014it makes me sound like a lunatic.\u201d A wry smile crossed her lips. \u201cHowever, you\u2019ve lived with the Hathaways long enough to know of a certainty that we are indeed a pack of lunatics.\u201d She paused. \u201cCatherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy brother never discusses Laura Dillard with anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Catherine blinked. \u201cHe was in pain. He\u2019d lost blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that is why he confided in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other reason could there have been?\u201d Catherine asked with difficulty.</p><p>It must have shown in her face, how much she dreaded the answer.</p><p>Amelia stared at her closely, and then shrugged with a rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019ve already said too much. Forgive me. It\u2019s only that I desire my brother\u2019s happiness so greatly.\u201d She paused before adding sincerely, \u201cAnd yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assure you, ma\u2019am, one has nothing to do with the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Amelia murmured, and went back to the doorway to wait.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>After the wound had been cleaned and bandaged, Leo was left gray-faced and exhausted. He slept for the rest of the day, waking occasionally to find broth or fever tea being poured down his throat. The family was merciless in their efforts to take care of him.</p><p>As he had expected, the opiate sent him into nightmares, filled with creatures rising from the earth to claw and pull at him, tugging him down below the surface where red glowing eyes blinked at him in the dark. Trapped in a narcotic daze, Leo couldn\u2019t fully awaken from the dreams, only struggled in the heat and misery, and subsided into more hallucinations. The only respite was when a cool cloth was applied to his forehead, and a gentle, comforting presence hovered beside him.</p><p>\u201cAmelia? Win?\u201d he mumbled in confusion.</p><p>\u201cShhhh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d he said with an aching sigh.</p> <p>\u201cLie still.\u201d</p><p>He was vaguely aware of two or three other times when the cloth was changed ... merciful coolness applied to his brow ... a light hand curving against his cheek.</p><p>When he awoke in the morning, he was tired, feverish, and in the grip of a profound gloom. It was the usual aftermath of opium, of course, but the knowledge hardly helped to alleviate the overwhelming dreariness.</p><p>\u201cYou have a mild fever,\u201d Cam told him in the morning. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to drink more yarrow tea to bring it down. But there\u2019s no sign of festering. Rest today, and I expect you\u2019ll feel much better by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tea tastes like ditch water,\u201d Leo muttered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to stay in bed all day.\u201d</p><p>Cam looked sympathetic. \u201cI understand, phral. You don\u2019t feel ill enough to rest, but you\u2019re not well enough to do anything. All the same, you have to give yourself a chance to heal, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going downstairs for a proper breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is done. They\u2019ve already cleared the sideboard.\u201d</p><p>Leo scowled and rubbed his face, wincing at the fiery pull of his shoulder. \u201cHave Merripen come up here. I want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is out with the tenants, drilling turnip seed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking care of the baby. He\u2019s teething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with the housekeeper, taking inventory and ordering supplies. Beatrix is carrying baskets to elderly cottagers in town. And I have to visit a tenant who\u2019s two months lacking in his rent. I\u2019m afraid there is no one available to entertain you.\u201d</p><p>Leo greeted this statement with surly silence. And then he brought himself to ask for the person he truly wanted. The person who hadn\u2019t bothered to look in on him or ask after his welfare even after she\u2019d promised to safeguard him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw her, she was busy with needlework. It seems the mending has piled up, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can do it here.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s face was carefully blank. \u201cYou want Miss Marks to do the mending in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, send her up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask if she\u2019s willing,\u201d Cam said, looking doubtful.</p><p>After Leo had washed and dragged on a dressing robe, he went back to bed. He was sore and infuriatingly unsteady. A housemaid brought a small tray with a solitary piece of toast and a cup of tea. Leo ate his breakfast while staring morosely at the empty doorway.</p><p>Where was Marks? Had Cam even bothered to tell her that she was wanted? If so, she had evidently decided to ignore the summons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Callous, coldhearted harpy. And this after she had promised to be responsible for him. She had persuaded him to take the laudanum, and then she had deserted him.</p><p>Well, Leo didn\u2019t want her now. If she decided to appear after all, he would send her away. He would laugh scornfully and tell her that no company at all was better than having her there. He would\u2019</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>His heart gave a leap as he saw her at the doorway, dressed in a dark blue gown, her light golden hair caught up and pinned in its usual stern confinement.</p> <p>She held a book in one hand and a glass of pale liquid in the other. \u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored out of my wits,\u201d Leo said with a scowl. \u201cWhy did you take so long to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were still asleep.\u201d Entering the room, Catherine left the door wide open. The long, furry form of Dodger the ferret came loping in after her. After standing tall to view his surroundings, Dodger scurried beneath the dresser. Catherine watched the ferret suspiciously. \u201cProbably one of his new hiding places,\u201d she said, and sighed. She brought Leo a glass of cloudy liquid, and gave it to him. \u201cDrink this, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillowbark, for your fever. I stirred in some lemon and sugar to improve the flavor.\u201d</p> <p>Leo drank the bitter brew, watching as Catherine moved about the room. She opened a second window to admit more of the outside breeze. Taking his breakfast tray out to the hallway, she gave it to a passing housemaid. When she returned to Leo, she laid her fingers on his forehead to test his temperature.</p><p>Leo caught her wrist, staying the motion. He stared at her in dawning recognition. \u201cIt was you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou came to me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou changed the cloth on my forehead. More than once.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s fingers curled lightly around his. Her voice was very soft. \u201cAs if I would enter a man\u2019s bedroom in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>But they both knew she had. The weight of melancholy lifted considerably, especially as Leo saw the concern in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHow are your hands?\u201d he asked, turning her scraped fingers to inspect them.</p><p>\u201cHealing nicely, thank you.\u201d She paused. \u201cI am told you require companionship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cI\u2019ll make do with you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Leo wanted to pull her against him and inhale her scent. She smelled light and clean, like tea and talcum and lavender.</p><p>\u201cShall I read to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI brought a novel. Do you like Balzac?\u201d</p><p>The day was improving rapidly. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Catherine occupied the chair by the bedside. \u201cHe meanders a bit too much for my taste. I prefer novels with more plot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut with Balzac,\u201d Leo said, \u201cyou have to give yourself over fully. You have to wallow and roll in the language...\u201d Pausing, he looked more closely at her small oval face. She was pale, and there were shadows beneath her eyes, no doubt as a result of having visited him so many times in the night. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cOn my account. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not at all, it wasn\u2019t you. I had nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned guarded. Forbidden territory. And yet Leo couldn\u2019t help pressing. \u201cAre the nightmares about your past? About whatever situation it was that Rutledge found you in?\u201d</p><p>Drawing in a sharp breath, Catherine stood, looking stunned and slightly ill. \u201cPerhaps I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leo said quickly, making a staying gesture with his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I need company\u2014I\u2019m still suffering the aftereffects of the laudanum that you convinced me to take.\u201d Seeing her continuing hesitation, he added, \u201cAnd I have a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mild one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang it, Marks, you\u2019re a companion,\u201d he said with a scowl. \u201cDo your job, will you?\u201d</p><p>She looked indignant for a moment, and then a laugh burst out despite her efforts to hold it in. \u201cI\u2019m Beatrix\u2019s companion,\u201d she said. \u201cNot yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday you\u2019re mine. Sit and start reading.\u201d</p><p>To Leo\u2019s surprise, the masterful approach actually worked. Catherine resumed her seat and opened the book to the first page. She used the tip of a forefinger to push her spectacles into place\u2014a meticulous little gesture that he adored. \u201cUn Homme d\u2019Affaires,\u201d she read. \u201cA Man of Business. Chapter one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Catherine glanced at him expectantly.</p><p>Leo chose his words with care. \u201cIs there any part of your past that you would be willing to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that\u2019s proof of how interesting you are. There\u2019s nothing more tedious than people who like to talk about themselves. I\u2019m a perfect example.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the book as if she were trying very hard to concentrate on the page. But after just a few seconds, she looked up with a grin that seemed to dissolve his spine. \u201cYou are many things, my lord. But tedious is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>As Leo gazed at her, he felt the same inexplicable flourish of warmth, of happiness, that he\u2019d experienced yesterday, before their mishap at the ruins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d Catherine asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first learn that you needed spectacles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was five or six. My parents and I lived in Holborn, in a tenement at Portpool Lane. Since girls couldn\u2019t go to school at the time, a local woman tried to teach a few of us. She told my mother that I was very good at memorization, but I was slow-witted when it came to reading and writing. One day my mother sent me on an errand to fetch a parcel from the butcher. It was only two streets away, but I got lost. Everything was a blur. I was found wandering and crying a few streets away, until finally someone led me to the butcher\u2019s shop.\u201d A smile curved her lips. \u201cWhat a kind man he was. When I told him I didn\u2019t think I could find my way home, he said he had an idea. And he had me try on his wife\u2019s spectacles. I couldn\u2019t believe how the world looked. Magical. I could see the pattern of bricks on walls, and birds in the air, and even the weave of the butcher\u2019s apron. That was my problem, he said. I just hadn\u2019t been able to see. And ever since then I\u2019ve worn spectacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere your parents relieved to discover their daughter wasn\u2019t slow-witted after all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite the opposite. They argued for days about which side of the family my weak eyes had come from. My mother was quite distressed, as she said spectacles would mar my appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rot.\u201d</p><p>She looked rueful. \u201cMy mother did not possess what one would call a great depth of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn light of her actions\u2014abandoning a husband and son, running to England with her lover\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have expected a surfeit of principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they were married, when I was a child,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWas there love between them?\u201d</p><p>Considering that, she chewed her lower lip, drawing his attention to the enticing softness of her mouth. \u201cThey were attracted to each other in a physical sense,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut that\u2019s not love, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhat happened to your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve confided in you?\u201d He gave her a chiding glance. \u201cBe fair, Marks. It can\u2019t be any more difficult for you than it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Catherine took a deep breath. \u201cWhen my mother fell ill, my father felt it as a great burden. He paid a woman to look after her until the end, and sent me away to live with my aunt and grandmother, and I never heard from him again. He may be dead, for all I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Leo said. And he was. Genuinely sorry, wishing he could somehow have gone back in time to comfort a small girl in spectacles, who had been abandoned by the man who should have protected her. \u201cNot all men are like that,\u201d he felt the need to point out.</p><p>\u201cI know. It would hardly be fair of me to blame the entire male population for my father\u2019s sins.\u201d</p><p>Leo became uncomfortably aware that his own behavior hadn\u2019t been any better than her father\u2019s, that he had indulged in his own bitter grief to the point of abandoning his sisters. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019ve always hated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI must remind you of him. I deserted my sisters when they needed me.\u201d</p><p>Catherine gave him a clear-eyed stare, not pitying, not censorious, just ... appraising. \u201cNo,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cYou\u2019re not at all like him. You came back to your family. You\u2019ve worked for them, cared for them. And I\u2019ve never hated you.\u201d</p><p>Leo stared at her closely, more than a little surprised by the revelation. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact\u2014\u201d She broke off abruptly.</p><p>\u201cIn fact?\u201d Leo prompted. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were. Something along the lines of liking me against your will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d Catherine said primly, but Leo saw the twitch of a smile at her lips.</p><p>\u201cIrresistibly attracted by my dashing good looks?\u201d he suggested. \u201cMy fascinating conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeduced by my brooding glances?\u201d He accompanied this with a waggish swerving of his brows that finally reduced her to laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes, it must have been those.\u201d</p><p>Settling back against the pillows, Leo regarded her with satisfaction.</p><p>What a wonderful laugh she had, light and throaty, as if she had been drinking champagne.</p><p>And what a problem this could become, this madly inappropriate desire for her. She was becoming real to him, dimensional, vulnerable in ways he had never imagined.</p><p>As Catherine read aloud, the ferret emerged from beneath the dresser and climbed onto her lap. He fell asleep in an upside-down circle, his mouth open. Leo didn\u2019t blame Dodger in the slightest. Catherine\u2019s lap looked like a lovely place to rest one\u2019s head.</p><p>Leo feigned interest in the complex and detailed narrative, while his mind occupied itself with the question of what she would look like naked. It seemed tragic that he would never see her so. But even by Leo\u2019s dilapidated code of ethics, a man did not take a virgin unless he had serious intentions. He had tried it once, letting himself fall madly in love, nearly losing everything as a result.</p><p>And there were some risks a man couldn\u2019t take twice.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>It was past midnight. Catherine woke to the sound of a baby\u2019s whimpering. Little Rye was teething, and the usually sweet-natured cherub had been fretful of late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Catherine stared sightlessly in the darkness, kicked the bed linens away from her legs, and tried to find a more comfortable position in which to sleep. Her side. Her stomach. Nothing felt right.</p><p>After a few minutes, the baby\u2019s crying stopped. No doubt he was being soothed by his attentive mother.</p><p>But Catherine was left awake. Lonely, aching. The worst kind of awake.</p><p>She tried to occupy herself with old Celtic sheep-counting words, still used by rural farmers in place of modern numbers ... yan, tan, tethera, pethera ... One could hear the echo of centuries in the ancient syllables. Sethera, methera, hovera, covera ...</p><p>Her mind summoned an image of singular blue eyes, striated light and dark, like strips of sky and ocean. Leo had watched her while she had read to him, and while she had done the mending. And underneath their banter, and his relaxed fa\u00e7ade, she had known that he wanted her. Yan, tan, tethera ...</p><p>Perhaps Leo was awake at this very moment. His fever had dissipated earlier in the evening, but it might have rekindled. He might need water. A cool cloth.</p><p>Catherine left the bed and snatched up her dressing robe before she could think twice. Finding her spectacles on the dressing table, she placed them precisely on her nose.</p><p>Her bare feet crossed the wood floors of the hallway as she went on her charitable mission.</p><p>The door to his room was partially open. She slipped in without a sound, like a thief, tiptoeing to the bed just as she had the previous night. The darkness of the room was penetrated by a few runnels of light from the open window, as if the shadows were a sieve. She could hear the soft and steady flow of Leo\u2019s breathing.</p><p>Making her way to his side, Catherine reached out tentatively, her heartbeat thickening as she laid her fingers on his forehead. No fever. Only smooth, healthy warmth.</p><p>Leo\u2019s breathing fractured as he awakened. \u201cCat?\u201d His voice was sleep-thickened. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have gone to him. Any excuse she gave would sound false and ridiculous, because there was no rational reason to have bothered him.</p><p>Awkwardly she mumbled, \u201cI ... I came to see if...\u201d Her voice died away.</p><p>She began to draw back but he caught her wrist with remarkable dexterity, considering that it was night and he was barely awake. They both went still as she was caught poised over him, her wrist imprisoned in his grip.</p><p>Leo exerted tension on her arm, forcing her to lean farther over him, farther, until her balance was compromised and she fell on him in a slow topple. Terrified of hurting him, she scrabbled to brace her hands on the mattress, and he used every movement to lever her more fully onto his body. She started as she encountered bare flesh tightly knit with muscle, his chest covered with a soft, crisp fleece.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>His long hand curved around the back of her head, and he brought her mouth down to his.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a kiss, it was a possession. He took her fully, the heat of his tongue thrusting inside her, draining her of volition and thought. The masculine incense of his skin filled her nostrils. Erotic. Delicious. Too many sensations to take in at once ... the hot silk of his mouth, the assured grip of his hands, the hard masculine contours of his body.</p><p>The world revolved slowly as Leo turned with her in his arms, half pinning her to the bed. His kisses were rough and sweet, kisses involving lips and teeth and tongue. Gasping, she reached around his neck and bandaged shoulder. He moved over her, big and dark, kissing her as if he wanted to devour her.</p><p>The folds of her dressing gown listed open, the hem of her nightgown rising to her knees. Leo\u2019s mouth broke from hers to begin a luscious search of her throat, following tender nerve paths down to the place where her neck and shoulder met. His fingers worked at the front of her nightgown, unmooring tiny buttons, spreading the thin fabric.</p><p>His head lowered, his lips slowly ascending the trembling slope of her breast until he reached the tip. Taking her into his mouth, he warmed the cool bud with lambent strokes of his tongue. Ragged moans rose in her throat, mingling with the gusts of his breath. Leo settled more heavily between her thighs, giving her his weight until she felt the hard length of him press her intimately. He sought her other breast, closing his mouth over the peak and tugging wetly, creating waves of involuting pleasure.</p><p>With every movement, more sensation was uncovered, the soft edges of arousal wearing away to exquisite rawness. Leo took her mouth with long, drugging kisses, while lower down he had begun a subtle rhythm, nudging and sliding, using himself to arouse her. She twisted beneath him, desperately trying to follow that teasing hardness. Their bodies pressed together like the pages of a closed book, and it felt so right, so wildly pleasurable, that it frightened her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, pushing at him. \u201cWait. Please\u2014\u201d</p> <p>One of her hands pressed heedlessly against his injured shoulder, and Leo rolled off her with a curse.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d She scrambled from the bed and stood there, shaking in every limb. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I hurt you? What can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Marks.\u201d His voice was low and guttural. \u201cOr else come back to bed, and let me finish.\u201d</p><p>She fled.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>After a wretched night, Catherine fumbled for her spectacles and realized she had lost them sometime during her visit to Leo\u2019s room. Groaning, she sat at her dressing table and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>A stupid impulse, she thought dully. A moment of madness. She should never have given in to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no one to blame but herself.</p><p>What remarkable ammunition she had given to Leo. He would torture her with this. He would take every opportunity to humiliate her. She knew him well enough not to doubt it.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s ill humor was not helped by the appearance of Dodger, who emerged from the slipper box by her bed. The ferret pushed the lid open with his head, clucked in cheerful greeting, and tugged her slipper out of the box. Heaven knew where he intended to take it.</p><p>\u201cStop that, Dodger,\u201d she said wearily, laying her head on her arms as she watched him.</p> <p>Everything was blurry. She needed her spectacles. And it was awfully difficult to go looking for something when you couldn\u2019t see more than two feet in front of your face. Moreover, if one of the housemaids found the spectacles in Leo\u2019s room, or God help her, in his bed, everyone would find out.</p><p>Abandoning the slipper, Dodger trotted to her and stood tall, bracing his long, slender body against her knee. He was shivering, which Beatrix had told her was normal for ferrets. A ferret\u2019s temperature lowered when he was sleeping, and shivering was his way of warming himself upon awakening. Catherine reached down to stroke him. When he tried to climb into her lap, however, she nudged him away. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well,\u201d she told the ferret woefully, although there was nothing wrong with her physically.</p><p>Chattering in annoyance at her rejection, Dodger turned and streaked out of the room.</p><p>Catherine continued to lie with her head on the table, feeling too dreary and ashamed to move.</p><p>She had slept late. She could hear the sounds of footsteps and muffled conversation coming from the lower floors. Had Leo gone down to breakfast?</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t possibly face him.</p><p>Her mind returned to those blistering minutes of the previous night. A fresh swell of desire rolled through her as she thought of the way he had kissed her, the feel of his mouth on the intimate places of her body.</p><p>She heard the ferret come back into the room again, chuckling and hopping as he did whenever he was especially pleased about something. \u201cGo away, Dodger,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>But he persisted, coming to her side and standing tall again, his body a long cylinder. Glancing at him, Catherine saw that something was clamped carefully in his front teeth. She blinked. Slowly she reached down and took the object from him.</p><p>Her spectacles.</p><p>Amazing, how much better a small gesture of kindness could make one feel.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, tears coming to her eyes as she stroked his tiny head. \u201cI do love you, you disgusting weasel.\u201d</p><p>Climbing onto her lap, Dodger flipped upside down and sighed.</p><p>Catherine dressed with painstaking care, putting extra pins in her hair, tying the sash of her gray dress a bit tighter than usual, even double-knotting the laces of her sensible ankle boots. As if she could contain herself so thoroughly that nothing could stray loose. Not even her thoughts.</p><p>Entering the breakfast room, she saw Amelia at the table. She was feeding toast to baby Rye, who was gumming it and drooling copiously.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Catherine murmured, going to pour a cup of tea at the samovar. \u201cPoor little Rye ... I heard him cry in the night. The new tooth hasn\u2019t come yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Amelia said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he disturbed your sleep, Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t bother me. I was already awake. It was a restless night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been for Lord Ramsay as well,\u201d Amelia remarked.</p> <p>Catherine glanced at her quickly, but thankfully there seemed to be no arch meaning in the comment. She tried to keep her expression neutral. \u201cOh? I hope he is well this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems well enough, but he\u2019s unusually quiet. Preoccupied.\u201d Amelia made a face. \u201cI suppose it didn\u2019t improve his disposition when I told him that we are planning to hold the ball in one month\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Stirring sugar into her tea with great care, Catherine asked, \u201cWill you tell people that the event is for the purpose of finding a bride for Lord Ramsay?\u201d</p><p>Amelia grinned. \u201cNo, even I am not that indelicate. However, it will be obvious that a great many eligible young women have been invited. And of course, my brother is a prime matrimonial target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Catherine muttered, trying to sound offhand, when inside she was filled with despair.</p><p>She realized she would not be able to stay with the Hathaway family if or when Leo married. She literally wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the sight of him with another woman. Especially if she made him happy.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s simple,\u201d Amelia said impishly. \u201cLord Ramsay is a peer with a full head of hair and all his teeth, and he is still in his procreating years. And if he weren\u2019t my brother, I suppose I would consider him not bad-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very handsome,\u201d Catherine protested without thinking, and flushed as Amelia gave her an astute glance.</p><p>She applied herself to drinking her tea, nibbled at a breakfast roll, and left in search of Beatrix. It was time for their morning studies.</p><p>Catherine and Beatrix had settled on a pattern, beginning their lessons with a few minutes on etiquette and social graces, and then spending the rest of the morning on subjects such as history, philosophy, even science. Beatrix had long mastered the \u201cfashionable\u201d subjects that were taught to young ladies merely for the purpose of making them suitable wives and mothers. Now Catherine felt that she and Beatrix had become fellow students.</p><p>Although Catherine had never had the privilege of meeting the Hathaway parents, she thought that both of them, particularly Mr. Hathaway, would have been pleased by their children\u2019s accomplishments. The Hathaways were an intellectual family, all of them easily able to discuss a subject or issue on an abstract level. And there was something else they shared\u2014an ability to make imaginative leaps and connections between disparate subjects. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One evening, for example, the discussion at dinner had centered on news of an aerial steam carriage that had been designed by a Somerset bobbin maker named John Stringfellow. It didn\u2019t work, of couse, but the idea was fascinating. During the debate about whether or not man might ever be able to fly in a mechanical invention, the Hathaways had brought up Greek mythology, physics, Chinese kites, the animal kingdom, French philosophy, and the inventions of Leonardo da Vinci. Trying to follow the discussion had very nearly been dizzying.</p><p>Privately Catherine had worried about whether such conversational pyrotechnics would put off potential suitors for Poppy and Beatrix. And in the case of Poppy, it had indeed turned out to be problematic. At least until she had met Harry.</p><p>However, when Catherine had tried to delicately raise the issue with Cam Rohan early on in her employment, he had been very decided in his reply.</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Marks, don\u2019t try to change Poppy or Beatrix,\u201d Cam had told her. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work, and it would only make them unhappy. Just help them learn how to behave in society, and how to talk about nothing, as the gadjos do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Catherine had said wryly, \u201cyou want them to have the appearance of propriety, but you don\u2019t wish for them to actually become proper?\u201d</p><p>Cam had been delighted by her understanding. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Catherine understood now how right Cam had been. None of the Hathaways would ever be like the denizens of London society, nor would she want them to be.</p><p>She went to the library to procure some books for her studies with Beatrix. As she entered the room, however, she stopped with a gasp as she saw Leo leaning over the long library table, writing something on a set of spread-out drawings.</p><p>Leo turned his head to glance at her, his eyes piercing. She went hot and cold. Her skull throbbed in the places where she had pinned her hair too tightly.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said breathlessly, falling back a step. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not intruding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to fetch some books, if ... if I may.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a single nod and returned his attention to the drawings.</p><p>Acutely self-conscious, Catherine went to the bookshelves and hunted for the titles she had wanted. It was so quiet that she thought the pounding of her heart must have been audible. Needing desperately to break the pressing silence, she asked, \u201cAre you designing something for the estate? A tenant house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddition for the stables.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Catherine gazed sightlessly along the rows of books. Were they going to pretend that the events of the previous night had never happened? She certainly hoped so.</p><p>But then she heard Leo say, \u201cIf you want an apology, you\u2019re not going to get one.\u201d</p><p>Catherine turned to face him. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Leo was still contemplating the set of elevations. \u201cWhen you visit a man in his bed at night, don\u2019t expect tea and conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t visiting you in your bed,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cThat is, you were in your bed, but it was not my desire to find you there.\u201d Aware that she was making no sense at all, she resisted the urge to smack herself on the head.</p><p>\u201cAt two o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d Leo informed her, \u201cI can nearly always be found on a mattress, engaged in either of two activities. One is sleeping. I don\u2019t believe I need to elaborate on the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to see if you were feverish,\u201d she said, turning crimson. \u201cIf you needed anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently I did.\u201d</p><p>Catherine had never felt so extraordinarily uncomfortable. All her skin had become too tight for her body. \u201cAre you going to tell anyone?\u201d she brought herself to ask.</p><p>One of his brows arched mockingly. \u201cYou fear I\u2019m going to tattle about our nighttime rendezvous? No, Marks, I have nothing to gain from that. And much to my regret, we didn\u2019t do nearly enough to warrant decent gossip.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, Catherine went to a pile of sketches and scraps at the corner of the table. She straightened them into a neat stack. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d she managed to ask, recalling how she had inadvertently pushed on his wounded shoulder. \u201cDoes it ache this morning?\u201d</p><p>Leo hesitated before replying. \u201cNo, it eventually eased after you left. But the devil knows it wouldn\u2019t take much to start up again.\u201d</p><p>Catherine was overcome with remorse. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Should we put a poultice on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA poultice?\u201d he repeated blankly. \u201cOn my ... oh. We\u2019re talking about my shoulder?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201cOf course we\u2019re talking about your shoulder. What else would we be discussing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat...\u201d Leo looked away from her. To her surprise, there was a tremor of laughter in his voice. \u201cWhen a man is aroused and left unsatisfied, he usually aches for a while afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a speaking glance.</p><p>\u201cYou mean...\u201d A wild blush raced over her as she finally understood. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t care if you ache there, I was only concerned about your wound!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much better,\u201d Leo assured her, his eyes bright with amusement. \u201cAs for the other ache\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with me,\u201d she said hastily.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s dignity had been mowed down to nothing. Clearly there was no option but retreat. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about the books you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch them later.\u201d</p><p>As she turned to depart, however, the edge of her bell-shaped sleeve caught the stack of sketches she had just straightened, and they went spilling to the floor. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d Instantly she went to her hands and knees, gathering up papers.</p><p>\u201cLeave them,\u201d she heard Leo say. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m the one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Catherine broke off as she saw something among the drafts of structures and landscapes and the pages of notes. A pencil sketch of a woman ... a na**d woman reclining on her side, light hair flowing everywhere. One slender thigh rested coyly over the other, partially concealing the delicate shadow of a feminine triangle.</p><p>And there was an all-too-familiar pair of spectacles balanced on her nose.</p><p>Catherine picked up the sketch with a trembling hand, while her heart lurched in hard strikes against her ribs. It took several attempts before she could speak, her voice high and airless.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Leo had lowered to the carpeted floor beside her. He nodded, looking rueful. His own color heightened until his eyes were startlingly blue in contrast.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be demeaning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was for my own eyes, no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to look at the sketch again, feeling horribly exposed. In fact, she couldn\u2019t have been more embarrassed had he actually been viewing her naked. And yet the rendering was far from crude or debasing. The woman had been drawn with long, graceful lines, the pose artistic. Sensuous.</p><p>\u201cYou ... you\u2019ve never seen me like this,\u201d she managed to say, before adding weakly, \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>A self-deprecating smile touched his lips. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t yet descended to voyeurism.\u201d He paused. \u201cDid I get it right? It\u2019s not easy, guessing what you look like beneath all those layers.\u201d</p><p>A nervous giggle struggled through her mortification. \u201cIf you did, I certainly wouldn\u2019t admit it.\u201d She put the sketch onto the pile, facedown. Her hand was shaking. \u201cDo you draw other women this way?\u201d she asked timidly.</p><p>Leo shook his head. \u201cI started with you, and so far I haven\u2019t moved on.\u201d</p><p>Her flush deepened. \u201cYou\u2019ve done other sketches like this? Of me unclothed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne or two.\u201d He tried to look repentant.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, please destroy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. But honesty compels me to tell you that I\u2019ll probably only do more. It\u2019s my favorite hobby, drawing you naked.\u201d</p><p>Catherine moaned and buried her face in her hands. Her voice slipped out between the tense filter of her fingers. \u201cI wish you would take up collecting something instead.\u201d</p><p>She heard his husky laugh. \u201cCat. Darling. Can you bring yourself to look at me? No?\u201d She stiffened but didn\u2019t move as she felt his arms draw around her. \u201cI was only teasing. I won\u2019t sketch you like that again.\u201d Leo continued to hold her, carefully guiding her face to his good shoulder. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew a trembling breath. \u201cOnly surprised that you would see me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not like me.\u201d</p><p>He understood what she meant. \u201cNo one ever sees himself\u2014or herself\u2014with perfect accuracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that I never lounge about completely naked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a terrible shame.\u201d He took a ragged breath. \u201cYou should know that I\u2019ve always wanted you, Cat. I\u2019ve had fantasies so wicked, it would send us both straight to hell if I told them to you. And the way I want you has nothing to do with the color of your hair, or the appalling fashions you wear.\u201d His hand passed gently over her head. \u201cCatherine Marks, or whoever you are ... I have the most profane desire to be in bed with you for ... oh, weeks, at least ... committing every mortal sin known to man. I\u2019d like to do more than sketch you naked. I want to draw directly on you with feather and ink ... flowers around your br**sts, trails of stars down your thighs.\u201d He let his warm lips brush the edge of her ear. \u201cI want to map your body, chart the north, south, east, and west of you. I would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, scarcely able to breathe.</p><p>A rueful laugh escaped him. \u201cI told you. Straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault.\u201d She pressed her hot face against his shoulder. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone to you last night. I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do.\u201d His mouth grazed the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t come back to my room at night, Marks. Because if it happens again, I won\u2019t be able to stop.\u201d</p><p>His arms loosened, and he released her to stand up from the floor. Reaching for her hand, he pulled her up with him. The sheaf of fallen papers was retrieved, and Leo took up the sketch of her. The parchment was neatly ripped, the pieces folded together, and ripped again. He gave her the shreds of paper and molded her fingers around them. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy the others as well.\u201d</p><p>Catherine stood without moving as he left the room. And her fingers tightened over the strips of parchment, crushing them into a damp knot.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>In the month that followed, Leo deliberately kept himself too busy to see much of Catherine. Two new tenant farms required irrigation schemes. It was a subject on which Leo had developed a certain amount of expertise while Cam worked with the horses and Merripen supervised the timber harvesting. Leo had designed water meadows that would be irrigated with rills and ditches leading from the nearby rivers. In one place where the channel would run too low to be let out naturally, they would require a waterwheel. The wheel, provided with buckets, would lift out the necessary amount of water and send it along a manmade canal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shirtless and sweating under the soft blaze of the Hampshire sun, Leo and the tenants dug ditches and drainage canals, moved rock, and hauled soil. At the end of the day Leo ached in every muscle, nearly too tired to stay awake during dinner. His body toughened and became so lean that he was obliged to borrow trousers from Cam while the village tailor altered his clothes.</p><p>\u201cAt least work keeps you from your vices,\u201d Win quipped one evening before supper, rubbing his hair affectionately as she joined him in the parlor.</p><p>\u201cI happen to like my vices,\u201d Leo told her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went to the trouble of acquiring them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you need to acquire,\u201d Win said gently, \u201cis a wife. And I\u2019m not saying that out of self-interest, Leo.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her, this gentlest of sisters, who had fought so many personal battles for the sake of love. \u201cYou don\u2019t possess a molecule of self-interest, Win. But as sound as your advice usually is, I\u2019m not going to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. You need a family of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more than enough family to contend with. And there are things I would much rather do than marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cut out my tongue and join the Trappist Monks ... roll na**d in treacle and nap on an anthill ... Shall I go on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Win said, smiling. \u201cHowever, you will marry someday, Leo. Both Cam and Merripen have said that you have a very distinct marriage line on your hand.\u201d</p><p>Bemused, Leo looked down at his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s a crease from the way I hold my pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a marriage line. And it\u2019s so long, it practically wraps around both sides of your hand. Which means you will someday marry a fated love.\u201d Win raised her fair brows significantly, as if to say, What do you think of that?</p><p>\u201cRomas don\u2019t really believe in palm reading,\u201d Leo informed her. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense. They only do it to extract money from fools and drunkards.\u201d</p><p>Before Win could reply, Merripen entered the parlor. \u201cGadjos certainly know how to complicate matters,\u201d he said, handing a letter to Leo and lowering to the settee.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Leo asked, glancing at the signature at the bottom. \u201cAnother letter from the solicitor? I thought he was trying to un complicate matters for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe more he explains,\u201d Merripen said, \u201cthe more confusing it is. As a Rom, I still have trouble understanding the concept of land ownership. But the Ramsay estate...\u201d He shook his head in disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s a Gordian knot of agreements, grants, customs, exceptions, additions, and leases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the estate is so old,\u201d Win said wisely. \u201cThe more ancient the manor, the more complications it\u2019s had time to acquire.\u201d She glanced at Leo. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve just learned that Countess Ramsay and her daughter Miss Darvin wish to come for a visit. We received a letter from them earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil you say!\u201d Leo was outraged. \u201cFor what purpose? To gloat? Take inventory? I\u2019ve still got a year left before they can lay claim to the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they wish to make peace and find an acceptable solution for all of us,\u201d Win suggested.</p><p>Win was always inclined to think the best of people and believe in the essential goodness of human nature.</p><p>Leo didn\u2019t have that problem.</p><p>\u201cMake peace, my arse,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBy God, I\u2019m tempted to get married just to spite that pair of witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any candidates in mind?\u201d Win asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot one. But if I ever did marry, it would be to a woman I was certain never to love.\u201d</p><p>A movement at the doorway caught his attention, and Leo watched covertly as Catherine entered the room. She gave the group a neutral smile, carefully avoiding Leo\u2019s gaze, and went to a chair near the corner. With annoyance, Leo noticed that she had lost weight. Her br**sts were smaller, and her waist was reed slender, and her complexion was wan. Was she deliberately avoiding proper nourishment? What had caused her lack of appetite? She was going to make herself ill.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Marks,\u201d he said irritably, \u201cyou\u2019re getting as scrawny as a birch branch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Win protested.</p><p>Catherine shot him a look of outrage. \u201cI\u2019m not the one whose trousers are being taken in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look half dead from malnourishment,\u201d Leo went on with a scowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Why aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamsay,\u201d Merripen murmured, evidently deciding a boundary had been crossed.</p><p>Catherine shot up from her chair and glared at Leo. \u201cYou\u2019re a bully, and a hypocrite, and you have no right to criticize my appearance, so ... so...\u201d She cast about wildly for the right phrase. \u201cBugger you!\u201d And she stormed from the parlor, her skirts rustling angrily.</p><p>Merripen and Win watched with open mouths.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn that word?\u201d Leo demanded, hard on her heels.</p><p>\u201cFrom you,\u201d she said vehemently over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know what it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t care. Stay away from me!\u201d</p><p>As Catherine stormed through the house, and Leo went after her, it occurred to him that he had been craving an argument with her, any kind of interaction.</p><p>She went outside and partway around the house, and soon they found themselves in the kitchen garden. The air was pungent with the smell of sun-warmed herbs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarks,\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019ll chase you through the parsley if you insist, but we may as well stop and have it out right here.\u201d</p><p>She whirled to face him, bright flags of color high on her cheeks. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss. You\u2019ve hardly said a word to me in days, and then you make offensive personal remarks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be offensive. I merely said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not scrawny, you despicable oaf! Am I less than a person to you, that you dare to treat me with such contempt?

I would be angry with anyone who didn\u2019t treat you well\u2014which in this case happens to be you. You\u2019re not taking care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>Leo parted his lips to reply, but he couldn\u2019t think of an effective rebuttal. He opened and closed his mouth again.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day you work yourself into exhaustion,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cYou\u2019ve dropped half a stone, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new farms need irrigation systems. I\u2019m the one best suited to design and implement them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to dig trenches and move rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Leo stared at her, considering whether or not to tell her the truth. He decided to be blunt. \u201cBecause working to the point of exhaustion is the only way I can keep from coming to you at night and seducing you.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine gave him a round-eyed glance. Her mouth opened and closed in the same way his had just a moment earlier.</p><p>Leo stared back at her with a mixture of wary amusement and growing heat. He could no longer deny that he found nothing in the world more entertaining than talking to her. Or just being near her. Cantankerous, stubborn, fascinating creature ... completely unlike his past lovers. And at times like this, she had all the cuddlesome appeal of a feral hedgehog.</p><p>But she challenged him, met him as an equal, in a way that no other woman ever had. He wanted her beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t seduce me,\u201d Catherine said testily.</p><p>They were both motionless, their gazes locked.</p><p>\u201cYou deny the attraction between us?\u201d Leo\u2019s voice was pitched deeper than usual. He saw a shiver run through her before she set her jaw in determination.</p><p>\u201cI deny that one\u2019s rational will can be undermined by physical sensation,\u201d she said. \u201cOne\u2019s brain is always in charge.\u201d</p><p>Leo couldn\u2019t prevent the mocking smile that rose to his lips. \u201cGood God, Marks. Obviously you\u2019ve never participated in the act, or you would know that the major organ in charge is not the brain. In fact, the brain ceases working altogether.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI find it easy to believe that a man\u2019s would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s brain is no less primitive than a man\u2019s, especially when it comes to physical distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I prove it to you?\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s delicate mouth twisted skeptically. But then, as if she couldn\u2019t resist, she asked, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Taking her arm, Leo drew her to a more secluded area of the kitchen garden, behind a pair of pergolas covered with scarlet runner beans. They stood next to a glass forcing house, which was used to compel plants into flower before they might have otherwise. A forcing house allowed a gardener to grow plants and flowers irrespective of the prevailing weather.</p><p>Leo glanced at their surroundings to make certain they were not being observed. \u201cHere\u2019s a challenge for your higher brain function. First, I\u2019ll kiss you. Directly afterward, I\u2019ll ask you a simple question. If you answer correctly, I\u2019ll concede the argument.\u201d</p><p>Catherine frowned and looked away from him. \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she said to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly have the right to refuse,\u201d Leo told her. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll take that as a forfeiture.\u201d</p><p>Folding her arms across her chest, Catherine gazed at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cOne kiss?\u201d</p><p>Leo spread his hands palm up, as if to demonstrate that he had nothing to hide. His gaze never left her. \u201cOne kiss, one question.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her arms loosened and lowered. She stood before him uncertainly.</p><p>Leo hadn\u2019t actually expected her to agree to the challenge. He felt his heart begin to beat in concentrated thumps. As he stepped closer to her, anticipation tightened his insides into knots.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, reaching for her spectacles, easing them from her face.</p><p>She blinked but didn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Leo folded the spectacles and tucked them in his coat pocket. Very gently he tilted her face upward with both hands. He had made her nervous. Good, he thought darkly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded within the careful bracket of his palms, her lips trembling.</p><p>Leo brought his mouth lightly to hers, kissing her with careful, undemanding pressure. Her lips were cool and sweet. Teasing them apart, he deepened the kiss. His arms slid around her, bringing her fully against him. She was slender but compact, her body as supple as a cat\u2019s. He felt her begin to mold against him, a slow and helpless relaxing. Concentrating on her mouth, he explored her with tender fire, searching with his tongue until he felt the vibration of her soft moan between their lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lifting his head, Leo looked into her flushed face. He was so mesmerized by the drowsy green-gray of her eyes that it was a struggle to remember what he\u2019d meant to ask her.</p><p>\u201cThe question,\u201d he reminded himself aloud, and shook his head to clear it. \u201cHere it is. A farmer has twelve sheep. All but seven die. How many are left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d she said promptly.</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d A grin spread across his face as he watched her puzzle it out.</p> <p>Catherine scowled. \u201cThat was a trick. Ask me another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the bargain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnother one,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>A husky laugh escaped him. \u201cGod, you\u2019re stubborn. All right.\u201d He reached for her and lowered his head, and she stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne kiss, one question,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>Catherine looked martyred. But she yielded to him, her head tilting back as he pulled her against him once more. This time he was not so tentative. His kiss was firm and urgent, his tongue sinking into the sweet, warm interior of her mouth. Her arms lifted around his neck, her fingers groping delicately in his hair.</p><p>Leo went dizzy with desire and pleasure. He couldn\u2019t pull her body close enough, he needed parts of her he couldn\u2019t reach. His hands shook with the need to find the sweet pale skin beneath the heavy fabric of her bodice. He kept trying to feel more of her, kiss her more deeply, and instinctively she tried to help him, sucking on his tongue with a little sound of pleasure. The hair on the back of his neck lifted as a chill of delight climbed up his spine to the base of his skull.</p><p>He broke the kiss, gasping.</p><p>\u201cAsk me a question,\u201d she reminded him thickly.</p><p>Leo could barely remember his own name. All he wanted to concentrate on was the way she fit against him. But somehow he obliged her. \u201cSome months have thirty-one days, some have thirty. How many months have twenty-eight days?\u201d</p> <p>A perplexed furrow appeared between her fine brows. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d came his gentle reply. He tried to look sympathetic as he saw her incredulous outrage.</p><p>\u201cAsk me another one,\u201d Catherine said, furious and determined.</p><p>Leo shook his head, breathless with laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any more. My brain is deprived of blood. Accept it, Marks, you lost the\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the lapels of his coat and dragged him back to her, and Leo\u2019s mouth fastened on hers before he knew what he was doing. The amusement vanished. Staggering forward with her in his arms, he put out one hand to brace himself against the glass forcing house. And he possessed her lips with rough, wholehearted ardor, reveling at the feel of her body arching against his. He was dying of lust, his flesh heavy and aching with the need to take her. He kissed her without restraint, sucking, almost gnawing, stroking the inside of her mouth in ways almost too delicious to bear.</p><p>Before he lost all semblance of self-control, Leo tore his lips from hers and held her tightly against his chest.</p><p>Another question, he thought dimly, and forced what was left of his mind to come up with something.</p><p>His voice was hoarse, as if he\u2019d just tried to breathe in fire. \u201cHow many animals of each species did Moses take into the ark?\u201d</p> <p>Her answer was muffled in his coat. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Leo managed to say. \u201cIt was Noah, not Moses.\u201d</p><p>But he no longer found the game amusing, and Catherine no longer seemed to care about winning. They stood together, gripped tight and close. Their bodies cast a single shadow that stretched along a garden path.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call it a draw,\u201d Leo muttered.</p><p>Catherine shook her head. \u201cNo, you were right,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cI can\u2019t think at all.\u201d</p><p>They waited a little longer, while she leaned into the wild rhythm of his heart. They were both in a daze, mutually occupied with a question that couldn\u2019t be asked. An answer that couldn\u2019t be given.</p><p>Letting out an unsteady sigh, Leo eased her away. He winced as the fabric of his trousers chafed his aroused flesh. Thank God the cut of his coat was long enough to conceal the problem. Extracting her spectacles from his pocket, he replaced them carefully on her nose.</p><p>He offered his arm in wordless invitation\u2014a truce\u2014and Catherine took it.</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018bugger\u2019 mean?\u201d she asked unevenly, as he led her out of the kitchen garden.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you,\u201d he said, \u201cit would lead to improper thoughts. And I know how you hate those.\u201d</p><p>Leo spent much of the next day at a stream on the west side of the estate, determining the best site for a waterwheel and marking the area. The wheel would be approximately sixteen feet in diameter, equipped with a row of buckets that would empty into a trough from which the water would course along a series of wooden flumes. Leo estimated that the system would irrigate approximately one hundred and fifty acres, or ten generously sized tenant farms.</p><p>After laying out plots with the tenants and laborers, hammering wooden stakes into the ground, and wading through a cold, muddy stream, Leo rode back to Ramsay House. It was late afternoon, the sun a condensed yellow, the meadows still and breezeless. Leo was tired, sweat-soaked, and annoyed from battling gadflies. Wryly he thought that all the romantic poets who waxed rhapsodic about being out in nature had certainly never been involved in an irrigation project.</p><p>His boots were so caked with mud that he went to the kitchen entrance, left them by the door, and went inside in his stocking feet. The cook and a maid were busy slicing apples and rolling dough, while Win and Beatrix sat at the worktable, polishing silver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Leo,\u201d Beatrix said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, what a sight you are,\u201d Win exclaimed.</p><p>Leo smiled at both of them, then wrinkled his nose as he detected a bitter stench in the air. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for any odor to eclipse mine at the moment. What is it? Metal polish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually it\u2019s...\u201d Win looked guarded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a kind of dye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor cloth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor hair,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cYou see, Miss Marks wants to darken her hair before the ball, but she was afraid of using dye from the apothecary, since he got it so wrong last time. So Cook suggested a recipe that her own mother used. You boil walnut shells and cassia bark together with vinegar and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is Marks dyeing her hair?\u201d Leo asked, striving to keep his tone ordinary, even as his soul revolted against the idea. That beautiful hair, gleaming gold and pale amber, covered with a dull, dark stain.</p><p>Win replied cautiously. \u201cI believe she wishes to be less ... visible ... at the ball, with so many guests in attendance. I didn\u2019t press her for answers, as I felt she was entitled to her privacy. Leo, please don\u2019t distress her by mentioning it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes no one find it odd that we have a servant who insists on disguising herself?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cIs this family so bloody eccentric that we accept any manner of strangeness without even asking questions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all that strange,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cMany animals change their colors. Cuttlefish, for example, or certain species of frogs, and of course chameleons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Leo said through clenched teeth. He left the kitchen with purposeful strides, while Win and Beatrix stared after him.</p><p>\u201cI was leading to some very interesting facts about chameleons,\u201d Beatrix said.</p><p>\u201cBea, darling,\u201d Win murmured, \u201cperhaps you\u2019d better go out to the stables and find Cam.\u201d</p><p>Catherine sat at her dressing table, contemplating her own tense reflection in the looking glass. Several articles were neatly arranged in front of her: folded toweling, a comb, a pitcher and basin, and a pot filled with a strained dark sludge that looked like boot blacking. She had painted a single lock of hair with the stuff, and was waiting for it to take effect, to see what color had been imparted. After her last disaster with colorant, when her hair had turned green, she was taking no chances.</p><p>With the Hathaway ball only two days away, Catherine had no choice but to drab down her appearance as much as possible. Guests from surrounding counties would attend, as well as families from London. And as always, she was afraid of being recognized. However, as long as she obscured her appearance and kept to the corners, no one ever noticed her. Chaperones were most often spinsters or poor widows, undesirable women who had been assigned the task of watching over young girls who still had their best years ahead of them. Catherine was scarcely older than those girls, but she felt as if there were decades between herself and them.</p> <p>Catherine knew that her past would catch up with her someday. And when it did, the time she had spent with the Hathaways would be over. It had been the only period of real happiness in her life. She would grieve to lose them.</p><p>All of them.</p><p>The door was flung open, shattering Catherine\u2019s quiet contemplation. She turned in her chair and saw Leo in remarkable disarray. He was sweaty and rumpled and filthy, standing there in his stocking feet.</p><p>She jumped up to face him, recalling too late that she wore nothing but a crumpled chemise.</p><p>His hard gaze raked over her, missing no detail, and Catherine turned red in outrage. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she cried. \u201cHave you gone mad? Leave my room this instant!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Leo closed the door and reached Catherine in two strides. He hauled her forcibly to the pitcher and basin.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she screeched, flailing at him, while he pushed her head over the basin and poured water over the lock of hair she had saturated with dye. She spluttered furiously. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? What are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWashing this slime from your hair.\u201d He dumped the rest of the water on her head.</p><p>Catherine yelped and struggled, managing to slosh water over him as well, until there were puddles on the floor and the carpet was soaked. They fought until Catherine found herself on the wet layer of wool covering the floor. Her spectacles had flown off, leaving the room a blur. But Leo\u2019s face was only inches above her own, his hot blue eyes staring into hers. He subdued her without effort, pinning her wrists, her torso, as if she had no more substance than a garment rippling on a clothesline. He was very heavy on her, muscle and weight and masculinity supported in the cradle of her thighs.</p><p>She twisted helplessly. She wanted him to let her go, and at the same time she wanted him to lie on her forever, his h*ps pressing hers harder, deeper. Her eyes turned wet.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she choked out. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hold my wrists.\u201d</p><p>As he heard the note of fear in her voice, his face changed. He released her arms at once. She was gathered up against him, her dripping head clasped to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid of me. I would never\u2014\u201d She felt him kiss the side of her face, the edge of her jaw, the frantic working of her throat. Waves of warmth slid over her, sensation rising in the places where they pressed. She let her arms remain limp and outstretched on the floor, but her knees tightened on his body, holding him instinctively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does it matter to you?\u201d she asked against his damp shirt. \u201cWhat do you care what color my h-hair is?\u201d She felt the hard wall of his chest beneath his shirt, and she wanted to delve beneath the garment, rub her mouth and cheeks through the dark fleece.</p><p>His voice was soft and fierce. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s not right. What are you hiding from?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head weakly, her eyes swimming. \u201cI can\u2019t explain. There\u2019s too much ... I can\u2019t. If you knew, I would have to go. And I want to stay with you. Just a little longer.\u201d A sob slipped from her throat. \u201cNot you, I meant your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay. Tell me, so I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed back another sob. There was a hot, irritating trickle on the side of her face. A tear had slid into her hairline. She lifted a hand to brush at it, but he had already put his mouth there, his lips absorbing the trail of wet salt. Her trembling hand curved around his head. She hadn\u2019t meant to encourage him, but he took it as such, his mouth finding hers hungrily. And she moaned, lost in a flood of urgent feeling.</p><p>He slid an arm beneath her neck, supporting her as he kissed her. She felt the excitement in him, heard it in the rasp of his breathing as he searched and teased and licked deep. His weight lifted from her, his warm hand settling on the damp fabric covering her midriff. She might as well have been na**d for all the concealment the chemise provided, her ni**les rising tightly against the transparent chill of fabric. He kissed her over the wet muslin, his mouth fastening over the rosy veiled point. Impassioned, he tugged at the tie of her chemise and spread the garment to reveal the shapes of her br**sts, high and small and round.</p><p>\u201cCat...\u201d The rush of his breath against her damp skin made her shiver. \u201cI could die of wanting you, you\u2019re so lovely ... sweet ... God ...\u201d He drew a flushed bud into his mouth, circling it with his tongue, tugging softly. At the same time his fingers went to her intimate flesh, tracing the delicate slit, stroking until she was open and wet. She felt the gentle pass of his thumb over a place of excruciating sensation, the caress sending fire up to the base of her throat. Her h*ps lifted into the soft stroking, and he teased her lightly, tenderly, until pleasure hummed through every part of her and an extraordinary promise of relief hovered just out of reach.</p><p>His touch deepened, a finger nudging the entrance of her body. The gentle invasion caused her to shrink backward in surprise. Except that she was on the floor on her back, and there was no place to retreat. She reached down reflexively, her hand going to his.</p><p>Leo nuzzled the side of her neck. \u201cInnocent darling. Relax and let me touch you, let me...\u201d She felt the intricate workings of bone and tendon in the back of his hand as his finger slid farther into the fluid softness. She caught her breath, her body grasping helplessly at the careful intrusion.</p><p>Leo\u2019s heavy lashes lowered over smoldering eyes, the color of the pale blue heart of a flame. A flush had crossed his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. \u201cI want to be inside you,\u201d he said thickly, caressing her. \u201cHere ... and deeper...\u201d</p><p>An incoherent sound climbed in her throat as the subtle inner teasing drew her knees up and caused her toes to curl. She was suffused with desperate heat, craving things she had no words for. Drawing his head down to hers, she kissed him frantically, needing the voluptuous pressure of his mouth, the thrust of his tongue\u2019</p><p>A series of determined raps on the door broke through the lurid haze of sensation. Leo cursed and pulled his hand from between her thighs, and tucked her body beneath his. Cat whimpered, her heart pounding madly.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Leo called out brusquely.</p><p>\u201cRohan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you open that door, I will kill you.\u201d The statement was uttered with the vicious sincerity of a man who had been pushed to his limits. Apparently it was enough to give even Cam Rohan pause.</p><p>After a long moment, Cam said, \u201cI want a word with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely now,\u201d came the inexorable reply.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Leo drew in a taut breath and expelled it slowly. \u201cDownstairs in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes?\u201d Cam persisted.</p><p>Leo stared at the closed door with an expression of incredulous wrath. \u201cGo, Rohan.\u201d</p><p>As Cam\u2019s footsteps retreated, Leo looked down at Catherine. She couldn\u2019t seem to stop writhing and trembling, her nerves jangling with agitation. Murmuring quietly, he held her close and rubbed circles on her back and hips. \u201cEasy, love. Let me hold you.\u201d Gradually the frantic need faded, and she lay still in his arms, her cheek pressed against his.</p><p>Leo stood and scooped her up easily, and carried her to the bed. He set her half-naked body on the mattress. While she perched on the edge of the bed and fumbled to draw the counterpane around herself, he hunted for her spectacles. Finding them in the corner of the room, he brought them back to her.</p> <p>The spectacles were beginning to look rather the worse for wear, she thought ruefully, straightening the battered wire frames and polishing the lenses with a corner of the counterpane.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say to Mr. Rohan?\u201d she asked hesitantly, putting the spectacles on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. But for the next two days, until the damned ball is over, I\u2019m going to put some distance between us. Because our relationship seems to have become a bit too flammable for either of us to manage. Afterward, however, you and I are going to talk. No evasions, no lies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked through dry lips.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make some decisions.\u201d</p><p>What kind of decisions? Was he planning to dismiss her? Or was some kind of indecent proposition in the making? \u201cPerhaps I should leave Hampshire,\u201d she said with difficulty.</p><p>Leo\u2019s eyes glinted dangerously. Taking her head in his hands, he bent down to whisper in her ear, in what could have been either a promise or a threat. \u201cAnywhere you go, I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p> <p>He went to the door, and paused before leaving. \u201cIncidentally,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I drew those sketches of you, I didn\u2019t begin to do you justice.\u201d</p><p>After Leo had washed and changed into decent attire, he went to the library. Cam was waiting there, looking no happier than Leo felt. Even so, there was a calmness about him, a quality of relaxed tolerance that helped to blunt the edge of Leo\u2019s temper. There was no man on earth whom Leo trusted more.</p><p>When they had first met, Leo would never have chosen a man like Cam Rohan for Amelia. It just wasn\u2019t done. Cam was a Gypsy, and no one could claim that a Romany heritage was an advantage in English society. But the temperament of the man, his patience, humor, and inherent decency, was impossible to deny.</p><p>In a relatively short time, Cam had become a brother to Leo. He had seen Leo at his worst, and he had offered steady support as Leo had fought to reconcile himself to a life bereft of innocence or hope. And somehow, in the past few years, Leo had regained a little of both.</p><p>Standing at the window, Cam leveled a shrewd stare at him.</p> <p>Wordlessly Leo went to the sideboard, poured a brandy, and let the snifter warm in his fingers. To his surprise, he saw that his hand wasn\u2019t quite steady.</p><p>\u201cI was called in from the stables,\u201d Cam said, \u201cto find your sisters worried and the housemaids in hysterics, because you decided to close yourself in a bedroom with Miss Marks. You can\u2019t take advantage of a woman in your employ. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you tread the moral high ground,\u201d Leo said, \u201clet\u2019s not forget that you seduced Amelia before you married her. Or is debauching an innocent acceptable as long as she\u2019s not working for you?\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of annoyance in Cam\u2019s hazel eyes. \u201cI knew I was going to marry her when I did it. Can you say the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept with Marks. Yet.\u201d Leo scowled. \u201cBut at this rate I\u2019ll have bedded her by week\u2019s end. I can\u2019t seem to stop myself.\u201d He raised his gaze heavenward. \u201cLord, please smite me.\u201d When it appeared there would be no response from the Almighty, he tossed back a swallow of brandy. It went down his throat in a rush of smooth fire.</p><p>\u201cYou think if you take her,\u201d Cam said, \u201cit would be a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d Leo took another swallow of liquor.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you have to make a mistake to avoid making an even worse one.\u201d Cam smiled slightly as he saw Leo\u2019s baleful expression. \u201cDid you think you could avoid this forever, phral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan. And I\u2019ve managed quite well until recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man in his prime. It\u2019s only natural to want your own woman. What\u2019s more, you have a title to pass on. And from what I understand of the peerage, your primary responsibility is to produce more of yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, are we back to that again?\u201d Scowling, Leo finished his brandy and set the glass aside. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is sire brats.\u201d</p><p>Cam lifted a brow, looking amused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sticky. They interrupt. They cry when they don\u2019t have their way. If I want that kind of company, I have my friends.\u201d</p><p>Settling in a chair, Cam stretched out his long legs and regarded Leo with deceptive casualness. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do something about Miss Marks. Because this can\u2019t continue. Even for the Hathaways, it\u2019s...\u201d He hesitated, searching for a word.</p> <p>\u201cIndecent,\u201d Leo finished for him. He paced across the room and back. Stopping at the cold, dark hearth, he braced his hands on the mantel and lowered his head. \u201cRohan,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cYou saw what I was like, after Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cam paused. \u201cThe Rom would say you were a man who grieved too much. You trapped your beloved\u2019s soul in the in-between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that, or I went mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is a form of madness, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Cam asked prosaically.</p><p>Leo let out a humorless chuckle. \u201cFor me, undeniably.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent. And then Cam murmured, \u201cIs Laura still with you, phral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leo stared into the empty fireplace. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted that she\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t dream about her anymore. But I remember what it was like, trying to live while I was dead inside. It would be even worse now. I can\u2019t go through it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to think you have a choice,\u201d Cam said. \u201cBut you have it backward. Love chooses you. The shadow moves as the sun commands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I enjoy Romany sayings,\u201d Leo marveled. \u201cAnd you know so many of them.\u201d</p><p>Rising from the chair, Cam went to the sideboard and poured himself a brandy. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not entertaining any thought of making her your mistress,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cRutledge would have you drawn and quartered, no matter that you\u2019re his brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t, in any case. Taking her as a mistress would create more problems than it would solve.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t leave her alone, you can\u2019t keep her as a mistress, and you won\u2019t marry her, the only option is to send her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most sensible option,\u201d Leo agreed darkly. \u201cAlso my least favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Miss Marks indicated what she wants?\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s terrified to face that. Because, God help her, she may possibly want me.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>For the next two days, the Hathaway household was a hive of activity. Vast quantities of food and flowers were brought in, furniture was temporarily stored, doors were taken off their hinges, rugs were rolled up, and the floors were waxed and polished.</p><p>Guests from Hampshire and surrounding counties would attend the ball, as well as families of distinction from London. To Leo\u2019s disgruntlement, the ball invitations had been eagerly accepted by a multitude of peers with daughters in marriageable circumstances. And as the lord of the manor, his duty was to act as host and dance with as many women as possible.</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done to me,\u201d he told Amelia.</p><p>\u201cOh, not at all, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve done worse things to you.\u201d</p> <p>Leo considered that, running through a long list of remembered offenses in his mind. \u201cNever mind, you\u2019re right. But to be clear ... I\u2019m only tolerating this to humor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I do hope you\u2019ll humor me further, and find someone to marry so you can produce an heir before Vanessa Darvin and her mother take possession of our home.\u201d</p><p>He gave his sister a narrow-eyed glance. \u201cOne could almost infer that the house means more to you than my future happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Your future happiness means at least as much to me as the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut I also happen to believe that you\u2019ll be much happier when you fall in love and get married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I ever fell in love with someone,\u201d he retorted, \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t ruin it by marrying her.\u201d</p><p>The guests began to arrive early in the evening. Women were dressed in silk or taffeta, jeweled brooches glittering at low rounded necklines, hands covered with wrist-length white gloves. Many feminine arms were adorned with matching bracelets in the new fashion.</p><p>Gentlemen, by contrast, were dressed with severe simplicity in black coats and matching creaseless trousers, and cravats in either white or black. The clothes were tailored with a touch of welcome looseness, making natural movement far easier than it had been in the constricting garments of the recent past.</p><p>Music floated through rooms abundantly dressed with flowers. Tables draped in gold satin nearly creaked beneath pyramids of fruit, cheese dishes, roast vegetables, sweetbreads, puddings, joints of meat, smoked fish, and roast fowl. Footmen moved through the circuit of public rooms, bringing cigars and liquor to men in the library, or wine and champagne to the card rooms.</p><p>The drawing room was crowded, with clusters of people all around the sides and couples dancing in the center. Leo had to admit, there was an uncommon number of attractive young women present. They all looked pleasant, normal, and fresh-faced. They all looked the same. But he proceeded to dance with as many of them as possible, taking care to include wallflowers, and he even persuaded a dowager or two to take a turn with him.</p><p>And all the while he hunted for glimpses of Catherine Marks.</p><p>She was wearing a lavender gown, the same one she\u2019d worn at Poppy\u2019s wedding. Her hair was caught in a smooth, tight chignon at the back of her neck. She watched over Beatrix while remaining discreetly in the background.</p><p>Leo had seen Catherine do the same thing countless times before, stand quietly among the dowagers and chaperones as girls only a little younger than herself flirted and laughed and danced. It was absurd that Catherine should not be noticed. She was the equal of any woman there, background be damned.</p> <p>Somehow Catherine must have felt his gaze on her. She turned and glanced at him, and she couldn\u2019t seem to look away any more than he could.</p><p>A dowager captured Catherine\u2019s attention, asking a question about something, and she turned to the dratted woman.</p><p>At the same time, Amelia came up to Leo\u2019s side and caught at his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said tensely. \u201cWe have a situation. Not a good one.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at his sister with instant concern, Leo saw that she wore a false smile for the benefit of anyone who might be watching. \u201cI had despaired of anything interesting happening this evening,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Darvin and Countess Ramsay are here.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s face went blank. \u201cHere? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, Win, and Merripen are talking to them in the entrance hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the devil invited them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. They prevailed on mutual acquaintances\u2014the Ulsters\u2014to bring them as guests. And we can\u2019t turn them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? They\u2019re not wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs improper as they\u2019ve been in coming without invitations, it would be even worse for us to reject them. It would make us appear exceedingly ungracious, and to say the least, it wouldn\u2019t be good manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar too often,\u201d Leo reflected aloud, \u201cgood manners stand in direct opposition to what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling well.\u201d</p><p>They shared a grim smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose they want?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d Leo said curtly. Offering her his arm, he escorted her out of the drawing room to the entrance hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More than a few curious gazes attended them as they joined the other Hathaways, who were speaking to a pair of women dressed in sumptuous ballgowns.</p><p>The older, presumably Countess Ramsay, was a woman of average appearance, a bit plump, neither attractive nor plain. The younger woman, Miss Vanessa Darvin, was a raving beauty, tall with an elegantly turned figure and a lavish bosom, all nicely displayed in a gown of blue-green trimmed with peacock feathers. Her midnight hair was arranged in a perfect mass of pinned-up curls. Her mouth was small and full, the color of a ripe plum, and her eyes were sultry, dark and heavily lashed.</p><p>Everything about Vanessa Darvin advertised sexual confidence, which Leo had certainly never held against a woman, except that in this girl it was a bit off-putting. Probably because she looked at him as if she expected him to fall at her feet and start panting like a pug dog with a respiratory ailment.</p><p>With Amelia on his arm, Leo approached the pair. Introductions were made, and he bowed with impeccable politeness.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to Ramsay House, my lady. And Miss Darvin. What a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>The countess beamed at him. \u201cI hope our unexpected arrival does not inconvenience you, my lord. However, when Lord and Lady Ulster made it known that you were giving a ball\u2014the first at Ramsay House since its restoration\u2014we felt certain that you wouldn\u2019t mind the company of your nearest relations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelations?\u201d Amelia asked blankly. The kinship between the Hathaways and the Darvins was so distant as to hardly warrant the word.</p><p>Countess Ramsay continued to smile. \u201cWe are cousins, are we not? And when my poor husband passed on to his reward, may God rest his soul, we found consolation in the knowledge that the estate would pass into capable stewardship as yours. Although...\u201d Her gaze flickered to Cam and Merripen. \u201cWe had not expected such a colorful variety of in-laws as you seem to have accumulated.\u201d</p><p>Fully comprehending the unsubtle reference to the fact that both Cam and Merripen were part Gypsy, Amelia scowled openly. \u201cNow see here\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow refreshing it is,\u201d Leo interrupted, trying to stave off an explosion, \u201cto finally be able to communicate without the interference of solicitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, my lord,\u201d Countess Ramsay replied. \u201cThe solicitors have made the situation regarding Ramsay House quite complex, have they not? But we are only women, and therefore much of what they relate goes right over our heads. Isn\u2019t that right, Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama,\u201d came the demure reply.</p><p>Countess Ramsay\u2019s pillowy cheeks puffed out with another smile. Her gaze encompassed the entire group. \u201cWhat matters most is the bond of familial affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve decided not to take the house away from us?\u201d Amelia asked bluntly.</p><p>Cam settled a hand at his wife\u2019s waist and gave her a warning squeeze.</p> <p>Looking taken aback, Countess Ramsay regarded Amelia with wide eyes. \u201cGoodness me. I\u2019m not at all able to discuss legalities\u2014my poor little brain fairly collapses when I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Vanessa Darvin said in a silky voice, \u201cas we understand, there is a chance we may not be entitled to Ramsay House, if Lord Ramsay marries and sires offspring within a year.\u201d Her gaze slid boldly over Leo, traveling from head to toe. \u201cAnd he seems well equipped to do so.\u201d</p><p>Leo arched a brow, amused by the delicate emphasis she placed on the term \u201cwell equipped.\u201d</p><p>Cam intervened before Amelia could utter a scathing reply. \u201cMy lady, do you have need of lodging during your stay in Hampshire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your kind concern,\u201d Vanessa Darvin replied, \u201cbut we are staying at the residence of Lord and Lady Ulster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome refreshments would be welcome, however,\u201d Countess Ramsay suggested brightly. \u201cI think a glass of champagne would revive me nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Leo said. \u201cMay I escort you to the refreshment tables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delightful,\u201d the countess said, beaming. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d She came forward to take his proffered arm, and Vanessa went to his other side. Summoning a charming smile, Leo led the pair away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat dreadful people,\u201d Amelia said dourly. \u201cThey\u2019re probably here to inspect the house. And they\u2019ll monopolize Leo all evening, when he should be talking and dancing with eligible young women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Darvin is an eligible young woman,\u201d Win said, looking troubled.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, Win. Do you think they came here so that Miss Darvin could meet Leo? Do you think she might set her cap for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere would be advantages to both sides if they married,\u201d Win said. \u201cMiss Darvin would become Lady Ramsay and gain the entire estate instead of just the copyhold. And we could all continue living here, whether or not Leo fathers a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of having a sister-in-law like Miss Darvin is intolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can\u2019t judge her on first acquaintance,\u201d Win said. \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s a nice person on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cWomen who look like that never have to be nice on the inside.\u201d Noticing that Cam and Merripen were speaking to each other in Romany, she asked her husband, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are peacock feathers on her gown,\u201d Cam remarked, in the same tone he might have said, There are poisonous flesh-eating spiders on her gown.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very dashing effect.\u201d Amelia looked at him quizzically. \u201cYou don\u2019t like peacock feathers?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo the Rom,\u201d Merripen said soberly, \u201ca single peacock feather is an evil omen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was wearing dozens of them,\u201d Cam added.</p><p>They watched Leo walk away with Vanessa Darvin as if he were heading toward a pit filled with vipers.</p><p>Leo escorted Vanessa Darvin to the drawing room, while Countess Ramsay remained near the refreshment tables with Lord and Lady Ulster. After a few minutes of conversation with Vanessa, it was obvious that she was a young woman with adequate intelligence and a highly flirtatious nature. Leo had known and bedded women like Vanessa before. She inspired little interest in him. However, it might benefit the Hathaway family to become acquainted with Vanessa Darvin and her mother, if only to learn their plans.</p> <p>Chattering lightly, Vanessa confided how dreadfully dull it had been to spend a year in mourning after her father had passed away, and how eager she had been to finally have a season in London the following year. \u201cBut how charming this estate is,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI remember visiting it once when my father had the title. It was a pile of rubbish, and the gardens were barren. Now it\u2019s a gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to Mr. Rohan and Merripen,\u201d Leo said. \u201cThe transformation was entirely due to their efforts.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa looked puzzled. \u201cWell. One would never have guessed. Their people aren\u2019t usually so industrious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomas are highly industrious, actually. It\u2019s only that they\u2019re nomadic, which limits their interest in farming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your brothers-in-law are not nomadic, it seems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have each found good reason to stay in Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shrugged. \u201cThey give the appearance of being gentlemen, which I suppose is all one could ask.\u201d</p><p>Leo was annoyed by her disdainful tone. \u201cThey\u2019re both related to nobility, as a matter of fact, being only half Romany. Merripen will inherit an Irish earldom someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had heard something to that effect. But ... Irish nobility,\u201d she said with a little moue of distaste.</p><p>\u201cYou consider the Irish inferior?\u201d Leo asked idly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve always found it so crass when people refuse to be English.\u201d</p><p>Either Vanessa chose to ignore the comment, or it sailed over her head. She exclaimed with pleasure as they approached the drawing room, with its rows of glittering windows, cream-painted interior, and steep tray ceiling. \u201cHow lovely. I believe I will enjoy living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you remarked earlier,\u201d Leo pointed out, \u201cyou may not have the chance. I have a year left to marry and procreate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a reputation as an elusive bachelor, which leaves some doubt as to whether you will achieve the former.\u201d A provocative gleam appeared in her dark eyes. \u201cThe latter, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never make that claim,\u201d Leo said blandly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, my lord. The claim has often been made on your behalf. Will you deny it?\u201d</p><p>It was hardly a question one would have expected from a well-bred miss upon first acquaintance. Leo gathered that he was supposed to be impressed by her audacity. However, after participating in an infinite number of such conversations in London parlors, he no longer found such remarks intriguing.</p><p>In London, a little sincerity was far more shocking than audacity.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t claim to be accomplished in the bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cMerely competent. And women usually don\u2019t recognize the difference.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa giggled. \u201cWhat makes one accomplished in the bedroom, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Leo glanced at her without smiling. \u201cLove, of course. Without it, the entire business is merely a matter of technicalities.\u201d</p><p>She looked disconcerted, but the flirtatious mask swiftly reappeared. \u201cOh, la, love is a passing thing. I may be young, but I\u2019m hardly na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve gathered,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you care to dance, Miss Darvin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether you\u2019re competent or accomplished at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Leo said, smiling despite himself.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Upon being told by Amelia of the unanticipated arrival of Countess Ramsay and Vanessa Darvin, Catherine was filled with curiosity.</p><p>Followed soon thereafter by gloom.</p><p>Standing at the side of the room, she and Beatrix watched as Leo waltzed with Miss Darvin.</p><p>They were a striking pair, Leo\u2019s dark handsomeness perfectly balanced by Miss Darvin\u2019s vibrant beauty. Leo was an excellent dancer, if a bit more athletic than graceful as he guided his partner around the room. And the skirts of Miss Darvin\u2019s blue-green gown swirled most becomingly, a fold of her skirts occasionally wrapping against his legs from the motion of the waltz.</p><p>Miss Darvin was quite beautiful, with glowing dark eyes and rich sable hair. She murmured something that elicited a grin from Leo. He looked charmed by her. Absolutely charmed.</p><p>Catherine had a peculiar feeling in her stomach as she watched them, as if she had just swallowed a handful of tenpenny nails. Beatrix stood beside her and touched her back briefly, as if to offer comfort. Catherine felt a reversal of their usual roles, that instead of being the wise older companion, she was the one in need of reassurance and guidance.</p><p>She tried to school her features into blankness. \u201cHow attractive Miss Darvin is,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Beatrix said noncommittally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Catherine added in a glum tone, \u201cshe\u2019s enchanting.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix watched Leo and Miss Darvin with thoughtful blue eyes as they executed a perfect turn. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say enchanting ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see one flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. Her elbows are knobby.\u201d</p> <p>Squinting through her spectacles, Catherine thought that perhaps Beatrix was right. They were a bit knobby. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she said, feeling a tiny bit better. \u201cAnd doesn\u2019t her neck seem rather too long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a giraffe,\u201d Beatrix said with an emphatic nod.</p><p>Catherine strained to see Leo\u2019s expression, wondering if he had noticed the abnormal length of Miss Darvin\u2019s neck. It didn\u2019t appear that he had. \u201cYour brother seems taken with her,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s merely being polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never polite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is when he wants something,\u201d Beatrix said.</p><p>But that only sent Catherine plummeting into deeper gloom. Because the question of what Leo might want from the dark-haired beauty had no palatable answer.</p><p>A young gentleman came to ask Beatrix to dance, and Catherine gave her permission. Sighing, she leaned back against the wall and let her thoughts wander.</p><p>The ball was an unqualified success. Everyone was having a lovely time, the music was delightful, the food delicious, the evening neither too warm nor too cool.</p><p>And Catherine was miserable.</p><p>However, she was hardly going to let herself crumble like a dry teacake. Forcing a pleasant expression to her face, she turned to make conversation with a pair of elderly woman standing next to her. They were involved in an animated debate over the comparative merits of a chain stitch or a split stitch in outlining crewel embroidery. Trying to listen attentively, Catherine stood with her gloved fingers laced together.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Marks.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the familiar masculine voice.</p><p>Leo was there, breathtaking in the formal evening scheme of black and white, his blue eyes sparkling wickedly.</p><p>\u201cWould you do me the honor?\u201d he asked, gesturing to the whirl of waltzing couples. He was asking her to dance. As he had once promised.</p><p>Catherine blanched as she became aware of the multitude of gazes on them. It was one thing for the host of the evening to confer briefly with his sister\u2019s companion. It was something else entirely for him to dance with her. He knew it, and he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said in a sharp whisper, her heart beating wildly.</p><p>A faint smile touched his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t. Everyone\u2019s watching. Are you going to give me a public setdown?\u201d</p><p>She could not embarrass him that way. It was a violation of etiquette to refuse a man\u2019s invitation to dance if it could have been construed that she didn\u2019t wish to dance with him personally. And yet to be the focus of attention ... to set tongues wagging ... it was contrary to every instinct for self-preservation. \u201cOh, why are you doing this?\u201d she whispered again, desperate and furious ... and yet somewhere in the midst of her inner tumult, there was a tingle of delight.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to,\u201d he said, his smile widening. \u201cAnd so do you.\u201d</p><p>He was unforgivably arrogant.</p><p>He also happened to be right.</p><p>Which made her an idiot. If she said yes, she deserved whatever happened to her afterward.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Biting her lip, she took his arm and let him lead her toward the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou could try smiling,\u201d Leo suggested. \u201cYou look like a prisoner being led to the gallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels more like a beheading,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one dance, Marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should waltz with Miss Darvin again,\u201d she said, wincing inwardly as she heard the sullen note in her own voice.</p><p>Leo laughed quietly. \u201cOnce was enough. I\u2019ve no wish to repeat the experience.\u201d</p><p>Catherine tried, without success, to smother the ripple of pleasure that went through her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we got on marvelously, as long as we didn\u2019t stray from the topic of utmost interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that with maturity, Miss Darvin will become less self-involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. It\u2019s of no importance to me.\u201d</p><p>Leo took her into his arms, his hold firm and supportive, and inexplicably right. And an evening that had seemed so dreadful only moments before became so wonderful that Catherine was light-headed.</p><p>He held her, his right hand precisely against her shoulder blade, his left hand securing hers. Even through the layers of their gloves, she felt the thrill of contact.</p><p>The dance began.</p><p>In the waltz, the man was thoroughly in control of the timing, the pace, the sequence of steps. And Leo left Catherine no opportunity to falter. It was easy to follow him, every movement nonnegotiable. There were moments in which they seemed almost to hover before sweeping into another series of turns. The music was an audible ache of yearning. Catherine was silent, afraid to break the spell, focusing only on the blue eyes above hers. And for the first time in her life, she was wholly happy.</p><p>The dance lasted three minutes, perhaps four. Catherine tried to collect every second and commit it to memory, so that in the future she could close her eyes and bring it all back. As the waltz ended on a sweet, high note, she found herself holding her breath, wishing it would go on just a little longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo bowed and offered her his arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord. It was lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. It would be scandalous. I\u2019m not a guest, after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of the family,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>\u201cYou are very kind, my lord, but you know that\u2019s not true. I am a paid companion, which means\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off as she became aware that someone, a man, was staring at her. Glancing in his direction, she saw a face that had haunted her in nightmares.</p><p>The sight of him, a figure from the past she had managed to evade for so long, extorted every bit of calm she possessed and sent her into full-scale panic. Only her grip on Leo\u2019s arm kept her from doubling over as if she\u2019d been kicked in the stomach. She tried to take a breath, and could only wheeze.</p><p>\u201cMarks?\u201d Leo stopped and turned her to face him, looking down at her bleached face in concern. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA touch of the vapors,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cIt must have been the exertion of the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you to a chair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The man was still staring at her, recognition dawning on his features. She had to get away before he approached her. She swallowed hard against the biting pressure of tears welling in her eyes and throat.</p><p>What might have been the happiest night of Catherine\u2019s life had abruptly become the worst.</p><p>It\u2019s over, she thought with bitter grief. Her life with the Hathaways had come to an end. She wanted to die.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Leo asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, will you see to Beatrix ... tell her...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t finish. Shaking her head blindly, she walked out of the drawing room as quickly as possible.</p><p>The exertions of the dance, my arse, Leo thought darkly. This was a woman who had moved a pile of rocks so that he could climb out of a pit. Whatever was bothering Catherine, it had nothing to do with the vapors. Glancing around the room with narrowed eyes, Leo saw a stillness amid the chattering crowd.</p><p>Guy, Lord Latimer, was watching Catherine Marks as intently as Leo was. And as she left the drawing room, Latimer began to make his way to the open doorway as well.</p><p>Leo scowled with the irritable awareness that the next time his family planned a ball or soir\u00e9e, he was going to personally inspect the guest list. Had he known that Latimer would be invited, he would have drawn through the name with the darkest of ink.</p><p>Latimer, at the age of approximately forty, had reached the stage of life at which a man could no longer be called a rake, which implied a certain youthful immaturity, but instead a rou\u00e9, which had the flavor of middle-aged unseemliness.</p><p>As next in line to an earldom, Latimer had little to occupy him, other than to wait for his father to die. In the meantime he had dedicated himself to the pursuit of vice and perversion. He expected others to clean up his messes, and he cared for no one\u2019s comfort but his own. The place in his chest where a heart should have been was as empty as a calabash gourd. He was wily, clever, and calculating, all in service of satisfying his own boundless needs.</p> <p>And Leo, in the depths of his despair over Laura Dillard, had tried his best to emulate him.</p><p>Recalling the escapades he had been involved in with Latimer and his cadre of dissipated aristocrats, Leo felt distinctly unclean. Since his return from France, he had scrupulously avoided Latimer. However, Latimer\u2019s family was from the neighboring county of Wiltshire, and it would have been impossible to steer clear of him forever.</p><p>Seeing Beatrix approaching the side of the drawing room, Leo reached her in a few impatient strides and took her arm.</p><p>\u201cNo more dancing for now, Bea,\u201d he murmured close to her ear. \u201cMarks isn\u2019t available to watch over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to find out. In the meantime, don\u2019t get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Go to the refreshment table and eat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Beatrix heaved a sigh. \u201cBut I suppose one doesn\u2019t need to be hungry to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he muttered, and left the room swiftly.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cStop! Stop right there, I say!\u201d</p><p>Catherine ignored the summons, keeping her head down as she hurried along a hallway toward the servants\u2019 stairwell. She was drowning in shame and fear. But she was also infuriated, thinking how monstrously unfair it was that this one man should keep ruining her life, over and over. She had known this would happen someday, that even though Latimer and the Hathaways moved in different circles, they would inevitably meet. But it had been worth the risk to be with the Hathaways, to feel that just for a little while, she had been part of a family.</p><p>Latimer grabbed her arm with bruising force. Catherine whirled to face him, her entire body shaking.</p><p>It surprised her to see the extent to which he had aged, his features blighted by coarse living. He was heavier, thick around the middle, and his ginger-colored hair was thinning. Most telling, his face had acquired the wizened look of habitual self-indulgence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you, sir,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cYou are importunate.\u201d</p><p>Latimer didn\u2019t let go of her arm. His devouring gaze made her feel polluted and ill. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten you. I looked for years. You went to another protector, didn\u2019t you?\u201d His tongue emerged to swipe moistly over his lips, and his jaw worked as if he were preparing to unhook it and swallow her whole. \u201cI wanted to be your first. I paid a bloody fortune for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Catherine took a shivering breath. \u201cRelease me at once, or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, dressed in a spinster\u2019s garb?\u201d</p><p>She looked away from him, battling tears. \u201cI am employed by the Hathaway family. By Lord Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can believe. Tell me what services you provide for Ramsay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d Her voice was low and strained.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d Latimer drew her stiff body closer, his wine-soured breath wafting in her face. \u201cRevenge,\u201d he said softly, \u201cis the act of a despicable and petty character. Which is no doubt why I\u2019ve always enjoyed it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want revenge for?\u201d Catherine asked, despising him to the bottom of her soul. \u201cYou lost nothing because of me. Except perhaps the merest fragment of pride, which you could easily afford.\u201d</p><p>Latimer smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s where you\u2019re mistaken. Pride is all I have. I\u2019m quite sensitive about it, really. And I won\u2019t be satisfied until it\u2019s returned with interest. Eight years of compounded pride is a tidy sum, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>Catherine stared at him coldly. The last time she had seen him, she had been a fifteen-year-old girl with no resources, and no one to protect her. But Latimer had no idea that Harry Rutledge was her brother. Nor did it seem to have occurred to him that there might be other men who would dare to stand between him and what he wanted. \u201cYou disgusting lecher,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose the only way you can have a woman is to purchase one. Except that I\u2019m not for sale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were once, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Latimer asked idly. \u201cYou were a costly piece, and I was assured that you were worth it. Obviously you\u2019re no virgin, being in service to Ramsay, but I\u2019d still like a sample of what I paid for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you nothing! Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Latimer stunned her by smiling, his face softening. \u201cCome now, you do me a disservice. I\u2019m not such a bad fellow. I can be generous. What does Ramsay pay you? I\u2019ll triple it. It would be no hardship, sharing my bed. I know a thing or two about pleasing a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know a great deal about pleasing yourself,\u201d she said, twisting in his grasp. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t struggle, you\u2019ll make me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>They were both so involved in their conflict that neither of them noticed the approach of a third party.</p> <p>\u201cLatimer.\u201d It was Leo\u2019s voice, severing the air like the quiet arc of a steel blade. \u201cIf anyone were going to molest my servants, Latimer, it would be me. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t require your assistance.\u201d</p><p>To Catherine\u2019s measureless relief, the brutal grip loosened and fell away. She backed up so hastily that she nearly stumbled. But Leo came to her swiftly, using a hand on her shoulder to arrest her momentum. The lightness of his grip, of a man mindful of fragility, was in stark contrast to Latimer\u2019s.</p><p>She had never seen Leo wear such an expression, a murderous glitter in his eyes. He wasn\u2019t at all the same man who had danced with her just minutes before.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Catherine nodded, staring up at him in dazed misery. How closely acquainted was he with Lord Latimer? Dear God, was it possible they were friends? And if so ... given the chance, might Leo have done the same thing to her that Latimer once had, all those years ago?</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d Leo murmured, removing his hand from her shoulder.</p><p>Glancing at Latimer, Catherine shivered in revulsion and fled from the pair, as her life came crashing down around her.</p><p>Leo stared after Catherine, resisting the urge to follow her. He would go to her later, and try to soothe or repair what damage had been done. And it was considerable damage\u2014he had seen it in her eyes.</p> <p>Turning to Latimer, Leo was powerfully tempted to slaughter the bastard where he stood. Instead he made his face implacable. \u201cI had no idea you\u2019d been invited,\u201d he said, \u201cor I would have advised the housemaids to go into hiding. Really, Latimer, must you force yourself on unwilling females with all the available ones to be had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to Miss Marks\u2019s period of employ, she\u2019s been with the family not quite three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to maintain the pretense that she\u2019s a servant,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cClever lad, installing your mistress in the family household for your own convenience. I want a go at her. Just for one night.\u201d</p><p>Leo found it increasingly difficult to restrain his temper. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name gave you the idea that she\u2019s my mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the girl, Ramsay. The one I told you about! Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leo said curtly.</p><p>\u201cWe were in our cups at the time,\u201d Latimer conceded. \u201cBut I thought you were paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your sober best, Latimer, you\u2019re irrelevant and annoying. Why would I have paid attention to anything you said when you were drunk? And what the devil do you mean, \u2018she\u2019s the girl\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI purchased her from my old madam. I won her in a private auction of sorts. She was the most charming thing I\u2019d ever seen, no more than fifteen, with those golden curls, and such remarkable eyes. The madam assured me the girl was absolutely untouched, and yet she had been told all the ways to pleasure a man. I paid a fortune to have the girl at my service for the period of a year, with an option to continue the arrangement if I desired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow convenient,\u201d Leo said, his eyes narrowed. \u201cI suppose you never bothered to ask the girl if she desired the arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrelevant. The agreement was all to her benefit. It was her fortune to be born a beauty, and she would learn how to profit from it. Besides, they\u2019re all prostitutes, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s only a question of circumstance and price.\u201d Latimer paused, smiling quizzically. \u201cShe told you none of this?\u201d</p><p>Leo ignored the question. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the day Catherine was delivered to my house, before I\u2019d sampled the goods, a man forced his way in and took her. Literally abducted her. One of my footmen tried to stop him and took a bullet in the leg for his pains. By the time I realized what was happening, the man had already taken Catherine past the front threshold. I can only assume that he had lost the private auction and decided to take what he wanted by force. Catherine disappeared after that. I\u2019ve wanted her for eight years.\u201d Latimer gave a low laugh. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s turned up in your possession. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m surprised, really. You\u2019ve always been a devious bastard. How did you manage to acquire her?\u201d</p> <p>Leo was momentarily silent. His chest was filled with searing anguish for Catherine\u2019s sake. Fifteen. Betrayed by those who should have protected her. Sold to a man without morals or mercy. The thought of what Latimer would have done to Catherine made Leo ill. Latimer\u2019s depravities wouldn\u2019t have stopped at mere physical violation\u2014he would have destroyed her soul. No wonder Catherine found it impossible to trust anyone. It was the only rational response to impossible circumstances.</p><p>Leveling a cold stare at Latimer, Leo reflected that if he were just a bit less civilized, he would have killed the bastard on the spot. However, he would have to settle for keeping him away from Catherine, and doing whatever was necessary to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cShe is owned by no one,\u201d Leo said with care.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is under my protection, however.\u201d</p> <p>Latimer arched a brow, amused. \u201cWhat am I to infer from that?\u201d</p><p>Leo was deadly serious. \u201cThat you are to go nowhere near her. That she\u2019ll never have to endure the sound of your voice or the insult of your presence ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t oblige you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>A coarse laugh erupted. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not threatening me.\u201d</p><p>Leo smiled coldly. \u201cMuch as I always tried to ignore your inebriated ravings, Latimer, a few things did stick in my memory. Some of your confessions of misconduct would make more than a few people unhappy. I know enough of your secrets to land you in Marshalsea prison without so much as a chum ticket. And if that\u2019s not enough, I would be more than willing to resort to bashing your skull in with a blunt object. In fact, I\u2019m becoming quite enthused about the idea.\u201d Seeing the astonishment in the other man\u2019s eyes, Leo smiled without humor. \u201cI see you grasp my sincerity. That\u2019s good. It might save us both some inconvenience.\u201d He paused to give his next statement greater impact. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to instruct my servants to escort you off my estate. You\u2019re not welcome.\u201d</p> <p>The older man\u2019s face went livid. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret having made an enemy of me, Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as I\u2019ve regretted having once made a friend of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Catherine?\u201d Amelia asked Leo when he returned to the drawing room. \u201cWhy did she leave so suddenly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Latimer accosted her,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>Amelia shook her head in bewildered outrage. \u201cThat repulsive goat\u2014why would he dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what he does. He\u2019s an affront to polite company and every standard of moral decency. A better question would be why the devil we invited him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t invite him, we invited his parents. Obviously he came in their stead.\u201d She threw him an accusing glance. \u201cAnd he\u2019s an old acquaintance of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s assume that every old acquaintance of mine is either a lecher or a criminal and should be kept far away from the estate and the family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Lord Latimer harm Catherine?\u201d Amelia asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot physically. But I want someone to see to her. I expect she\u2019s in her room. Will you go to her, or send Win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions. Just make certain she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, Win came to Leo with the information that Catherine had declined to say anything other than she wished to retire undisturbed.</p><p>It was probably for the best, Leo thought. Although he wanted to go up to her and offer comfort, he would let her sleep.</p><p>On the morrow, they would sort everything out.</p><p>Leo awakened at the hour of nine and went to Catherine\u2019s door. It was still closed, and there was no sound from within. It took all his self-control to keep from opening the door and waking her. However, she needed to rest ... especially in light of what he intended to discuss with her later.</p><p>It seemed to Leo as he went downstairs that the entire household, including servants, was practically sleepwalking. The ball hadn\u2019t ended until four in the morning, and even then some of the guests had been reluctant to leave. Sitting in the breakfast room, Leo drank a mug of strong tea and watched as Amelia, Win, and Merripen came in. Cam, always a late riser, was still absent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened to Catherine last night?\u201d Amelia asked quietly. \u201cAnd what of Lord Latimer\u2019s precipitate departure? More than a few tongues were wagging.\u201d</p><p>Leo had considered whether or not to discuss Catherine\u2019s secrets with the rest of the family. They would have to be told something. And although he would not go into detail, he felt it would be easier for Catherine if someone else gave the explanation. \u201cAs it turns out,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cwhen Cat was a girl of fifteen, her so-called family made an arrangement with Latimer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of arrangement?\u201d Amelia asked. Her eyes widened as Leo sent her a speaking glance. \u201cDear Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully Rutledge intervened before she was forced to\u2014\u201d Leo broke off, surprised by the note of fury in his own voice. He struggled to moderate it before continuing. \u201cI needn\u2019t elaborate. However, it\u2019s obviously not a part of Cat\u2019s past that she\u2019s fond of dwelling on. She\u2019s been in hiding for the past eight years. Latimer recognized her last evening, and upset her badly. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll awaken this morning with some notion of leaving Hampshire.\u201d</p> <p>Merripen\u2019s features were stern, but his dark eyes were warm with compassion. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for her to go anywhere. She\u2019s safe with us.\u201d</p><p>Leo nodded, rubbing the edge of the teacup with the pad of his thumb. \u201cI\u2019ll make that clear when I talk with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Amelia said carefully, \u201care you certain that you\u2019re the best one to manage this? With your history of quarreling...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hard look. \u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d A hesitant voice came from the doorway.</p> <p>It was Beatrix, wearing a ruffled blue dressing gown, her dark hair trailing in wild locks. Worry had creased her forehead.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, dear,\u201d Amelia said warmly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to rise early, if you don\u2019t wish to.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix replied in a tumble of words. \u201cI wanted to see how the injured owl I\u2019m keeping in the barn is faring. And I was also looking for Dodger, because I haven\u2019t seen him since yesterday afternoon. So I opened Miss Marks\u2019s door just a sliver, to see if he was in there. You know how he likes to sleep in her slipper box\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t there?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>Beatrix shook her head. \u201cAnd neither was Miss Marks. Her bed is made, and her carpetbag is gone. And I found this on the dressing table.\u201d</p><p>She handed a piece of folded paper to Amelia, who opened it and scanned the written lines.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Leo asked, already on his feet.</p><p>Amelia handed it to him without a word.</p><p>Please forgive me for leaving without saying good-bye. There is no other choice. I can never express the gratitude I feel for your generosity and kindness. Hopefully you will not think it presumptuous of me to say that although you are not my family in truth, you are the family of my heart.</p><p>I will miss all of you.</p><p>Ever your</p><p>Catherine Marks</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Leo growled, tossing the folded paper to the table, \u201cthe drama in this household is more than a man can tolerate. I would have assumed that we could have had a reasonable discussion in the comfort of Ramsay House, but instead she flees in the dark of night and leaves a letter filled with sentimental twaddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not twaddle,\u201d Amelia said defensively.</p> <p>Win\u2019s eyes filled with compassionate tears as she read the note. \u201cKev, we must find her.\u201d</p><p>Merripen slid a hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to London,\u201d Leo muttered. To his knowledge, Harry Rutledge was the only person Cat could turn to. Although Harry and Poppy had been invited to the ball, hotel business had kept them in London.</p><p>Anger, urgency, exploded inside Leo from nowhere. He tried not to show it, but the discovery that Cat had left ... left him ... had filled him with a possessive fury unlike anything he had ever felt before.</p><p>\u201cThe mail coach usually leaves Stony Cross at five-thirty,\u201d Merripen said. \u201cWhich means you have a fair chance of overtaking her before she reaches Guildford. I\u2019ll go with you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I,\u201d Win said.</p><p>\u201cWe should all go,\u201d Amelia declared.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leo said grimly. \u201cI\u2019m going alone. When I catch up with Marks, you won\u2019t want to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Amelia asked suspiciously, \u201cwhat are you planning to do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always insist on asking questions when you know you won\u2019t like the answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, being an optimist,\u201d she said tartly, \u201cI always hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The coach schedule was limited, now that the mails were most often loaded onto locomotive trains. Catherine had been fortunate to obtain a seat inside a coach bound for London.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel all that fortunate, however.</p><p>She was miserable and chilled, even in the stuffy interior of the coach. The vehicle was filled with passengers outside and in, with parcels and luggage tied precariously up top. The whole thing felt dangerously top-heavy as it rumbled over rough patches of road. Ten miles per hour, one of the gentleman passengers had estimated, admiring the strength and endurance of the team of massive drays.</p><p>Morosely Catherine stared out the window as the meadows of Hampshire rolled into the heavy woodland and bustling market towns of Surrey.</p><p>There was only one other woman inside the coach, a plump and well-dressed matron who was traveling with her husband. She dozed in the opposite corner from Catherine\u2019s, emitting delicate snores. Whenever the coach jolted, it caused the objects on her hat to rattle and quiver. And quite a hat it was, adorned with clusters of artificial cherries, a plume, and a small stuffed bird. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At midday the coach stopped at an inn where a new team would be put to, in preparation for the next stretch of road. Groaning in relief at the prospect of a brief respite, the passengers poured out of the vehicle and into the tavern.</p><p>Catherine carried her tapestry carpetbag, afraid to leave it in the coach. The bag was a weighty affair containing a nightgown, undergarments and stockings, an assortment of combs and pins and a hairbrush, a shawl, and a voluminous novel with a mischievous inscription from Beatrix ... \u201cThis story is guaranteed to entertain Miss Marks without improving her in the least! With love from the incorrigible B.H.\u201d</p><p>The inn appeared moderately well appointed but hardly luxurious, the kind of place that stablemen and workingmen frequented. Catherine glanced disconsolately at a wooden yard wall covered with posting bills, and turned to watch a pair of ostlers change the team.</p><p>She nearly dropped the carpetbag at the side of the carriage yard as she felt a rustle of independent movement within. Not as if something had shifted around ... it was more like ... something was alive in there.</p> <p>Her heartbeat became rapid and disorganized, like the bobbing of small potatoes in boiling water. \u201cOh no,\u201d she whispered. Turning to face the wall, trying desperately to keep the bag out of view, she unlooped the fastener and opened the bag a mere two inches.</p><p>A sleek little head popped out. Catherine was aghast to behold a familiar pair of bright eyes and a set of twitching whiskers.</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d she whispered. The ferret chattered happily, the corners of his mouth curling in his perpetual ferret smile. \u201cOh, you naughty boy!\u201d He must have slipped into the bag while she had been packing. \u201cWhat am I to do with you?\u201d she asked in despair. Pushing his head back down into the bag, she stroked him to keep him quiet. There was no choice but to take the dratted creature all the way to London, and give him into Poppy\u2019s keeping until he could be returned to Beatrix.</p><p>As soon as one of the ostlers shouted, \u201cAll ready!\u201d Catherine went back into the coach and settled the carpetbag at her feet. Opening the top once more, she peeked at Dodger, who was coiled in the folds of her nightgown. \u201cBe quiet,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d came the matron\u2019s voice as she entered the carriage, her hat plume trembling with indignation.</p> <p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am, I wasn\u2019t speaking to you,\u201d Catherine said hastily. \u201cI was ... lecturing myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes narrowed as she plopped into the opposite seat.</p><p>Catherine sat stiffly. She waited for a telltale rustling of the carpetbag or a betraying noise. However, Dodger remained quiet.</p><p>The matron closed her eyes and lowered her chin to the high, mounded shelf of her bosom. In a matter of two minutes, she appeared to be dozing again.</p><p>Perhaps this wouldn\u2019t be difficult after all, Catherine thought. If the woman remained asleep, and the gentlemen resumed their newspaper reading, she might be able to smuggle Dodger to London unnoticed.</p><p>But just as Catherine allowed herself to teeter on the brink of hope, the entire situation went tumbling out of her control.</p> <p>Without warning Dodger poked his head out, surveyed his interesting new surroundings, and slithered from the bag. Catherine\u2019s lips parted in a silent cry, and she froze with her hands arrested in midair. The ferret ran up the upholstered seat to the matron\u2019s beckoning hat. A nibble or two, and his sharp teeth had severed a cluster of artificial cherries from the hat. Triumphantly he scrambled down the seat and leaped into Catherine\u2019s lap with his prize. He did a happy ferret war dance, a series of hops and wriggles.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Catherine whispered, grabbing the cherries from him and trying to shove him back into the carpetbag.</p><p>Dodger protested, squeaking and chattering.</p><p>The woman spluttered and blinked, waking irritably at the noise. \u201cWha ... what...\u201d</p><p>Cat went still, her pulse thundering in her ears.</p><p>Dodger streaked up around Cat\u2019s neck and hung limply, playing dead.</p><p>Like a scarf, Cat thought, struggling to repress a burst of demented giggles.</p><p>The matron\u2019s indignant gaze arrowed to the bunch of cherries in her lap. \u201cWhy ... why, those are from my hat, aren\u2019t they? Were you attempting to steal those while I was napping?\u201d</p> <p>Catherine sobered immediately. \u201cNo, oh no, it was an accident. I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined it, and this was my best hat, it cost two pounds and six! Give it back to me at\u2014\u201d But she broke off with a strangled sound, her mouth rounding into a calcified O as Dodger leaped to Catherine\u2019s lap, seized the cherries, and disappeared into the safety of the carpetbag.</p><p>The woman screamed with earsplitting force, exiting the coach in a full-rigged tumult of skirts.</p><p>Five minutes later, Catherine and the carpetbag had been unceremoniously ejected from the coach. She stood at the verge of the carriage yard, assaulted by a concurrence of strong smells: dung, horses, urine, combining queasily with scents of cooked meat and hot bread coming from the tavern.</p><p>The coachman mounted to the box, ignoring Catherine\u2019s outraged protests.</p><p>\u201cBut I paid to go all the way to London!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYou paid for one passenger, not two. Two passengers get half the journey.\u201d</p><p>Incredulously Catherine looked from his stony expression to the carpetbag in her hand. \u201cThis is not a passenger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a quarter hour behind time because of you and your rat,\u201d the coachman said, squaring his elbows and cracking the whip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my rat, he\u2019s ... wait, how am I to get to London?\u201d</p><p>One of the ostlers replied implacably as the coach set out. \u201cNext mails come tomorrow morning, miss. Maybe they\u2019ll let you and your pet ride up top.\u201d</p><p>Catherine glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ride up top, I paid to ride inside, all the way to London, and I consider this a form of larceny! What am I to do until tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>The ostler, a young man with a long-handled mustache, shrugged. \u201cYou might ask if there\u2019s a room available,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAlthough they probably won\u2019t take kindly to guests with rats.\u201d He looked beyond her as another vehicle came into the yard. \u201cOut of the way, miss, or you\u2019ll get thrown down by the carriage.\u201d</p> <p>Infuriated, Catherine stomped to the entrance of the inn. She looked into her carpetbag, where Dodger was playing with the cherries. Was it not enough, she thought in frustration, that she\u2019d just had to leave a life she had loved, that she\u2019d been through an entire night of nearly ceaseless crying and was now exhausted? Why had an unkind fate also seen fit to deposit Dodger in her care? \u201cYou,\u201d she fumed aloud, \u201care the last feather that broke the horse\u2019s back. You have plagued me for years, and stolen all my garters, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon,\u201d came a polite voice.</p><p>Catherine looked up with a scowl. In the next moment she swayed, her balance momentarily off.</p><p>Her thunderstruck eyes beheld Leo, Lord Ramsay, who looked amused. He kept his hands tucked in his pockets as he approached her in a relaxed stride. \u201cI\u2019m sure I shouldn\u2019t ask. But why are you shouting at your luggage?\u201d</p><p>Despite the negligence of his manner, his gaze went over her thoroughly, taking careful inventory.</p> <p>The sight of him had knocked the breath from her. He was so handsome, so beloved and familiar, that Catherine was nearly overcome by the impulse to fling herself at him. She couldn\u2019t fathom why he had come after her.</p><p>How she wished he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Fumbling to close the carpetbag, she decided that it probably wouldn\u2019t do to advertise Dodger\u2019s presence before she managed to secure a room for herself. \u201cWhy are you here, my lord?\u201d she asked unsteadily.</p><p>A leisurely shrug. \u201cWhen I awakened this morning after a mere four and a half hours of sleep, I thought it would be just the thing to hop in the carriage and go for a picturesque drive to Haslemere and visit the\u201d\u2014Leo paused to glance at the sign above the door\u2014\u201cSpread Eagle Inn. What a fortuitous name.\u201d His lips twitched at her bewildered expression, but his eyes were warm. His hand came up to her face, gently lifting her unwilling chin. \u201cYour eyes are swollen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel dust,\u201d Catherine said with difficulty, swallowing hard at the sweetness of his touch. She wanted to push her chin harder against his hand, like a cat hungry to be stroked. Her eyes stung with the portent of tears.</p><p>This would not do. Her reaction to him was nothing short of appalling. And if they stood out in the carriage yard even a moment longer, she would lose her composure altogether.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have difficulty with the coach?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and there won\u2019t be another till morning. I need to arrange for a room.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t release her from his gaze. \u201cYou could come back to Hampshire with me.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion was more devastating than Leo could have known.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to London, to see my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll probably travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll tour the Continent. And settle in France or Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d Leo didn\u2019t bother to hide his skepticism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire a companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hire a companion, you are a companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just left the position,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>For just a moment, there was an alarming intensity in his gaze. Something predatory. Something dangerous. \u201cI have a new position for you,\u201d he said, and a little chill went down her spine.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d Blindly she turned and walked into the building.</p><p>Finding the innkeeper\u2019s table, she waited resolutely until a short, stocky man came to greet her. Although his head was shiny and bald, he had a thick gray beard and muttonchop sideburns. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d he asked, looking from Catherine to the man just behind her.</p><p>Leo spoke before she could say a word. \u201cI\u2019d like to arrange a room for my wife and myself.\u201d</p><p>His wife? Catherine twisted to give him an offended glance. \u201cI want my own room. And I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t, really.\u201d Leo smiled at the innkeeper, the rueful, commiserating smile of one put-upon man to another. \u201cA marital squabble. She\u2019s cross because I won\u2019t let her mother visit us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh...\u201d The innkeeper made an ominous sound and bent to write in the registry book. \u201cDon\u2019t give in, sir. They never leave when they say they will. When my mother-in-law visits, the mice throw themselves at the cat, begging to be eaten. Your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Catherine began, nettled. She broke off as she felt the carpetbag quiver in her grasp. Dodger wanted to get out. She had to keep him hidden until they were safely upstairs. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo smiled. \u201cEager to make up after our quarrel, darling?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look that should have slayed him on the spot.</p><p>To Catherine\u2019s fidgety impatience, it took another ten minutes for the arrangements to be made, including securing lodging for Leo\u2019s driver and footman. Moreover, Leo\u2019s luggage\u2014two sizable traveling bags\u2014had to be brought in. \u201cI thought I might not reach you until London,\u201d Leo said, having the grace to look slightly sheepish.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you arrange for only one room?\u201d she whispered sharply.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not safe by yourself. You need me for protection.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I need protection from!\u201d</p><p>They were shown to a tidy but sparsely furnished room, with a brass bed in need of polishing, and a faded, much-laundered quilt. Two chairs were poised by the tiny hearth, one upholstered, the other small and bare. A battered washstand occupied one corner, a small table in another. The floor was swept and the white-painted walls were vacant except for a framed work consisting of a motto embroidered on heavy perforated paper: \u201cTime and tide wait for no man.\u201d</p><p>Mercifully there was a lack of strong odor in the room, only a slight whiff of roasted meat from the tavern below, and an ashy tang from the cold hearth.</p><p>After Leo had closed the door, Catherine set her carpetbag on the floor and opened it.</p> <p>Dodger\u2019s head emerged and did a complete swivel as he surveyed the room. He leaped out and scurried beneath the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou brought Dodger with you?\u201d Leo asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cNot voluntarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Is that why you were forced off the coach?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at him, Catherine felt her insides rearrange themselves, a warm lifting and resettling as she saw him remove his coat and cravat. Everything about the situation was improper, and yet propriety no longer seemed to matter.</p><p>She told him the story then, about the rustling in the bag, and how the ferret had stolen the cherries off the matron\u2019s hat, and by the time she got to the part about Dodger pretending to be a scarf around her neck, Leo was gasping with laughter. He looked so thoroughly tickled, so boyish in his amusement, that Catherine didn\u2019t care if it was at her expense or not. She even laughed with him, breaking into helpless giggles.</p> <p>But somehow her giggling dissolved into sobs, and she felt her eyes welling even as she laughed, and she put her hands over her face to hold the giddy emotions back. Impossible. She knew she looked like a madwoman, laughing and crying all at once. This kind of emotional unhinging was her worst nightmare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she choked, shaking her head, covering her eyes with a sleeved forearm. \u201cPlease leave. Please.\u201d</p><p>But Leo\u2019s arms went around her. He collected the quivering bundle of her against his hard chest, and he held her firmly. She felt him kiss the hot, exposed curve of her ear. The scent of his shaving soap drifted to her nostrils, the masculine fragrance comforting and familiar. She didn\u2019t realize that she had continued to gasp out the word \u201csorry\u201d until he answered, his voice low and infinitely tender. \u201cYes, you should be sorry ... but not for crying. Only for leaving me without a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI l-left a letter,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThat maudlin note? Surely you didn\u2019t think that would be enough to keep me from coming after you. Hush, now. I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re safe, and I\u2019m not letting go. I\u2019m here.\u201d She realized that she was struggling to press closer to him, trying to fight her way deeper into his embrace.</p><p>When her crying broke into watery hiccups, she felt Leo tug the jacket of her traveling habit from her shoulders. In her exhaustion she found herself complying like an obedient child, pulling her arms from the sleeves. She didn\u2019t even protest as he took the combs and pins from her hair. Her scalp throbbed sharply as the tight coiffure was undone. Leo removed her spectacles and set them aside, and went to fetch a handkerchief from his discarded coat.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Catherine mumbled, mopping her sore eyes with the square of pressed cotton, wiping her nose. She stood with childlike indecision, the handkerchief balled in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Leo sat in the large hearthside chair and drew her down with him.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d she began, but he hushed her and gathered her on his lap. The mounds of her skirts spilled heavily over them both. She rested her head on his shoulder, the agitated workings of her lungs gradually matching the measured rhythm of his. His hand played slowly in her hair. Once she would have shrunk away from a man\u2019s touch, no matter how innocuous. But in this room, removed from the rest of the world, it seemed neither of them were quite themselves.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have followed me,\u201d she finally brought herself to say.</p><p>\u201cThe entire family wanted to come,\u201d Leo said. \u201cIt seems the Hathaways can\u2019t do without your civilizing influence. So I\u2019ve been charged with bringing you back.\u201d</p><p>That nearly started her crying again. \u201cI can\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know. Lord Latimer must have told you about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me a little.\u201d The backs of his fingers stroked the side of her neck. \u201cYour grandmother was the madam, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d His tone was quiet and matter-of-fact, as if having a grandmother who owned a house of prostitution was a perfectly ordinary circumstance.</p><p>Catherine nodded, swallowing miserably. \u201cI went to live with my grandmother and Aunt Althea when Mother took ill. At first I didn\u2019t understand what the family business was, but after a while I realized what working for my grandmother meant. Althea had finally reached the age when she was no longer as popular among the customers. And then I turned fifteen, and it was supposed to be my turn. Althea said that I was lucky, because she\u2019d had to start when she was twelve. I asked if I could be a teacher or a seamstress, something like that. But she and my grandmother said I\u2019d never make enough money to repay what had been spent on me. Working for them was the only profitable thing I could do. I tried to think of somewhere to go, some way to survive by myself. But there was no position I could get without recommendations. Except for a factory job, which would have been dangerous and the wages would have been too low to pay for a room anywhere. I begged my grandmother to let me go to my father, because I knew he would never have left me there, had he known of their plans. But she said\u2014\u201d Catherine stopped, her hands fisting in his shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo disentangled her fingers and meshed his own with them, until their hands were caught together like the clasp of a bracelet. \u201cWhat did she say, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he already knew, and approved, and he would receive a percentage of the money I earned. I didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d She let out a broken sigh. \u201cBut he had to have known, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Leo was silent, his thumb softly rubbing into the cup of her palm. The question needed no answer.</p><p>Catherine set her jaw against a quiver of grief, and resumed. \u201cAlthea brought gentlemen to meet me one at a time, and she told me to be charming. She said that of all of them, Lord Latimer had made the highest offer.\u201d She made a face against his shirt. \u201cHe was the one I liked least of all. He kept winking and telling me there were naughty surprises in store for me.\u201d</p> <p>Leo uttered a few choice words beneath his breath. At her uncertain pause, he ran his hand along her spine. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Althea told me what to expect, because she thought I would fare much better if I knew. And the acts she described, the things I was supposed to...\u201d</p><p>His hand went still on her back. \u201cWere you required to put any of it in practice?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, but it all sounded dreadful.\u201d</p><p>A note of sympathetic amusement warmed his voice. \u201cOf course it did, to a fifteen-year-old girl.\u201d</p> <p>Lifting her head, Catherine looked into his face. He was too handsome for his own good, and for hers as well. Although she wasn\u2019t wearing her spectacles, she could see every breathtaking detail of him ... the dark grain of shaved whiskers, the laugh lines at the outer corners of his eyes, little pale whisks against the rosewood color of his skin. And most of all the variegated blue of his eyes, light and dark, sunlight and shadow.</p><p>Leo waited patiently, holding her as if there were nothing else in the world he would have preferred doing. \u201cHow did you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to my grandmother\u2019s desk one morning,\u201d Catherine said, \u201cwhen the household was still asleep. I was trying to find money. I planned to run away and find lodging and a decent position somewhere. There wasn\u2019t a single shilling. But in one of the nooks in the desk, I found a letter, addressed to me. I\u2019d never seen it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Rutledge,\u201d Leo said rather than asked.</p><p>Catherine nodded. \u201cA brother I\u2019d never known existed. Harry had written that if I were ever in need, I should send word to his address. I dashed off a letter to let him know the trouble I was in, and I gave it to William to deliver\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is William?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little boy who worked there ... he carried things up and down the stairs, cleaned shoes, went on errands, whatever he was told to do. I think he was the child of one of the prostitutes. A very sweet boy. He delivered the note to Harry. I hope Althea never found out. If she did, I fear for what happened to him.\u201d She shook her head and sighed. \u201cThe next day I was sent to Lord Latimer\u2019s house. But Harry came just in time.\u201d She paused reflectively. \u201cHe frightened me only a little less than Lord Latimer. Harry was extremely angry. At the time I thought it was directed at me, but now I think it was the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt often takes the form of anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never blamed Harry for what happened to me. I wasn\u2019t his responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s face hardened. \u201cApparently you were no one\u2019s responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Catherine shrugged uneasily. \u201cHarry didn\u2019t know what to do with me. He asked where I wanted to live, since I couldn\u2019t stay with him, and I asked if he could send me somewhere far from London. We settled on a school in Aberdeen, called Blue Maid\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSome of the peerage send their more unruly daughters or by-blows there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m acquainted with a woman who attended Blue Maid\u2019s. A severe place, she said. Plain food and discipline.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lived there for six years, teaching for the last two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Rutledge come to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly once. But we corresponded occasionally. I never went home on holiday, because the hotel wasn\u2019t really a home, and Harry didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d She grimaced a little. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very nice until he met Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that he\u2019s nice now,\u201d Leo said. \u201cBut as long as he treats my sister well, I\u2019ll have no quarrel with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but Harry loves her,\u201d Catherine said earnestly. \u201cTruly he does.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s expression softened. \u201cWhat makes you so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see it. The way he is with her, the look in his eyes and ... why are you smiling like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen. You\u2019ll interpret anything as love. You see a man wearing an idiotic expression, and you assume he\u2019s been struck by Cupid\u2019s arrow when in reality he\u2019s digesting a bad turnip.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him indignantly. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Leo tightened his arms around her as she tried to struggle from his lap. \u201cI\u2019m merely making an observation about your gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you think men are superior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Only simpler. A woman is a collection of diverse needs, whereas a man has only one. No, don\u2019t get up. Tell me why you left Blue Maid\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe headmistress asked me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?

I wanted to be like her. She was stern but kind, and nothing ever seemed to disrupt her composure. I went to her office, and she poured tea, and we talked for a long time. She said I\u2019d done an excellent job, and I was welcome to return and continue teaching in the future. But first she wanted me to leave Aberdeen and see something of the world. And I told her that leaving Blue Maid\u2019s was the last thing I wanted to do, and she said that was why I needed to do it. She had received word from a friend at a placement agency in London that a family of ... \u2018uncommon circumstances,\u2019 as she put it, was searching for a woman who could act as both governess and companion to pair of sisters, one of whom had recently been expelled from finishing school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded. \u201cThe headmistress thought that I might suit the Hathaways. What I never expected was how much they suited me. I went for an interview, and I thought the entire family was a bit mad\u2014but in the loveliest possible way. And I\u2019ve worked for them for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been so happy and now\u2014\u201d She broke off, her face contorting.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Leo said hastily, taking her head in his hands, \u201cdon\u2019t start that again.\u201d</p><p>Catherine was so shocked to feel his lips brush her cheeks and closed eyes that the tears instantly evaporated. When she finally brought herself to look at him again, she saw that he was wearing a faint smile. He smoothed her hair, and stared into her grief-ravaged face with a depth of concern she had never seen from him before.</p><p>It frightened her to realize how much of herself she had just given away. Now he knew everything she had tried to keep secret for so long. Her hands worked against his chest like the wings of a bird that had found itself trapped indoors.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said with difficulty, \u201cwhy did you come after me? What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you have to ask,\u201d he murmured, still caressing her hair. \u201cI want to offer for you, Cat.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she thought, bitterness welling. \u201cTo be your mistress.\u201d</p> <p>His voice matched hers exactly for calmness, in a way that conveyed gentle sarcasm. \u201cNo, that would never work. First, your brother would arrange to have me murdered, or, at the very least, maimed. Second, you\u2019re far too prickly tempered to be a mistress. You\u2019re far better suited as a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose?\u201d she asked with a scowl.</p><p>Leo stared directly into her narrowed eyes. \u201cMine, of course.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Hurt and outraged, Catherine struggled so violently that he was forced to release her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your tasteless, insensitive humor,\u201d she cried, leaping to her feet. \u201cYou cad, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, damn it!\u201d Leo stood and reached for her, and she hopped backward, and he grabbed, and she flailed. They grappled until Catherine found herself tumbling backward onto the bed.</p><p>Leo fell over her in a controlled descent\u2014a pounce, really. She felt him sinking into the mass of skirts, his superior weight urging her legs apart, the muscular mass of his torso pinning her down. She writhed in distress as excitement went skimming and tickling all through her. The more she wriggled, the worse it became. She subsided beneath him, while her hands kept opening and closing on nothing.</p> <p>Leo stared down at her, eyes dancing with mischief ... but there was something else in his expression, a purposefulness, that unsettled her profoundly.</p><p>\u201cConsider it, Marks. Marrying me would solve both our problems. You would have the protection of my name. You wouldn\u2019t have to leave the family. And they couldn\u2019t nag me to get married any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am illegitimate,\u201d she said distinctly, as if he were a foreigner trying to learn English. \u201cYou are a viscount. You can\u2019t marry a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Duke of Clarence? He had ten bastard children by that actress ... what was her name...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that one. Their children were all illegitimate, but some of them married peers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the Duke of Clarence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m not a blueblood any more than you are. I inherited the title purely by happenstance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. If you married me, it would be scandalous and inappropriate, and doors would be closed to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, woman, I let two of my sisters marry Gypsies. Those doors have already been closed, bolted, and nailed shut.\u201d</p><p>Catherine couldn\u2019t think clearly, could scarcely hear him through the pounding in her ears, the wild clamor of her blood. Will and desire pulled at her with equal force. Turning her face away as his mouth descended, she said desperately, \u201cThe only way you could be certain of keeping Ramsay House for your family is to marry Miss Darvin.\u201d</p><p>He gave a derisive snort. \u201cIt\u2019s also the only way I could be certain of committing sororicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d she asked in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cSororicide. Killing one\u2019s wife.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you mean to say \u2018uxoricide.\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, uxor is the Latin word for \u2018wife.\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s \u2018sororicide\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKilling one\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, if I had to marry Miss Darvin, I\u2019d probably end up doing that too.\u201d Leo grinned down at her. \u201cThe point is, I could never have this kind of conversation with her.\u201d</p><p>He was probably right. Catherine had lived with the Hathaways long enough to fall into their style of banter, slipping into the verbal detours that could start one talking about the increasing problem of the Thames River pollution, and end up debating the question of whether or not the Earl of Sandwich had actually invented sandwiches. Catherine restrained a miserable laugh as she realized that although she might have had a slight civilizing influence on the Hathaways, their influence on her had been much greater.</p><p>Leo\u2019s head lowered, and he kissed the side of her neck with a slow deliberation that made her squirm. Clearly he had lost interest in the subject of Miss Darvin. \u201cGive in, Cat. Say you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I couldn\u2019t give you a son?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are never guarantees.\u201d Leo lifted his head and grinned. \u201cBut think of how much fun we\u2019ll have trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for the Hathaways losing Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>A new seriousness infused his expression. \u201cNo one would hold you responsible for that. It\u2019s a house. No more and no less. There isn\u2019t a structure on earth that could last forever. But a family goes on.\u201d</p><p>The front of her bodice had gone loose. She realized that he had been unbuttoning her as they had been talking. She moved to stop him, but he had already managed to spread the front of her bodice open, revealing her corset and chemise.</p><p>\u201cTherefore the only thing you\u2019ll be responsible for,\u201d Leo said huskily, \u201cis going to bed with me as often as I wish, and participating in all my heir-inducing efforts.\u201d As Catherine turned her face away, gasping, he bent to whisper in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to pleasure you. Fill you. Seduce you from head to toe. And you\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the most arrogant and absurd\u2014oh, please don\u2019t do that.\u201d He was investigating her ear with the tip of his tongue, a silky-wet tickle. Paying no attention to her protests, he kissed and licked his way along the taut arch of her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she moaned, but he took her panting mouth with his, and let his tongue play there as well, and the sensation and taste and smell of him made her feel drunk. Her arms groped around his neck, and she surrendered with a weak moan.</p> <p>After her mouth had been teased, searched, and thoroughly ravished, Leo lifted his head and stared into her dazed eyes. \u201cDo you want to hear the best part of my plan?\u201d he asked thickly. \u201cIn order to make an honest woman of you, I\u2019ll have to debauch you first.\u201d</p><p>Catherine was dismayed to hear herself giggle in witless amusement. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGifted,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThe trick is for me to find out what you like best, and then let you have only a little of it. I\u2019ll torment you until you\u2019re absolutely miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound at all pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not? Then you\u2019ll be surprised when you beg me to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Catherine couldn\u2019t hold back another helpless giggle.</p><p>Then they were both motionless, flushed, staring at each other intently.</p><p>She heard herself whisper, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, darling,\u201d Leo said gently. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes held. Catherine was paralyzed. What he asked was impossible. To give herself over entirely to a man, to anyone, was anathema to her very nature. Therefore, it should have been easy to refuse him.</p><p>Except that when she tried to form the word \u201cno,\u201d she couldn\u2019t produce a sound.</p><p>Leo began to undress her, pulling the gown away in rustling armfuls. And Catherine let him. She actually helped him, loosening laces with shaking hands, lifting her hips, tugging her arms free. He unhooked her corset deftly, betraying easy familiarity with women\u2019s unmentionables. He was in no hurry, however. He was slow and deliberate as he removed the protective layers one by one.</p><p>Finally Catherine was covered in nothing more than a blush, her pale skin scored with temporary marks left by the edges of the corset and the seams of her clothes. Leo\u2019s hand descended to her midriff, fingertips moving sensitively along the faint lines like a traveler mapping unexplored territory. His expression was absorbed, tender, as his palm skimmed over her stomach ... lower ... softly grazing the fluff of intimate hair.</p><p>\u201cBlond everywhere,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs that ... does that please you?\u201d she asked bashfully, gasping as his hand ascended to her breast.</p><p>There was a hint of a smile in his voice. \u201cCat, everything about you is so lovely, I can hardly breathe.\u201d His fingers caressed the cool rise of her breast, toying with the tip until it was taut and rose-colored. He bent and took it in his mouth.</p><p>Her heart missed a beat as she heard a noise from downstairs, a clatter that sounded like dishes being dropped in the tavern, the pitch of a raised voice. It was unimaginable that other people were going about the perfectly ordinary business of their day while she was na**d in bed with Leo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of his hands slid beneath her hips, aligning her exactly with the hard ridge behind his trousers. She whimpered against his lips, shaken by intense pleasure, wanting to stay against him like that forever. He kissed her deeply, and down below his hand pressed her against him in a corresponding rhythm, the voluptuous nudges driving her into some new dimension of feeling. Closer, closer, lapping waves urging her forward ... but then he was easing her away. She made an agitated sound, her body aching with unspent sensation.</p><p>Leo sat up and stripped his clothes off, revealing a powerful masculine body, efficiently lean and paved with muscle. There was hair on his chest, an intriguing dark fleece, and more of it lower down. His body was ready to couple with hers, she saw. Her stomach clenched in nervous anticipation. He returned to her, gathering her against him, length to length.</p><p>She explored him hesitantly, her fingers moving over his chest to the sleek skin of his side. Finding the small scar on his shoulder from their mishap at the ruins, Catherine pressed her lips to it. She heard his rough intake of breath. Encouraged, she inched lower on the bed and rubbed her nose and mouth through the soft mat on his chest. Everywhere their bodies touched, she felt his muscles tighten in response.</p><p>Trying to remember Althea\u2019s long-ago instructions, she reached down to the upthrust shape of his arousal. The skin was like nothing she had ever felt, thin and silky, moving easily over astonishing hardness. Timidly she leaned down to kiss the side of the shaft, her lips brushing against a strong pulse. She looked up to gauge his reaction, her gaze questioning.</p><p>Leo wasn\u2019t breathing at all well. A tremor shook his hand as he passed it over her hair. \u201cYou are the most adorable woman, the sweetest\u2014\u201d He gasped as she kissed him again, and laughed unsteadily. \u201cNo, love\u2014it\u2019s all right. No more of that for now.\u201d Reaching down to her, he pulled her up beside him.</p><p>He was more insistent now, more authoritative, in a way that allowed her to relax completely. How strange that she could so easily relinquish all control to him, when they had been such fierce adversaries. He parted her thighs with his hand, and she felt herself turn wet even before he touched her there. He teased through the protective curls, spreading her intimately. Her head tilted back against his supportive arm, and she closed her eyes, breathing deeply as his finger slipped inside her.</p><p>Leo seemed to luxuriate in her response. His head bent to her breast, and he used his teeth gently, licking and gnawing in time to the slow thrust of his finger. It seemed her entire body aligned with that coaxing rhythm, every quiver, pulse, muscle, thought, surging together, and again, until sensation amassed into one exquisite rush of pleasure. She sobbed, riding the swell, letting it take her, letting the heat pump and swirl and ripple all through her ... then finally she subsided into trembling weakness.</p><p>He loomed over her, panting, staring into her dazed face. Reaching up, she pulled him closer, her limbs moving easily to accommodate him. As he pressed against the entrance to her body, a sharp pain burned through her. He went deeper. Too much of him, the intrusion slow and hard and relentless. When he had gone as far as her resisting flesh could take him, he held still and tried to soothe her. His mouth slid gently over her cheeks and throat.</p><p>The intimacy of the moment, the sensation of holding him within her body, was stunning. She found herself trying to soothe him as well, her hands stroking his sleek back. Murmuring his name, she slid her palms to his flanks and urged him to continue. He began to thrust cautiously. It hurt, and yet there was something assuaging in the deep, low pressure. She opened to him instinctively, pulling him closer.</p><p>She loved the sounds he made, the quiet groans and fragmented words, his roughcast breathing. It became easier to take him, her h*ps lifting naturally with each forward motion, slippery flesh plunging and grasping. Her knees bent, angling to cradle him. His body trembled roughly, a grunt of something that sounded like pain coming from his throat.</p><p>\u201cCat ... Cat...\u201d Leo withdrew from her abruptly and thrust against her stomach, and she felt heat spill in wet pulses over her skin. He held her tightly, groaning into the joint of her shoulder and neck.</p><p>They lay together, trying to catch their breath. Catherine was limp with exhaustion, her limbs heavy. Contentment had saturated and softened her, like water seeping into a dry sponge. For the moment, at least, it was impossible to worry about anything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said drowsily. \u201cYou are gifted.\u201d</p><p>Leo eased to his side heavily, as if the movement had required great effort. He pressed his lips to her shoulder, and she felt the shape of his smile on her skin. \u201cHow delicious you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt was like making love to an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSans halo,\u201d she murmured, and was rewarded by his low chuckle. She touched the film of moisture on her stomach. \u201cWhy did you do it that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithdrawing, you mean? I don\u2019t want to get you with child, if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want children? I mean ... not because of the copyhold clause, but for their own sake?\u201d</p><p>Leo considered that. \u201cIn abstraction, not especially. With you, however ... I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy with me?\u201d</p><p>Taking a handful of her hair, Leo let the pale runners sift through his fingers, playing with it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Perhaps because I can see you as a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d Catherine had never seen herself that way.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. The practical kind who makes you eat your turnips, and scolds you for running with sharp objects.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that how your mother was?\u201d</p><p>He stretched, his feet reaching far past hers. \u201cYes. And thank God for it. My father, bless him, was a brilliant scholar one step removed from lunacy. Someone had to be sensible.\u201d Rising up on one elbow, he studied her. He used the pad of his thumb to smooth the arc of her eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t move, love, I\u2019ll get a cloth for you.\u201d</p><p>Catherine waited with her knees drawn up, watching as he left the bed and went to the washstand. He took up a cloth, dampened it with water from a jug, and cleaned himself efficiently. Taking up another cloth, he moistened it liberally and brought it to her. She sensed that he intended to perform the service for her, but she reached for the cloth and said bashfully, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Leo found his discarded clothing, pulled on his linens and trousers, and returned to Catherine bare-chested. \u201cYour spectacles,\u201d he murmured, setting them carefully on her nose. His hands were strong and warm against the humid coolness of her cheeks. Seeing the shiver that went through her, he pulled the quilt up to her shoulders, and half sat on the edge of the mattress.</p> <p>\u201cMarks,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cWhat just happened ... am I to take that as a \u2018yes\u2019 to my proposal?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and shook her head. And then she gave him a wary but resolute glance, as if to indicate that there was nothing he could do or say to change her mind.</p><p>His hand found the shape of her hip, squeezing her through the quilt. \u201cI promise it will get better for you, once you heal and have time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I enjoyed it.\u201d She paused, blushing fiercely. \u201cVery much. But we don\u2019t suit in any way other than in the bedroom. We argue so dreadfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be like that now. I\u2019ll be nice. I\u2019ll let you win every argument, even when I\u2019m right.\u201d His lips twitched with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re not convinced, I see. What are you afraid we\u2019ll argue about?\u201d</p> <p>Catherine looked down at the quilt, smoothing out a frayed seam. \u201cIt is fashionable among the peerage for the husband to take mistresses and the wife to take lovers. I could never accept that.\u201d As he opened his mouth to argue, she continued in a rush. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve never concealed your aversion to marriage. For you to change your mind so quickly ... it\u2019s impossible to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Leo\u2019s hand covered hers in a vital grip. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019ve been against the idea of marriage ever since I lost Laura. And I\u2019ve invented all kinds of excuses to keep from taking such a risk again. But I can\u2019t deny any longer that you are entirely worth it. I wouldn\u2019t propose to you unless I knew without a doubt that you could satisfy all my needs, and I could satisfy yours.\u201d He slid his fingers beneath her chin and urged her to look at him. \u201cAs for fidelity\u2014I\u2019ll have no difficulty with that.\u201d His smile turned wry. \u201cMy conscience is burdened enough with past sins\u2014I doubt it could stand any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would become bored with me,\u201d she said anxiously.</p><p>That brought a slight smile to his lips. \u201cObviously you have no idea of the prodigious variety of ways a man and woman can entertain each other. I won\u2019t be bored. Neither will you.\u201d He stroked her pink cheek with a gentle finger. His gaze was steady. \u201cIf I went to another woman\u2019s bed, it would be a betrayal of two people\u2014my wife and myself. I wouldn\u2019t do that to either of us.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve always known you to be truthful. Annoying, but truthful.\u201d</p><p>There was a glint of amusement in his eyes. \u201cThen give me your answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore I make any decisions, I would like to talk with Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A smile played on his lips. \u201cHe married my sister, now I want to marry his. If he objects, I\u2019ll tell him that it\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d</p><p>As he sat leaning over her, his dark brown hair falling over his brow, Cat could hardly believe that Leo Hathaway was trying to convince her to marry him. Although she was certain that he meant what he said, some promises were broken despite people\u2019s best intentions to keep them.</p><p>Reading her expression, Leo reached out and pulled her against his warm, hard chest. \u201cI\u2019d tell you not to be afraid,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut that\u2019s not always possible. On the other hand ... you\u2019ve already started to trust me, Marks. There\u2019s no point in stopping now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Upon learning that the private dining rooms in the tavern would be occupied for some time, Leo requested a tray to be sent up to their room, as well as a hot bath.</p><p>Catherine fell asleep beneath the quilt while waiting. She stirred and blinked as she heard the door opening, chairs being moved, the clinking of plates and flatware, the thump of a large tin washtub.</p><p>There was a warm, furry weight next to her. Dodger had crawled beneath the quilt and was snoozing beside her shoulder. As Catherine looked at him, she saw the gleam of his bright eyes and heard a tiny yawn before he resettled.</p> <p>Recalling that she was wearing only Leo\u2019s discarded shirt, Catherine hid beneath the quilt and peeked over the edge as a pair of chambermaids set out the bath. Would they suspect what had occurred between her and Leo earlier? She braced herself for a sly or accusing glance, perhaps a contemptuous giggle, but it seemed the chambermaids were too busy to care. They were nothing but businesslike as they tipped two steaming pails into the washtub, and returned with another two pails full. One of the girls set out a three-legged stool piled with folded toweling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chambermaids would have left the room without incident, except that Dodger, attracted by the scent of food, emerged from beneath the quilt. He stood tall on the bed and regarded the dinner tray on the small table, his whiskers twitching. Oh, lovely, I was getting hungry! his expression seemed to say.</p><p>As one of the maids saw Dodger, her face contorted in terror. \u201cEeeek!\u201d She pointed a plump, trembling finger at the ferret. \u201cIt\u2019s a rat, or a mouse, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a ferret,\u201d Leo explained, his tone reasonable and soothing. \u201cA harmless and highly civilized creature\u2014the favored pet of royalty, actually. Queen Elizabeth had a pet ferret, and\u2014really, there\u2019s no need for violence\u2014\u201d</p><p>The chambermaid had picked up a fireplace poker and was raising it in anticipation of an attack.</p> <p>\u201cDodger,\u201d Catherine said shortly. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Dodger slithered up to her. Before she could push him away, he licked her on the cheek in a nuzzling ferret kiss.</p><p>One of the chambermaids looked horror-struck, while the other appeared ill.</p><p>Fighting to keep a straight face, Leo gave a half-crown to each chambermaid and ushered them from the room. When the door was closed and locked, Catherine lifted the affectionate ferret from her chest and regarded him with a scowl. \u201cYou are the most troublesome creature in the world, and not at all civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Dodger.\u201d Leo set out a saucer of beef and parsnips, and the ferret streaked over to it.</p> <p>While the ferret was busy devouring his meal, Leo came to Catherine and took her face in gentle hands. He lowered his mouth to hers in a brief, warm kiss. \u201cDinner or bath first?\u201d</p><p>She was mortified to hear her stomach tighten with an audible kworr.</p><p>Leo grinned. \u201cDinner, it seems.\u201d</p><p>The meal consisted of beef rounds and mashed parsnips, and a bottle of strong red wine. Catherine ate ravenously, even swabbing the plate with a crust of bread.</p><p>Leo was an entertaining companion, telling amusing stories, gently winnowing out confidences, refilling her wine glass. In the light of the single candle that had been set on the table, his face was severely handsome, with thick lashes shadowing incandescent blue eyes.</p><p>It occurred to Catherine that this was the first meal she\u2019d ever shared alone with him. Once she would have dreaded the prospect, knowing she would have to be on her guard every second. But there was no conflict in this easy conversation. How remarkable. She almost wished that one of the Hathaway sisters were somewhere nearby, so that she could share this discovery ... Your brother and I just spent an entire meal together without arguing!</p> <p>It had begun to rain outside, the sky darkening steadily, sprinkles thickening into a steady rush that obliterated the sounds of people and horses and the activity in the carriage yard. Even dressed in the heavy robe that Leo had given her to wear, Catherine shivered and felt gooseflesh rise all over.</p><p>\u201cTime for your bath,\u201d Leo said, coming to pull her chair back.</p><p>Wondering if he intended to stay in the room, Catherine ventured, \u201cPerhaps you might allow me some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may need assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bathe myself. And I would prefer not to be watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy interest is purely aesthetic. I\u2019ll imagine you as Rembrandt\u2019s Hendrickje Bathina, wading in the waters of innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurely?\u201d she asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a very pure soul. It\u2019s only my private parts that have gotten me into trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYou may stay in the room, as long as you turn your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He went to stand by the window.</p><p>Catherine glanced at the tub with keen anticipation. She didn\u2019t think she had ever looked forward to a bath so much. After securing her hair to the top of her head, she shed the robe, the shirt, and her spectacles, placed them on the bed, and glanced cautiously at Leo, who seemed to have taken a great interest in the view of the carriage yard. He had opened the window a few inches, letting rain-scented air into the room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d she said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Although you really should discard your inhibitions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could get in the way of yielding to temptation.\u201d</p><p>She sank gingerly into the battered tub. \u201cI would say that I\u2019ve yielded quite thoroughly today.\u201d She sighed in relief as the water soothed all her intimate stings and aches.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was delighted to be of assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t assist,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are the temptation.\u201d She heard him chuckle.</p><p>Leo kept his distance as Catherine bathed, looking out at the rain. After she had washed and rinsed herself, she was so tired that she doubted her own ability to climb out of the bath. Rising on shaking legs, she fumbled to retrieve the folded toweling from the stool next to the tub.</p><p>As Catherine stepped out of the water, Leo came to her quickly and held up the toweling, wrapping it around her. Swathing her in a temporary cocoon, he held her for a moment. \u201cLet me sleep with you tonight,\u201d he said against her hair, a question in his voice.</p><p>Catherine looked up at him quizzically. \u201cWhat would you do if I refused? Arrange for another room?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI would worry about your safety if I were in a different room. I\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll share the bed.\u201d She pressed her cheek to his chest, relaxing fully in his hold. How comfortable this was, she thought in wonder. How calm and safe she felt with him. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it like this before?\u201d she asked dreamily. \u201cIf you\u2019d been the way you are now, I would never have argued with you about anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI tried being nice to you, once or twice. It didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? I never noticed.\u201d Her skin, already pink from the bath, turned a deeper shade. \u201cI was suspicious. Mistrustful. And you ... were everything I feared.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s arms tightened at the admission. He looked down at her with a pensive gaze, as if he were untangling something in his mind, approaching a new realization. The blue eyes were warmer than she had ever seen them. \u201cLet\u2019s make a bargain, Marks. From now on, instead of assuming the worst of each other, we\u2019ll try to assume the best. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded, transfixed by his gentleness. Somehow those few simple sentences seemed to have wrought a greater change between them than everything that had gone before.</p> <p>Leo released her carefully. She went to bed while he washed awkwardly in a tub that couldn\u2019t begin to accommodate a man his size. She lay and watched him drowsily, the warmth of her body gathering between the sheets of the clean, dry bed. And in spite of all the problems that awaited her, she sank into a deep sleep.</p><p>In her dreams, she went back to the day she had turned fifteen. She had been parentless for five years, living with her grandmother and Aunt Althea. Her mother had died during that time. She had never known exactly when this event occurred, having been informed well after the fact. She had asked Althea if she might visit her ailing mother, and Althea had replied that she had already died.</p><p>Even knowing that her mother had suffered a fatal wasting disease, knowing there was no hope, the news had come as a shock. Catherine had started to weep, but Althea had grown impatient and snapped, \u201cThere\u2019s no use crying. It happened long before now, and she\u2019s been in the ground since high summer.\u201d Which had left Catherine with a bewildering sense of lateness, of off-timing, like a theatergoer who had applauded at the wrong moment. She couldn\u2019t grieve properly because she had missed the appropriate opportunity for grieving.</p><p>They had lived in a small house in Marylebone, a shabby but respectable dwelling lodged between a dental surgeon\u2019s office with a replica of a set of teeth hanging from its sign, and a subscription library supported by private funds. The library was owned and run by her grandmother, who had gone there every day to work.</p><p>It had been the most tantalizing place in the world, this heavily frequented building with its vast and hidden collection of books. Catherine had stared at the place from her window, imagining how lovely it would be to browse among rooms of old volumes. Undoubtedly the air had smelled like vellum and leather and book dust, a literary perfume that filled the quiet rooms. She had told Althea that she wanted to work there one day, a declaration that had earned an odd smile from her aunt, and a promise that she undoubtedly would.</p> <p>However, despite the sign that clearly proclaimed its purpose as a library for the use of distinguished gentlemen, Catherine had gradually realized there was something wrong about the place. No one ever left with any books.</p><p>Whenever Catherine mentioned this incongruity, Althea and her grandmother became cross, the same reaction they had displayed when she asked if her father would ever return for her.</p><p>On Catherine\u2019s fifteenth birthday, she had been given two new dresses. One was blue and one white, with long skirts that had reached all the way to the floor, and waists that had fitted at her own natural waist, instead of childishly high. From now on, Aunt Althea had told her, she would put her hair up and behave as a woman. She was no longer a child. Catherine had absorbed this promotion with pride and anxiety, wondering what would be expected of her now that she had become a woman.</p><p>Althea had proceeded to explain, her long, lean face looking harder than usual, her gaze not quite able to meet Catherine\u2019s. The establishment next door, as suspected, was not a lending library. It was a house of prostitution, for which she had worked since the age of twelve. It was an easy enough occupation, she assured Catherine ... let the man do as he pleased, turn your mind elsewhere, and take his money. No matter what his desires or how he used your body, there was relatively little discomfort as long as you didn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Catherine had said, turning ashen as she realized why the advice was being given.</p><p>Althea had raised her plucked, arched brows. \u201cWhat else do you think you\u2019re fit for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything but that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutton-headed girl, do you know how much we\u2019ve spent on your upkeep? Do you have any idea what a sacrifice it was to take you on? Of course not\u2014you think it was owed to you. But now it\u2019s time to repay. You\u2019re not being asked to do anything that I haven\u2019t done. Do you think you\u2019re better than me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Catherine said, shamed tears slipping from her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach one of us is born for a purpose, my dear.\u201d Althea\u2019s voice was calm, even kind. \u201cSome people are born into privilege, some are blessed with artistic talent or natural intelligence. You, unfortunately, are average in every regard ... average intellect, average wit, and no distinguishable talent. You have inherited beauty, however, and a whore\u2019s nature. Therefore, we know what your purpose is, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Catherine flinched. She tried to sound composed, but her voice shook. \u201cBeing average in most regards doesn\u2019t mean I have the makings of a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deceiving yourself, child. You are the product of two families of faithless women. Your mother was incapable of being constant to anyone. Men found her irresistible, and she could never resist being wanted. And as for our side ... your great-grandmother was a procuress, and she trained her daughter in the business. Then it was my turn, and now it is yours. Of all the girls who work for us, you will be the most fortunate. You won\u2019t be hired out to any man who comes off the street. You\u2019ll be the luminary of our little business. One man at a time, for a negotiated period. You\u2019ll last much longer that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No matter how Catherine resisted, she had soon found herself being sold to Guy, Lord Latimer. He had been as alien to her as all men were, with his sour breath and scratchy face and crawling hands. Trying to kiss her, forcing his hands into the openings of her clothes, tearing at her like a gamekeeper plucking a dead grouse. He had been amused by her struggles, grunting in her ear about what he was going to do to her, and she had loathed him, loathed all men.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you ... if you don\u2019t fight me...\u201d Latimer had said, grabbing her hands, forcing them down to his groin. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it. Your little quim knows what\u2019s what, I\u2019ll show you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t touch me, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She woke up sobbing, straining pitifully against a hard chest. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCat. It\u2019s me. Hush, it\u2019s me.\u201d A warm hand moved over her back.</p><p>She went still, her wet cheek pressed to a soft mat of hair. The sound of his voice was deep and familiar. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was just a nightmare. It\u2019s over. Let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>Her head was pounding. She felt shaky and ill, and ice-cold with shame. Leo cuddled her against his chest. As he felt the way she trembled, he smoothed her hair repeatedly. \u201cWhat were you dreaming of?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with a shuddery sound.</p> <p>\u201cIt had to do with Latimer, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>After a long hesitation, she cleared her throat and replied, \u201cPartly.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her shrinking back in soothing circles, and his lips moved to her damp cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll come after you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSomething worse.\u201d</p><p>Very gently he asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, Catherine curled into a ball, facing the opposite direction. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m sorry for waking you.\u201d</p> <p>Leo fit himself against her spoon fashion. She quivered at the sensation of warmth applied all along her back, long hairy legs tucked up beneath hers, a muscular arm thrown across her. All the textures and scents and pulses of him were wrapped around her, his breath falling on her neck. What an extraordinary creature a man was.</p><p>It was wrong to take such pleasure in this. Everything Althea had said about her was probably true. She had a whore\u2019s nature, a craving for masculine attention ... she was indeed her mother\u2019s daughter. She had repressed and ignored that side of herself for years. But now it was being shown to her, as surely as a reflection in a looking glass. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like her,\u201d she whispered without thinking.</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>His hand settled on her hip. \u201cYour brother gave me the strong impression that you were definitely not like her.\u201d He paused. \u201cIn what way are you afraid of being similar?\u201d</p><p>Catherine was silent, her breath wavering as she tried not to choke on a new surge of tears. He was undoing her with this newfound tenderness. She would have much preferred the old mocking Leo. It seemed she had no defenses against this one.</p><p>He pressed a kiss into the hollow behind her ear. \u201cMy dear girl,\u201d he whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you feel guilty for having enjoyed sexual relations?\u201d</p><p>It unnerved her further that he had reached an accurate conclusion so quickly. \u201cPerhaps a little,\u201d she said, her voice catching.</p> <p>\u201cGood God, I\u2019m in bed with a puritan.\u201d Leo uncoiled her stiff body and spread her out beneath him, ignoring her protest. \u201cWhy is it wrong for a woman to enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you, then?\u201d His voice was gently sardonic. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the fourth generation of a family of prostitutes. And my aunt said I had a natural proclivity for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone does, love. It\u2019s how the world is populated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for that. For prostitution.\u201d</p><p>He snorted derisively. \u201cThere is no such thing as a natural proclivity for selling oneself. Prostitution is forced on women by a society that allows them damned few options to support themselves. And as for you ... I\u2019ve never met a woman less equipped for it.\u201d He played with the tangled runners of her hair. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t follow your logic. It\u2019s no sin to enjoy a man\u2019s touch, nor does that have anything to do with prostitution. Anything your aunt told you was pure manipulation\u2014for obvious reasons.\u201d His mouth lowered to her neck, pressing kisses along the taut surface. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you feeling guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s so misguided.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cMorality isn\u2019t misguided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. There\u2019s the problem. You have morality, guilt, and pleasure all mixed together.\u201d His hand went to her breast, cupping tenderly. The sensation shot to the pit of her stomach. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing moral about denying pleasure, and nothing wrong about wanting it.\u201d She felt him smile against her skin. \u201cWhat you need is to indulge in several long nights of uncivilized lust with me. It would drive all the guilt out of you. And if that didn\u2019t work, at least I would be happy.\u201d His hand swept down her body, his thumb brushing the top edge of intimate curls. Her belly tightened beneath his palm. His fingers trailed deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHelping you with your problem. No, don\u2019t thank me, it\u2019s no trouble at all.\u201d His smiling mouth brushed against hers, and he moved over her in the darkness. \u201cWhat word do you use for this, love?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this sweet place ... here.\u201d</p><p>Her body jerked at his gentle caress.

But the French, not surprisingly, have the nicest one. Le chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cat?\u201d she asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cYes, a double meaning for a feline and a woman\u2019s softest part. Puss. Pussy. The sweetest fur ... no, don\u2019t be shy. Ask me to pet you.\u201d</p><p>The words stole her breath away. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she protested faintly.</p><p>\u201cAsk and I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he prompted, his fingers withdrawing to play in the sensitive hollow behind her knee.</p><p>She swallowed back a moan.</p><p>\u201cAsk,\u201d came his coaxing whisper.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Leo kissed her thigh, his mouth soft and hot, his bristle an exciting scrape against the tender skin. \u201cPlease what?\u201d</p><p>Wicked man. She squirmed and covered her face with her hands, even though they were in complete darkness. Her voice was muffled by the screen of her fingers. \u201cPlease pet me there.\u201d</p><p>His touch came so lightly she could scarcely feel it at first, fingertips stirring, teasing. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh yes...\u201d Her h*ps lifted, inviting more. He fingered the folds of her sex, massaging delicately, tracing the softness within. The skillful caresses brought her body to trembling readiness.</p><p>\u201cWhat else should I do?\u201d Leo whispered, moving lower in the darkness. She felt his breath on her, heat against moisture, a soft intermittent blowing. Her h*ps arched and strained without volition.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>He sounded gently regretful. \u201cNo, you\u2019re too sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cShall I kiss you instead? Here?\u201d His fingertip swirled.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s eyes widened in the darkness. Stunned and acutely aroused by the suggestion, she licked her dry lips. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She writhed as she felt him breathe against her, his fingers gently holding her apart. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk me nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk you to ... Oh, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The teasing fingers left her. \u201cShall we go to sleep, then?\u201d</p><p>She caught his head in her hands. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He was inexorable. \u201cYou know how to ask.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. The shamed syllables stuck in her throat, and she could only moan in frustration.</p><p>And Leo, the monstrous cad, smothered a chuckle against her thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you find this amusing,\u201d she said furiously.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he assured her, his voice thick with laughter. \u201cOh, Marks, we have so far to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d she snapped, trying to move away, but he pinned her legs in place, holding her easily.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be stubborn,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cGo on, say it. For me.\u201d</p><p>A long silence passed. She swallowed and made herself say, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown there,\u201d she managed, her voice shaking. \u201cOn my pu**y. Please.\u201d</p><p>Leo fairly purred in approval. \u201cWhat a naughty girl you are.\u201d His head lowered, and he nuzzled into the damp softness, and she felt his mouth cover the most sensitive part of her in a wet, open kiss, and the world caught fire.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you wanted?\u201d she heard him ask.</p><p>\u201cMore, more,\u201d she cried, gasping.</p><p>His tongue traced her in fluid, savoring strokes. Her body drew taut as he began to tug and flick, and the voluptuous expanding pleasure went all through her. She was suffused in wet sensation, each slide of his tongue opening her to greater pleasure. His hands cupped beneath her, making a vessel of her hips, tilting her to meet his mouth. She convulsed in raw shudders, crying out, her nerves dancing with exquisite heat. His mouth lingered softly, as if he were reluctant to stop. For a scalding moment she felt his tongue enter her, teasing out a last few quivers.</p><p>She was soon chilled as rain-scented air from the partially open window swept over her skin. She thought Leo would satisfy his own needs then, and she moved toward him in exhausted confusion. But he settled her in the crook of his arm and pulled the quilts over them both. She was replete and enervated, unable to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she heard him whisper. \u201cAnd if you have any more nightmares ... I\u2019ll kiss them all away.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The rainy night had yielded to a damp green morning. Leo awakened to the sounds of the carriage yard coming alive with the whicker and jangling and stomping of horses. A muffled clatter of footsteps advanced along the hallways as people left their rooms and went to the tavern for food.</p><p>Leo\u2019s favorite part of a romantic rendezvous had always been the moments of anticipation right before lovemaking. His least favorite part had been the morning after, when his first waking thought was how quickly he could leave without causing offense.</p><p>This morning, however, was different from any other. He had opened his eyes to discover that he was in bed with Catherine Marks, and there was nowhere else in the world he wanted to be. She was still sleeping deeply, on her side with her hand palm up. Her fingers were curled like the edges of an orchid. She was beautiful in the morning, tumbled and relaxed and sleep-flushed.</p><p>His fascinated gaze traveled over her. He had never confided so much in any woman, but he knew that his secrets were safe with her. And hers with him. They were well matched. No matter what happened now, their days of battling were over. They knew too much about each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unfortunately, the question of their betrothal was not at all settled. Leo knew that Cat was not nearly as convinced of the rightness of their match as he was. Furthermore, Harry Rutledge was going to have an opinion about it, and so far Leo had rarely liked his opinions. It was even possible that Harry might encourage Cat in her idea of traveling the Continent.</p><p>A frown tugged at Leo\u2019s brow as he pondered how she had gone through life virtually unprotected until now. How could a woman so deserving of affection have received so little? He wanted to make up for everything she had missed. He wanted to give her whatever she had been deprived of. The trick would be convincing her to let him.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s face was peaceful, her lips slightly parted. Curled among the white bed linens, a glimpse of her pink shoulder visible, that golden hair streaming everywhere, she looked like a confection placed amid swirls of whipped cream.</p><p>There was a disturbance at the foot of the bed as Dodger hoisted himself up to the corner of the mattress and crept along Catherine\u2019s side. She stirred and yawned, and fumbled to pet him. The ferret curled by her hip and closed his eyes.</p> <p>Catherine awakened slowly, her body lengthening in a trembling stretch. Her lashes lifted. She looked at Leo in bewilderment, clearly wondering why he should be there with her. It was a stare of disarming innocence, those lovely sea-gray eyes contemplating him while her mind collected itself. Hesitantly she reached a cool hand to his cheek, investigating the bristle that had grown during the night. Her voice was low and wondering. \u201cYou\u2019re as scratchy as Beatrix\u2019s hedgehog.\u201d</p><p>Leo kissed her palm.</p><p>Catherine nestled against him cautiously. Her breath stirred the hair on his chest as she asked, \u201cAre we going to London today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cDo you still want to marry me?\u201d she asked abruptly.</p> <p>He kept her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m going to insist on it.\u201d</p><p>Her face was angled so that he couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cBut ... I\u2019m not like Laura.\u201d</p><p>Leo was somewhat startled by the comment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said frankly. Laura had been the product of a loving family, an idyllic life in a small village. She had known nothing like the fear and pain that had shaped Catherine\u2019s childhood. \u201cYou resemble Laura no more than I resemble the boy I was then,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow is that relevant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you would be better off with someone like her. Someone you\u2014\u201d She stopped herself.</p><p>Leo turned and braced himself on an elbow, looking down into myopic blue-gray eyes. \u201cSomeone I love?\u201d he finished for her, and watched her frown and chew her lower lip uncertainly. He wanted to gently bite and suck that perfect little mouth as if it were a fresh plum. Instead he traced the edge of her lower lip with a gentle fingertip. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, I love like a madman,\u201d he said. \u201cImmoderate, jealous, possessive ... I\u2019m absolutely intolerable.\u201d</p><p>He let the backs of his fingers glide over her chin and along the front of her throat, where he felt the swift tattoo of her heartbeat and the flutter of her swallow. No stranger to the signs of feminine arousal, he slid his palm over the front of her body, skimming the hard bud of her nipple, the curve of her side. \u201cIf I loved you, Cat, I would have you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You\u2019d never have any peace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would set limits. And make you heed them.\u201d She drew a sharp breath as he pulled the sheet away from her. \u201cYou want a firm hand, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed by the disturbance, Dodger slid off the bed indignantly and went to hop into Catherine\u2019s carpetbag.</p><p>Leo nuzzled the warm curve of her breast and stroked the tip with his tongue. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, catching her hand, drawing it down to his hard flesh.</p><p>\u201cI ... I didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But I\u2019m a terribly literal-minded person.\u201d He showed her how to grip and stroke him, guiding her in the ways he liked to be touched. They lay together in the warm bed, both of them breathing fast as she explored him with delicate pale fingers. How many times Leo had fantasized about this moment, the prim and prudish Marks na**d in bed with him. It was glorious.</p><p>Her hand tightened on his stiff length, and the delicious pressure nearly sent him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cGod ... no, no, wait...\u201d He pried her hand away with a gasping laugh.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Catherine asked anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all, love. But one rather hopes to last more than five minutes, especially before the lady is satisfied.\u201d He reached for her br**sts, kneading gently. \u201cHow beautiful you are. Bring yourself higher and let me kiss your breast.\u201d As she hesitated, he closed his thumb and forefinger over her nipple in a playful pinch.</p><p>She jerked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cToo hard?\u201d Leo asked contritely, his gaze intent on her face. \u201cThen do as I asked, and I\u2019ll soothe it.\u201d He didn\u2019t miss her quick double-blink, or the altered rhythm of her breathing. Reaching out, he drew his hands slowly over the slender curves of her body, learning more about her by the second.</p><p>\u201cYou are intolerable,\u201d she told him unevenly. But she obeyed the encouraging pressure of his palms, and climbed slowly over him. She was light and supple, her skin like silk, the blond thatch of curls brushing crisply against his stomach.</p><p>The peak of her breast was already tightly contracted as Leo took it into his mouth. He played with her, dragging the flat of his tongue across the gathered point, relishing the helpless sounds that climbed in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he said, slipping a hand behind her neck, pulling her mouth to his. \u201cAnd rest your h*ps on mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop giving orders,\u201d she protested breathlessly.</p><p>On impulse, Leo decided to provoke her. He let an arrogant smile touch his lips. \u201cHere in bed, I\u2019m the master. I\u2019ll give orders, and you\u2019ll follow them without question.\u201d He paused deliberately, lifting his brows. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p><p>Catherine stiffened. Leo had never enjoyed anything so much as the sight of her struggling between outrage and arousal. He felt the heat rise in her, the excited thrum of her pulse. She took an agitated breath, while gooseflesh rose on her arms. And then her body seemed to lose all its tension, her limbs loosening. \u201cYes,\u201d she finally whispered, not quite able to meet his gaze.</p><p>Leo\u2019s own heartbeat escalated. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cNow spread your thighs so I can feel you against me.\u201d</p><p>Gradually the angle of her legs widened.</p><p>She looked dazed, a little lost, her gaze turning inward as if to contemplate the puzzle of her own reactions to him. Her eyes glittered, an involuntary welling of pleasure and confusion, and the sight sent a tide of lust through him. He wanted to fulfill her beyond imagining, discover and satisfy every need.</p><p>\u201cPut your hand beneath your breast,\u201d he said, \u201cand bring it to my mouth.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him to obey, trembling. And then he was the one who was lost, fiercely absorbed in the sweet softness of her. He lost awareness of everything but instinct, the primitive intent to claim, conquer, possess.</p><p>He made her kneel over him, and he followed the intoxicating salt-scented moisture to the tender entrance of her body. Delving with his tongue, he traced and licked until he felt the long, fine muscles of her thighs tightening rhythmically.</p><p>With a hoarse murmur, Leo eased her away and helped her to straddle his hips. He fit himself against the soft slit and clasped her waist to steady her. She quivered as she understood what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d he murmured as she eased onto him. \u201cAll the way down.\u201d He barely managed to stifle an agonized groan as he felt her clenching around him, her swollen flesh working to pull him inside. Nothing had ever felt so good. \u201cOh, sweet Jesus ... take it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She writhed and went still, looking disgruntled.</p><p>It was inconceivable that Leo should have found any amusement in the moment, when his body was tortured with desire. But she was so adorably awkward astride him. Somehow managing to repress a laugh, Leo put his shaking hands on her, arranging and stroking. \u201cYou can,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cPut your hands on my shoulders, and lean your sweet little body forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the experienced one. You\u2019re the novice, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re too ... oh.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in the midst of their debate, he had pressed upward the last crucial distance, and their bodies slid together fully.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said again, her eyes half closing, new color sweeping over her.</p><p>Leo felt an explosive cl**ax rolling up to him, requiring only a hint of stimulation to reach irresistible momentum. Catherine\u2019s body tightened around him, a voluptuously contained rhythm that threatened to drive him mad. She moved tentatively, the tender friction causing them both to shudder.</p><p>\u201cCat, wait,\u201d he whispered through dry lips.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t...\u201d She moved again, and he arched as if on a torture rack.</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d But she had begun to rock against him instinctively, and he groaned and took up the rhythm, watching her lips parting with delighted gasps, and as he felt the spasms overtake her, the sensations rushed too powerfully for him to withstand.</p><p>With a herculean effort, Leo withdrew and spilled his pleasure on the sheets, while his breath hissed through his clenched teeth. Every muscle screamed in protest at being deprived of the lush warmth that had enclosed him. Panting, blinking against a shower of sparks, Leo felt Catherine curl up against him.</p><p>One of her hands came to the center of his chest, pressing over his pounding heart. She pressed her lips to his shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to stop,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her, and smiled ruefully against her hair. \u201cBut that\u2019s the problem with coitus interruptus. One always has to exit at the station before one\u2019s final destination.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Leo proposed twice more to Catherine on the way to London. She refused both times, determined to proceed in a sensible manner and discuss the situation with her brother first. When Leo pointed out that running harum-scarum from Ramsay House in the middle of the night could hardly be characterized as sensible behavior, she allowed that perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have acted so impetuously.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I dislike to admit it,\u201d she told Leo as their carriage rolled along the post road, \u201cI haven\u2019t been in my right mind since the ball. It was a shock to see Lord Latimer so unexpectedly. And when he put his hands on me, I felt myself shrink down to a frightened child again, and all I could think of was getting away.\u201d She paused reflectively. \u201cBut I found comfort in knowing I had Harry to run to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also had me,\u201d Leo said quietly.</p><p>She stared at him in wonder. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze held hers. \u201cYou know it now.\u201d</p><p>Let me be your big brother, Harry had told Catherine at their last meeting in Hampshire, making it clear that he wanted to attempt the kind of familial relationship they had never been capable of before. With no small amount of unease, Catherine reflected that she was about to test his claim far sooner than either of them could have expected. And they were still practically strangers.</p><p>But Harry had altered greatly during the short time of his marriage to Poppy. He was far kinder and warmer now, and certainly willing to think of Catherine as something more than an inconvenient half sister who didn\u2019t belong anywhere.</p><p>Upon arriving at the Rutledge Hotel, Leo and Catherine were shown immediately to the sumptuous private apartments that Harry and Poppy shared.</p> <p>Of all the Hathaways, Poppy was the one Catherine had always felt the most comfortable with. Poppy was a warm and talkative young woman who loved order and routine. Hers was an essentially sunny and accepting nature, providing a necessary balance to Harry\u2019s driven intensity.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d she exclaimed, embracing her, then standing back to view her with concern. \u201cWhy are you here? Is something wrong? Is everyone well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family is quite well,\u201d Catherine said hastily. \u201cBut there was ... a situation. I had to leave.\u201d Her throat became very tight.</p><p>Poppy looked at Leo with a frown. \u201cDid you do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause if there is trouble of any kind, you\u2019re usually involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But this time I\u2019m not the problem, I\u2019m the solution.\u201d</p><p>Harry approached them, his green eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you\u2019re the solution, Ramsay, I\u2019m terrified to hear the problem.\u201d He gave Cat an alert glance, and astonished her by bringing her against him in a protective embrace. \u201cWhat is it, Cat?\u201d he asked near her ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry,\u201d she faltered, \u201cLord Latimer came to the ball at Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>He understood everything from that one sentence. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Catherine closed her eyes and let out a slow sigh. \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were right to come to me. We\u2019ll manage it together.\u201d Harry raised his head and glanced at Leo. \u201cPresumably Cat has told you about Latimer.\u201d</p><p>Leo looked grim. \u201cBelieve me, had I known anything about the situation before, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anywhere near her.\u201d</p><p>Harry kept Catherine in the crook of his arm as he turned to face Leo fully. \u201cWhy was the bastard invited to Ramsay House in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family was invited as a courtesy befitting their social position in Hampshire. He came in their stead. After he tried to force himself on Marks, I booted him from the premises. He won\u2019t be returning.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes gleamed dangerously. \u201cI\u2019ll put a word in the right ear. By tomorrow evening he\u2019ll wish he were dead.\u201d</p><p>Catherine felt a nervous pang in her stomach. Harry was a man of extensive influence. As well as his hotel dealings, he had access to a great quantity of highly confidential and valuable information. What Harry kept in his head could probably have been used to start wars, fell kingdoms, destroy families, and dismantle the British financial system.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to have Lord Latimer butchered or maimed, you\u2019re going to have to think of something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Harry\u2019s plan,\u201d Leo said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up for debate,\u201d Poppy informed him. \u201cCome, let\u2019s sit and discuss reasonable alternatives.\u201d She looked at Catherine. \u201cYou must be famished after traveling so far. I\u2019ll ring for tea and sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for me, thank you,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she wants sandwiches,\u201d Leo interrupted. \u201cShe had only bread and tea for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Catherine protested. He answered her annoyed glance with an implacable one.</p><p>It was a new experience, having someone care about the mundane details of her welfare, having him notice what she\u2019d eaten for breakfast. She examined the feeling, tested it, and found it strangely alluring, even as she resisted the idea of being told what to do. The small interaction was similar to a thousand instances she had seen between Cam and Amelia, or Merripen and Win, the way they occasionally fussed over each other. Cared for each other.</p><p>After tea was sent for, Poppy returned to the private parlor. Sitting beside Catherine on the velvet-covered settee, Poppy said, \u201cTell us what happened, dear. Did Lord Latimer approach you early in the evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the ball had been under way for some time...\u201d</p><p>Catherine relayed the events of the evening in a matter-of-fact manner, her hands clenched in her lap. \u201cThe problem is,\u201d she said, \u201cthat no matter how we try to keep Lord Latimer quiet about the past, he will make it public. A scandal is coming, and nothing will stop it. The best way to throw water on the flames is for me to disappear again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new name, a new identity?\u201d Harry asked, and shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t run forever, Cat. We\u2019ll stand and confront it this time\u2014together\u2019as we should have done years ago.\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose, turning various options over in his mind. \u201cI\u2019ll start by acknowledging you publicly as my sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Catherine felt herself turn ashen. People would be ravenously curious when they learned that the mysterious Harry Rutledge had a long-lost sister. She was fairly certain she wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the scrutiny and the questions.</p><p>\u201cPeople would recognize me as the Hathaways\u2019 governess,\u201d she said in a suffocated voice. \u201cThey would ask why the sister of a wealthy hotelier would have accepted such a position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make of it what they will,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t reflect well on you.\u201d</p> <p>Leo spoke dryly. \u201cWith your brother\u2019s associations, Marks, he\u2019s accustomed to unflattering rumors.\u201d</p><p>The familiar way he had addressed her caused Harry\u2019s eyes to narrow. \u201cI find it interesting,\u201d he said to Catherine, \u201cthat you came to London with Ramsay as your traveling companion. When was it decided that the two of you would depart together? And what hour did you leave last night, to reach London by noon?\u201d</p><p>All the color that had left Catherine\u2019s face earlier now came rushing back at a surplus. \u201cI ... he...\u201d She glanced at Leo, who had adopted an expression of innocent interest, as if he too wanted to hear her explanation. \u201cI left by myself yesterday morning,\u201d she managed to say, dragging her gaze back to Harry.</p><p>Harry leaned forward, a scowl gathering on his face. \u201cYesterday morning? Where did you spend the night?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and tried to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cA coaching inn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea how dangerous those places are for a woman alone? Have you taken leave of your senses? When I think of what could have happened to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>Harry stared at him incredulously.</p><p>It was one of those silences that was far more eloquent than words. One could almost see Harry\u2019s brain working like the elaborate mechanisms he liked to construct in his spare time. One could also see the moment at which he reached an accurate and highly unwelcome conclusion.</p><p>Harry spoke to Leo in a tone that chilled Catherine to the bone. \u201cEven you wouldn\u2019t take advantage of a frightened and vulnerable woman who had just suffered an upheaval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never given a damn about her,\u201d Leo replied. \u201cWhy should you start now?\u201d</p> <p>Harry rose to his feet, his fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Poppy murmured. \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you share a room with her?\u201d Harry demanded of Leo. \u201cA bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your bloody business, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when it\u2019s my sister and you were supposed to be protecting her, not molesting her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Catherine broke in, \u201che didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rarely disposed to listen to a lecture on morality,\u201d Leo said to Harry, \u201cwhen it\u2019s given by someone who knows even less about it than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d Harry said, his gaze fastened on Leo as if he were contemplating murder. \u201cYou and Cat need to leave the room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy must I leave when I\u2019m the subject of discussion?\u201d Catherine demanded. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Catherine,\u201d Poppy said quietly, heading to the door. \u201cLet them bluster and brawl in their manly fashion. You and I will go somewhere to discuss your future sensibly.\u201d</p><p>This struck Catherine as an excellent idea. She followed Poppy from the room, while Harry and Leo continued to glare at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>Harry\u2019s face went blank. \u201cYou despise each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she accepted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. She wants to discuss it with you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Because I\u2019ll tell her that it\u2019s the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Leo arched a brow. \u201cYou doubt I could protect her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you could keep from murdering each other! I doubt she could ever be happy in such volatile circumstances. I doubt ... no, I won\u2019t bother listing all my concerns, it would take too bloody long.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes were ice-cold. \u201cThe answer is no, Ramsay. I\u2019ll do what is necessary to take care of Cat. You can return to Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be that easy to get rid of me,\u201d Leo said. \u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t notice that I haven\u2019t asked for your permission. There is no choice. Certain things have happened that can\u2019t be undone. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He saw from Harry\u2019s expression that only a few fragile constraints stood between him and certain death.</p><p>\u201cYou seduced her deliberately,\u201d Harry managed to say.</p><p>\u201cWould you be happier if I claimed it was an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that would make me happy is to weight you with rocks and toss you into the Thames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I even sympathize. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to face a man who\u2019s compromised your sister, how difficult it would be to keep from murdering him on the spot. Oh, but wait...\u201d Leo tapped a forefinger thoughtfully on his chin. \u201cI can imagine. Because I went through it two bloody months ago.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the same. Your sister was still a virgin when I married her.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave him an unrepentant glance. \u201cWhen I compromise a woman, I do it properly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat does it,\u201d Harry muttered, leaping for his throat.</p><p>They crashed to the floor, rolling and grappling.

They rolled twice, exchanging blows, aiming for the throat, the kidneys, the solar plexus, in the kind of fight that usually took place in East End slum alleys.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t win this one, Rutledge,\u201d Leo panted as they broke apart and lurched to their feet. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your prick-me-dainty fencing partners.\u201d He dodged a hard right and took a jab of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve fought my way in and out of every gaming hell and tavern in London\u2014\u201d He faked a jab with his left and followed with a swift right hook, making a satisfying impact with Harry\u2019s jaw. \u201cAnd aside from all that, I live with Merripen, who has a left uppercut like a kick from a mule\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever stop talking?\u201d Harry threw a counterpunch and stepped back before Leo could retaliate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called communication. You ought to try it sometime.\u201d Exasperated, Leo dropped his guard and stood there undefended. \u201cEspecially with your sister. Have you ever bothered to listen to her? Damn it, man, she came to London hoping for some kind of brotherly counsel or consolation, and the first thing you do is send her from the room.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s fists lowered. He pinned Leo with a damning glare, but when he spoke, his voice was heavy with self-condemnation. \u201cI\u2019ve failed her for years. Do you think I\u2019m unaware of all that I could have done for her but didn\u2019t? I\u2019ll do anything possible to atone. But damn you, Ramsay ... the last thing she needed in this situation was for her innocence to be taken when she couldn\u2019t defend herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what she needed.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head in disbelief. \u201cDamn you.\u201d He scrubbed a hand through his black hair, and gave a peculiar strangled laugh. \u201cI hate arguing with a Hathaway. You all say something lunatic as if it\u2019s perfectly logical. Is it too early for brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m feeling far too sober for this conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Harry went to a sideboard and pulled out two glasses. \u201cWhile I pour,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can explain why being deflowered by you was so bloody beneficial to my sister.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging out of his coat, Leo draped it over the back of his chair and sat. \u201cMarks has been isolated and alone for much too long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been alone, she\u2019s been living with the Hathaways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, she\u2019s stayed at the edges of the family with her nose pressed against the window, like some Dickensian orphan. A false name, drab clothes, dyed hair ... she\u2019s concealed her identity for so long that she hardly knows who she is. But the real Catherine emerges when she\u2019s with me. We\u2019ve gotten beneath each other\u2019s guards. We speak the same language, if you take my meaning.\u201d Leo paused, staring into the glowing swirl of his brandy. \u201cMarks is a contradictory woman, and yet the more I know her, the more the contradictions make sense. She\u2019s spent too long in the shadows. No matter how she tries to convince herself otherwise, she wants to belong somewhere, with someone. And yes, she wants a man in her bed. Me in particular.\u201d Taking the brandy that Harry handed to him, Leo tossed back a swallow. \u201cShe\u2019ll thrive with me. Not because I\u2019m a stellar example of virtuous manhood, nor have I ever claimed to be. But I\u2019m right for her. I\u2019m not cowed by her sharp tongue, and she can\u2019t outmaneuver me. And she knows it.\u201d</p><p>Harry sat nearby and drank his own brandy. He watched Leo pensively, on one level trying to assess his sincerity, on another judging his veracity. \u201cWhat would you get from this arrangement?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cAs I understand, you need to marry and sire a child rather soon. If Cat doesn\u2019t succeeded in bearing a son, the Hathaways will lose Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived many things far worse than losing a bloody house. I\u2019ll marry Marks and take the risk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re testing the waters,\u201d Harry said, his face expressionless. \u201cTrying to determine if she\u2019s fertile before you marry her.\u201d</p><p>Instantly offended, Leo forced himself to remember that he was dealing with the legitimate concern of a brother for a sister. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if she\u2019s fertile or not,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cIf it will settle your concerns, we\u2019ll wait however long it will take to make the copyhold clause irrelevant. I want her regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about what Cat wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to her. As for dealing with Latimer\u2014I\u2019ve already made him aware that I have leverage against him. I\u2019ll use it if he starts to make trouble. But the best protection I can offer her is my name.\u201d Finishing his brandy, Leo set the empty snifter aside. \u201cWhat do you know of this grandmother and aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old crone died not long ago. The aunt, Althea Hutchins, runs the place now. I sent my assistant Valentine to take inventory of the situation, and he returned looking somewhat sickened. Apparently in a bid to revive business, Mrs. Hutchins turned it into a whipping brothel, where any number of depravities are catered to. The unfortunate women who work there are usually too well worn to be employed at other brothels.\u201d Harry finished his brandy. \u201cIt seems the aunt is ailing, most likely from some untreated bawdy-house disease.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo looked at him alertly. \u201cHave you told Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s never asked.

Of things Althea said to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head. \u201cShe told me in confidence.\u201d He smiled faintly at Harry\u2019s obvious annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her for years, Rutledge\u2014what in God\u2019s name did you talk about when you were together? Taxes? The weather?\u201d He stood and picked up his coat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to arrange for a room.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, where else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the terrace you usually lease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClosed away for the summer. But even if it weren\u2019t, I\u2019d still stay here.\u201d Leo smiled slightly. \u201cConsider it yet another chance to experience the joys of a close family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a far greater joy when the family stayed in bloody Hampshire,\u201d Harry said as Leo left the apartment.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cHarry was right about something,\u201d Poppy told Catherine as they walked through the gardens at the back of the hotel.</p><p>In contrast to the modern preference for the romantic appearance in gardening\u2014unstructured, with beds of blossoms that appeared to have sprung up spontaneously, and paths laid out in meandering curves\u2014the Rutledge gardens were orderly and grand. Disciplined hedges formed walls that guided one through a careful arrangement of fountains, statuary, parterres, and elaborate flower beds.</p> <p>\u201cIt is definitely time,\u201d Poppy continued, \u201cfor Harry to introduce you to people as his sister. And for you to be known by your real name. What is it, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine Wigens.\u201d</p><p>Poppy considered that. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s only because I\u2019ve always known you as Miss Marks ... but I like Marks better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. Catherine Wigens was a frightened girl in difficult circumstances. I\u2019ve been much happier as Catherine Marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappier?\u201d Poppy asked gently. \u201cOr merely less frightened?\u201d</p><p>Catherine smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve learned quite a lot about happiness over the past few years. I found peace at school, although I was too quiet and private to make friends there. It wasn\u2019t until I came to work for the Hathaways that I saw the day-to-day interactions of people who love each other. And then in the past year, I\u2019ve finally experienced moments of true joy. The feeling that at least for the moment, everything is as it should be, and there\u2019s nothing else one could ask for.\u201d</p><p>Poppy sent her a smiling glance. \u201cMoments such as...?\u201d</p><p>They entered the rose garden, filled with a profusion of blossoms, the air heavy with sun-warmed perfume.</p> <p>\u201cEvenings in the parlor, when the family was together and Win was reading. Going on walks with Beatrix. Or that rainy day in Hampshire when we all had a picnic on the veranda. Or\u2014\u201d She broke off, shaken by the realization of what she had been about to say.</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d Poppy prompted, pausing to examine a large and resplendent rose, inhaling its scent. Her astute gaze darted to Catherine\u2019s face.</p><p>It was difficult to express her most personal thoughts, but Catherine forced herself to admit the uncomfortable truth. \u201cAfter Lord Ramsay hurt his shoulder at the old manor ruins ... he was in bed with fever the next day ... and I sat with him for hours. We talked while I did the mending, and I read Balzac to him.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled. \u201cLeo must have loved that. He adores French literature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me about the time he spent in France. He said the French have a marvelous way of uncomplicating things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he needed that very much. When Leo went to France with Win, he was a wreck of a man. You wouldn\u2019t have known him. We didn\u2019t know whom to fear for more, Win with her weak lungs, or Leo, who was bent on destroying himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they came back well,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cYes, both of them were finally well. But different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and also the struggles they\u2019d been through. Win told me that one isn\u2019t improved by being at the top of the mountain, one is improved by the climb.\u201d</p><p>Catherine smiled as she thought of Win, whose patient fortitude had carried her through years of illness. \u201cThat sounds exactly like her,\u201d she said. \u201cPerceptive. And strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo is like that too,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIt\u2019s only that he\u2019s far more irreverent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cynical,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cYes, cynical ... but also playful. Perhaps it\u2019s an odd combination of qualities, but there\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s smile lingered. There were so many images of Leo in her mind ... patiently rescuing a hedgehog that had fallen into a fencepost hole ... working on a set of plans for a new tenant house, his face severe with concentration ... lying wounded on his bed, his eyes glazed with pain as he murmured, I\u2019m too much for you to manage.</p><p>No, she had replied, you\u2019re not.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d Poppy said hesitantly, \u201cthe fact that Leo came to London with you ... I wonder if ... that is, I hope ... is there a betrothal in the making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has offered for me,\u201d Catherine admitted, \u201cbut I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas he?\u201d Poppy astonished her with an enthusiastic embrace. \u201cOh, it\u2019s too good to be true!

But in time you will, I\u2019m sure of it. There is so much about him worth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of love,\u201d Catherine said with a slight grimace.</p> <p>\u201cMarriage isn\u2019t a question of love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is, of course, but I meant to say that love cannot overcome certain difficulties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do love him?\u201d Poppy asked hopefully.</p><p>Catherine turned deep red. \u201cThere are many qualities I esteem in Lord Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he makes you happy, you said so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, on that one day, I\u2019ll admit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018A moment of true joy,\u2019 was how you put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, Poppy, I feel as if I\u2019m being interrogated.\u201d</p><p>Poppy grinned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just that I want this match so very much. For Leo\u2019s sake, and yours, and for the family.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s dry voice came from behind them. \u201cIt appears we\u2019re at cross-purposes, my love.\u201d The women turned as he approached them. Harry regarded his wife warmly, but there was an air of preoccupation about him. \u201cThe tea and sandwiches are waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the brawl is over. Shall we go back to the apartments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho won the brawl?\u201d Poppy asked impishly.</p> <p>That earned one of Harry\u2019s rare grins. \u201cA conversation broke out in the middle of the fight. Which was undoubtedly a good thing, as it turned out that neither of us knows how to fight like a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fence,\u201d Poppy pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s a very gentlemanly way to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFencing isn\u2019t really fighting. It\u2019s more like chess with the risk of puncture wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t hurt each other,\u201d Poppy said cheerfully, \u201csince there\u2019s a distinct possibility that you may soon be brothers-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already brothers-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers-in-law squared, then.\u201d Poppy slipped her arm through his.</p><p>Harry glanced at Catherine as they began to walk. \u201cYou haven\u2019t decided yet, have you? About marrying Ramsay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d she said quietly, keeping pace with them. \u201cMy head\u2019s in a whirl. I need time to think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Poppy said, \u201cwhen you say that we\u2019re at cross-purposes, I hope you don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re against the idea of Leo and Catherine marrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the time being,\u201d he said, seeming to choose his words carefully, \u201cI believe caution is in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want Catherine to become part of my family?\u201d Poppy asked, bewildered. \u201cShe would have the protection of the Hathaways, and she would be close to your influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would like that very much. Except that it would necessitate Cat\u2019s marrying Ramsay, and I\u2019m not at all convinced that would be best for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Leo,\u201d Poppy protested.</p><p>\u201cI do. If there\u2019s a man in London with more charm or wit, I have yet to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you have any objections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause his past doesn\u2019t recommend itself as that of a reliable husband. Cat has been betrayed many times in her life.\u201d His tone was sober and grim. He looked at Catherine. \u201cAnd I\u2019m one of the people who failed you. I don\u2019t want you to suffer that way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Catherine said earnestly, \u201cyou\u2019re far too severe on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to pour sweetener on unpleasant truths,\u201d he returned. \u201cIf I could change the past, I would go back and do so without hesitation. But all I can do is try to make amends, and do better in the future. And I would say the same of Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. And I\u2019d like to believe that he\u2019s turned over a new leaf. But it remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll fall back into bad habits,\u201d Catherine said.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the first. However, Ramsay is nearing the age at which a man\u2019s character is more or less fixed. If he continues to avoid his former libertine practices, I think he\u2019ll make a fine husband. But until he manages to prove himself, I\u2019m not willing to risk your future as the wife of a man who may prove incapable of keeping his vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would keep his vows,\u201d Poppy insisted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled down at her. \u201cHe is fortunate to have you defend him, sweet. And I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d His gaze flickered to Catherine\u2019s troubled face. \u201cAm I wrong in suspecting that you have the same doubts, Cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it difficult to trust any man,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>The three of them were quiet as they continued along a neatly edged path.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d Poppy ventured, \u201cmay I ask something exceptionally personal?\u201d</p><p>Cat sent her a mock-worried look, and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything more personal than what we\u2019ve been discussing. Yes, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas my brother told you that he loves you?\u201d</p><p>Catherine hesitated for a long moment. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her gaze fixed on the path before them. \u201cIn fact, I recently overheard him telling Win that he would only marry a woman if he were certain not to love her.\u201d She darted a glance at Harry, who thankfully forbore comment.</p><p>Poppy frowned. \u201cHe may not have meant it.

They\u2019ll be a bit loose for you, but they can be altered easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Catherine protested. \u201cI\u2019ll send for the things I left in Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need something to wear in the meantime. And I have scores of gowns that have never been worn. Harry is ridiculously excessive when it comes to buying things for me. Besides, there\u2019s no need for all your stodgy spinster dresses now. I\u2019ve always longed to see you in beautiful colors ... pink, or jade green...\u201d She smiled at Catherine\u2019s expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like the proverbial butterfly emerging from the cocoon.\u201d</p><p>Catherine tried to respond with humor, although her nerves were strung tight with anxiety. \u201cI was really quite comfortable as a caterpillar.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy went to find Harry in his curiosities room, where he often went to mull over a problem or work on something in a place where he was certain not to be interrupted. Only Poppy was allowed to come and go as she pleased.</p><p>The room was lined with shelves of exotic and interesting objects, gifts from foreign visitors, clocks and figurines and odd things he had collected in his travels.</p><p>Harry sat at his desk in his shirtsleeves, fiddling with gears and springs and bits of wire, as he did whenever he was deep in thought. Poppy approached him, feeling a little pang of pleasure as she watched the movements of those hands, thinking of how they played on her body.</p><p>Harry looked up as she closed the door, his gaze attentive and thoughtful. He discarded the handful of metallic objects. Turning in his chair, he took her by the waist and pulled her between his spread thighs.</p><p>Poppy let her hands slide into his shiny dark hair, brown-black silk that curled slightly over her fingers. \u201cAm I distracting you?\u201d she asked as she leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said against her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Her chuckle dissolved between their lips, like sugar melting in hot tea. Lifting her head, Poppy tried to remember what she had come there for. \u201cMmmn, don\u2019t,\u201d she said as his mouth went to her throat. \u201cI can\u2019t think when you do that. I was going to ask you something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>Drawing back, she grinned and looked down at him, her arms still linked around his neck. \u201cWhat do you really think about this situation with Catherine and Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He toyed with the front of her bodice, running his fingers along the row of decorative buttons.</p><p>\u201cHarry, do not pull at those,\u201d she warned, \u201cthey\u2019re decorative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good are buttons that don\u2019t do anything?\u201d he asked, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I to get this dress off you?\u201d Intrigued, Harry began to search for hidden fastenings.</p> <p>Poppy touched her nose to his. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll let you find out after you tell me what you intend to do about Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScandal burns itself out far sooner when ignored. Any attempt to smother it only fans the flames. I\u2019m going to introduce Cat as my sister, explain that she went to school at Blue Maid\u2019s, and subsequently took a position with the Hathaways as a kindness to you and your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about all the uncomfortable questions?\u201d Poppy asked. \u201cHow shall we answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the manner of politicians. Willfully misinterpret and evade.\u201d</p><p>She considered that with thoughtfully pursed lips. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the only choice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what of Leo\u2019s proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she should accept him?\u201d</p><p>Poppy nodded decisively. \u201cI don\u2019t see what is to be gained by waiting. One never knows what kind of husband a man will be until one marries him. And then it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor little wife,\u201d Harry murmured, patting her rump over the gathered folds of her skirts. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I\u2019ve resigned myself to a lifetime of having to endure your passionate lovemaking and witty conversation.\u201d She heaved a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being a spinster, I tell myself.\u201d</p><p>Harry stood and pulled her up against him, kissing her until she was dizzy and pink-cheeked.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she persisted, as he nuzzled beneath her ear, \u201cwhen will you give your blessing to the match between Catherine and my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she tells me that it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, she\u2019s going to marry him come hell or high water.\u201d Lifting his head, he stared deeply into her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the apartment and take a nap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d she whispered, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d Taking her hand, he drew her out of the room. \u201cNow about those buttons...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>In the morning, Catherine was awakened by a maid who lit a fire in the grate and brought breakfast. One of the joys of staying at the Rutledge was the delicious food prepared by the talented Chef Broussard. Catherine sighed in enjoyment as she saw the contents of the tray: tea, fresh eggs coddled in cream and sided with pistolettes, small oval-shaped rolls, and a dish of ripe berries.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a note under the door, miss,\u201d the maid said. \u201cI put it on the side of the tray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Picking up the small sealed card, Catherine felt a twinge of pleasure when she saw her name written in Leo\u2019s unmistakable style, the neat, semi-joined italic of a trained architect.</p><p>\u201cRing when you\u2019re finished with the tray, miss, and I\u2019ll run up to get it. And if you need help dressing or arranging your hair, I\u2019m a fair hand at that too.\u201d</p><p>Catherine waited until the maid had left before opening the note.</p><p>Mysterious outing planned for this morning. Be ready at ten o\u2019clock sharp. Wear walking shoes.</p> <p>\u2014R</p><p>A smile broke out on Catherine\u2019s face. \u201cMysterious outing,\u201d she said, watching as Dodger hoisted himself up on the bed, his tiny nose working appreciatively as he detected food nearby. \u201cWhat could he be planning? No, Dodger, don\u2019t even think of disturbing my breakfast. You\u2019ll have to wait till I\u2019m done. I draw the line at sharing a plate with you.\u201d</p><p>Seeming to understand her stern tone, Dodger stretched and rolled slowly, completing three revolutions across the mattress.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t expect this to be a permanent arrangement,\u201d Catherine added, stirring sugar in her tea. \u201cI\u2019m only taking care of you until you go back to Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>She was so hungry that she ate every morsel on her plate, except for the small portion she reserved for the ferret. The eggs were perfect, the steaming yellow centers perfect for dipping the crisp pistolette crusts. When she was done, she spooned a coddled egg into a saucer for Dodge, placed a few berries on the side, and went to set it on the floor for him. Happily Dodger circled her, paused for a petting, and went to devour his food.</p><p>Catherine had just finished washing and brushing out her hair when there came a knock at the door. It was Poppy, accompanied by the housemaid she had seen earlier. Poppy was carrying at least three dresses draped across her arms, while the maid held a large basket filled with what appeared to ladies\u2019 linens, stockings, gloves, and other fripperies.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Poppy said cheerfully, coming in to lay the gown across the bed. Glancing at the ferret eating in the corner, she shook her head and grinned. \u201cHello, Dodger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre all those things for me?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cI don\u2019t need so much, truly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m forcing it on you,\u201d Poppy informed her, \u201cso don\u2019t dare try to give anything back. I\u2019ve included a few new underthings from the dressmaker, and a \u2018reform\u2019 corset\u2014do you remember when we saw them displayed at the ladies\u2019 outfitter stand at the Great Exhibition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Catherine smiled. \u201cImpossible to forget a collection of women\u2019s private garments being hung out for all the world to view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was a good reason why Madame Caplin won the prize medal at the exhibition. The Caplin corsets are much lighter than the usual ones, and they don\u2019t have nearly as many poky, pointy stays, and the whole thing adjusts to the body rather than molding you into an uncomfortable shape. Harry told the hotel housekeeper, Mrs. Pennywhistle, that any of the maids who wished to wear one could charge it to the Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because it allows them so much more freedom of movement. And you can breathe.\u201d Poppy lifted a pale seafoam-green dress from the bed and showed it to her. \u201cYou must wear this today. I\u2019m sure it will fit you\u2014we\u2019re the same height, only you\u2019re slimmer, and I have to tight-lace to fit into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too generous, Poppy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense, we\u2019re sisters.\u201d She sent Catherine an affectionate glance. \u201cWhether or not you marry Leo, we\u2019ll always be sisters. Leo told me about your outing at ten o\u2019clock. Did he tell you where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Poppy grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him surprise you. However, I will say that the expedition has my\u2014and Harry\u2019s\u2014full approval.\u201d</p><p>After the combined efforts of Poppy and the maid, Catherine was dressed in a pale seafoam gown, neither blue nor green but some perfect shade between the two. The bodice was close-fitting, stylishly cut without a waist seam, the skirts plain until the knee, where they draped in rows of flounces. The matching jacket, tailored to the waist, was trimmed with silk fringe in interwoven shades of blue, green, and silver-gray. A small, flirtatious hat was set on the upsweep of her hair, which had been done in a waterfall chignon with the ends tucked up and pinned beneath.</p><p>To Catherine, who had gone so long without wearing anything pretty or modish, the effect was disconcerting. She saw a stylishly turned-out woman in the looking glass, decidedly feminine and dashing.</p><p>\u201cOh, miss, you\u2019re as pretty as the girls they paint on tins of sweets,\u201d the housemaid exclaimed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Catherine,\u201d Poppy said, beaming. \u201cWait until my brother sees you! He\u2019ll rue every awful word he\u2019s ever said to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said awful things to him too,\u201d Catherine replied soberly.</p><p>\u201cWe all knew there was a reason behind the animosity between you,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut we could never agree on what it was. Beatrix was right, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat you and Leo were like a pair of ferrets, a bit rough-and-tumble in courtship.\u201d</p><p>Catherine smiled sheepishly. \u201cBeatrix is very intuitive.\u201d</p><p>Poppy directed a wry glance at Dodger, who was carefully licking the last residue of egg off the saucer. \u201cI used to think Beatrix would outgrow her obsession with animals. Now I realize it\u2019s the way her brain works. She sees hardly any difference between the animal world and the human one. I only hope she can find a man who will tolerate her individuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a tactful way to put it,\u201d Catherine said, laughing. \u201cYou mean a man who won\u2019t complain about finding rabbits in his shoes or a lizard in his cigar box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Catherine assured her. \u201cBeatrix is far too loving, and worthy of being loved, to go unmarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d Poppy said meaningfully. She went to scoop up the ferret as he proceeded to investigate the contents of the basket. \u201cI\u2019ll take Dodger for the day. I\u2019m doing correspondence all morning, and he can sleep on my desk while I work.\u201d</p><p>The ferret hung limp in Poppy\u2019s hold, grinning at Catherine as he was carried away.</p><p>Leo hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Catherine alone last night. He had wanted to stay beside her, watch over her, like a griffin guarding an exotic treasure. Although Leo had never possessed a jealous nature before, it seemed he was quickly making up for lost time. It was particularly annoying that Catherine was so reliant upon Harry. But it was natural that she should want to depend on her brother, especially when Harry had once rescued her from a dire situation and had been her only constant in the years afterward. Even though Harry had shown little love or interest in her until recently, he was all she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>The problem was that Leo had a consuming desire to be everything to Catherine. He wanted to be her exclusive confidant, her lover and closest friend, to tend to her most intimate needs. To warm her with his body when she was cold, hold a cup to her lips when she was thirsty, rub her feet when she was tired. To join his life with hers in every significant and mundane way.</p><p>However, he would not win her with one gesture, one conversation, one passion-filled night. He would have to chip away at her, removing strategic slivers here and there until her objections finally collapsed. That would require patience, attention, time. So be it. She was worth all of that and more.</p> <p>Arriving at the door of Catherine\u2019s suite, Leo knocked discreetly and waited. She appeared promptly, opening the door and smiling at him. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said with an expectant glance.</p><p>Any words of greeting Leo had intended to say vanished instantly. His gaze traveled slowly over her. She was like one of the exquisite feminine images painted on bandboxes or displayed in print shops. The pristine perfection of her made him long to unwrap her, like a bonbon done up in a neat paper twist.</p><p>Leo\u2019s silence went on so long that Catherine was forced to speak again. \u201cI\u2019m ready for the outing. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d Leo said, still staring. He moved forward as if to crowd her back into the room.</p><p>Holding her ground, Catherine placed a gloved hand on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow you inside, my lord. It wouldn\u2019t be proper. And I do hope that for this outing you have hired an open carriage instead of a closed one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take a carriage if you prefer. But our destination is a short distance, and the walk is pleasant, through St. James\u2019s Park. Would you like to go on foot?\u201d</p><p>She nodded immediately.</p><p>As they left the hotel, Leo took the side nearest the curb. Walking with her hand tucked into the crook of Leo\u2019s arm, Catherine told him what she and Beatrix had read concerning the park, that King James had kept a collection of animals there, including camels, crocodiles, and an elephant, as well as a row of aviaries along what became Birdcage Walk. That led to Leo telling her about the architect John Nash, who had designed the central mall through the park. The avenue had become the royal ceremonial route from Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>\u201cNash was what they called a coxcomb back then,\u201d Leo said. \u201cArrogant and self-important, which are requirements for an architect of that caliber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Catherine seemed amused. \u201cWhy, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staggering amount of money expended on an important work, and the public nature of it ... it\u2019s effrontery, really, to believe that a design in one\u2019s head has enough merit to be built on a large scale. A painting hangs in a museum where people have to seek it out, or avoid it if they prefer. But there\u2019s not much one can do to avoid a building, and God help us all if it\u2019s an eyesore.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him astutely, paying close attention. \u201cDo you ever dream of designing a grand public palace or monument, as Mr. Nash did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have no ambitions to be a great architect. Only a useful one. I like designing smaller projects, such as the tenant houses on the estate. They\u2019re no less important than a palace, in my opinion.\u201d He shortened his stride to match hers, and steered her carefully over a rough patch in the pavement. \u201cWhen I went back to France the second time, I happened to encounter one of my professors from the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, while I was on a walk in Provence. Lovely old man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat a fortunate coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in fate?\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a crooked grin. \u201cImpossible not to, living with Rohan and Merripen, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Catherine smiled back, and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a skeptic. I believe fate is who we are and what we make of our chances. Go on ... tell me about the professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI visited Professor Joseph often after that chance meeting, drawing and drafting and studying in his atelier.\u201d He pronounced the surname the French way, with the stress on the second syllable. Pausing, he smiled in rueful reminiscence. \u201cWe often talked over glasses of chartreuse. I couldn\u2019t abide the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d came the soft question.</p><p>\u201cUsually architecture. Professor Joseph had a pure view of it ... that a small, perfectly designed cottage has as much value as a grand public edifice. And he spoke of things he\u2019d never mentioned at the Acad\u00e9mie; his sense of the connections between the physical and spiritual ... that a perfect man-made creation, such as a painting, sculpture, or a building, could provide you with a moment of transcendence. Clarity. A key to unlock a glimpse of heaven.\u201d</p><p>Leo paused as he glimpsed her troubled expression. \u201cI\u2019ve bored you. Forgive me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that at all.\u201d They walked in silence for nearly a half minute before Catherine burst out, \u201cI\u2019ve never really known you. You are overturning so much of what I assumed about you. It\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re softening toward the idea of marrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t resist my charms forever.\u201d He guided her away from the park and onto a prosperous street of shops and businesses.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me to a haberdashery?\u201d Catherine asked, viewing the windows and signs. \u201cA flower shop? A book shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Leo said, stopping in front of a window. \u201cWhat do you think of this place?\u201d</p> <p>She squinted at the printed sign hung inside the window. \u201cTelescopes?\u201d she asked in bewilderment. \u201cYou want me to take up astronomy?\u201d</p><p>Leo turned her back to the window. \u201cContinue reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Purveyors of camp, racecourse, opera, and perspective glasses,\u2014\u201d she read aloud, \u201c\u2018by Her Majesty\u2019s royal letters patent. Illuminated ocular examinations performed by Dr. Henry Schaeffer with modern devices for the purpose of scientific correction of vision acuity.\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Schaeffer is the finest oculist in London,\u201d Leo said. \u201cSome say in the world. He was a professor of astronomy at Trinity, when his work with lenses led him to an interest in the human eye. He was habilitated as an ophthamologist, and has made remarkable strides in the field. I made an appointment for you to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need the finest oculist in London,\u201d she protested, puzzled that Leo would have gone to such lengths.</p><p>\u201cCome, Marks,\u201d he said, drawing her to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to have proper spectacles.\u201d</p><p>The interior of the shop was intriguing, lined with shelves of telescopes, magnifying glasses, binoculars, stereoscope instruments, and all manner of eyeglasses. A pleasant young clerk greeted them and went to fetch Dr. Schaeffer. The doctor came out very soon, displaying an expansive and jovial temperament. A handsome set of white whiskers framed his pink cheeks, and a thick snowy mustache curved upward when he smiled.</p><p>Schaeffer showed them around his shop, pausing to demonstrate a stereoscope and explain how the illusion of depth was created. \u201cThis instrument serves two purposes,\u201d the doctor said, his eyes twinkling behind his own spectacle lenses. \u201cFirst, the stereogram cards are sometimes of use in treating focusing disorders in certain patients. And second, they are helpful in entertaining high-spirited children.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine was cautious but willing as she and Leo followed Dr. Schaeffer to the rooms at the back of his shop. Whenever she had purchased spectacles in the past, the optician had simply brought out a tray of lenses, handed her various ones to hold up to her eyes, and when she felt she had obtained sufficient vision, he had proceeded to make spectacles for her.</p><p>Dr. Schaeffer, however, insisted on examining her eyes with a lens he called a \u201ccorneal loupe,\u201d after putting drops into her eyes to dilate the pupils. After pronouncing that there were no signs of disease or degeneration, he asked her to read letters and numbers from a series of three charts on the wall. She was obliged to reread the charts with various strengths of lenses, until finally they achieved a near-miraculous clarity.</p><p>When it came time to discuss the frames for the lenses, Leo surprised both Catherine and Dr. Schaeffer by taking an active part. \u201cThe spectacles that Miss Marks wears at present,\u201d Leo said, \u201cleave a mark at the bridge of her nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contour of the support arch must be adjusted,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d Leo withdrew a slip of paper from the pocket of his coat and placed it on the table. \u201cHowever, I have a few more ideas. What if the bridge is built up to hold the lenses a bit farther away from her face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of a design similar to the clips of a pince-nez?\u201d Schaeffer asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, they would fit more comfortably and also stay in place.\u201d</p><p>Schaeffer stared closely at the sketch Leo had given him. \u201cYou\u2019ve drawn curved earpieces, I see. An unusual feature.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe intention is to hold the spectacles more firmly onto her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a problem, keeping them on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout question,\u201d Leo replied. \u201cThis is a very active woman. Chasing animals, falling through rooftops, stacking rock\u2014all an average day for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Catherine said in reproof.</p> <p>Schaeffer smiled as he examined the contorted shapes of her spectacles. \u201cFrom the condition of these frames, Miss Marks, one could almost believe Lord Ramsay\u2019s claims.\u201d His mustache curved upward. \u201cWith your permission, I will instruct the jeweler I work with to build the frames you\u2019ve drawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them in silver,\u201d Leo said. He paused, regarding Catherine with a faint smile. \u201cAnd have him put a touch of filigree on the earpieces. Nothing vulgar ... keep it delicate.\u201d</p><p>Catherine shook her head immediately. \u201cSuch adornment is expensive and unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it nevertheless,\u201d Leo said to the doctor, his gaze still holding Catherine\u2019s. \u201cYour face deserves adornment. I would hardly put a masterpiece in a ordinary frame, would I?\u201d</p><p>She sent him a reproving glance. She neither liked nor trusted such outrageous flattery, nor did she intend to melt at his charm. But Leo gave her an unrepentant grin. And as he sat there and surveyed her with wicked blue eyes, she felt a painfully sweet contraction of her heart, followed by the sensation of being knocked off balance. Such a long distance to fall ... and yet she couldn\u2019t seem to back away from the danger.</p> <p>She could only stay there with her precarious equilibrium, suspended in longing and peril ... unable to save herself.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>It has been confirmed by Mr. Harry Rutledge, the London hotelier, that a woman identified as Miss Catherine Marks is in fact a half sister who has heretofore lived in relative obscurity as a companion to the family of Viscount Ramsay of Hampshire. Upon inquiry as to why the young woman was not previously brought out into society, Mr. Rutledge explained the discretion as appropriate to the circumstances of her birth, as the natural child of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s mother and an unnamed gentleman. Mr. Rutledge proceeded to emphasize the decorous and refined nature of his sister, and his own pride in acknowledging kinship with a woman he describes as \u201cestimable in every regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very flattering,\u201d Catherine said lightly, setting down the copy of the Times. She sent Harry a rueful glance across the breakfast table. \u201cAnd now the questions will begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the questions,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll you have to do is behave in the aforementioned decorous and refined manner when Poppy and I take you to the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going to the theater?\u201d Poppy asked, popping a last bite of honey-soaked crumpet into her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow evening, if that pleases you.\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded, trying not to look troubled by the prospect. People would stare, and whisper. Part of her shrank at the idea of being on display. On the other hand, it was a play, which meant the audience\u2019s attention would focus mainly on the activity within the proscenium.</p><p>\u201cShall we invite Leo?\u201d Poppy asked. She and Harry both looked at Catherine.</p><p>She hitched her shoulders in an unconcerned shrug, although she suspected it didn\u2019t deceive either of them.</p><p>\u201cWould you have any objection?\u201d Harry asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. He is Poppy\u2019s brother, and my former employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd possibly your fianc\u00e9,\u201d Harry murmured.</p><p>Catherine looked at him quickly. \u201cI haven\u2019t accepted his proposal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are considering it, however ... aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a few thick beats in her chest. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat, I don\u2019t mean to harass you about this, but how long do you intend to wait before giving Ramsay an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d Cat frowned into her tea. \u201cIf there\u2019s any hope of retaining Ramsay House, Lord Ramsay will have to marry someone soon.\u201d</p><p>A tap at the door heralded the entrance of Harry\u2019s right-hand man, Jake Valentine. He brought Harry a stack of daily manager\u2019s reports, as well as a handful of letters. One of these was addressed to Poppy, who received it with a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Valentine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rutledge,\u201d he said with an answering smile, bowing before he left. He looked the tiniest bit smitten with Poppy, which Catherine couldn\u2019t blame him for in the least.</p><p>Poppy broke the seal and read the letter, her fine brows inching higher and higher as she neared the conclusion. \u201cMy goodness, this is odd.\u201d</p><p>Harry and Catherine both looked at her questioningly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Lady Fitzwalter, with whom I am acquainted through some charity work. She asks me in this letter, very earnestly, if I will prevail on my brother to call upon Miss Darvin and Countess Ramsay, who are in town. And she provides the address of the house they have let.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so very odd,\u201d Catherine said pragmatically, although the news caused a stir of anxiety. \u201cAfter all, a lady may never call on a man for any reason, and therefore it is certainly not unheard-of for one to prevail upon a mutual acquaintance to arrange the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why does Miss Darvin wish to speak to Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be about the copyhold clause,\u201d Harry said, looking interested. \u201cPerhaps she wishes to offer some manner of concession.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she means to offer him something, \u201d Catherine said sullenly. She couldn\u2019t help remembering how beautiful the dark-haired Miss Darvin was, and what a striking couple she and Leo had made as they had waltzed. \u201cHowever, I doubt she intends to discuss legalities. It\u2019s something personal. Otherwise she would allow the solicitors to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam and Merripen were terrified by Miss Darvin,\u201d Poppy told Harry with a grin. \u201cAmelia wrote that her ballgown was trimmed with peacock feathers, which the Rom view as an omen of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some Hindu sects,\u201d Harry said, \u201cthe peacock\u2019s cries are associated with the rainy season, and therefore, fertility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanger or fertility?\u201d Poppy asked dryly. \u201cWell, it should be interesting to see which one Miss Darvin will evince.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Leo said immediately upon being informed of the necessity of calling on Miss Darvin.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, you have no choice,\u201d Poppy said, taking his coat as he entered the apartment.</p><p>Seeing Catherine seated in the parlor with Dodger in her lap, Leo came to her. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said, reaching for Catherine\u2019s hand and brushing a kiss on the backs of her fingers. The feel of his lips, so warm and soft against her skin, caused a quick indrawn breath.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, glancing at the place on the settee beside her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>After Poppy was seated in a chair by the hearth, Leo sat beside Catherine.</p><p>She smoothed Dodger\u2019s fur repeatedly, but he didn\u2019t move. A sleeping ferret was so limp and impossible to awaken that one might have reasonably assumed he was dead. One could pick him up, even shake him, and he would slumber on undisturbed.</p><p>Leo reached over to toy with the ferret\u2019s tiny arms and legs, lifting them gently and letting them drop back into her lap. They both chuckled as Dodger remained unconscious.</p><p>Catherine detected an unusual fragrance about Leo, a scent of feed and hay and some pungent animal scent. She sniffed curiously. \u201cYou smell a bit like ... horses ... Did you go for a ride this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eau de zoo, \u201d Leo informed her, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI went for a meeting with the secretary of the zoological society of London, and we toured the newest pavilion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d Catherine asked.</p> <p>\u201cAn old acquaintance of mine, with whom I apprenticed for Rowland Temple, has been commissioned at the Queen\u2019s behest to design a gorilla enclosure at the zoo. They keep them in small cages, which is nothing short of cruelty. When my friend complained to me about the difficulty of designing a sufficiently large and safe enclosure without costing a fortune, I suggested that he dig a moat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moat?\u201d Poppy echoed.</p><p>Leo smiled. \u201cGorillas won\u2019t cross deep water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that, my lord?\u201d Catherine asked in amusement. \u201cBeatrix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d He looked rueful. \u201cAnd now after my suggestion, it seems I\u2019ve been recruited as a consultant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least if your new clients complain,\u201d Catherine told him, \u201cyou won\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>Leo smothered a laugh. \u201cObviously you haven\u2019t seen what gorillas fling when they\u2019re displeased.\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cAll the same, I\u2019d rather spend my time with primates than pay a call to Miss Darvin and her mother.\u201d</p><p>The play that evening was mawkish but highly entertaining. The story was about a handsome Russian peasant who was striving for an education, but on his wedding day to his true love, the poor girl was assaulted by the prince of the domain, and while she swooned, was fatally stung by an asp. Before death overtook her, she reached her home and told her fianc\u00e9 what had happened, whereupon the handsome peasant swore revenge against the prince. These efforts led him to impersonate another nobleman in the royal court, where he happened to meet a woman who looked exactly like his dead love. As it turned out, the woman was an identical twin of the murdered peasant girl, and to further complicate matters, she was in love with the evil prince\u2019s honorable young son.</p> <p>Then it was intermission.</p><p>Unfortunately Catherine\u2019s and Poppy\u2019s enjoyment of the drama was hampered by low-voiced comments from both Harry and Leo, who insisted on pointing out that in her death throes, the asp-stung woman was clutching the wrong side of her body, and furthermore, a person dying of poison probably wouldn\u2019t cross the state back and forth while uttering poetic declarations of love.</p><p>\u201cYou have no romance in your soul,\u201d Poppy told Harry at intermission.</p><p>\u201cNot in my soul, no,\u201d he replied gravely. \u201cHowever, I have a great deal of it in other locations.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, reaching up to smooth an imaginary crease in his crisp white cravat. \u201cDarling, would you please have someone bring champagne to our box? Catherine and I are thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send for it,\u201d Leo said, standing and buttoning his coat. \u201cI need to stretch my legs after an hour and a half in that absurdly small chair.\u201d He looked down at Catherine. \u201cWould you care for a promenade?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, feeling much safer in the confines of the theater box than out walking in the crowd. \u201cThank you, but I am comfortable here.\u201d</p><p>As Leo pushed aside the curtains at the back of their box, it was evident that the hallways were exceedingly crowded. A pair of gentlemen and a lady came through the curtains and greeted the Rutledges warmly. Catherine tensed as Harry introduced her to Lord and Lady Despencer and Lady Despencer\u2019s sister, Mrs. Lisle. She anticipated a cool reception from them, perhaps a dismissive remark, but instead they were polite and affable. Perhaps, she thought wryly, she should stop expecting the worst of people. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy asked Lady Despencer about one of her children, who had been ill recently, and the woman listed all the medications and precautions it had taken for their ailing son to get well. Another cluster of people entered the box, waiting for a turn to speak to Harry, and Catherine moved to make room for them. She stood at the back of the box beside the curtain panels, waiting with forced patience as conversation flowed in currents in the hallway, in the box, large swells of noise rising from the audience below. The relentless clamor and movement irritated her. It was stuffy in the theater, the air warm from the mass of human bodies crowding everywhere. She hoped that intermission would conclude soon.</p><p>As she stood with her hands behind her back, she felt a hand reach through the box curtains and close around her wrist. A masculine body pressed behind hers. A smile touched her lips as she wondered what game Leo was playing.</p><p>But the voice that slithered into her ear wasn\u2019t Leo\u2019s. It was a voice from her nightmares.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty you look in your fine feathers, my pigeon.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Catherine stiffened, her hand clenching into a fist, but she couldn\u2019t jerk her arm away from Lord Latimer\u2019s grasp. He twisted her gloved wrist, forced it an inch or two higher, and continued to speak in a soft undertone.</p><p>Stunned and frozen, Catherine could hear nothing at first but the frantic velocity of her heartbeat. Time seemed to flicker, falter, and resume at a crawl. \u201c...so many questions about you...\u201d he was saying, his voice saturated with contempt. \u201cEveryone wants to know more about Rutledge\u2019s enigmatic sister ... is she fair or ill-favored? Accomplished or vulgar? Endowed or destitute? Perhaps I should supply the answers. \u2018She\u2019s a beauty,\u2019 I\u2019ll tell my curious friends, \u2018trained by an infamous procuress. She\u2019s a fraud. And most of all she\u2019s a whore.\u2014\u201d</p><p>Catherine was quiet, breathing through flared nostrils. She couldn\u2019t make a scene during her first public outing as Harry\u2019s sister. Any conflict with Lord Latimer would expose their past connection, and bring about her social ruin that much faster.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you further explain,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat you\u2019re a filthy lecher who tried to rape a fifteen-year-old girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTsk, tsk ... You should know better, Catherine. People never blame a man for his passions, no matter how perverse. People blame the woman for arousing them. You won\u2019t get far, asking for sympathy. The public despises victimized women, especially attractive ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ramsay will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamsay will use you and discard you, which is what he does with all women. Surely you\u2019re not so vain or stupid as to think you\u2019re different from the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI want what I paid for,\u201d he whispered, \u201call those years ago. And I\u2019ll have it. There\u2019s no other future for you, my dear. You were never meant for a respectable life. By the time you\u2019ve been run through the rumor mills, you\u2019ll never have a chance of being received anywhere.\u201d</p><p>The manacling fingers fell away, and her tormentor disappeared.</p> <p>Stricken, Catherine stumbled forward to her chair and sat heavily, trying to compose herself. She stared straight ahead, seeing nothing, while the clamor of the theater pressed around her from all sides. She tried to examine her fear objectively, to put a barrier around it. It wasn\u2019t that she actually feared Latimer. She loathed him, but he was certainly not the threat to her now that he once had been. She now had sufficient wealth to live as she pleased. She had Harry and Poppy, and the Hathaways.</p><p>But Latimer had identified her legitimate worries with cruel accuracy. One could fight a man, but not a rumor. One could lie about the past, but the truth would eventually surface. One could promise fidelity and commitment, but such promises were often broken.</p><p>She felt overwhelmed with melancholy. She felt ... stained.</p><p>Poppy sat next to her, smiling. \u201cNearly time for the second act,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think the peasant will gain revenge against the prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, undoubtedly,\u201d Catherine replied, trying to sound light, but her voice was forced.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s smile faded, and she looked at her closely. \u201cDo you feel well, dear? You look pale. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>Before Catherine replied, Leo shouldered his way back into the box, accompanied by a steward bearing a tray of champagne. A little bell rang from the orchestra box, signaling that the intermission would soon conclude. To Catherine\u2019s relief, the visitors began to drift out of the box, and the throng in the hallway receded.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Leo said, handing champagne to Poppy and Catherine. \u201cYou may want to drink it quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Catherine asked, forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe champagne goes flat much faster in these coupe glasses.\u201d</p><p>Catherine drained her champagne with unladylike haste, closing her eyes and swallowing against the sparkling burn in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that quickly,\u201d Leo said, viewing her with a faint, concerned smile.</p><p>The lights began to dim, and the audience settled.</p><p>Catherine glanced at the silver stand where the bottle of chilled champagne had been placed, a white napkin tied neatly at its neck. \u201cMay I have another?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll get tipsy if you have it so soon.\u201d Leo took the empty glass from her, set it aside, and took her gloved hand in his. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d she whispered back, easing her hand from his. \u201cPlease.\u201d She didn\u2019t want the evening to be ruined for everyone, nor did she want to take the chance that Leo might seek out Latimer in the theater and confront him. There was nothing to be gained by saying anything at the moment.</p><p>The theater darkened and the play resumed, although the story\u2019s melodramatic charms couldn\u2019t pull Catherine out of her frozen misery. She watched the stage with a fixed gaze, hearing the actors\u2019 dialogue as if it were a foreign language. And all the while her mind kept trying to find a solution to her internal dilemma.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem to matter that she already knew the answers. It had never been her fault, the situation she had once been put in. The blame was Latimer\u2019s, and Althea\u2019s, and her grandmother\u2019s. Catherine could reassure herself of that for the rest of her life, and yet the feelings of guilt, pain, confusion, were still there. How could she rid herself of them? What could possibly free her?</p><p>For the next ten minutes, Leo glanced at Catherine repeatedly, perceiving that something was deeply wrong. She was trying very hard to concentrate on the play, but it was clear that her mind was consumed with some overpowering problem. She was distant, unreachable, as if she had been encased in ice. Trying to comfort her, he took her hand once more, and ran his thumb above the edge of her wrist-length glove. The iciness of her skin was startling.</p> <p>Frowning deeply, Leo leaned toward Poppy. \u201cWhat the devil happened to Marks?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she returned helplessly. \u201cHarry and I were talking to Lord and Lady Despencer, and Catherine was off to the side. Then we both sat, and I noticed that she looked ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her back to the hotel,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>Harry, who had caught the last of the exchange, frowned and murmured, \u201cWe\u2019ll all go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for any of us to leave,\u201d Catherine protested.</p> <p>Ignoring her, Leo stared at Harry. \u201cIt would be better if you stayed and watched the rest of the play. And if anyone asks about Marks, say something about the vapours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone I had vapours,\u201d Catherine whispered sharply.</p><p>\u201cThen say I had them,\u201d Leo told Harry.</p><p>That seemed to rouse Catherine from her numbness. Leo was relieved to see a flicker of her usual spirit as she said, \u201cMen can\u2019t have vapours. It\u2019s a female condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I do,\u201d Leo said. \u201cI may even swoon.\u201d He helped her from her seat.</p><p>Harry rose as well, looking down at his sister with concern. \u201cIs this what you want, Cat?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking annoyed. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, he\u2019ll be asking for smelling salts.\u201d</p><p>Leo escorted Catherine outside and summoned a hackney carriage. It was a two-wheeled, partially open vehicle, with an elevated driver\u2019s seat at the rear. One could speak to the driver through a trapdoor at the top.</p><p>As Catherine approached the vehicle with Leo, she had a crawling sensation of being watched. Afraid that Latimer had followed her, she glanced to her left, where a man stood beside one of the theater\u2019s massive portico columns. To her relief, it was not Latimer, but a much younger man. He was tall, rawboned, and dressed in shabby dark clothing and a tattered hat, with the overall effect of a scarecrow. He had the distinctive London pallor common to those who spent most of their time indoors, whose skin was never touched by sun without the filter of polluted city air. His brows were strong black stripes across his gaunt face, his skin creased with lines that he was too young to have.</p><p>He was staring at her fixedly.</p><p>Catherine paused uncertainly, aware of a vague sense of recognition. Had she seen him somewhere before? She couldn\u2019t fathom where they might have met.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Leo said, intending to hand her into the carriage.</p><p>But Catherine resisted, caught by the riveted stare of the stranger\u2019s raven-dark eyes.</p><p>Leo followed the direction of her gaze. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p> <p>The young man came forward, removing his hat to reveal a mop of shaggy black hair. \u201cMiss Catherine?\u201d he said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d she breathed in wonder.</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d His mouth curled upward in the beginnings of a smile. He took another hesitant step, and bobbed in a sort of clumsy bow.</p><p>Leo intruded between them protectively and looked down at Catherine. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s the boy I once told you about ... who worked at my grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe errand boy?\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded. \u201cHe was the reason I was able to send for Harry ... he took my letter to him. My lord, do let me speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s face was implacable. \u201cYou would be the first one to tell me that a lady never stands and converses with a man on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you want to pay heed to etiquette?\u201d she asked in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to him.\u201d Seeing the refusal in his face, she softened her voice, and surreptitiously touched his hand. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Leo relented. \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d he muttered, looking none too happy. He remained right beside her, his eyes ice-blue as he stared at William.</p><p>Looking cowed, William obeyed Catherine\u2019s motion to come to them. \u201cYou turned into a lady, Miss Catherine,\u201d he said in his thick South London accent. \u201cBut I knew it was you\u2014that face, and those same little spectacles. I always hoped you was all right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed more than I, William,\u201d she said, trying to summon a smile. \u201cHow tall you\u2019ve grown. Are you still ... working for my grandmother?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and smiled ruefully. \u201cShe passed on two years ago, miss. Doctor said \u2019er heart gave out, but the girls at the \u2019ouse said it couldn\u2019t be, she didn\u2019t \u2019ave one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Catherine whispered, her face turning bleached and stiff. It was only to be expected, of course. Her grandmother had suffered from a heart ailment for years. She thought she should feel relieved by the news, but instead she only felt chilled. \u201cAnd ... my aunt? Is Althea still there?\u201d</p><p>William cast a guarded glance around them. \u201cShe\u2019s the madam now,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI work for her, odd jobs, same as I did for your grandmother. But it\u2019s a different place now, miss. Much worse.\u201d</p> <p>Compassion stirred inside her. How unfair it was for him to be trapped in such a life, with no training or education to afford him any other choice. Privately she resolved to ask Harry if there might be some kind of employment for William at the hotel, something that would lead him to a decent future. \u201cHow is my aunt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAiling, miss.\u201d His thin face was sober. \u201cDoctor said she must of got a bawdy-\u2019ouse disease some years back ... got in \u2019er joints and went up to \u2019er brain. Not well in the \u2019ead, your aunt. And she can\u2019t see none too good, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Catherine murmured, trying to feel pity, but instead a mass of fear rose in her throat. She tried to swallow it back, to ask more questions, but Leo interrupted brusquely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hackney\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Catherine gave her childhood friend a troubled glance. \u201cIs there something I can do to help you, William? Do you need money?\u201d She instantly regretted the question as she saw the shame and offended pride on his face. Had there been more time, had the circumstances allowed, she would have found a better way to ask.</p> <p>William gave a stiff shake of his head. \u201cDon\u2019t need noffing, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the Rutledge Hotel. If you wish to see me, if there is something I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t nivver trouble you, Miss Cathy. You was always kind to me. You brought me medicine once when I was sick, \u2019member? Came to the kitchen pallet where I slept, and covered me wiv one of the blankets from your bed. You sat on the floor and watched over me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Leo said, flipping a coin to William.</p><p>William caught it in midair. His fist lowered, and he looked at Leo with a mixture of greed and resentment, his face turning hard. When he spoke, his accent was exaggerated. \u201cFank you, guvnah.\u201d</p><p>Leo guided Catherine away with an uncompromising grasp on her elbow, and helped her into the carriage. By the time she had settled in the narrow seat and looked out again, William was gone.</p> <p>The passenger seat was so small that the mass of Catherine\u2019s skirts, layers of pink silk arranged like rose petals, spilled over one of Leo\u2019s thighs.</p><p>Staring at her profile, Leo thought she looked stern and nettled, like the Marks of old.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t have dragged me away like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were rude to William.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an unrepentant glance. \u201cNo doubt later, upon reflection, I\u2019ll feel terrible about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were some things I still wanted to ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure there was quite a lot more to be learned about bawdy-house diseases. Forgive me for depriving you of such an enlightening conversation. I should have let the two of you reminisce about the good old times at the brothel while you were standing on a public street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam was the dearest boy,\u201d Catherine said quietly. \u201cHe deserved a better lot in life. He had to work from the time he could toddle, cleaning shoes and carrying heavy buckets of water up and down the stairs ... he had no family, no education. Have you no sympathy at all for those in unfortunate circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe streets are filled with such children. I do what I can for them in Parliament, and I give to charity. Yes, I have sympathy for them. But at the moment I\u2019m more interested in your unfortunate circumstances than anyone else\u2019s. And I have a few questions for you, starting with this: What happened at intermission?\u201d</p> <p>When Catherine didn\u2019t reply, he took her jaw in a gentle but secure grasp, and forced her to look at him. \u201cLet\u2019s have it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a strained glance. \u201cLord Latimer approached me.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s eyes narrowed, his hand lowering from her chin. \u201cWhile you were in the theater box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Harry and Poppy didn\u2019t see. Latimer spoke to me through the curtain at the back of the box seating.\u201d</p><p>Leo was filled with explosive rage. For a moment he didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He wanted to go back and slaughter the bastard. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d he asked roughly.</p><p>\u201cThat I was a prostitute. And a fraud.\u201d</p><p>Leo wasn\u2019t aware that his grip had tightened until she winced. His hand loosened instantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were subjected to that,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you. I didn\u2019t think he would dare approach you after the warning I gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he wanted to make it clear that he\u2019s not intimidated by you.\u201d She drew an unsteady breath. \u201cAnd I think it hurt his pride all those years ago, to have paid for something he didn\u2019t receive. Perhaps I could give him some of the money Harry settled on me, and that might be enough to make him leave me alone. To keep quiet about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, that would only start us on a course of prolonged blackmail. And Latimer would never keep quiet. Listen to me, Cat ... Harry and I have discussed how to manage the problem. Suffice it to say that in a few days, Latimer will find himself in a position in which he\u2019ll either end up in prison or be forced to flee England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what crime?\u201d she asked, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long list to choose from,\u201d Leo said. \u201cHe\u2019s tried nearly everything. And I\u2019d rather not tell you the specific offense, because it\u2019s not appropriate for a lady\u2019s ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make him leave England? Truly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>He felt her relax a little, her shoulders slumping. \u201cThat would be a relief,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Catherine angled her face away from his searching gaze. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter. Because what he said was no less than the truth. I am a fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat self-pitying tripe. You were a fraud as an aspiring prostitute. As a proper and well-mannered lady who holds an irresistible attraction for ferrets, you\u2019re completely authentic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all ferrets. Just Dodger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof of his excellent taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to be charming,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more annoying than someone trying to make one feel better when one wants to wallow.\u201d</p><p>Leo bit back a grin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said contritely. \u201cGo on and wallow. You were doing so well at it until I interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She heaved a sigh and waited a moment. \u201cBlast,\u201d she finally said, \u201cI can\u2019t do it now.\u201d Her fingers crept further into his, and he smoothed his thumb over the backs of her knuckles. \u201cI want to correct something,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI was never an aspiring prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you aspire to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo live somewhere peaceful, and be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s all. And I haven\u2019t managed to do it yet. Although ... the past few years have been the closest I\u2019ve ever gotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Leo told her, \u201cand you can have both. You\u2019ll be safe, and you\u2019ll live in Hampshire. And you\u2019ll have me, which is obviously icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant laugh escaped her. \u201cRather more icing than the cake needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as too much icing, Marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I don\u2019t believe that you sincerely want to marry me as much as you want to have your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to marry me so that I don\u2019t have my way all the time,\u201d he said, which was the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for me to be indulged. And you tell me no quite frequently.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a huff of wry amusement. \u201cI haven\u2019t said it to you nearly enough lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s practice in your hotel suite. I\u2019ll try to have my way with you, and you can try to refuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see? You\u2019re sharpening your skills already.\u201d</p><p>Leo directed the driver to take them to the alley that bordered the mews behind the hotel. It was a far more discreet way to enter than parading through the lobby. They went up the back stairs and along the hallway that led to Catherine\u2019s suite. The hotel was extraordinarily quiet at that hour, everyone either out for their evening pursuits, or sleeping soundly.</p><p>When they reached Catherine\u2019s door, Leo waited as Catherine searched for the key in the little knitted silk bag she had looped around one wrist.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d Leo said when she had found the key. Taking it from her, he unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Catherine took back the key and turned to face him at the threshold.</p><p>Leo stared down into her fine-boned face, reading the emotions that flickered in her eyes: despair, refusal, yearning. \u201cInvite me in,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou must go. It\u2019s not seemly for you to stand here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night\u2019s still young. What will you do in there, alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll stay awake as long as possible, worrying about nightmares.\u201d Seeing that he had scored a point, Leo pressed his advantage. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Leo stood in the doorway, tugging off his gloves casually, as if he had all the time in the world. Catherine went dry-mouthed as she watched him. She needed him. She needed to be held and comforted, and he knew it. If she allowed him into her hotel suite, there was no question as to what would happen next.</p><p>She started as the sound of voices came from the end of the long hallway. Reaching out hastily, she grabbed the lapels of Leo\u2019s coat, pulled him across the threshold, and closed them both safely inside the room. \u201cHush,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Leo braced his hands on either side of her, caging her against the door. \u201cYou know how to keep me quiet.\u201d</p><p>The voices became louder as people advanced further along the hallway.</p><p>Smiling into her tense face, Leo began in a perfectly audible tone, \u201cMarks, I wonder if\u2014\u201d</p><p>She drew in an exasperated breath and crammed her mouth against his, anything to shut him up. Leo fell obligingly silent, kissing her with bold and avid pleasure. Even through the elegant layers of his clothes, she could feel the heat and hardness of him. Desperately she fumbled with his clothes, pushing her hands beneath his coat where his body heat had collected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moaned, the sound catching between their lips. His tongue went deep, and she felt corresponding twinges of pleasure low in her stomach. Her legs lost their strength, her balance eroding. Her spectacles became dislodged, catching between their faces. Leo reached up to remove them carefully. He slipped them into his pocket. With deliberate slowness, he put the key in the door and locked it from the inside. Catherine stood mutely, torn between desire and caution.</p><p>In the silence, Leo went to light a lamp. A rasp, as a match was struck ... a glow, as the wick kindled. Catherine blinked owlishly at the shadow-crossed room, at the large dark shape of him before her. She ached for him, her body clenching on intimate emptiness. A tremor went through her as she thought of how he had filled her, the sweet heaviness of him inside her.</p><p>Blindly she turned to face away from him, offering access to the row of hooks that fastened the back of her dress. The fabric tightened across her br**sts as he grasped the dress at the back. There was a series of deft tugs, the garment loosening, slipping lower. She felt his mouth brush the tender nape of her neck, a whisk of exciting warmth. He pushed the gown to her waist and over her hips. She moved to help him, stepping out of the heap of layered pink silk, kicking off her slippers. Turning her around again, Leo unhooked her corset, pausing to kiss each of her shoulders in turn.</p><p>\u201cTake down your hair.\u201d The touch of his breath on her skin made her shiver.</p><p>Catherine obeyed, pulling the pins from her chignon, collecting them in a little bundle. After setting them on the dressing table, she went to the bed and climbed onto the mattress, waiting tensely as he undressed. She couldn\u2019t help wishing she had her spectacles back as she stared at the intriguing, hazy shape of him, the play of light and shadow on his skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t squint so hard, love. You\u2019ll strain your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>He approached her, every line of his body replete with masculine grace. \u201cCan you see me at this distance?\u201d</p><p>She contemplated him thoroughly. \u201cCertain parts.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave a husky laugh, crawling onto the bed, over her, bracing his weight on his arms. The tips of her br**sts hardened beneath the light veil of her chemise. Their stomachs pressed together, the erect shape of him caught exquisitely against the corresponding notch of her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d Leo whispered. \u201cAm I close enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she managed to say, staring into his face, taking in every breathtaking detail. She had to force out words between uneven breaths. \u201cBut not quite...\u201d</p><p>Leo bent to take her lips, locking his mouth over hers in a blaze of sensation. She lost herself in it, a kiss that was at once giving and demanding. He searched her gently, meeting the shy advances of her own tongue. She tasted inside his mouth for the first time, and felt the jolt of his response.</p><p>With a ragged sound, Leo reached for the hem of her chemise. Pulling the garment upward, he helped Catherine to lift it over her head. He untied the tapes of her drawers with torturous slowness, running his fingers along the loosening waist, easing the thin muslin fabric down her hips. Her garters and stockings soon followed, leaving her completely exposed.</p><p>Murmuring his name, Catherine twined her arms around his neck and tried to draw him over her again. She arched into him, gasping with delight at the varied textures of him, roughness and silk, smoothness and steel.</p><p>He brought his mouth to her ear, his lips toying with the soft lobe before he whispered, \u201cCat. I\u2019m going to kiss all the way down your body and up again. And I want you to lie perfectly still and let me do as I please. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said earnestly, \u201cI really don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Leo averted his face for a moment. When he looked back at her, his eyes were sparkling with amusement. \u201cThat was actually a rhetorical question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rhetorical question has an obvious answer,\u201d she argued, \u201cand what you\u2019re asking is not\u2014\u201d She broke off, unable to speak or think as she felt him nibble and lick at a sensitive part of her neck. His mouth was hot and silken, the flat of his tongue like velvet. He worked his way along her arm, pausing at the hollows of her inner arm and wrist, caressing the pulse that beat visibly in the fragile skin. Every inch of her body prickled with awareness of him and what he was doing.</p><p>His mouth wandered back along her arm to the side of her breast, the trail of his mouth leaving her skin flushed and damp. He kissed all around the rosy peak without touching it, until she felt a whimper climb in her throat. \u201cMy lord, please, \u201d she gasped, sliding her hands into his hair, trying to guide him.</p><p>He resisted, grasping her wrists and pulling them to her sides. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he reminded her gently. \u201cOr do you want me to start over?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and lay with aggrieved stillness, her chest heaving. Leo had the gall to laugh softly, his mouth returning to nuzzle the undercurve of her breast. A cry escaped her when she felt his lips brush against the gathered crest. Slowly his mouth opened and sealed over her, and he began to suckle. Heat writhed in her stomach, and her h*ps lifted from the mattress. His hand settled on her taut abdomen, rubbing in a soothing circle, pressing her back down.</p><p>It was impossible to lie motionless as Leo tormented her, arousing her skillfully but providing no relief. Impossible to endure ... but he wouldn\u2019t allow otherwise. He made his way down to her stomach, licking and blowing lightly into the hollow of her navel. She was weak and perspiring, wet at the roots of her hair, her body racked with delight that verged on pain.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth glided across the vulnerable softness of her groin to her inner thighs, his tongue playing gently on either side ... everywhere except the wet pulsing center.</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she panted. \u201cThis ... is not very nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cMove your legs apart.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed with a shudder, letting him guide her, opening her body in ever more revealing positions. He used his mouth in ways that infuriated and aroused her ... nibbling along her thigh, investigating the ticklish hollows behind her knees, stringing kisses around her ankles, sucking lazily on her toes. She swallowed back a supplicating moan, and another, impatience thumping through her body.</p><p>After an eternity, Leo had finally progressed all the way back to her neck. Catherine parted her thighs, dying for him to take her, but instead he rolled her to her stomach. She whimpered in frustration.</p><p>\u201cImpatient wench.\u201d Leo\u2019s hand smoothed over her bottom and slipped between her thighs. \u201cThere, will this satisfy you for now?\u201d She felt him parting her swollen flesh. Her body stiffened in bliss as his fingers entered her, slipping into the wetness. He held them there, deep and flexing, while he kissed along her spine. She found herself grinding against his hand, gasping in pleasure. Closer ... closer ... and yet the cl**ax shimmered just out of reach.</p><p>Finally Leo turned her to her back again, his features hard and sweat-misted, and it was only then that she realized he had been torturing himself as well as her. He pinned her arms over her head and spread her legs. For an instant she knew a flare of panic at her own helplessness, seeing his powerful body above hers. But then he entered her in a hard, slick plunge, and the fear vanished in a flood of pleasure. He slipped his free arm beneath her neck. Her eyes closed, and her head lolled as he bent to kiss her throat.</p><p>She was nothing but feeling, heat coming through her in waves, stronger and stronger as he took her with slow, luscious drives. He rolled his h*ps with each forward pitch, repeating the movement until she went crimson and whimpered in a last burst of release. And he stayed with her, riding every drawn-out spasm until she was limp and quiet. Murmuring to her, he coaxed her to wrap one leg around his waist, and he lifted her other leg until it hooked over his shoulder. The position opened her, changed the angle between them, so that when he thrust again, it caressed a new place inside her. Another rush of pleasure started, surging so high and fast that she could hardly breathe. She lay still beneath him, her legs trembling as she took him more deeply than she had thought possible. She was propelled into another cl**ax, strong and dizzying, but before the last tremors had faded, he withdrew abruptly to take his own release, his sex throbbing viciously against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cat,\u201d he said after a while, still over her, his hands gripped in the bedclothes.</p><p>She turned her face until her lips brushed the rim of his ear. The erotic perfume of sex and damp skin filled her nostrils. Her palm went to his back, smoothing over the taut surface, and she felt him shiver in pleasure at the gentle scratch of her nails. How remarkable it was to lie with a man, feeling him soften inside her as their pulses slowed. What an astonishing assimilation of flesh and moisture and sensation, the lingering twinges and pulses in the places they pressed together.</p><p>Leo lifted his head and looked down at her. \u201cMarks,\u201d he said, his voice uneven, \u201cyou are not a perfect woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have an evil temper, you\u2019re as blind as a mole, you\u2019re a deplorable poet, and frankly, your French accent could use some work.\u201d Supporting himself on his elbows, Leo took her face in his hands. \u201cBut when I put those things together with the rest of you, it makes you into the most perfectly imperfect woman I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Absurdly pleased, she smiled up into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful beyond words,\u201d Leo went on. \u201cYou are kind, amusing, and passionate. You also have a keen intellect, but I\u2019m willing to overlook that.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cAre you leading to another marriage proposal?\u201d</p><p>His gaze was intent. \u201cI have a special license from the Archbishop\u2019s Court of Faculties. We could wed at any church, whenever we please. We could be married by morning, if you say yes.\u201d</p><p>Catherine turned her face away from his, pressing a frown into the mattress. She owed him an answer\u2014she owed him honesty. \u201cI\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll ever be able to say yes to that.\u201d</p><p>Leo was very still. \u201cDo you mean only when I propose, or if any man did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny man,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s only that with you, it\u2019s very difficult to refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s encouraging,\u201d he said, although his tone conveyed the opposite.</p><p>Leo left the bed and went to get a damp cloth for her. Returning, he stood beside the bed and watched her. \u201cThink of it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cMarriage would change hardly anything between us, except that we would end our arguments in a much more satisfying way. And of course I would have extensive legal rights over your body, your property, and all your individual freedoms, but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so alarming about that.\u201d</p><p>His quip almost made Catherine smile again, despite her encroaching despair. Finishing her ablutions, she set the cloth on the bedside table and pulled the bed linens up to her br**sts. \u201cI wish people were like the clocks and mechanisms that Harry is so clever at constructing. Then I could have whatever is wrong with me repaired. As it is, though, I have some parts that aren\u2019t working properly.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo sat on the side of the bed, his gaze holding hers. He extended a muscular arm and caught the back of her neck in his hand, and held her steady. His mouth possessed hers roughly, until her head swam and her heart pounded. Lifting his head, he said, \u201cI adore all of your parts exactly as they are.\u201d He drew back and touched her taut jawline, his fingers gentle. \u201cCan you at least admit that you\u2019re fond of me?\u201d</p><p>Catherine swallowed against the soft caress. \u201cI ... it\u2019s obvious that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it,\u201d he urged, stroking the side of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy must I say something if it\u2019s obvious?\u201d</p> <p>But he persisted, damn him, seeming to understand how difficult it was for her. \u201cIt\u2019s only a few words.\u201d His thumb brushed the hard, anxious pulse at the base of her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Catherine couldn\u2019t look at him.

Taking a deep breath, she managed a shaking whisper. \u201cI\u2019m f-fond of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Leo murmured, beginning to draw her close. \u201cWas that so bad?\u201d</p> <p>Her body was wrenched with the longing to huddle against his inviting chest. But instead she put her arms between them, preserving a crucial distance. \u201cIt makes no difference,\u201d she forced herself to say. \u201cIn fact, it makes it worse.\u201d</p><p>His arms loosened. He gave her a quizzical glance. \u201cWorse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because I can never give you anything more than that. And regardless of what you claim to the contrary, you\u2019ll want the kind of marriage your sisters have. The way Amelia is with Cam, the devotion and intimacy ... you\u2019ll want that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want intimacy with Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about it,\u201d she said wretchedly. \u201cThis is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d came his quiet reply. \u201cSometimes serious conversations make me uncomfortable, and I tend to resort to humor as a result.\u201d He paused. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re trying to tell me. But what if I say that attraction and fondness would be enough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe you. Because I know how unhappy you would become, seeing your sisters\u2019 marriages, remembering how devoted your parents were to each other, and knowing that ours was a counterfeit by comparison. A parody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so certain that we won\u2019t come to care for each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am. I\u2019ve looked inside my heart, and it\u2019s not there. That\u2019s what I meant before. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to trust anyone enough to love them. Even you.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s face was expressionless, but she sensed something dark lurking beneath his self-control, something that hinted of anger, or exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re unable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to.\u201d He released her carefully and went to retrieve his discarded clothes. As he dressed, he spoke in a voice that chilled her with its pleasant blandness. \u201cI have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But if I stay, I\u2019ll end up making love to you and proposing to you repeatedly, until morning. And even my tolerance for rejection has its limits.\u201d</p><p>Words of regret and self-reproach hovered on her lips. But she held them back, sensing that it would only infuriate him. Leo was hardly a man to fear a challenge. But he was beginning to comprehend that he could do nothing with the challenge she presented, some inexplicable quandary that couldn\u2019t be solved.</p><p>After dressing and shrugging into his coat, Leo returned to the bedside. \u201cDon\u2019t try to predict what you\u2019re capable of,\u201d he murmured, sliding his fingers beneath her chin. He bent to press his lips to her forehead, and added, \u201cYou may surprise yourself.\u201d Going to the door, he opened it and glanced up and down the hallway. He glanced at Catherine over his shoulder. \u201cLock the door when I leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said with difficulty. \u201cAnd ... I\u2019m sorry, my lord. I wish I were different. I wish I could\u2014\u201d She stopped and shook her head miserably.</p><p>Pausing a bit longer, Leo gave her a look of amusement edged with warning. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose this battle, Cat. And despite yourself, you\u2019re going to be very happy in defeat.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Paying a call on Vanessa Darvin the following day was the last thing Leo wanted to do. However, he was curious about why she wanted to see him. The address that Poppy had given to him was of a Mayfair residence in South Audley Street, not far from the terrace he leased. It was a Georgian town house, neat red brick with white trim, fronted by a white pediment with four slender pilaster columns.</p><p>Leo liked Mayfair immensely, not so much for its fashionable reputation as the fact that it had once been deemed a \u201clewd and disorderly\u201d place in the early eighteenth century by the Grand Jury of Westminster. It had been condemned for its practices of gaming, bawdy stage plays, prizefighting and animal baiting, and all the attendant vices of crime and prostitution. Over the next hundred years it had gradually gentrified until John Nash had sealed its hard-won respectability with Regent Street and Regent\u2019s Park. To Leo, however, Mayfair would always be a respectable lady with a notorious past.</p><p>Upon arriving at the residence, Leo was shown to a reception room overlooking a two-tiered garden. Vanessa Darvin and Countess Ramsay were both present, welcoming him warmly. As they all sat and made the obligatory small talk, inquiring after the health of their family, and his, and the weather, and other safe and polite subjects of an opening acquaintance, Leo found that his impressions of the two women from the ball in Hampshire were unchanged. The countess was a garrulous biddy, and Vanessa Darvin was a self-involved beauty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A quarter hour passed, and then a half hour. Leo began to wonder if he would ever discover why they had prevailed on him to call.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d the countess eventually exclaimed, \u201cI quite forgot that I had intended to consult with Cook about the evening meal. Pardon, I must go at once.\u201d She stood, and Leo automatically rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should leave, as well,\u201d he said, grateful for the opportunity to escape.</p><p>\u201cDo stay, my lord,\u201d Vanessa said quietly. A look passed between Vanessa and the countess before the latter left the room.</p> <p>Recognizing the obvious pretext to leave them alone, Leo lowered back into the chair. He raised a brow as he regarded Vanessa. \u201cSo there is a point to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a point,\u201d Vanessa confirmed. She was beautiful, her shining dark hair arranged in pinned-up curls, her eyes exotic and striking in her porcelain complexion. \u201cI wish to discuss a highly personal matter with you. I hope I may rely on your discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may.\u201d Leo studied her with a flicker of interest. There was a hint of uncertainty, urgency, beneath her provocative fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain how best to begin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBe blunt,\u201d Leo suggested. \u201cSubtleties are usually wasted on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would like to put forth a proposition, my lord, that will satisfy our mutual needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow intriguing. I wasn\u2019t aware that we had mutual needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously yours is to marry and have a son quickly, before you die.\u201d</p><p>Leo was mildly startled. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned to expire any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Ramsay curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the Ramsay curse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither did my father,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Leo said, both annoyed and amused, \u201cin light of my rapidly approaching demise, we shouldn\u2019t waste a moment. Tell me what you want, Miss Darvin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find a husband as quickly as possible, or I will soon find myself in a very unpleasant position.\u201d</p><p>Leo watched her alertly, making no response.</p><p>\u201cAlthough we are not well acquainted,\u201d she continued, \u201cI know a great deal about you. Your past exploits are hardly a secret. And I believe all the qualities that would make you an unsuitable husband for anyone else would make you ideal for me. We are very much alike, you see. From all accounts, you are cynical, amoral, and selfish.\u201d A deliberate pause. \u201cSo am I. Which is why I would never try to change any of those things about you.\u201d</p><p>Fascinating. For a girl no more than twenty, she possessed preternatural self-confidence.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you chose to stray,\u201d Vanessa continued, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t complain. I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice, because I would be similarly occupied. It would be a sophisticated marriage. I can give you children to ensure that the Ramsay title and estate will stay in your line of descent. Furthermore, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Darvin,\u201d Leo said carefully, \u201cpray don\u2019t continue.\u201d The irony of the situation was hardly lost on him\u2014she was proposing a true marriage of convenience, free from messy desires and feelings. The diametric opposite of the marriage he wanted with Catherine.</p> <p>Not long ago, that might have appealed to him.</p><p>Settling back in his chair, Leo regarded her with detached patience. \u201cI don\u2019t deny the stories of my past sins. But despite all that ... or perhaps because of it ... the idea of a sophisticated marriage doesn\u2019t appeal to me in the least.\u201d</p><p>He saw by the frozen stillness of Vanessa\u2019s face that he had surprised her. She took her time about replying. \u201cPerhaps it should, my lord. A better woman would be disappointed and shamed by you, and come to hate you. Whereas I \u201d\u2014she touched her chest in a practiced gesture, drawing his attention to her round, perfect bosom\u2014\u201cwould never expect anything from you.\u201d</p><p>The arrangement Vanessa Darvin proposed was a perfect recipe for aristocratic domesticity. How fantastically bloodless and civilized.</p><p>\u201cBut I need someone to expect something from me,\u201d he heard himself say.</p><p>The truth of that bolted through him like lightning. Had he really just said it? And did he truly mean it?</p><p>Yes. Dear God.</p><p>When and how had he changed? It had been a mortal struggle to leave behind the excesses of grief and self-loathing. Somewhere along the way he had stopped wanting to die, which was not quite the same thing as wanting to live. But that had been enough for a while.</p><p>Until Catherine. She had reawakened him like a cold dash of water in his face. She made him want to be a better man, not just for her, but for himself, as well. He should have known that Catherine would push him over the edge. Good God, how she pushed him. And he loved it. Loved her. His small, bespectacled warrior.</p><p>I won\u2019t let you fall, she had said to him, the day he\u2019d been injured at the ruins. I won\u2019t let you turn into a degenerate. She had meant it, and he had believed her, and that had been the turning point.</p><p>How deeply he had resisted loving someone like this ... and yet it was exhilarating. He felt as if his soul had been set on fire, every part of him burning with impatient joy.</p><p>Aware that his color had heightened, Leo took a deep breath and let it out slowly. A smile twitched his lips as he reflected on the peculiar inconvenience of realizing that he was in love with one woman, when he had just been proposed to by another.</p><p>\u201cMiss Darvin,\u201d he said gently, \u201cI am honored by your suggestion. But you want the man I was. Not the man I am now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dark eyes flashed with malice. \u201cYou\u2019re claiming to be reformed? You think to disown your past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But I have hopes for a better future.\u201d He paused deliberately. \u201cRamsay curse notwithstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d Vanessa\u2019s pretty features hardened. \u201cI knew you were no gentleman, but I didn\u2019t take you for a fool. You should leave now. It seems you\u2019ll be of no use to me.\u201d</p><p>Leo rose obligingly. He paused before taking his leave, giving her an astute glance. \u201cI can\u2019t help but ask, Miss Darvin ... why don\u2019t you simply marry the baby\u2019s father?\u201d</p> <p>It turned out to be a very good guess.</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s eyes flared before she managed to school her expression. \u201cHe is too far beneath me,\u201d she said in a tight little voice. \u201cI\u2019m rather more discriminating than your sisters, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d Leo murmured. \u201cThey seem to be very happy in their lack of discrimination.\u201d He bowed politely. \u201cFarewell, Miss Darvin. I wish you luck in your search for a husband who\u2019s not beneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need luck, my lord. I will marry, and soon. And I\u2019ve no doubt my future husband and I will be happy indeed when we come to take possession of Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the hotel from a morning dressmaker\u2019s appointment with Poppy, Catherine shivered in pleasure as they entered the Rutledge apartments. It was raining steadily, in fat chilling drops that heralded the approach of autumn. Despite the precautions of cloaks and umbrellas, she and Poppy had not escaped entirely from the damp. They both went to the parlor hearth, standing before the snapping fire.</p> <p>\u201cHarry ought to be coming back from Bow Street soon,\u201d Poppy said, pushing back a wet tendril of hair that had stuck to her cheek. He had gone for a meeting with a special constable and a Bow Street magistrate to discuss Lord Latimer. So far Harry had been maddeningly closemouthed as to the specifics of the situation, promising that after he\u2019d gone to the magistrate\u2019s office, he would explain in detail. \u201cAnd so should my brother, after seeing Miss Darvin.\u201d</p><p>Catherine removed her spectacles and used a fold of her sleeve to clear the steam from the lenses. She heard a welcoming sound from Dodger, a sort of ferrety chuckling noise, and he came loping toward her out of seemingly nowhere. Replacing her spectacles, she bent to pick him up, and he wriggled into her arms. \u201cYou odious rat,\u201d she murmured, cradling his long, sleek body.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, Catherine,\u201d Poppy said, shaking her head and smiling.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I\u2019m returning him to Beatrix at the first opportunity.\u201d But she furtively lowered her cheek and let Dodger kiss her.</p><p>There was a knock at the door, followed by the bustle of someone entering, a masculine murmur, a maid taking his coat and hat. Leo entered the parlor, bringing in the scents of damp wool and rain. His hair was wet at the ends, curling slightly against his neck.</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Poppy exclaimed with a laugh, \u201chow wet you are! Didn\u2019t you take an umbrella?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmbrellas are of little use when it\u2019s raining sideways,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch a towel.\u201d Poppy darted out of the room.</p><p>Left alone with Leo, Catherine met his gaze. His smile faded, and he stared at her with alarming intensity. Why did he look at her that way? It seemed as if something had been cut loose in him, his eyes demon-blue and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cHow was your conversation with Miss Darvin?\u201d she asked, tensing as he approached her.</p><p>\u201cIlluminating.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the brief reply, taking refuge in a show of exasperation. \u201cWhat did she ask of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe proposed a marriage of convenience.\u201d</p><p>Catherine blinked. It was what she had expected, and yet to hear it caused a stab of jealousy.</p> <p>Leo stopped beside her, the firelight flickering over his features. Tiny droplets of rain glittered like jewels on his sun-browned face. She wanted to touch that light mist, put her mouth on it, taste his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your response?\u201d she forced herself to ask.</p><p>\u201cI was flattered, of course,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cOne always appreciates being wanted.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was jealous. He was toying with her. Catherine struggled to keep her temper from igniting.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should accept her,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>His gaze didn\u2019t move from hers. \u201cPerhaps I did.\u201d</p><p>Catherine drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d Poppy said cheerfully, oblivious to the tension between them as she entered the room with a neat stack of toweling. She brought a cloth to Leo, who took it and blotted his face.</p><p>Catherine sat on the settee, letting Dodger coil in her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Miss Darvin want?\u201d she heard Poppy ask.</p><p>Leo\u2019s voice was muffled in the towel. \u201cShe proposed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cShe clearly hasn\u2019t any idea of what it\u2019s like to tolerate you on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her situation,\u201d he returned, \u201ca woman can\u2019t afford to be particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat situation is that?\u201d Catherine asked tersely.</p><p>Leo handed the towel back to Poppy. \u201cShe\u2019s expecting a child. And she doesn\u2019t care to marry the father. That\u2019s not to go any further than this room, of course.\u201d</p><p>The two women were silent. Catherine wrestled with a curious mixture of feelings ... sympathy, hostility, jealousy, fear. With this bit of news, the advantages of a match between Leo and Miss Darvin were abundantly clear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy regarded her brother gravely. \u201cHer circumstances must be quite desperate, for her to confide in you like that.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s reply was forestalled as Harry entered the apartments, his coat and hat streaming with water. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Harry said, flashing a smile. The maid took the sodden hat and coat, and Poppy approached him with a fresh towel.</p><p>\u201cYou walked?\u201d she asked, her gaze sweeping from the sodden hems of his trouser legs to his rain-dappled features. She reached up to dry his face with wifely solicitude.</p><p>\u201cI very nearly swam,\u201d Harry told her, seeming to enjoy her ministrations.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take a hackney or send for a carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the hackneys were taken as soon as the rain started,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a short distance. Only a milksop would send for a carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter a milksop than to catch your death of cold,\u201d Poppy fussed, following as he drew near the hearth.</p><p>Harry smiled and leaned down to steal a kiss from her as he worked at the wet knot of his cravat. \u201cI never catch cold.\u201d Drawing off the damp length of linen, he tossed it aside and stood by the fire. He glanced at Leo expectantly. \u201cWhat of your meeting with Miss Darvin?\u201d</p><p>Leo sat and leaned forward with his elbows braced on his knees. \u201cNever mind that, tell us about the visit to Bow Street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpecial Constable Hembrey has considered the information you provided, and he\u2019s willing to take up an investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of investigation?\u201d Catherine asked, looking from Harry to Leo.</p><p>Leo\u2019s face was impassive as he explained. \u201cA few years ago, Lord Latimer invited me to join an exclusive club. A kind of rakehell society, with secret meetings held in a former abbey.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat is the purpose of the society?\u201d</p><p>Harry and Leo were both silent. Eventually Leo replied in a flat tone, his gaze fixed on a distant point outside the rain-streaked windows. \u201cUnmitigated depravity. Mock religious rituals, assaults, unnatural crimes. I\u2019ll spare you the details, except to say they were so distasteful that even at the height of my debauchery, I turned down Latimer\u2019s invitation.\u201d</p><p>Catherine watched him carefully. His face was set, a small muscle in his jaw flexing. The firelight gilded the taut lines of his face.</p> <p>\u201cLatimer was so certain I would want to participate,\u201d Leo continued, \u201cthat he went into some detail regarding some of the crimes he was involved in. And by some fluke I happened to be sober enough to remember most of what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the information enough to support prosecution?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cAnd as a peer, doesn\u2019t Lord Latimer have the right of freedom from arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in civil cases,\u201d Harry told her. \u201cNot in criminal ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you think he\u2019ll be brought to trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t come to that,\u201d Leo said quietly. \u201cThe society can\u2019t allow their activities to be exposed. When they realize that Latimer is the focus of an investigation, they\u2019ll probably force him to leave England before he can be prosecuted. Or better yet, they\u2019ll see to it that he ends up as a floater in the Thames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Constable Hembrey want to depose me?\u201d Catherine brought herself to ask.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Leo said with reassuring firmness. \u201cThere\u2019s more than enough evidence against him without your involvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever it plays out,\u201d Harry added, \u201cLatimer will be far too busy to trouble you further, Cat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Catherine told Harry. Her gaze flickered back to Leo as she added, \u201cThat is a great relief.\u201d After an awkward pause, she repeated herself lamely. \u201cA great relief, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem all that relieved,\u201d Leo observed lazily. \u201cWhy is that, Marks?\u201d</p><p>This lack of sympathy, along with his earlier taunts about Miss Darvin, were too much for Catherine\u2019s shredded nerves.</p><p>\u201cIf you were in my position,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t exactly be dancing a jig, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a fine position.\u201d Leo\u2019s eyes were like blue ice. \u201cLatimer will soon be gone, Rutledge has acknowledged you publicly, you\u2019re a woman of means, and you have no obligations or commitments to anyone. What could you possibly want that you don\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re sorry to stop running and hiding. Because now you have to face the unfortunate fact that you have nothing ... and no one ... to run to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough for me to stay still,\u201d she said coldly.</p><p>Leo smiled with provoking insouciance. \u201cThat brings to mind the old paradox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat paradox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.\u201d</p><p>Harry and Poppy were both silent, looking back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019m the immovable object?\u201d Catherine asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like,\u201d she said, scowling, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve always thought that was an absurd question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is no possible answer.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes clashed and held.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d Leo said, seeming to enjoy her rising fury.</p><p>Harry joined in the debate. \u201cNot from a scientific standpoint. An immovable object would require infinite mass, and the unstoppable force would require infinite energy, neither of which is possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you argue in terms of semantics, however,\u201d Leo countered with maddening calmness, \u201cthere is an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Harry said dryly. \u201cA Hathaway can always find a way to argue. Enlighten us\u2014what is the answer?\u201d</p><p>Leo replied with his gaze fixed on Catherine\u2019s tense face. \u201cThe unstoppable force takes the path of least resistance and goes right around the object ... leaving it far behind.\u201d</p><p>He was challenging her, Catherine realized. Arrogant, manipulative cad, using poor Vanessa Darvin\u2019s plight to provoke her and implying what might happen if Catherine didn\u2019t give in to him. Go right around the object ... leave it far behind ... Indeed!</p> <p>She jumped to her feet, glaring at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on and marry her, then?\u201d Snatching up her reticule, and Dodger\u2019s limp body, she stormed out of the apartments.</p><p>Leo was instantly at her heels.</p><p>\u201cRamsay\u2014\u201d Harry began.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Rutledge,\u201d Leo muttered, striding after Catherine. The door was closed with a force that caused it to tremble in its frame.</p><p>In the ensuing stillness, Harry looked at Poppy in bewilderment. \u201cI\u2019m not usually slow-witted,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what the devil were they bickering about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Darvin, I think.\u201d Going to him, Poppy sat in his lap and linked her arms around his neck. \u201cShe\u2019s with child and wants to marry Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry leaned his head against the back of the chair. His mouth twisted. \u201cI see. He\u2019s using it to try and push Catherine into making a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve,\u201d Poppy said rather than asked, stroking a damp lock of hair off his forehead.</p><p>Harry gave her a wry glance. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I would do in his position. Of course I don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop following me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d Leo kept pace with Catherine as she hurried along the hallway, his ground-eating strides accounting for every two of her short ones.</p> <p>\u201cI have no interest in anything you have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d He sounded more than a little pleased by the fact.</p><p>\u201cOf you and Miss Darvin?\u201d She forced a scornful laugh. \u201cI pity the both of you. I can\u2019t conceive of a more ill-destined match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that she\u2019s a very attractive woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for her neck,\u201d Catherine couldn\u2019t resist saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is the matter with her neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s abnormally long.\u201d</p><p>Leo tried, unsuccessfully, to smother a laugh. \u201cI can overlook that. Because if I marry her, I\u2019ll get to keep Ramsay House, and we\u2019ll have a baby already on the way. Convenient, isn\u2019t it? Moreover, Miss Darvin promised that I could philander to my heart\u2019s content, and she would look the other way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about fidelity?\u201d Catherine asked in outrage.</p><p>\u201cFidelity is so pass\u00e9. It\u2019s laziness, really, not bothering to go out and seduce new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that you would have no difficulty with fidelity!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was when we were talking about our marriage. Marriage with Miss Darvin will be another thing entirely.\u201d</p><p>Leo stopped with her as they reached the door of her suite. While Catherine held the sleeping ferret, Leo reached inside her reticule and extracted the key. Catherine didn\u2019t spare him a glance as he opened the door for her.</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Leo pushed his way in regardless, and closed the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cPray don\u2019t let me keep you,\u201d Catherine said grimly, going to set Dodger in his little basket. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have much to do. Starting with changing the name on the special license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the license is only good for you. If I marry Miss Darvin, I\u2019d have to pay for a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s expensive,\u201d she said vehemently.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Leo approached her from behind and put his arms around her, hauling her back securely against him. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, struggling in his grasp.</p><p>His mouth touched the edge of her ear. \u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOnly you. Always you.\u201d</p><p>Catherine went still. Her eyes closed against a sudden wet sting. \u201cDid you accept her proposal?\u201d</p><p>Leo nuzzled tenderly into the hollow beneath her ear. \u201cOf course not, pea-goose.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t prevent a little sob of angry relief. \u201cThen why did you imply that you had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need to be pushed. Otherwise you\u2019ll drag this affair out until I\u2019m too decrepit to be of any use to you.\u201d Steering Catherine toward the bed, he scooped her up and tossed her to the mattress. Her spectacles went flying to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Catherine struggled indignantly, propping herself up on her elbows. She was buried in the masses of her skirts, with their sodden hems and heavy damp flounces. \u201cMy dress is wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you remove it.\u201d His solicitous tone was belied by the wicked gleam in his eyes.</p><p>She floundered amid the layers and flounces, while Leo unhooked and unfastened her with astonishing efficiency. One would have thought he had more than two arms, as he turned her this way and that, his hands reaching everywhere. Ignoring her protests, he pulled the heavy skirt, with its stiffened muslin lining, away from the detachable bodice, and tossed it to the floor. Her shoes were removed and dropped over the side of the bed. Flipping Catherine to her stomach, he began on the fastenings of the heavily ruched bodice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon, I did not ask to be husked like an ear of corn!\u201d She twisted in an effort to push away his busy hands. A squeak escaped her as he found the tapes of her drawers and pulled them loose.</p><p>With a low chuckle, Leo anchored her squirming body with his legs, and kissed the exposed nape of her neck. She felt warm all over, her nerves sparked by the touch of his sensuous mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you kiss her?\u201d she heard herself blurt out, her voice muffled in the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cNo, love. I wasn\u2019t tempted by her in the least.\u201d Leo bit lightly into the soft muscle of her neck, stroked the fine skin with his tongue, and she gasped. His hand slipped inside her drawers and circled over her bottom. \u201cNo other woman in the world could excite me as you do. But you\u2019re too damn stubborn, and far too good at protecting yourself. There are things I want to say to you ... do to you ... and the fact that you\u2019re not ready for any of it is going to drive us both mad.\u201d</p><p>He touched further between her thighs, finding wetness, stroking in soft circles. She moaned and writhed beneath him. Her corset was still snugly laced, the compression of her waist seeming to divert sensation down between her thighs. Although part of her rebelled at the feeling of being held down and caressed, her body reacted with helpless pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you.\u201d Leo traced the inner structure of her ear with the tip of his tongue. \u201cI want to go as deep as you can take me, and feel you tighten around me, and I want to come inside you.\u201d A finger slid inside her, and another, and she whimpered softly. \u201cYou know how good it would feel,\u201d he whispered, stroking her slowly. \u201cYield to me, and I\u2019ll love you without stopping. I\u2019ll stay in you all night.\u201d</p><p>Catherine gasped for breath, while her heart thumped madly. \u201cYou would have me in the same position as Miss Darvin,\u201d she said. \u201cPregnant and pleading for you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes, I would love that.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked with indignation, while his long fingers teased her inside and out. Her body began to clench in a slow, steady pulse of desire. There were great swaths of fabric caught between their bodies, layers of remaining clothing, and all she could feel was his mouth at the back of her neck, and that devilishly persuasive hand.</p><p>\u201cI have never said this to anyone before.\u201d Leo\u2019s voice was like ragged velvet. \u201cBut the idea of you with child is the most insanely arousing thing I\u2019ve ever imagined. Your belly all swollen, your br**sts heavy, the funny little way you would walk ... I would worship you. I would take care of your every need. And everyone would know that I\u2019d made you that way, that you belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... you are so...\u201d She couldn\u2019t even think of a suitable word.</p><p>\u201cI know. Woefully primitive.\u201d Laughter threaded through his voice. \u201cBut I must be tolerated, because I\u2019m a man and I really can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her with gentle, explicit manipulation, his fingers slick and tireless. She felt a new flush of arousal, the liquid heat spreading out to her fingers and toes. Moving behind her, he tugged her drawers to her knees, and fumbled with the fastenings of his trousers. He let his weight settle on her deliciously. A blunt, moist pressure slipped between her thighs, not quite entering. White fire raced through her senses, and her body trembled at the verge of release ... so close ...</p><p>\u201cYou have a decision to make, Cat.\u201d Leo kissed the side of her throat hungrily, his mouth strong and wet. \u201cEither tell me to stop right now, or let me take you all the way. Because I can\u2019t withdraw at the last moment any longer. I want you too much. And I probably will make you pregnant, love, because I\u2019m feeling rather potent at the moment. So it\u2019s all or nothing. Tell me yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. \u201d Catherine thrashed in frustration as his h*ps lifted from hers. As he rolled her over to face him, she glared up at him. Unable to stop himself, he lowered his head and kissed her voraciously, savoring the sound of need that came from her throat.</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d he said, breathing heavily. \u201cI was working up to something really lascivious.\u201d Rolling off her, he reached for the fall of his trousers, muttering something about the risk of doing himself permanent injury as he tried to fasten them again.</p><p>Catherine watched him incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to finish?\u201d</p><p>He let out an unsteady sigh. \u201cAs I said, all or nothing.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself, trembling with desire until her teeth chattered. \u201cWhy are you trying to torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that a lifetime of patience wouldn\u2019t be enough to break through your guard. So I\u2019ll have to try something else.\u201d Leo kissed her gently and left the bed. After he raked both hands through his disheveled hair and straightened his clothes, he gave her a smoldering glance, followed by a grin that seemed to mock both of them simultaneously. \u201cI\u2019m waging war, love. And the only way to win this kind of war is to make you want to lose.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Only a woman made of stone could have lasted against the campaign Leo launched over the next week. It was courtship, he claimed, but there should have been another word for it, the way he kept Catherine constantly off balance with his sweetly subversive charm.</p><p>One moment he provoked her into some nonsensical and highly entertaining argument, and the next he was soothing and kind. He whispered whimsical compliments and lines of poetry in her ear, and taught her naughty French words, and made her laugh at inappropriate moments. What Leo did not do, however, was try to kiss or seduce her. At first Catherine was amused by this obvious tactic, and then secretly miffed, and then intrigued. She frequently found herself staring at his mouth, so flawless and firm ... she couldn\u2019t help remembering their past kisses, daydreaming about them.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they attended a private musical evening at a mansion on Upper Brook Street, Leo stole Catherine away as the hostess led a group of guests on a tour of the house. Following Leo to a private corner behind an arrangement of tall potted ferns, Catherine went eagerly into his arms. Instead of kissing her, however, he pulled her into the warm strength of his body ... and held her. Simply held her, keeping her warm and close, letting his hands course slowly over her back. He whispered something secretive amid the pinned-up swirls of her hair, the words too soft for her to hear.</p><p>What Catherine enjoyed above all was walking with Leo through the Rutledge gardens, where sunlight stuttered through trees and hedges, and the breezes carried the crisp hint of approaching autumn. They had long conversations, sometimes touching on sensitive subjects. Careful questions, difficult answers. And yet it seemed they were both struggling toward the same goal, a kind of connection that neither of them had ever known before.</p><p>Sometimes Leo drew back and looked at her for wordless moments as one might stare at a work of art in a museum, trying to discover its truth. It was compelling, the interest he showed in her. Seductive. And he was a wonderful conversationalist, telling her stories about his childhood misadventures, about what it had been like to grow up in the Hathaway family, about the time he had spent in Paris and Provence. Catherine listened carefully to the details, gathering them like quilting scraps, piecing them together to form a better understanding of one of the more complex men she had ever met.</p><p>Leo was an unsentimental rogue who was capable of great sensitivity and compassion. He was an articulate man who could use words either to soothe like a balm of honey, or dissect like a surgeon\u2019s knife. When it suited him, Leo played the part of a jaded aristocrat, adeptly concealing the quicksilver workings of his brain. But sometimes in unguarded moments, Catherine caught glimpses of the gallant boy he had once been, before experience had weathered and hardened him.</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways he\u2019s very much like our father was,\u201d Poppy told her in private. \u201cFather loved conversation. He was a serious man, an intellectual, but he possessed a streak of whimsy.\u201d She grinned, remembering. \u201cMy mother always said she might have married a more handsome man, or a wealthier one, but never one who talked as he did. And she knew herself to be the kind of woman who would never have been happy with a dullard.\u201d</p><p>Catherine could well understand that. \u201cDid Lord Ramsay favor your mother in any regard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. She had an artistic eye, and she encouraged Leo in his architectural pursuits.\u201d Poppy paused. \u201cI don\u2019t think she would have been pleased to learn that Leo would inherit a title\u2014she didn\u2019t have a high opinion of the aristocracy. And she certainly wouldn\u2019t have approved of Leo\u2019s behavior in the past few years, although she would be very glad that he had decided to mend his ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did his wicked wit come from?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cYour mother or your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Poppy said wryly, \u201cis entirely Leo\u2019s own.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly every day, Leo brought Catherine a small gift: a book, a box of sweets, a collar made of Brussels bobbin lace in a delicate pattern of openwork flowers. \u201cThis is the loveliest lacework I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she told him regretfully, setting the exquisite gift on a nearby table with great care. \u201cBut my lord, I\u2019m afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Leo said. \u201cA gentleman shouldn\u2019t give personal items to a lady he\u2019s courting.\u201d He lowered his voice, mindful of being overheard by Poppy and the housekeeper, who were talking by the threshold of the Rutledge apartments. \u201cBut I can\u2019t take it back\u2014no other woman could do it justice. And Marks, you have no idea of the self-restraint I exercised. I wanted to buy you a pair of embroidered stockings with little flowers that run all the way up the insides of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Catherine whispered, a light blush covering her face. \u201cYou forget yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten a thing, actually. Not one detail of your beautiful body. Soon I may start sketching you na**d again. Every time I put a pencil to paper, the temptation nearly overwhelms me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to look severe. \u201cYou promised not to do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my pencil has a will of its own,\u201d he said gravely.</p> <p>Catherine\u2019s color deepened, even as a smile tugged at her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lowered fractionally. \u201cKiss me, and I\u2019ll behave.\u201d</p><p>She made an exasperated little sound. \u201cNow you want to kiss me, when Poppy and the housekeeper are standing only a few yards away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t notice. They\u2019re involved in a riveting conversation about hotel toweling.\u201d Leo\u2019s voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cKiss me. One little kiss. Right here.\u201d He pointed to his cheek.</p><p>Perhaps it was the fact that Leo looked rather boyish as he teased her, his blue eyes alight with mischief. But as Catherine looked at him, she was nearly overwhelmed with a strange new feeling, a warm giddiness that invaded every part of her body. She leaned forward, and instead of kissing his cheek, she put her mouth directly on his.</p><p>Leo drew in a surprised breath, letting her take the lead. And, giving in to temptation, she lingered longer than she had intended, her mouth softly teasing, her tongue shyly touching his lips. He responded with a low sound, his arms going around her. She sensed the rising heat in him, the carefully banked urges threatening to flare out of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ending the kiss, Catherine half expected to see Poppy and the housekeeper, Mrs. Pennywhistle, both staring at them with scandalized expressions. But as she peeked over Leo\u2019s shoulder, she saw that the housekeeper\u2019s back was still turned toward them.</p><p>Poppy had taken in the situation with an astute glance. \u201cMrs. Pennywhistle,\u201d she said glibly, ushering the housekeeper away from the threshold, \u201cdo come out into the hallway with me, I thought I saw a dreadful stain on the carpeting the other day, and I wanted to show you ... is it here? ... No, perhaps over there ... Oh, drat, where is it?\u201d</p><p>Left in temporary privacy, Catherine looked into Leo\u2019s heavy-lidded blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d he asked, his voice husky.</p> <p>She tried to think of an answer that would amuse him. \u201cI wanted you to test my higher brain function.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of his lips. Taking a deep breath, he let it out slowly. \u201cIf you have a match when you enter a dark room,\u201d he finally said, \u201cwhich would you light first\u2014the oil lamp on the table, or the kindling in the hearth?\u201d</p><p>Catherine squinted as she considered the question. \u201cThe lamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe match,\u201d he said, shaking his head. His tone was soft and chiding. \u201cMarks, you\u2019re not even trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one,\u201d she prompted, and he complied without hesitation, his head bending over hers. He gave her a long, smoldering kiss, and she relaxed against him, her fingers sinking into his hair. He finished the kiss with a voluptuous nudge.</p> <p>\u201cIs it legal or illegal for a man to marry his widow\u2019s sister?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIllegal,\u201d she said languidly, trying to pull his head back to hers.</p><p>\u201cImpossible, because he\u2019s dead.\u201d Leo resisted her efforts and looked down at her with a crooked grin. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested, straining toward him.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Marks,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOne of us has to have some self-control, and it really should be you.\u201d He brushed his lips against her forehead. \u201cI have another present for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook in my pockets.\u201d He jumped a little and laughed unsteadily as she began to search him. \u201cNo, you little ravisher, not my trouser pockets.\u201d Grabbing her wrists in his hands, he held them suspended in the air, as if he were trying to subdue a playful kitten. Seeming unable to resist, he leaned forward and took her mouth again. Being kissed while he held her wrists might have frightened her once, but now it awakened something deep and ticklish inside.</p><p>Leo tore his mouth away and released her with a gasping laugh. \u201cCoat pocket. My God, I want to\u2014no, I won\u2019t say it. Yes, there\u2019s your present.\u201d</p><p>Catherine drew out an object wrapped in soft cloth. Gently she unwrapped a new pair of spectacles made of silver ... gleaming and perfect, the oval lenses sparkling. Marveling at the workmanship, she drew a finger along one of the intricate filigreed earpieces, all the way to the curved tip. \u201cThey\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she said in wonder.</p><p>\u201cIf they please you, we\u2019ll have another pair made in gold. Here, let me help you...\u201d Leo gently drew the old spectacles off her face, seeming to savor the gesture.</p><p>She put the new ones on. They felt light and secure on the bridge of her nose. As she looked around the room, everything was wonderfully detailed and in focus. In her excitement, she jumped up and hurried to the looking glass that hung over the entryway table. She inspected her own glowing reflection.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty you are.\u201d Leo\u2019s tall, elegant form appeared behind hers. \u201cI do love spectacles on a woman.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s smiling gaze met his in the silvered glass. \u201cDo you? What an odd preference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d His hands came to her shoulders, lightly fondling up to her throat and back again. \u201cThey emphasize your beautiful eyes. And they make you look capable of secrets and surprises\u2014which, as we know, you are.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cMost of all I love the act of removing them\u2014getting you ready for a tumble in bed.\u201d</p> <p>She shivered at his bluntness, her eyes half closing as she felt him pull her back against him. His mouth went to the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou like them?\u201d Leo murmured, kissing her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her head listed to the side as his tongue traced a subtle path along her throat. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t know why you went to such trouble. It was very kind.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s dark head lifted, and he met her drowsy gaze in the looking glass. His fingers went to the side of her throat, stroking as if to rub the feel of his mouth into her skin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being kind,\u201d he murmured, a smile touching his lips. \u201cI merely wanted you to see clearly.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to, she was tempted to tell him, but Poppy returned to the apartment before she was able.</p><p>That night Catherine slept badly, stumbling into the nightmare world that seemed as real, if not more real, than the infinitely kinder world she inhabited in her waking moments.</p><p>It was part dream, part memory, the recollection of running through her grandmother\u2019s house until she had found the old woman sitting at her desk, writing in a ledger.</p><p>Heedlessly Catherine threw herself at her grandmother\u2019s feet and buried her face in the voluminous black skirts. She felt the old woman\u2019s skeletal fingers slide under her wet chin and lift it.</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s face was masked with a sediment of powder, the ashy whiteness contrasting with her artificially darkened brows and hair. Unlike Althea, she wore no lip rouge, only colorless salve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlthea talked to you,\u201d Grandmother said, in a voice like dried leaves rubbing together.</p><p>Catherine struggled to force out words between sobs. \u201cYes ... and I don\u2019t underst ... understand ...\u201d</p><p>Grandmother responded with a scratchy croon, pressing Catherine\u2019s head on her lap. She stroked her hair, narrow fingers combing lightly through the loose locks. \u201cDid Althea fail to explain adequately? Come, you\u2019re not a clever girl, but neither are you stupid. What don\u2019t you understand? Stop crying, you know I detest it.\u201d</p><p>Catherine squeezed her eyes tightly, trying to stop the tears from slipping out. Her throat was tight with misery. \u201cI want something else, anything else. I want a choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be like Althea?\u201d The question was spoken with unnerving gentleness.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to be like me?\u201d</p><p>Catherine hesitated and shook her head slightly, afraid to say \u201cno\u201d again. She had learned in the past that the word should be used sparingly with her grandmother. It was an unfailing irritant regardless of the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cBut you already are,\u201d Grandmother told her. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman. All women have a whore\u2019s life, child.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine froze, afraid to move. Her grandmother\u2019s fingers became talons, the stroking changing into a sort of slow, rhythmic clawing on her head.</p><p>\u201cAll women sell themselves to men,\u201d her grandmother continued. \u201cMarriage itself is a transaction, in which a woman\u2019s value is tied to purposes of copulation and breeding. At least we, in our time-honored profession, are honest about it.\u201d Her tone turned reflective. \u201cMen are foul, brutish creatures. But they own the world and always will. And to get the most from them, you must practice submission. You\u2019ll be very good at it, Catherine. I\u2019ve seen the instinct in you. You like being told what to do. You\u2019ll like it even more when you\u2019re paid for it.\u201d Her hand lifted from Catherine\u2019s head. \u201cNow, don\u2019t trouble me again. You may ask Althea all the questions you like. Mind you, when she began on her career, she was no happier about it than you. But she quickly saw the advantages of her situation. And we all have to earn our keep, don\u2019t we? Even you, dear. Being my granddaughter affords you no entitlement. And fifteen minutes on your back will earn you as much as other women earn in two or three days. Willing submission, Catherine.\u201d</p><p>Feeling stunned, as if she had just fallen from a great height, Catherine had left her grandmother\u2019s study. She knew a momentary, mad urge to bolt for the front door. But without a place to go to, without money, an unprotected girl would last only a matter of hours in London. The trapped sobs in her chest had dissolved into shivers.</p><p>She went upstairs to her room. But then the dream changed, the memories transforming into dark vagaries of imagination ... becoming a nightmare. The stairs seemed to multiply, and the climb became difficult and she went upward into deeper and deeper shadows. Alone and shivering with cold, she reached her room, illuminated only by the glaze of moonlight.</p><p>There was a man sitting at the window. He was straddling the frame, actually, one long leg placed firmly on the floor, the other swinging negligently outside. She knew him from the shape of his head, from the powerful lines of his silhouette. And from the dark, a velvety voice that lifted the hairs on the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. Come here, Marks.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine was suffused with relief and yearning. \u201cMy lord, what are you doing here?\u201d she cried, running to him.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d His arms went around her. \u201cI\u2019ll take you far away from here\u2014would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, yes ... but how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go right out this window. I have a ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it safe? Are you certain\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put his hand gently to her mouth, silencing her. \u201cTrust me.\u201d His hand pressed harder. \u201cI won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tell him that she would go anywhere with him, do anything he said, but he was covering her mouth too tightly for her to speak. His grip became hurtful, clamping on her jaw. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s eyes opened. The nightmare fell away, revealing a far worse reality. She struggled beneath a crushing weight, and tried to cry out against the callused hand that covered her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cYour aunt wants to see you,\u201d came a voice in the darkness. \u201cI \u2019as to do this, miss. I \u2019as no choice.\u201d</p><p>In the space of just a few minutes, it was done.</p><p>William gagged her with a tight cloth that bit into her mouth, a large knot pressing hard against her tongue. After binding her hands and feet, he went to light a lamp. Even without the aid of her spectacles, Catherine perceived that he wore the dark blue coat of a Rutledge Hotel employee.</p><p>If only she could get a few words out, plead or bargain with him, but the knotted lump of cloth made coherent sound impossible. Her saliva spiked unpleasantly at the intensely acrid flavor of the gag. There was something on it, she realized, and at that same moment she felt her consciousness breaking into pieces, scattered like an unfinished puzzle. Her heart turned sluggish, pumping poisoned blood through her collapsing limbs, and there was a ballooning, thumping sensation in her head as if her brain had suddenly become too large for her skull.</p><p>William came to her with a hotel laundry bag. He began to pull it over her, starting at her feet. He didn\u2019t look at her face, only kept his gaze on his task. She watched passively, seeing that he took care to keep the hem of her nightgown primly down at her ankles. Some distant part of her brain wondered at the small kindness of preserving her modesty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bedclothes rustled near her feet, and Dodger streaked out with a furious chatter. With quicksilver speed he attacked William\u2019s arm and hand, inflicting a series of deep, gouging bites. Catherine had never seen the little animal behave in such a manner. William grunted in surprise and flung out his arm with a low curse. The ferret went flying, slamming hard against the wall and falling limply to the floor.</p><p>Catherine moaned behind the gag, her eyes burning with acid tears.</p><p>Breathing heavily, William examined his bleeding hand, found a cloth at the washstand to wrap around it, and returned to Catherine. The laundry bag was pulled higher and higher until it went over her head.</p><p>She understood that Althea didn\u2019t really want to see her. Althea wanted to destroy her. Perhaps William didn\u2019t know. Or perhaps he thought it was kinder to lie. It didn\u2019t matter. She felt nothing, no fear, no anguish, although tears leaked steadily from the outward corners of her eyes. What a terrible fate to leave the world feeling nothing at all. She was nothing more than a tangle of limbs in a sack, a headless doll, all memories receding, all sensation falling away.</p> <p>A few thoughts needled through the blanket of nothingness, pinpricks of light in the dark.</p><p>Leo would never know that she had loved him.</p><p>She thought of his eyes, all those colors of blue. Her mind was filled with a constellation of high summer, stars in a lion\u2019s shape. The brightest star marks his heart.</p><p>He would grieve. If only she could spare him that.</p><p>Oh, what they could have had. A life together, such a simple thing. To watch that handsome face weather with age. She had to admit now that she had never been happier than in the moments with him.</p> <p>Her heart beat faintly beneath her ribs. It was heavy, aching with contained feeling, a hard knot within the numbness.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to need you, Leo, I fought so hard to stay standing at the edge of my own life ... when I should have had the courage to walk into yours.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Late in the morning Leo returned from a visit with his old mentor, Rowland Temple. The architect, now a professor at University College, had recently been awarded the Royal Gold Medal for his work in advancing the academic study of architecture. Leo had been amused but hardly surprised to discover that Temple was as imperious and irascible as ever. The old man viewed the aristocracy as a source of patronage to keep him financially solvent, but he had contempt for their traditional and unimaginative sense of style.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not one of those parasitical dunderheads,\u201d Temple had told him emphatically, which Leo gathered had been a compliment. And later, \u201cMy influence on you cannot be eradicated, can it?\u201d And of course Leo had assured him that it could not, that he remembered and valued everything he had learned from Temple. He hadn\u2019t dared to mention the far greater influence of the elderly professor in Provence.</p><p>\u201cArchitecture is how we reconcile to the difficulties of life,\u201d Joseph had once told Leo at his atelier. The old professor had been repotting some herbs at a long wooden table, while Leo tried to help. \u201cNon, don\u2019t touch these, mon fils, you pack the roots too tightly, they need more air than you allow them.\u201d He took a pot away from Leo and resumed the lecture. \u201cTo be an architect, you have to accept the environment around you, no matter what its conditions. Then, in full awareness, you take your ideals and form them into structure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I do it without ideals?\u201d Leo had asked, only half joking. \u201cI\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t live up to them.\u201d</p><p>Professor Joseph had smiled at him. \u201cNeither can you reach the stars. But you still need their light. You need them to navigate, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>Take your ideals and form them into structure. Only in that way could a good house, a good building, be designed.</p><p>Or a good life.</p><p>And Leo had finally found the cornerstone, the essential piece to build the rest on.</p><p>A very stubborn cornerstone.</p><p>His lips curved as he considered what to do with Catherine that day, how to woo her, or annoy her, since she seemed to enjoy both equally. Perhaps he would start a small argument and kiss her into capitulation. Perhaps he would propose to her again, if he could catch her in a moment of weakness.</p><p>Heading to the Rutledge apartments, Leo entered after a careless knock, and found Poppy rushing to the entrance foyer.</p> <p>\u201cHave you\u2014\u201d she started, then broke off as she saw him. \u201cLeo. I wondered when you\u2019d get back. I didn\u2019t know where you were, or I would have sent for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, sis?\u201d he asked gently, understanding at once that something was very wrong.</p><p>Poppy looked wretched, her eyes large in her white face. \u201cCatherine didn\u2019t come up for breakfast this morning. I assumed that she wanted to sleep late. Sometimes her nightmares\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Leo gripped her cold hands, staring at her alertly. \u201cOut with it, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago I send a housemaid to Catherine\u2019s room, to see if she needed something. She wasn\u2019t there, and these were on the table by the bed.\u201d Reaching out with a trembling hand, she gave him the new silver spectacles. \u201cAnd ... there was blood on the bed.\u201d</p><p>It took Leo a moment to contain the rush of panic. He felt it as instant stinging from head to toe, and a heart-thundering blast of energy. A dizzying urge to kill.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel is being searched,\u201d he heard Poppy say over the roar in his ears, \u201cand Harry and Mr. Valentine are talking to the floor stewards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatimer has her,\u201d Leo said thickly. \u201cHe sent someone for her. I\u2019ll rip the filthy whoreson\u2019s guts out and hang him with them\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she whispered, her hand fluttering to his mouth. What she saw in his face frightened her. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Relief partially smoothed Poppy\u2019s brow as her husband entered the apartment. \u201cHarry, is there any sign?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face was grim and hard. \u201cOne of the night stewards said that last night he saw a man dressed as an employee\u2014he assumed he was newly hired\u2014carrying a laundry sack down the back stairs. He noticed it because the housemaids usually take care of laundry, and never at that time of night.\u201d He put a restraining hand on Leo\u2019s shoulder, and Leo shook him off. \u201cRamsay, keep your head. I know what you assume, and you\u2019re probably right. But you can\u2019t go dashing off like a madman. We need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me,\u201d Leo said in a guttural tone. There was no controlling what had been unleashed in him. He was gone before Harry could draw another breath.</p> <p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Harry muttered, dragging his hands through his black hair. He gave Poppy a distracted glance. \u201cFind Valentine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s still talking with the floor managers. Tell him to go to Special Constable Hembrey\u2014or whoever he can find at Bow Street, and let them know what\u2019s happening. Hembrey can start by sending a man to Lord Latimer\u2019s house. Tell Valentine to say there\u2019s a murder in progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo won\u2019t kill Lord Latimer,\u201d Poppy said, her face blanched.</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Harry replied with cold certainty, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Catherine awakened in a strange euphoria, light-headed and listless, and very glad to awaken from her nightmares. Except that when she opened her eyes, she was still in a nightmare, in a room hazed with sickening-sweet smoke, the windows shrouded with heavy curtains.</p><p>She took a long time to collect herself, straining to see without spectacles. Her jaw was sore, her mouth unbearably dry. She was desperate for a sip of cold water, a breath of clean air. Her wrists were fastened behind her back. She half reclined, half sat on a settee, dressed in her nightgown. Awkwardly she used her shoulder to try to push back some of the loose tangles of her hair that had fallen over her face.</p> <p>Catherine knew this room, blurry as it was. And she knew the old woman sitting near her, stick thin and dressed in black. The woman\u2019s hands moved with the delicacy of an insect\u2019s pincers as she lifted a thin leather hose attached to a hookah vase. Putting the hose to her lips, she sucked in a breath, held it, and expelled a puff of white smoke.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother?\u201d Catherine asked, her voice rough, her tongue thick in her mouth.</p><p>The woman moved closer, until her face came into Catherine\u2019s limited view. A powdered white face, vermillon lips. Hard, familiar eyes rimmed with kohl. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. It\u2019s my house now. My business.\u201d</p><p>Althea, Catherine realized in dull horror. A cadaverous version of Althea, the once attractive features shrunken and calcified. The face powder covered the top stratum of skin but hadn\u2019t settled into the web of wrinkles, giving her complexion the appearance of crackled glaze on porcelain. She was far more fearsome than even Grandmother had been. And she looked more than a little mad, her eyes bulging and blue-glazed like those of a baby bird.</p><p>\u201cWilliam told me he\u2019d seen you,\u201d Althea said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018We must fetch her for a long overdue visit, mustn\u2019t we?\u2019 It took a bit of planning on his part, but he executed it nicely.\u201d She glanced into a shadowed corner. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, William.\u201d</p><p>He replied in an unintelligible murmur. Or at least it was unintelligible to Catherine, through the irregular pulse that thumped in her ears. It seemed the inner systems of her body had been rearranged, a new order of channels and nerves that she couldn\u2019t quite integrate.</p> <p>\u201cMay I have some water?\u201d she asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cWilliam, give our guest some water.\u201d</p><p>He complied clumsily, going to fill a glass, standing over Catherine. Holding the cup to her lips, he watched as she sipped carefully. The water was instantly absorbed into the parched tissue of her lips, inner cheeks, throat. It carried a dusty, brackish taint, or perhaps that was just the taste of her mouth.</p><p>William retreated, and Catherine waited while her aunt puffed thoughtfully on the hookah.</p><p>\u201cMother never forgave you,\u201d Althea said, \u201cfor running away as you did. Lord Latimer hounded us for years, demanding the return of his money ... or you. But you don\u2019t care about what trouble you caused. You never gave a thought to what you owed.\u201d</p><p>Catherine fought to keep her head steady, when it kept lolling to the side. \u201cI didn\u2019t owe you my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you were too good for that. You wanted to avoid my downfall. You wanted a choice.\u201d Althea paused, as if waiting for confirmation. When none was forthcoming, she continued with soft vehemence. \u201cBut why should you have one when I didn\u2019t? My own mother came to my bedroom one night. She said she\u2019d brought a nice gentleman to help tuck me in. But first he was going to show me some new games. After that night, there was no innocent part of me left. I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>Another long inhalation through the hookah, another dizzying puff of smoke. There was no way for Catherine to avoid breathing in more. The room seemed to sway gently, as Catherine had imagined the deck of a ship would rock at sea. She floated on the waves, buoyant, listening to Althea\u2019s seething. And she felt a stirring of sympathy, but like the rest of her emotions, it remained deep under the surface, drowning.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought of running away,\u201d Althea said. \u201cI asked my brother\u2014your father\u2014to help me. He lived with us then, coming and going as he pleased. Using the whores for free any time he wanted, and they didn\u2019t dare complain to Mother. \u2018I need just a little money,\u2019 I told him. \u2018I\u2019ll go far away to the country.\u2019 But he went to Mother and told her what I\u2019d asked. I wasn\u2019t let out of the house for months afterward.\u201d</p><p>From what little Catherine remembered of her father, a brusque and pitiless individual, this story was easy to believe. But she found herself asking distantly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother liked the situation as it was\u2014he had the best of everything without lifting a finger. Mother gave him whatever he wanted. And the selfish pig didn\u2019t mind sacrificing me to keep himself comfortable. He was a man, you see.\u201d She paused. \u201cSo I became a whore. And for years I prayed for rescue. But God doesn\u2019t hear the prayers of women. He cares only for those He made in His own image.\u201d</p><p>Befuddled and squinting, Catherine labored to keep her thoughts in order. \u201cAunt,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cwhy did you bring me here? If that was done to you ... why must it be done to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should you escape when I couldn\u2019t? I want you to become me. Just as I became Mother.\u201d</p><p>Yes ... this was one of Catherine\u2019s fears, the worst one. That if she were put in the wrong situation, the wickedness in her own nature would take over all the rest.</p><p>Except ... it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s foggy brain seized on the idea and turned it over, examining it. The past was not the future. \u201cI\u2019m not like you,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWon\u2019t ever be. I grieve for what was done to you, Aunt. But I didn\u2019t make the same choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a choice for you now.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Catherine\u2019s opiated detachment, Althea\u2019s caressing tone made her flesh creep.</p><p>\u201cYou will either make good on that long-ago arrangement with Lord Latimer,\u201d Althea continued, \u201cor you will service customers in the brothel, as I did. Which shall it be?\u201d</p><p>Catherine refused to choose. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what you do,\u201d she said, drugged but intractable. \u201cNothing will change who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Althea\u2019s voice dripped with contempt. \u201cA decent woman? Too good for the likes of this place?\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s head became too heavy for her to hold up any longer. She lowered herself to the settee, resting her head on the arm. \u201cA woman who is loved.\u201d</p><p>It was the worst, most hurtful answer she could have given Althea. And it was the truth.</p> <p>Unable to open her eyes, Catherine was aware of a bustling movement nearby, of Althea\u2019s tentaclelike grip on her face, of the leather hose from the hookah shoved between her lips. Her nose was pinched shut, and she breathed in helplessly. A flood of cool, pungent smoke entered her lungs. She coughed, and was forced to draw it in again, and then she wilted into a placid and near-insensible heap.</p><p>\u201cTake her upstairs, William,\u201d Althea said. \u201cTo her old bedroom. Later we\u2019ll move her to the brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d William gathered Catherine up carefully. \u201cMa\u2019am ... may I undo her wrists?\u201d</p><p>Althea shrugged. \u201cShe certainly won\u2019t go anywhere under her own power.\u201d</p><p>William carried Catherine upstairs, settled her on the small, musty bed of her old room, and untied her hands. He arranged her arms with her hands touching at her middle, in the position of a body in a casket. \u201cSorry, miss,\u201d he murmured, looking into her half-open, unseeing eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s all I \u2019ave. I \u2019as to do what she says.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Guy, Lord Latimer, lived in a newer section of London on the west side, with a picturesque and peaceful common, and a row of stucco-fronted houses built in a deeply wooded hollow. Leo had visited the house on more than one occasion, several years earlier. Although the street and the house were neatly kept, the place was littered with distasteful memories that would have made an East End slum look like a rectory by comparison.</p><p>Dismounting from his horse before it had even halted, Leo raced up to the front door and pounded on it with his fists. All his thoughts had diverted into parallel currents, one occupied with the anguished desperation to find Catherine before harm could come to her. Or, if something already had befallen her\u2014please, God, no\u2014how to make her well again.</p> <p>The other current was directed toward the one goal of turning Latimer into butcher\u2019s refuse.</p><p>There was no sign of Harry yet\u2014Leo was certain that he was not far behind, but Leo had no inclination to wait for him.</p><p>A perturbed-looking butler opened the door, and Leo shouldered his way in. \u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your master?\u201d Leo asked brusquely.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, sir, but he is not\u2014\u201d The butler broke off with an astonished yelp as Leo grabbed him by the coat and shoved him against the nearest wall. \u201cGood God. Sir, I beg you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ... the library ... but he\u2019s not well...\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s lips curled in an evil smile. \u201cI have just the cure for him.\u201d</p><p>A footman came into the hall, and the butler began to sputter for help, but Leo had already released him. In a matter of seconds he had reached the library. It was dark and overheated, an unseasonably large fire blazing in the hearth. Latimer was slumped in a chair, his chin on his chest, a half-empty bottle in one hand. With his bloated face lit by tongues of yellow and red flame, he looked like a damned soul. His incurious gaze lifted to the harsh contours of Leo\u2019s face, and Leo saw from his difficulty in focusing that he was sow-drunk. Too bloody drunk to see a hole in a ladder. It would have taken hours of steady imbibing to arrive at this state. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The realization filled Leo with furious despair. Because the one thing worse than finding Catherine with Latimer was not finding her there. He leaped on the bastard, clenched his hands around Latimer\u2019s thick, clammy throat, and hauled him to a standing position. The bottle dropped to the floor. Latimer\u2019s eyes bulged, and he choked and spat as he tried to pry Leo\u2019s hands free.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Leo demanded, giving him a hard shake. \u201cWhat have you done with Catherine Marks?\u201d He loosened his bruising grip just enough to allow Latimer to speak.</p><p>The bastard coughed and wheezed, and stared at him incredulously. \u201cSodding lunatic! What the bloody hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you think I have her?\u201d Latimer let out a disbelieving bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cConvince me that you don\u2019t,\u201d Leo said, clenching his neck more tightly, \u201cand I may let you live.\u201d</p><p>Latimer\u2019s bloated face turned dark. \u201cI have no use for that woman, or any other harlot, because of the ... the stew you\u2019ve put me in! You are tearing my life apart! Investigations, questions from Bow Street ... allies threatening to turn on me. D\u2019 you know how many enemies you\u2019re making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as many as you.\u201d</p><p>Latimer writhed in his merciless grasp. \u201cThey want me dead, damn you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d Leo said through clenched teeth. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has become of you?\u201d Latimer demanded. \u201cShe\u2019s only a woman. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens to her, I\u2019ll have nothing left to lose. And if I don\u2019t find her within the next hour, you\u2019ll pay with your life.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone caused Latimer\u2019s eyes to widen in panic. \u201cI have nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, or I\u2019ll garrot you until you swell up like a toad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamsay.\u201d Harry Rutledge\u2019s voice sliced through the air like a sword.</p> <p>\u201cHe says she\u2019s not here,\u201d Leo muttered, not taking his gaze from Latimer.</p><p>A few metallic clicks, and then Harry placed the muzzle of a flintlock in the center of Latimer\u2019s forehead. \u201cLet go of him, Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>Leo complied.</p><p>Latimer made an incoherent sound in the sepulchral quiet of the room. His gaze locked with Harry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d Harry asked softly. \u201cI should have done this eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>It appeared that Harry\u2019s ice-cold eyes frightened Latimer even more than Leo\u2019s murderous ones. \u201cPlease,\u201d Latimer whispered, his mouth shaking.</p><p>\u201cGive me information about my sister\u2019s whereabouts in the next five seconds, or I\u2019ll put a hole in your head. Five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Latimer pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it on my life!\u201d Tears sprang from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThree. Two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d</p><p>Harry hesitated, giving him an assessing stare. He read the truth in his eyes. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he said softly, and lowered the pistol. He looked at Leo, while Latimer collapsed in a sobbing drunken heap on the floor. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have her.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a quick, bleak glance. It was the first time Leo had ever felt a kinship with Harry, sharing this moment of despair over the same woman.</p><p>\u201cWho else would want her?\u201d Leo muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s no one with a connection to her past ... except the aunt.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe night of the play, Cat happened to see a man who worked at the brothel. William. She knew him as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brothel is in Marylebone,\u201d Harry said abruptly, heading for the door. He motioned for Leo to follow.</p><p>\u201cWhy would the aunt have taken Cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps she\u2019s finally gone mad.\u201d</p><p>The brothel was sagging and flat-breasted, with trim that had chipped and been painted a thousand times until someone had finally decided the effort was no longer worth it. The windows were soot-darkened, the front door askew like a lascivious half-smile. The house next door was far smaller, stoop-shouldered, a maltreated child standing next to its promiscuous older sister.</p><p>It was often the arrangement that when a brothel was a family business, the owners lived in a separate dwelling. Leo recognized the house from Catherine\u2019s description. This was where she had lived as a na\u00efve young girl, unaware that her future had already been stolen from her.</p><p>They rode through a cross-street to a fetid alley behind the brothel, a crumbling mews with tilting sides, one of many in the labyrinth of nooks and tiny streets concealed behind the main thoroughfare.</p><p>Two men lounged in the doorway of the larger building, the brothel, one of them possessing a massive physical stature that distinguished him as the Bully of the house. In the world of prostitution, the office of Bully was to keep order at a brothel and settle disputes between whores and clients. The other man was small and slight, a hawker of some manner, with a pocketed apron knotted around his waist and a small covered handchaise at the side of the alley.</p><p>Noting the attention the visitors paid to the back entrance of the brothel, the Bully spoke in an affable tone. \u201cSporting ladies aren\u2019t working yet, guvnahs, you \u2019as to come back at nightfall.\u201d</p><p>Leo summoned all his will to keep his tone pleasant as he spoke to the strongman. \u201cI have business with the mistress of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t see you, I \u2019spect ... but you can ask Willy.\u201d The Bully gestured toward the dilapidated house with a meaty hand, his manner relaxed, his eyes sharp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo and Harry went to the dilapidated entrance of the smaller house. A cluster of nail holes was all that remained of a long-gone door knocker. Leo struck the door with his knuckles in a controlled hammer, when he longed to kick it down with the full force of his impatience.</p><p>In a moment, the door creaked open, and Leo was faced with the pale and undernourished countenance of William. The young man\u2019s eyes dilated in alarm as he recognized Leo. Had there been any color to his complexion, it would have leached out at once. He tried to close the door again, but Leo shouldered his way forward.</p><p>Grabbing William\u2019s wrist, Leo forced it upward and surveyed the bloodstained bandage on his hand. Blood on the bed ... the thought of what this man might have done to Cat ignited a rage so violent that it obliterated every other awareness. He stopped thinking altogether. A minute later, he found himself on the floor, straddling William\u2019s body and battering him mercilessly. He was dimly aware of Harry shouting his name and endeavoring to pull him off.</p><p>Alerted by the fracas, the Bully stormed through the doorway and launched at him. Leo flipped the heavier, larger man over his head, causing his body to slam to the floor with an impetus that shook the house to its frame. The Bully lurched to his feet, and his fists, the size of Sunday roasts, whipped through the air with bone-crushing force. Leo leaped back, raising his guard, then jabbed forward with his right. The Bully blocked him easily. Leo, however, did not fight according to the London Prize Ring rules. He followed with a side kick to the kneecap. As the Bully bent over with a grunt of pain, Leo delivered a fouett\u00e9, or whip kick, to the head. The Bully toppled to the floor, right at Harry\u2019s feet.</p> <p>Reflecting that his brother-in-law was one of the dirtier fighters he\u2019d ever seen, Harry gave him a short nod and headed into the empty receiving room.</p><p>The house was eerily vacant, quiet except for Leo\u2019s and Harry\u2019s shouts as they searched for Catherine. The place reeked of opium smoke, the windows filmed with such thick grime that curtains were entirely unnecessary. Every room was shrouded in filth. Dust upon dust. Corners clotted with webs, carpets blossomed with stains, wood floors scarred and buckled.</p><p>Harry saw a room upstairs where lamplight oozed into the hallway shadows, filtering through a miasma of smoke. He took the steps two and three at a time, his heart hammering.</p><p>The form of an old woman was curled on the settee. The loose folds of her black dress couldn\u2019t conceal the stick-thin lines of her body, gnarled like the trunk of a crab apple tree. She appeared only half conscious, her bony fingers caressing the length of a leather hookah hose as if it were a pet serpent.</p><p>Harry approached her, put his hand on her head, and pushed it back to view her face.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she croaked. The whites of her eyes were stained, as if they had been soaked in tea. Harry struggled not to recoil at the smell of her breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come for Catherine,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him fixedly. \u201cThe brother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, where is she? Where are you keeping her? The brothel?\u201d</p><p>Althea let go of the leather hose and hugged herself.</p><p>\u201cMy brother never came for me,\u201d she said plaintively, perspiration and tears seeping through the powder on her face, turning it into a creamy paste. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her.\u201d But her gaze chased off to the side, in the direction of the stairs leading to the third floor.</p> <p>Galvanized, Harry rushed from the room and up the stairs. A blessed waft of cool air and a ray of natural light came from one of the two rooms at the top. He went inside, his gaze sweeping across the stagnant room. The bed was in disarray and the window had been thrown open.</p><p>Harry froze, sharp pain lancing through his chest. His heart had stopped with fear. \u201cCat!\u201d he heard himself shout, running to the window. Gulping for air, he looked down at the street three stories below.</p><p>But there was no broken body, no blood, nothing on the street below except rubbish and manure.</p><p>At the periphery of his vision, a white flutter caught his attention, like the flapping of a bird\u2019s wings. Turning his head to the left, Harry drew in a quick breath as he saw his sister.</p><p>Catherine was in a white nightgown, perched on the edge of a winged gable. She was only about three yards away, having crept along an incredibly narrow sill that was cantilevered over the second story below. Her arms were locked around her slender knees, and she was shivering violently. The breeze played with the loose locks of her hair, glittering banners dancing against the gray sky. One puff of wind, one momentary loss of balance, would knock her off the gable.</p><p>Even more alarming than Catherine\u2019s precarious perch was the vacancy of her expression.</p><p>\u201cCat,\u201d Harry said carefully, and her face turned in his direction.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to recognize him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Harry said hoarsely. \u201cStay still, Cat.\u201d He ducked his head inside the house long enough to shout, \u201cRamsay!\u201d and then his head emerged from the window again. \u201cCat, don\u2019t move a muscle. Don\u2019t even blink.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, only sat and continued to shiver, her gaze unfocused.</p><p>Leo came up behind Harry and stuck his own head out the window. Harry heard Leo\u2019s breath catch. \u201cSweet mother of God.\u201d Taking stock of the situation, Leo became very, very calm. \u201cShe\u2019s as high as a piper,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be a pretty trick.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk along the sill,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of heights.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leo\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cNeither am I. But it won\u2019t hold either of us\u2014too much stress on the trusses. The ones above us are rotting, which means they probably all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there another way to reach her? From the third-story roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would take too long. Keep talking to her while I find some rope.\u201d</p><p>Leo disappeared, while Harry hung farther out the window. \u201cCat, it\u2019s me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry. You know me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Course I do.\u201d Her head dropped to her bent knees, and she wobbled. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat, wait. This isn\u2019t the time for a nap. Lift your head and look at me.\u201d Harry continued to talk to her, encouraging her to stay still, stay awake, but she barely responded. More than once she altered her position, and Harry\u2019s heart plummeted as he expected her to roll right off the winged gable.</p><p>To his relief, Leo returned in no time at all with a substantial length of rope. His face was misted with sweat, and he was drawing in deep lungfuls of air.</p><p>\u201cThat was fast,\u201d Harry said, taking the rope from him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re next door to a notorious whipping den,\u201d Leo said. \u201cThere was a lot of rope.\u201d</p> <p>Harry measured two spans of rope with his arms and began to tie a knot. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to coax her to come back to the window,\u201d he said, \u201cit won\u2019t work. She won\u2019t respond to anything I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tie the knot. I\u2019ll do the talking.\u201d</p><p>Leo had never experienced fear like this before, not even when Laura had died. That had been a slow process of loss, watching her life slip away like sand from an hourglass. This was even worse. This was the deepest level of hell.</p><p>Leaning out the window, Leo stared at Catherine\u2019s huddled, exhausted form. He understood the effects of the opium, the confusion and dizziness, the sense that one\u2019s limbs were too heavy to move, and at the same time a feeling of buoyant lightness as if one could fly. And added to that, Catherine couldn\u2019t even see.</p><p>If he managed to get her to safety, he was never going to let her out of his arms again.</p><p>\u201cWell, Marks,\u201d he said in as normal a voice as he could manage. \u201cOf all the ridiculous situations you and I have found ourselves in, this one takes the biscuit.\u201d</p> <p>Her head lifted from her knees, and she squinted blindly in his direction. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to help you. Stay still. Naturally you would make my heroic rescue effort as difficult as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on this.\u201d Her voice was slurred, but there was a familiar\u2014and welcome\u2014touch of indignation in it. \u201cWas trying to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And in just a minute, I\u2019m going to bring you inside so that we can argue properly. For the time being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to come in?\u201d Leo asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t want to argue.\u201d She lowered her head to her knees again, and gave a muffled sob.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Leo said, his emotions nearly getting the better of him. \u201cDarling love, please, we won\u2019t argue. I promise. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d He took a shuddering breath as Harry handed him the rope, looped with a perfect bowline knot. \u201cCat, listen to me ... lift your head and put your knees down just a little. I\u2019m going to throw a rope to you, but it\u2019s very important that you not reach for it, do you understand? Just sit still and let it fall into your lap.\u201d</p> <p>She held obediently still, squinting and blinking.</p><p>Leo let the loop swing a few times, testing its weight, estimating how much line to allow. He tossed it in a slow, careful motion, but the loop fell short of its mark, bouncing off the shingles near Catherine\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cYou need to throw it harder,\u201d she said.</p><p>Despite Leo\u2019s desperation and bone-deep anxiety, he had to bite back a grin. \u201cWill you ever stop telling me what to do, Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said after a moment\u2019s reflection.</p><p>He gathered up the rope and tossed the loop again, and this time it caught neatly on her knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Leo said. He fought to keep his voice calm. \u201cNow, put your arms through the circle, and lift it over your head. I want it to go around your chest. Not too fast, keep your balance\u2014\u201d His breath quickened as she fumbled with the loop. \u201cYes, just so. Yes. God, I love you.\u201d He let out breath of relief as he saw that the rope was in place, fitting just above her br**sts and beneath her arms. He gave the other end of the rope to Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Harry quickly tied it around his own waist.</p><p>Leo\u2019s attention returned to Catherine, who was saying something to him, her face drawn with a frown. \u201cWhat is it, Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to say what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I heard you say to Win that...\u201d Catherine paused, struggling to recollect. \u201cThat you would only marry a woman you were certain never to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often say idiotic things,\u201d Leo protested. \u201cIt never crossed my mind that anyone actually listens to me.\u201d</p><p>A window opened in the brothel next door, and an annoyed prostitute leaned out. \u201cThere\u2019s girls what\u2019s tryin\u2019 to sleep in \u2019ere, and you\u2019re shoutin\u2019 fit to wake the dead!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be finished soon,\u201d Leo called back to her, scowling. \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p><p>The prostitute continued to lean out. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 wiv a girl on the bleedin\u2019 roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Leo said curtly.</p><p>A few more windows opened, and more heads stuck out, with incredulous exclamations.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Oo is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she goin\u2019 to jump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGor, what a filfy mess that would be.\u201d</p><p>Catherine didn\u2019t seem to notice the audience they had attracted, her squinting gaze fastened on Leo. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d Leo said, straddling the windowsill, holding on to the frame. \u201cFor now, I want you to put your hand against the side of the house and step onto the sill. Carefully.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Catherine repeated, unmoving.</p><p>Leo gave her an incredulous glance. \u201cGood God, Marks, do you have to be stubborn now, of all times? You want me to declare myself in front of a chorus of prostitutes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded emphatically.</p><p>One of the whores called out, \u201cGo on an\u2019 tell \u2019er, dearie!\u201d</p><p>The others joined in enthusiastically. \u201cGo on, luv!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s \u2019ear it, \u2019andsome!\u201d</p> <p>Harry, who was standing just behind Leo, was shaking his head slowly. \u201cIf it will get her to come in off the blasted roof, just say it, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Leo leaned farther out the window. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said shortly. As he stared at Catherine\u2019s small, shivering figure, he felt his color run high, and his soul open with an emotion deeper than he had ever imagined could reside in him. \u201cI love you, Marks. My heart is completely and utterly yours. And unfortunately for you, the rest of me comes with it.\u201d Leo paused, struggling for words, when they had always come so easily to him. But these had to be the right words. They meant too much. \u201cI know I\u2019m a bad bargain. But I\u2019m begging you to have me anyway. Because I want the chance to make you as happy as you make me. I want to build a life with you.\u201d He fought to steady his voice. \u201cPlease come to me, Cat, because there\u2019s no surviving you. You don\u2019t have to love me back. You don\u2019t have to be mine. Just let me be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh...\u201d one of the prostitutes sighed.</p><p>Another blotted her eyes. \u201cIf she won\u2019t \u2019ave \u2019im,\u201d she sniffled, \u201cI\u2019ll take \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>Before Leo had even finished, Catherine had gotten to her feet and was creeping to the sill. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d Leo cautioned, tightening his grip on the rope as he watched the movements of her small, bare feet. \u201cDo it exactly the way you did before.\u201d</p><p>She inched toward him, her back to the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t remember doing it before,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just as well. Keep moving.\u201d Gradually Leo gathered the excess rope, as if he were reeling her in. Closer and closer she came, until she was finally within arm\u2019s reach. Leo stretched his hand as far as possible, his fingers trembling with effort. Another step, another, and then he finally had his arm around her, and he dragged her inside.</p><p>Cheers erupted from the brothel, and the multitude of windows began to close.</p><p>Leo sank to the floor with his knees splayed, his face buried in Catherine\u2019s hair. Tremors of relief ran through his body, and he let out a shuddering sigh. \u201cI have you. I have you. Oh, Marks. You\u2019ve just put me through the worst two minutes of my entire life. And for that you\u2019re going to spend years atoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only two minutes,\u201d she protested, and he choked on a laugh.</p><p>Fumbling at his pocket, he pulled out her spectacles, and placed them carefully on her nose. The world became clear again.</p><p>Harry knelt beside them and touched Catherine\u2019s shoulder. She turned and put her arms around him, hugging him tightly. \u201cMy big brother,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou came for me again.\u201d</p><p>She felt Harry smile against her hair. \u201cAlways. Whenever you need me.\u201d Lifting his head, he glanced ruefully at Leo as he continued, \u201cYou\u2019d better marry him, Cat. Any man willing to put himself through that is probably worth keeping.\u201d</p><p>It was with the greatest reluctance that Leo surrendered Catherine to Poppy and Mrs. Pennywhistle when they arrived back at the hotel. The two women brought her to her room and helped her to bathe and wash her hair. She was exhausted and disoriented, and infinitely grateful for the soothing attention. Clad in a fresh nightgown and dressing robe, she sat before the fire while Poppy combed out her hair.</p><p>The room had been cleaned and tidied, the bed changed and freshly made. The housekeeper left with an armload of damp toweling, allowing Catherine and Poppy some privacy.</p><p>There was no sign of Dodger anywhere. Remembering what had happened to him, Catherine felt her throat clench in grief. Tomorrow she would ask about the gallant little creature, but for now she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to face it.</p><p>Hearing her sniffle, Poppy reached around to give her a handkerchief. The comb moved gently through her hair. \u201cHarry told me not to bother you with this tonight, dear, but if it were me, I would want to know. After you left with Leo, Harry stayed behind until the police came to your aunt\u2019s house. They went upstairs to find your aunt, but she was dead. They found raw opium paste in her mouth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoor Althea,\u201d Catherine whispered, pressing the handkerchief against her welling eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind, to have any sympathy at all for her.

After what that dreadful man did to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam was a victim, as surely as I,\u201d Catherine said earnestly. \u201cHe was only trying to survive. Life was brutally unfair to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, dear. But you made something far better of it than he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I had Harry. And I had you and your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Leo,\u201d Poppy said, a smile in her voice. \u201cI would say you have him without question. For a man who was so determined to go through life as an observer, he\u2019s certainly been pulled back into the stream. Because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I marry him, Poppy?\u201d she asked almost timidly.</p><p>Poppy hugged her from behind, and rested her head briefly against Catherine\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure I speak for all the Hathaways in saying that we would be eternally grateful if you would marry him. I can\u2019t imagine who else would dare to take him on.\u201d</p><p>After a light supper of toast and broth, Catherine went to bed and dozed for a while, waking every now and then with a fearful start. Each time she was reassured to see Poppy reading in a chair by the bed, her hair gleaming like mahogany in the glow of lamplight.</p><p>\u201cYou should go back to the apartment,\u201d Catherine finally mumbled, not wishing to seem like a child afraid of the dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay a little longer,\u201d came the soft answer.</p><p>The next time Catherine awoke, Leo was sitting in the chair. Her drowsy gaze moved over him, taking in the contours of his handsome face, his serious blue eyes. His shirt was partly unbuttoned, revealing a shadow of chest hair. Suddenly desperate to be held against that hard, strong chest, she reached for him wordlessly.</p><p>Leo came to her at once. Wrapping his arms around her, he reclined back against the pillows with her. Catherine luxuriated in the feel and scent of him. \u201cOnly I,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwould feel so safe in the arms of the wickedest man in London.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of amusement. \u201cYou like them wicked, Marks. An ordinary man would be tame sport for a woman like you.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled closer, her legs tense beneath the bed linens. \u201cI\u2019m so weary,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be better tomorrow morning. I promise.\u201d His hand settled on her hip, over the covers. \u201cClose your eyes, love, and let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to obey. But as the minutes ticked by, she was plagued by increasing restlessness and irritated nerves, a sense of dryness that permeated to her bones. Her skin clamored to be touched, scratched, rubbed, but even the delicate chafing of the sheets was enough to make her raw.</p><p>Leo left the bed and returned with a glass of water, and she drank thirstily. Her mouth tingled agreeably from the cool wetness.</p><p>Taking away the empty glass, Leo extinguished the lamp and returned to her. She flinched at the feel of his weight depressing the mattress, the disparate information of her senses distilling into one compelling need. In the darkness, Leo\u2019s mouth found hers, tender and gentle, and she couldn\u2019t prevent her own exaggerated response. His hand came to her breast, finding the tip already hard beneath the veil of muslin.</p> <p>\u201cIt sometimes happens with opium smoke,\u201d Leo said quietly. \u201cLater with habit, it decreases. But when you first try it, it can act upon you this way. As the effects leave your body, your nerves start screaming for more of it, and the result is ... frustration.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, his hand cupped her breast, his thumb gently circling the tight bud. She felt the sensation everywhere, streamers of fire unraveling to the pit of her belly, and along her legs and arms. She panted and squirmed, too desperate to feel embarrassed by her own muffled cries as his hand slipped beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cEasy, love,\u201d Leo whispered, caressing the taut plane of her stomach. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were gentle on her swollen flesh, stroking and parting and entering, sliding easily into the moisture. She hitched upward, her body craving and willful, every movement enticing him to stroke deeper, harder.</p><p>Leo bent his head and kissed her throat. The tip of his thumb rested just above the little spot that burned with white fire, manipulating delicately as his invading fingers stretched her. It sent her into spasms of near-painful release, tearing an unwilling groan from her, and she clutched the back of his shirt in her fists until she felt the fine linen begin to rip. Breathing hard, she let go of the shirt and stammered out an apology. He stripped off the ruined shirt and hushed her with his mouth.</p><p>He spread his hand over her intimately, teasing her with exquisite care, while she whimpered and stiffened. Another burst of fire, a series of deep shudders, and she opened her thighs as he slid his fingers in. When the last vibrations had faded, she lay heavily in his arms and let exhaustion overtake her.</p><p>In the middle of the night, Catherine pressed against him furtively, needing him again. He rose above her, murmuring that she must relax, he would help her, he would take care of her, and she sobbed openly as she felt him kiss his way down her body. He lifted her legs over his shoulders and cupped her bottom in his hands. His mouth searched gently, his tongue stroking deep into the tender chalice. He did not find a rhythm but instead played with her, pulling softly, licking and nuzzling. The pleasure broke over her in waves, making her gasp in relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered as he lay beside her again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leo said gently, turning to pin her to the mattress. \u201cNo chance of that tonight. We\u2019ll have to wait until your judgment isn\u2019t clouded. By morning, most of the opium will have worn off. If you still want me then, I\u2019ll be ready and willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you now,\u201d she said, but he held her down and pleasured her with his mouth once more.</p><p>Catherine woke a few hours later, glimpsing the plum-colored sky as it began to lighten with the premonition of dawn. Leo\u2019s long body was tucked comfortably behind hers, one arm beneath her neck, the other draped across her middle. She loved the feel of him, vibrant heat and muscle, his skin like satin in some places, hair-roughened in others. Although she was careful not to move, Leo stirred and murmured.</p> <p>Slowly she reached for his hand and drew it to her breast. Leo began to fondle her before he was even awake. His lips touched the back of her neck. Feeling him harden against her bottom, she pressed against him. One of his legs intruded between hers, as his hand slid down to the light fleece of curls.</p><p>She felt the taut pressure of him, nudging against her entrance, circling into the moisture. He pushed partway inside her and stopped, while her flesh, swollen from the night\u2019s excesses, had difficulty accommodating him.</p><p>His soft, amused voice tickled her ear. \u201cMmmn ... you\u2019ll have to try harder, Marks. We both know you can take more than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>With a sympathetic murmur, he lifted her top leg and adjusted her position. Her eyes closed as she felt him slide inside her.</p> <p>\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder ... harder...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, love ... let me be gentle with you. Just for now.\u201d</p><p>He moved inside her with slow, deliberate drives, his caressing hand sliding back between her thighs. He took his time, and she had no choice but to let him. She was suffused with warmth, sensation building as he courted her, stroked her. Pressing love words and kisses against her neck, he sank more deeply inside her. She cried out his name, cresting, and he gently urged her even higher. Her shaking hand went to his hip and gripped the flexing surface.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Please, Leo.\u201d</p><p>He understood. As her wet flesh clenched around him once more, delicately wringing and pulling at the hardness, he pumped forcefully, letting himself go. And at last she knew the feel of his release, the way his belly tightened, the trembling of a powerful man rendered helpless in that ultimate moment.</p> <p>They stayed joined as long as possible, resting together and watching as the dawn seeped through the parted curtains.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cso dearly, my lord. My Leo.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her. Rising, he went to drag on his trousers.</p><p>While Leo sluiced his face at the washstand, Catherine reached for her spectacles. Her gaze happened to fall on Dodger\u2019s empty basket by the door, and her smile dimmed. \u201cPoor weasel,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Leo returned to her, instantly concerned as he saw her watering eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d she said with a sniffle. \u201cI miss him already.\u201d</p><p>Leo sat and drew her up against him. \u201cWould you like to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, she saw an odd movement beneath the door ... a furry, skinny body wiggling industriously beneath the ridiculously narrow space. Catherine blinked, afraid to move. \u201cDodger?\u201d</p><p>The ferret came loping toward the bed, chuckling and chirping, his eyes bright as he hurried to her.</p><p>\u201cDodger, you\u2019re alive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s alive,\u201d Leo said. \u201cWe put him in Poppy\u2019s apartment last night to allow you some rest.\u201d He smiled as the ferret bounded onto the mattress. \u201cMischievous little beggar. How did you get all the way down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to find me.\u201d Catherine held out her arms, and Dodger climbed up to her and snuggled against her chest. She stroked him over and over, murmuring endearments. \u201cHe tried to protect me, you know. He bit William\u2019s hand quite terribly.\u201d She nuzzled her chin against Dodger and crooned, \u201cGood little watch ferret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, Dodger,\u201d Leo said. Leaving the bed for a moment, he went to his discarded coat and rummaged through the pockets. \u201cI suppose that leads to the question ... in marrying you, am I going to be gaining a ferret, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Beatrix would let me keep him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt of it.\u201d Leo returned to sit beside her. \u201cShe\u2019s always said that he belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s rather obvious, in light of his fascination for your garters. And one certainly can\u2019t blame him for that.\u201d Leo reached for her hand. \u201cI have something to ask you, Marks.\u201d</p><p>She sat up eagerly, letting Dodger drape around her neck.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember if this is the fifth or sixth proposal,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the fourth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you yesterday. Are you counting that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t really \u2018will you marry me,\u2019 that was more \u2018will you come down off the roof.\u2014\u201d</p><p>One of Leo\u2019s brows arched. \u201cBy all means, let\u2019s be technical.\u201d He slid a ring onto the fourth finger of her left hand. It was the most breathtaking ring she had ever seen, a flawless silver opal with flashes of blue and green fire hidden deep inside. With every movement of her hand, the opal glimmered with unearthly color. It was encircled by a rim of glittering small diamonds. \u201cThis reminded me of your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly not nearly as beautiful.\u201d He paused, looking at her intently. \u201cCatherine Marks, love of my life ... will you marry me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to answer another question first,\u201d she told him. \u201cSomething you asked me before.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and put his forehead against hers. \u201cThe one about the farmer and the sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... the one about what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.\u201d</p><p>A laugh rustled in his throat. \u201cTell me your answer, love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe unstoppable force stops. And the immovable object moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmn. I like that.\u201d His lips brushed hers tenderly.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I\u2019d rather not wake up as Catherine Marks ever again. I want to be your wife as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded. \u201cAlthough ... I will miss you calling me Marks. I\u2019ve gotten rather fond of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll still call you Marks from time to time. During moments of lurid passion. Let\u2019s try it.\u201d His voice lowered to a seductive whisper. \u201cKiss me, Marks...\u201d</p><p>And she lifted her smiling mouth to his.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One year later</p><p>The cry of an infant broke through the silence.</p><p>Leo flinched at the sound, lifting his head. Having been banished from the bedroom where Catherine was giving birth, he had waited with the rest of the family in the parlor. Amelia had stayed with Catherine and the doctor, occasionally emerging to give a brief report to Win or Beatrix. Cam and Merripen were maddeningly sanguine about the process, both having seen their own wives safely through childbirth.</p> <p>The Hathaway family was proving remarkably fertile. In March, Win had given birth to a robust boy, Jason Cole, nicknamed J\u00e0do. Two months later, Poppy had produced a petite red-haired daughter, Elizabeth Grace, upon whom Harry and the entire Rutledge Hotel staff doted.</p><p>Now it was Catherine\u2019s turn. And while childbirth was a perfectly ordinary event for other people, it was the most nerve-racking experience Leo had ever gone through. The sight of his wife in pain was intolerable, and yet there was nothing he could do. It didn\u2019t matter how often he was reassured that the birth was going splendidly ... endless hours of labor pains did not seem all that splendid to Leo.</p><p>For eight hours Leo had waited in the parlor with his head in his hands, brooding and quiet and inconsolable. He was afraid for Catherine, and he could hardly bear to be separated from her. As he had predicted, he loved Catherine like a madman. And as she had once claimed, she was entirely able to manage him. They were different in so many ways, and yet somehow it made them exactly right for each other.</p><p>The result had been a remarkably harmonious marriage. They entertained each other with furious, funny bickering and long, thoughtful conversations. When they were alone, they often spoke in a kind of shorthand that no one else would have been able to interpret. They were a physical pair, passionate and affectionate. Playful. But the real surprise of the marriage was the kindness they showed each other ... they, who had once fought so bitterly.</p><p>Leo had never expected that the woman who had formerly brought out the worst in him would now bring out the best in him. And he had never dreamed that his love for her would deepen to such proportions that there was no hope of controlling or restraining it. In the face of a love this vast, a man could only surrender.</p><p>If anything happened to Catherine ... if something went wrong during the childbirth ...</p><p>Leo stood slowly, his fists clenched, as Amelia entered the parlor with a bundled-up newborn. She paused near the doorway as the family gathered around her with soft exclamations. \u201cA perfect little girl,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cThe doctor said her color is excellent and her lungs are strong.\u201d She brought the baby to Leo.</p><p>He was too afraid to move. He didn\u2019t take the baby, only stared at Amelia and asked hoarsely, \u201cHow is Marks?\u201d</p> <p>She understood at once. Her tone gentled as she replied. \u201cAbsolutely fine. She\u2019s quite well, dear, and you can go up to see her now. But first say hello to your daughter.\u201d</p><p>An unsteady sigh escaped Leo, and he took the baby from her gingerly. He looked down in wonder at the miniature pink face, the rosebud mouth. How light the baby was ... it was difficult to believe he was holding an entire human being in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of Hathaway in her,\u201d Amelia said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll do what we can to correct that.\u201d Leo bent to kiss his daughter\u2019s tiny forehead, the wisps of dark hair tickling his lips.</p><p>\u201cHave you chosen a name?\u201d Amelia asked.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench. Very pretty.\u201d For some reason, Amelia laughed quietly before asking, \u201cWhat would you have named a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Father? How lovely. And I think it suits him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits who?\u201d Leo asked, still engrossed in his daughter.</p><p>Reaching up to his face, Amelia guided him to look at the doorway, where Win stood with another bundle, displaying it to Merripen, Cam, and Beatrix.</p><p>Leo\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMy God. Twins?\u201d</p><p>Cam approached him with a broad grin. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine-looking boy. You\u2019ve come into fatherhood with a vengeance, phral. \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Leo,\u201d Beatrix added. \u201cYou\u2019ve had an heir just in time ... with one day to spare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time for what?\u201d Leo asked dazedly. Handing his daughter back to Amelia, he took his son from Win. Looking down at the infant\u2019s face, he fell in love for the second time in the same day. It was almost too much for his overwhelmed heart to endure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe copyhold clause, of course,\u201d he heard Beatrix say. \u201cThe Hathaways will keep Ramsay House now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would even think about that at a time like this,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Merripen asked, his dark eyes twinkling. \u201cPersonally speaking, I find it a relief to know that we\u2019ll all be able to stay at Ramsay House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all concerned about a bloody house, when I\u2019ve just endured eight hours of sheer hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Leo,\u201d Beatrix said, trying to sound contrite. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about what you\u2019d just been through.\u201d</p><p>Leo kissed his son and handed him carefully to Win. \u201cI\u2019m going to see Marks now. It\u2019s probably been difficult for her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her our congratulations,\u201d Cam said, a tremor of laughter in his voice.</p><p>Taking the stairs two at a time, Leo went to the bedroom where Catherine rested. She looked very small beneath the covers, her face exhausted and pale. A weary grin curved her lips as she saw him.</p><p>He went to her and pressed his mouth to hers. \u201cWhat can I do for you, love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing at all. The doctor gave me some laudanum for the pain. He\u2019s coming back in just a moment.\u201d</p><p>Continuing to lean over her, Leo smoothed her hair. \u201cDamn you for not letting me stay,\u201d he whispered against her cheek.</p><p>He felt her smile.</p><p>\u201cYou were frightening the doctor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI merely asked if he knew what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForcefully,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>Leo turned to rummage through the articles on the bedside table. \u201cThat was only because he\u2019d pulled out a case of instruments that looked more suited to a medieval inquisition than childbirth.\u201d He found a little pot of salve and applied a dab of the unguent to Catherine\u2019s dry lips.</p><p>\u201cSit with me,\u201d she said against his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d She patted the mattress invitingly.</p><p>Leo sat beside her with extreme caution, trying not to jostle her. \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised that you produced two children at once,\u201d he said, taking her hand and kissing her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re terrifyingly efficient, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they look like?\u201d she asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see them after they were washed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowlegged, with large heads.\u201d</p><p>Catherine chuckled and winced. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, actually. My dearest love...\u201d Leo pressed a kiss into her palm. \u201cI never fully realized what a woman went through during childbirth. You are the bravest, strongest person who\u2019s ever lived. A warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan, Saladin ... all milksops, compared to you.\u201d Leo paused, a grin spreading across his face. \u201cIt was well done of you to make certain one of the babies was a boy. The family is rejoicing, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we can keep Ramsay House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly. But I suspect what they\u2019re truly ecstatic about is that now I\u2019ll have to contend with twins.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know they\u2019ll be hellions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so. They wouldn\u2019t be ours otherwise.\u201d Catherine snuggled closer, and he settled her carefully against his shoulder. \u201cGuess what happens at midnight?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTwo hungry infants will wake up screaming simultaneously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ramsay curse will be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told me. Now I\u2019ll be terrified for the next...\u201d\u2014Leo paused to glance at the mantel clock\u2014\u201cseven hours and twenty-eight minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d She yawned and let her head drop more heavily against him.</p><p>Leo smiled and stroked her hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll both be fine, Marks. We\u2019ve just begun our journey ... and there\u2019s so much we have yet to do.\u201d He spoke more softly as he heard her breathing turn even and steady. \u201cRest against my heart. Let me watch over your dreams. And know that tomorrow morning, and every morning after that, you\u2019ll awaken next to someone who loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDodger?\u201d she mumbled against his chest, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cNo, your confounded ferret will have to stay in his basket. I was referring to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Catherine slid her hand up to his cheek. \u201cOnly you,\u201d she said. \u201cAlways you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
