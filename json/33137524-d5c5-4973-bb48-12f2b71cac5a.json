The size was daunting enough\u2014she couldn\u2019t see her feet or find a comfortable sitting position\u2014but the weight was the real killer. Someone with a twisted sense of humor had decided to simulate what felt like the pressure of a baby elephant. The small of her back screamed out in protest, while unexpected pressure on her bladder made her want to duck into the nearest ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>\u201cAll for a good cause,\u201d she reminded herself.</p> <p>Francesca shifted to ease the throbbing in her back and leaned against the heavy cart she\u2019d maneuvered into the service elevator of the six-story bank building. When the doors opened, she shoved her overloaded cart into the main hallway. Stacks of boxes wobbled precariously and threatened to tumble onto the carpeted floor.</p><p>It was just after five on a Friday afternoon. All around her dozens of businesspeople headed for the main elevators to start their weekend. Francesca pushed up her glasses and paused to smooth down the front of the ugliest maternity dress she\u2019d been able to find. The oversize collar dwarfed her shoulders and made her head look too small. The pinks and roses of the busy floral print sucked all the color from her pale olive skin. She\u2019d brushed powder into her hair to lighten it to a mousy brown. The little makeup she\u2019d put on had been applied to make her look tired, drawn, and unattractive.</p><p>She glanced at her watch, then squared her shoulders as she prepared to begin work.</p><p>\u201cShow time,\u201d she said softly, not that anyone was listening.</p><p>Three men from the insurance office at the end of the hall walked past her without even giving her a nod. Francesca continued to push her pile of packages slowly against the flow of foot traffic. Two women in suits gave her a quick, sympathetic smile. A man and a woman, both carrying expensive-looking briefcases, followed. The woman looked, the man didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Another corridor branched to the left. Francesca shifted her cart to make the turn. Several boxes went tumbling. A single man walked by without breaking his stride. A college-age girl stopped long enough to help Francesca pick up the boxes, then hurried toward the elevator with a call to \u201cWait for me!\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later Francesca reached her destination\u2014an office she\u2019d scouted out the previous week, chosen because the company had recently shut down. There she was, pregnant, lost, overloaded with more than a dozen boxes to be delivered, and no one to accept them. Had she been any sort of an actress, she might have been able to force out a tear or two.</p><p>The rules stipulated she was not allowed to directly ask for help. It had to be offered. She would wait for the required thirty minutes, mentally tallying who ignored her, who smiled, and who, if anyone, stopped to actually offer assistance.</p><p>This was a high-powered crowd with expensive tastes and busy lives. She didn\u2019t hold out much hope for rescue. In her experience\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou look lost.\u201d</p><p>Francesca whirled around to see a tall man standing beside her cart. A tall, good-looking man in a dark blue power suit.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said before preparing to launch into her canned speech about needing to deliver packages to a nonexistent firm. Except she couldn\u2019t remember anything she was supposed to say.</p><p>The man waited patiently. He had dark blond hair and sort of tawny-colored eyes. There was an intensity to his expression that reminded her of predators watching prey. A shiver rippled through her as she thought of gazelles being brought down for the kill. Unfortunately in her current condition she was more water buffalo than gazelle.</p><p>He looked confident, important, and powerful. Not the sort of person who should be stopping to help an unattractive pregnant woman in trouble. Men like him sent assistants to take care of life\u2019s unpleasant details.</p><p>\u201cDo you speak English?\u201d he asked, enunciating each word clearly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. Of course.\u201d She sucked in a breath, not sure what could be wrong with her. She would blame her sudden mental hiccup on food poisoning, only she hadn\u2019t eaten anything that day. \u201cI\u2019m, ah\u2014\u201d Francesca cleared her throat. Brain function returned and she launched into her spiel.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Francesca. I\u2019m supposed to be delivering these packages here\u2014\u201d She motioned to the closed and locked office door. \u201cBut there seems to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>The man glanced first at the boxes, all carefully addressed to the defunct company, then to the door where a hand-lettered sign said that Malcolm and White Data Tech was no more.</p><p>\u201cBringing these here was the last thing my boss told me to do before he left town,\u201d she went on. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get them delivered, he\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to look terrified, Francesca thought about how little she had in her checking account and how that pesky electric bill was going to come due soon. Eventually she would reap the rewards of her postgraduate education, but until she could actually slap the letters Ph.D. after her name, she seemed destined to a life of poverty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to risk his fury,\u201d the man said calmly. \u201cThese boxes aren\u2019t going anywhere today. That company closed the door about ten days ago. From what I\u2019ve heard, the main players skipped town with the last few dollars left, leaving several employees with lots of angry customers and no paychecks. What\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. A genuine, happy-to-meet-you smile that made the corners of his eyes crinkle and caused her palms to suddenly start to sweat. This was the most fun she\u2019d had in days.</p><p>Her rescuer introduced himself as Sam Reese.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of this hallway, and we\u2019ll figure out what we\u2019re going to do next.\u201d</p><p>We? They were a we?</p><p>Sam took charge of the cart, wheeling it down the hallway with an ease that made her envious. Of course, he didn\u2019t have to worry about a pregnant belly getting in the way of his actions. She trailed after him, wondering what the next step would be. How far was Sam willing to take things? In situations like this\u2014a nonemergency\u2014people generally stopped at the point of inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cJust through there,\u201d he said, pointing to a set of double glass doors.</p><p>Before Francesca could read the name of the company, one of the doors opened and a huge man stepped into the hallway. She involuntarily came to a stop to stare.</p><p>The man had to be at least six feet seven. He was built like a mountain with a massive neck and shoulders broad enough to support a couple of trailer homes. Dark-skinned, with penetrating eyes and a firm, unsmiling mouth, he looked both dangerous and more than a little scary.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d the man said, glancing between her rescuer and herself. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there might be.\u201d Sam looked back at her. \u201cMs. Marcelli was trying to make a delivery to Malcolm and White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey split last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I explained to Ms. Marcelli.\u201d He motioned to the cart. \u201cTake this inside, Jason. Store it in one of the conference rooms.\u201d He turned his attention back to her. \u201cIf your employer\u2019s expecting payment for a delivery, that isn\u2019t going to happen. At least not right now. Come on inside and we\u2019ll get this situation straightened out.\u201d</p><p>Francesca found herself being ushered into a plush office with a gray and burgundy waiting area. An attractive woman in her early forties manned the front desk. She spoke over a headset as they walked by, pausing only to nod at Sam.</p><p>\u201cI can search out Malcolm and White,\u201d Sam said as they moved down a long corridor decorated with elegant prints and the occasional slim table pushed up against a wall. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to track them down.\u201d</p><p>He sounded fierce as he spoke, as if he had a personal beef with the missing businessmen. Francesca trailed after him, torn between wondering why Sam Reese would care if a company in his building closed and trying to figure out what she\u2019d gotten herself into. They passed several large conference rooms, what looked like classrooms, and a few offices containing large desks, computers, and file cabinets. All generic stuff that didn\u2019t hint at the kind of business done here.</p><p>At the end of the hall they made a left, then a quick right before stopping in front of an open foyer containing a large desk and computer setup manned by a well-dressed young man wearing a sport coat.</p><p>\u201cJack, this is Ms. Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>The young man, probably around twenty-five and built like a football player, rose to his feet. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Francesca walked to the desk to shake hands. As she did so, her purse slipped down her arm and plopped onto the ground before she could catch it.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d she said, bending down to pick it up.</p><p>As she straightened, all the blood rushed from her head, causing the room to spin and her body to sway. For a split second she thought she was going down.</p><p>Less than a heartbeat later a strong arm encircled her, holding her in place. \u201cMs. Marcelli? Are you all right? Is it the baby?\u201d</p><p>Baby? What... oh, the baby.</p><p>Francesca shook her head slightly. Her sense of equilibrium returned enough for her to realize she was standing amazingly close to Sam. Close enough to see the surprisingly dark lashes framing his eyes. Speaking of which\u2014she stared more intently\u2014seen from such a close range, his eyes were the most unusual color. Light brown, shot with gold. Otherworldly eyes. Cat eyes.</p><p>Cat eyes on a powerful man. She felt both the heat of him and the strength. Somehow she\u2019d always assumed that executives in expensive suits were sort of wimpy under all that designer wool. She had been seriously wrong.</p><p>\u201cMs. Marcelli?\u201d</p><p>Tension filled his voice. She shook her head again and tried to shrug free of his hold. When he didn\u2019t release her, she gave him a quick smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I haven\u2019t eaten today. I do that sometimes. Work distracts me. Then I get low blood sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good for the child.\u201d</p><p>As there was no child, his concern made her feel a little guilty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she repeated. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>He slowly removed his arm from around her waist. \u201cJack, bring Ms. Marcelli some herb tea. There\u2019s a selection in the coffee room. Nothing with caffeine. Also, check to see if there are any sandwiches left from the lunch meeting.\u201d</p><p>Francesca thought about protesting again, but before she could figure out what to say without blowing her cover, she found herself being ushered into an office the size of Utah.</p><p>Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a view of Santa Barbara and mountains from one wall and Santa Barbara and a hint of ocean from the other. Tasteful paintings decorated the remaining walls. Two large leather sofas formed a conversational area in a corner. Between them and the desk was enough room to hold a kickboxing class.</p><p>Sam settled her on the sofa, then sat next to her. Before she knew what was going on, he had her hand resting in his and his fingers on the inside of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYour pulse is rapid. Would you like me to call your doctor?\u201d</p><p>She generally went to student health services whenever she needed a checkup. Somehow she didn\u2019t think her friendly chitchat with the nurse practitioner qualified as having a doctor of her own.</p><p>Although she would have to admit that having her hand cradled by a handsome man held a certain thrill. He was warm, solid, and plenty sexy. Had she looked slightly more appealing than something gacked up by a stray cat, she might have tried smiling, flirting, and witty conversation. Not that she could think of anything witty right at the moment.</p><p>\u201cNo doctor calling,\u201d she insisted, reluctantly drawing her hand free of his. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me. Although I have been taking up too much of your time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started to rise. Sam kept her in her seat with nothing more than a steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cHave some tea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>Both were an order.</p> <p>Before she could protest, Jack appeared carrying a tray. There was a steaming mug of tea, along with a wrapped deli sandwich.</p><p>\u201cWe only have turkey left,\u201d the young man said apologetically as he set the tray on the glass coffee table.</p><p>The small amount of guilt she\u2019d felt before doubled in size. \u201cLook. You\u2019re being really nice\u2014both of you. But there\u2019s no need to fuss.\u201d</p><p>The men ignored her. \u201cGet on the computer,\u201d Sam told his assistant. \u201cSee if you can track down either Malcolm or White. You\u2019ll find a file in the usual place.\u201d He turned his considerable attention back to her. \u201cYou said your boss had left for the day. How do you get in touch with him? I want to let him know that the boxes can\u2019t be delivered. I\u2019ll also make arrangements for them to be returned to him.\u201d His fierce expression softened slightly. \u201cHe should never have left you to take care of them yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind,\u201d she said weakly, feeling the floor beneath her crumbling into quicksand. In a matter of seconds she was going to sink so deep, no one would ever find her. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get in touch with him. He\u2019s, um, heading for the airport. To, ah, get on a plane.\u201d</p> <p>She mentally winced. Lying had never come easily to her. Heading to the airport to get on a plane? Why else did people go to the airport?</p><p>Francesca sighed. Somehow this experiment had gotten out of hand. According to her research, Sam shouldn\u2019t have stopped to help her, and he should never have taken things this far. The man was messing with her data.</p><p>\u201cWhat airline? What flight?\u201d He pulled a small leather-covered notebook from his jacket pocket.</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. She was in way over her head. She gave Jack a frantic \u201crescue me\u201d look which he either didn\u2019t get or chose to ignore. Jason, the big and strong, poked his head in the office to inform them that he\u2019d put the boxes in Conference Room 2. Jack disappeared with Jason, closing the door behind them. Leaving her very much alone with a man obviously capable of ruling the universe.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Ms. Marcelli, your boss\u2019s flight? His name would help, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Francesca,\u201d she said and reached for the tea. Her stomach growled, but she refused to touch the sandwich. Not while she was here under false pretenses. \u201cCan you really get in contact with someone on a plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to. It would be easier to reach him before he left. Is he driving down to Los Angeles, or taking a corporate flight out of Santa Barbara.\u201d</p><p>Francesca thought of all the times she\u2019d created situations to find out if strangers would take the trouble to stop and help her. She\u2019d had nice old ladies offer her rides, friendly couples give her directions, even the odd schoolkid help her find a lost dog. But never had anyone taken things as far as Sam Reese.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve been great,\u201d she said. \u201cReally terrific. I don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>His tawny gaze settled on her face. She regretted her dull-colored hair and oversize glasses, not to mention the deliberately unflattering makeup. Successful, gorgeous men like him didn\u2019t much inhabit her grad-school world. Why couldn\u2019t she have put on her sexy biker-girl disguise today instead of ugly-pregnant-woman?</p><p>Sam waited patiently. As if he had all the time in the world. As if he was used to people being reluctant to give up information.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to track down your boss, that\u2019s your decision,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least eat something. For the baby, if not for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>She really wished he would stop mentioning the pregnancy. Okay, so in all the years she\u2019d been doing this sort of thing, she\u2019d never once been put in a position of coming clean, but hey, this wasn\u2019t her fault. She was being overwhelmed by guilt. Well, guilt and a more-than-mild attraction to a handsome guy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pregnant,\u201d she said.</p><p>His gaze never left her face. One point for his side. She pulled off her glasses and tossed them on the table. It was a small gesture of vanity, but under the circumstance\u2014wearing the world\u2019s ugliest dress, sensible shoes, and an unflattering hairstyle\u2014it was the best she could do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grad student studying social psychology. I observe how people react under different circumstances. In my work I\u2019m trying to see if social standing, appearance, or gender influence behavior.\u201d</p><p>Sam tucked his notepad back into his jacket pocket. One eyebrow rose slightly. \u201cWill busy people eager to get home on a Friday afternoon stop and help a pregnant woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he studied her face. She wanted to say something stupid, like she cleaned up real well, but held back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the boxes?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cMixed paper recycling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deliberately chose to address them to a company that had recently closed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>This time his gaze dropped to her protruding stomach. \u201cAnd that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA medical condition.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s a device to simulate pregnancy. I borrowed it from a maternity store. Women use it to see how clothes will look as the baby gets bigger.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the glasses and glanced through the lenses. \u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. A slow, sexy smile that made her long to trade in her black sensible shoes for a pair of red strappy sandals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an easy man to fool, Francesca,\u201d he told her. \u201cIn fact, I can\u2019t think of the last time someone did. You\u2019re impressive. The fainting was a nice touch.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cActually that part was real. I haven\u2019t eaten all day and that messes with my blood sugar.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to her protruding belly. \u201cYou spend your day like this in the name of scientific research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t always dress up with a pregnancy belly. Sometimes I go out in a wheelchair, or tattoos and black leather.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the sofa. \u201cThat would stop traffic.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat depends on where I am.\u201d She reached for the tea. \u201cThere have been dozens of studies done about the effect of appearance on behavior. Do you know that more people will stop to help an attractive person than an unattractive one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are visual creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just men. Women do it, too. I\u2019m studying\u2014\u201d She stopped and put down her tea. \u201cSorry. I get on a roll. My studies fascinate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why. Who are you going to be tomorrow? If your costume involves black leather, feel free to stop by.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cActually I\u2019m supposed to be done with the research phase. My project for the summer is to write my dissertation. But the thought of spending all that time at the computer makes my skin crawl, so I\u2019ve been putting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do with the boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I can take them with me. I need to return the cart, too. I borrowed it from the building maintenance guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he gets full points for helping out the pregnant lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>Sam had a great voice, Francesca thought as a shiver rippled through her. Deep, rich, seductive.</p><p>\u201cYou get bonus points,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d He angled toward her. \u201cHow about I let you keep the points and in return you join me for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstances Francesca never would have accepted the invitation. She didn\u2019t know Sam Reese from a rock. Yes, he was plenty appealing, but in the scheme of things, did that really matter?</p><p>\u201cDumb question,\u201d she murmured as she maneuvered her truck through the early evening Santa Barbara traffic. It was early June, with the tourist season in full swing. Sidewalks were crowded, restaurants full, and traffic moved at a crawl down State Street.</p><p>\u201cAppeal matters.\u201d</p><p>So did those cat eyes, the tempting smile, and easy conversation. But the real reason she\u2019d said yes was she needed to have sex. After all, a promise was a promise.</p><p>Francesca grinned as she thought of Sam\u2019s reaction if she\u2019d told him that particular truth. Would he have bolted for safety or started unbuttoning his shirt? She liked to think it would be the latter, but she\u2019d taken a good look at herself when she\u2019d gone home to change and her out-loud shriek hadn\u2019t been from pleasure. Nope, the man would have run for his life.</p><p>One shower with three shampoos to get the powder out of her hair, a quick change of clothes, and a light dusting of makeup later, she was ready to if not dazzle, then at least intrigue. She figured with as bad as she\u2019d looked before, anything would be an improvement.</p><p>So she was off to dazzle Sam Reese and see what she could do about keeping her promise... the one she\u2019d made to have sex with the next attractive, single man to cross her path.</p><p>2</p><p>F rancesca knew she wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore when the restaurant\u2019s valet parking cost more than a recent lunch at McDonald\u2019s. She smiled brightly as the well-dressed, blond surfer valet looked disgustedly at her ten-year-old truck, then took the keys with a shake of his head. She could only imagine what the guy would have done if she\u2019d still been pregnant and, well, ugly. No doubt he would have shown her to the back of the restaurant.</p><p>Francesca dismissed him from her mind and instead focused on the beauty of the evening. The sun hovered at the horizon, casting a golden glow over the courtyard entrance to the restaurant. She was about to have dinner with a very nice man who, if he played his cards right, would help her fulfill the commitment she\u2019d made to her sisters.</p><p>Two months ago, after too much wine and way too many cookies, she\u2019d promised Katie and Brenna she would do the wild thing with the first normal single man she met, thus ending a self-imposed three-year celibacy. Her willingness to do something so completely out of character had a whole lot more to do with the lack of romance and fun in her life than it did with the dare itself. Not that she wanted a commitment. Been there, done that. But a sexy man and warm summer night... that was another matter.</p><p>In the past sixty-three days she hadn\u2019t come across one appropriate candidate, which said something about the state of her social life... or lack thereof.</p><p>Then Sam had appeared. He\u2019d rescued her, made her pulse quicken, and asked her to dinner. She didn\u2019t need her tea leaves read to recognize a sign when she saw one, she thought with a smile. As this one had been in all capital letters and italics, she couldn\u2019t have missed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>The smooth red-wine-and-chocolate voice came from behind her, causing her to jump. She turned and saw Sam standing next to a gleaming silver car. She couldn\u2019t quite see the type of sedan, but she didn\u2019t doubt that it was expensive.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve been able to sneak up on me.\u201d</p><p>His tawny gaze settled on her face... which gave her a distinctly unsettled feeling. He stood about six two or three. She was five nine and had put on two-inch heels, but still had to tilt her head slightly to study his face.</p><p>\u201cI sneak by profession,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look terrific.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the black dress she\u2019d pulled on. She\u2019d bought it on impulse from a guy selling them out of the back of a truck on campus. With the designer label cut out and not a tag in sight, she\u2019d had a feeling the merchandise hadn\u2019t been exactly legal. But the price had been amazing and the dress made her feel elegant and sophisticated. Two things she knew she would need tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held out her arms, sucked in her stomach and turned slowly. \u201cThe miracles of modern medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a boy or a girl?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was more of a beanbag mound. Undetermined gender.\u201d</p> <p>As she came to stop in front of him, she flipped back her long hair, a gesture she\u2019d perfected at age fourteen and hadn\u2019t had reason to use in years.</p><p>This was fun. Maybe she\u2019d been too hasty in settling in to her years of celibacy. There was something to be said for appreciation in a man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Sam took her hand and placed it in the crook of his arm.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, motioning to the open courtyard of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>Why not? Well, for one thing, there was a growing knot of nerves in the pit of her stomach. Sam was smooth. The men of her acquaintance didn\u2019t dress like GQ and act like James Bond. The guys in grad school were more jeans and Taco Bell.</p><p>Oh, well. She\u2019d said she was going to get back in the swim of things and had decided throwing herself in the deep end was the quickest way. If her plan backfired, she would dog-paddle to the side and drag her wet butt out of the pool.</p><p>The visual metaphor made her smile.</p><p>As they walked into the restaurant, Francesca curled her fingers and felt the softness of Sam\u2019s wool jacket and the hint of powerful muscle just beneath the fabric. Very masculine. Very not her life. Very something she might want to experiment with.</p><p>They reached the podium, where the hostess smiled at Sam. \u201cGood evening, Mr. Reese. Your table is ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man with his own table,\u201d Francesca murmured. \u201cWow. If you come here often enough, do you get other pieces of furniture?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Last year they gave me a chair and a sideboard.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m impressed you know what a sideboard is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an impressive guy.\u201d</p><p>Sam placed his fingers over hers and squeezed slightly. The soft pressure, not to mention the heat of his touch, nearly made her stumble.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re confident,\u201d she said as they were shown to a table tucked into an alcove. Several tall, potted plants gave the space a sense of privacy.</p><p>Sam released her hand and moved to hold out a chair. As she sat down, she tried to remember the last time anyone had done that for her, and came up with the answer.</p><p>Never.</p><p>He moved around the table and settled across from her. The hostess put menus on the table and left.</p> <p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re not sure? Do you fake it?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cI never have to fake it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could think all that bravado was covering up for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen one would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cFair enough. Although I can see I\u2019m going to have to be on my toes with you. I\u2019m glad I have a background in psychology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that because you\u2019re not the trained professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared with a wine list. Sam waited until the server left, then held up the list. \u201cDo you have an interest?\u201d</p><p>Francesca considered the question. \u201cNot as much as my sister, but I\u2019ll look.\u201d</p><p>Sam watched Francesca slowly turn pages. Her long dark hair rippled with her every movement and caught the light. The rich brown color was a contrast to the mousy brown it had been earlier.</p><p>She\u2019d discarded her glasses, the pregnancy belly, and the unflattering dress. In their place she wore a black dress that hugged slender curves and long, sexy legs. Her skin was clear, a pale olive color that appeared luminescent. Hazel eyes\u2014more green than gold or blue\u2014widened as she read an entry. She had the kind of mouth that got a man in trouble, and he found himself wanting to be first in line for whatever she might be offering.</p><p>On the way over he\u2019d told himself he was an idiot for asking her to dinner. He\u2019d first offered to help because she\u2019d been in trouble and that\u2019s what he did.</p><p>Then he\u2019d looked closer and he\u2019d seen... possibilities.</p><p>She closed the wine menu and passed it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou see anything you like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let you pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a test?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She turned her attention to her menu. \u201cWhat\u2019s good here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you already know what you want?\u201d</p><p>He waited until she\u2019d glanced up before answering. \u201cI know exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>The words got the reaction he\u2019d been hoping for. Her eyes widened and her take-me-I\u2019m-yours mouth curved.</p><p>\u201cOne point for your side,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre we keeping score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the prize for winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want it to be?\u201d As soon as she said the words, she held up a hand. \u201cPretend I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGetting in over your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. I\u2019m not going to ask if you are. I can already guess the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. What do you want for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNo. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychology major. It\u2019s a touchy-feely fringe science. Attracts a lot of vegetarians.\u201d</p><p>She delighted him by laughing. \u201cAs long as you haven\u2019t allowed yourself to be swayed by ill-informed stereotypes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to ask what your style is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. So what are you ordering?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSteak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little clich\u00e9d.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared and discussed the evening\u2019s specials. Francesca chose a baked chicken dish, while he had his usual. He ordered a bottle of Wild Sea Vineyards Cabernet.</p><p>\u201cInteresting choice,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cThe wine I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re local. Central California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She tilted her head, her hazel eyes bright with emotions he couldn\u2019t read. \u201cSo, Sam Reese, why did you invite me to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy question. You fooled me. That doesn\u2019t happen very often. I was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy my disguise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I should have been able to see through it and I didn\u2019t. When you fainted, I was terrified we were going to be delivering a baby right there in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been a shame to spoil such nice carpeting.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI was pretty unattractive. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t run in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>Their waiter returned and showed Sam the bottle of wine. When Sam nodded, the young man opened it, then poured a small amount into Sam\u2019s glass. He took a sip.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d</p><p>Francesca waited until the waiter had left before tasting her wine.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs you said, it\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>There was something in her voice. Something he couldn\u2019t place. Amusement? Annoyance? Both?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you accept my invitation to dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Good answer, he thought as his gaze settled on her lush mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you do,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw a very nice office with lots of room, but no clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run Security International. We\u2019re based here in Santa Barbara, although we operate all over the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal. We provide bodyguards on a temporary or full-time basis. We have a security consulting division, and we will train other people\u2019s bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>She looked startled. \u201cLike the movie?\u201d</p><p>He knew which one she meant. \u201cMy people get fired for sleeping with a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re paid to stay alert, not get lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny famous clients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She waited expectantly, then laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me any names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a hint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really big guy back at the office. Jason. He\u2019s one of your bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t exactly blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s not what the client wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slow smile. \u201cEspecially me.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her wine. \u201cEven now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to see?\u201d</p><p>Francesca was willing to bet Sam hadn\u2019t spent more than fifteen minutes without a woman circling in his orbit. Her specifications had been clear\u2014she would throw herself at the first eligible, attractive guy she ran into. She\u2019d thought the situation might be nerve-racking and awkward; she hadn\u2019t considered she would be a bush-league rookie playing with the pros.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you want to flash the staff,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an upscale restaurant, and they frown on that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her wine, which actually wasn\u2019t bad. Not that she would be telling her sister.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe safety\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>As if they were talking about the gun. \u201cI\u2019m cautious and sensible. Not afraid.\u201d She put the glass down. \u201cHow long have you been in the security business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my life. My grandfather founded the company.\u201d</p><p>She knew all about family concerns. \u201cAny siblings to share the responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy father died when I was a kid. My mom passed away a few years ago, though we were never close. Now there\u2019s just my grandfather and myself.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared and set their salads in front of them. Francesca stared at the artful arrangement of baby greens, apple slices, blue cheese, and walnuts. Her mind whirled with possibilities.</p><p>Married? No. That wasn\u2019t an option. Her luck couldn\u2019t be that bad. There was no way the first guy she\u2019d been attracted to in the past three years could be\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married, are you?\u201d she blurted.</p><p>Sam paused in the act of bringing his fork to his mouth. He set the utensil down.</p><p>She braced herself for a joke or teasing, or something snide. Instead his expression turned serious. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked you to dinner if I were married or involved.\u201d</p><p>Relief blended with the flavor of the cheese. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Any current or former Mr. Marcellis floating around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, Marcelli is my maiden name. But I was married several years ago. He passed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou must have married young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt eighteen. Right on time, according to my rather twisted family\u2019s expectations.\u201d She speared a slice of apple. \u201cI come from an Irish-Italian family. Very large, very traditional. We\u2019re supposed to marry young and procreate with abandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile. \u201cNot that I know about.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI had an ill-fated marriage. I was all of twenty-two, off in Europe, out of college, and on my own. We didn\u2019t make it to our first anniversary.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe were both too young. No kids, which is good. Divorce is tough on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his wine. \u201cEnough serious conversation. Do you plan to seduce me later?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Francesca had been drinking, she would have spit.

My grandfather had a branch office in Los Angeles for a while, but the base of operations has always been here.\u201d</p><p>They talked about the changes in the city in the past ten years, how celebrities both wanted and thwarted a bodyguard\u2019s ability to protect, and the various experiments she\u2019d set up to help her with her research.</p> <p>Sam had nearly finished his steak when he glanced at her nearly full glass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like your wine?\u201d</p><p>She touched the stem. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca. What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of Wild Sea Vineyards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>Plans? With him? Now that he mentioned it\u2014</p><p>She deliberately broke off in mid-thought. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anywhere else I\u2019d rather be,\u201d he said. \u201cSo tell me a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d At least this was a safe topic. No double entendres, not even a hint of sexual tension.</p><p>\u201cIn 1923 two friends, Antonio Marcelli and Salvatore Giovanni, came to America from Italy. They were both second sons with no hope of inheriting their families\u2019 businesses. They vowed to show their respective families that they would be big successes. They settled in Central California and carefully tended the treasures they had brought with them.\u201d She paused and smiled. \u201cGrapevines.\u201d</p><p>Sam leaned back in his chair. She was one surprise after the other. \u201cFrancesca Marcelli? As in Marcelli Wines?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to the bottle on the table. \u201cThe Giovanni family, I presume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. The virgin soil, the windswept hills, the temperate climate were all perfect for growing grapes. Antonio and Salvatore bought land next to each other. They shared labor, celebrated victories, and together toasted their first harvest. In time they returned to Italy to ma rry, then came back to California and settled down to have happy lives. Wild Sea Vineyard and Marcelli Wines were born. Antonio and Salvatore each had one son and two daughters.\u201d</p><p>She paused to take a drink of water. He leaned forward. \u201cYou grew up listening to that story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour voice changes when you talk about the family history.\u201d More than her voice. Her eyes stared past him to focus on a long-ago place.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother talks about the old days. I guess I\u2019m repeating what she says.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath and continued. \u201cEvents in Europe in the late 1930s worried the friends. With the German occupation of France and threats to Italy during the Second World War, there was great concern for the state of the vineyards. Would generations of healthy stock be destroyed? Antonio and Salvatore went to Europe, where friends offered cuttings. They traveled, collecting more and more cuttings from the most famous vineyards in France and Italy. Then they returned home to graft their legacy to their strongest vines. Whatever happened in Europe, the traditions would continue in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a more European flavor to Wild Sea wines,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t say the same about Marcelli wines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo one knows exactly what happened or why. At first both sets of cuttings did well, but over time those planted on Marcelli lands began to die. Antonio accused Salvatore of cursing his lands or poisoning his grapes. The two men had a falling out, as did the families. Friendships ended, engagements were broken. To this day, Marcelli Wines and Wild Sea Vineyards are mortal enemies.\u201d</p><p>He liked the story, but then he found that he liked everything Francesca had to say.</p><p>\u201cAny spilt blood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot our style,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re more the heated conversation types. Actually my grandfather, Antonio\u2019s son, is the one most interested in carrying on the feud. My parents have never been that enthusiastic about old fights, and my sisters and I don\u2019t really have the invested emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho runs Wild Sea now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore\u2019s great-grandson, Nicholas.\u201d She rested her fingertips on the bottle. \u201cThey flourished with their new European cuttings. While we\u2019re a successful enterprise, they are an international conglomerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou study psychology, not wine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa Lorenzo says the vines must be a passion. They never were for me. My sister, Brenna, has them in her blood.\u201d</p><p>Their waiter took away the plates. Francesca shook off an offer of dessert. Sam handed him a credit card.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner,\u201d she said when they were alone again. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Sam smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Heat sparked to life inside her midsection. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night? Unless you already have plans.\u201d</p><p>She supposed she should play hard to get. That\u2019s what Mia, her baby sister, was always saying. Francesca had never been very good at following directions.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is fine.\u201d</p><p>Sam pulled a business card from his jacket pocket and wrote on the back. \u201cMy home number,\u201d he said when he passed it to her. He drew out another card. \u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>As she told him the number, he wrote it down. When he was finished, she glanced at his business card. She scanned the information, then visually stumbled when she read the title under the name.</p><p>President and CEO.</p><p>\u201cYou run the company,\u201d she said, trying not to panic. Of course he did. Why would that change anything?</p><p>\u201cFor a few years now.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to his face. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four.\u201d</p><p>The waiter interrupted them when he handed Sam his credit card and a receipt to sign.</p><p>When Sam had finished, he glanced at her. \u201cHave I converted you to Wild Sea wines?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cUnlikely. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve had Wild Sea Cab before. It was actually pretty good. Not that I\u2019ll tell my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would probably want to cut you out of his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or throw me out of the family.\u201d</p><p>Sam tucked the receipt into his jacket pocket, rose, and moved behind her. As she stood, he pulled the chair away, then settled a hand on the small of her back.</p><p>She felt the heat of his palm and fingers all the way through to her skin, and found herself fighting the instinctive urge to step closer.</p><p>Surfer valet met them by the courtyard. He gave Sam a quick salute and pointed down the street. Francesca followed the direction and saw her truck parked behind a gleaming silver sedan. Sam held out his free hand, and the valet dropped two set of keys into them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to get the cars?\u201d she asked, confused by the circumstances.</p><p>Sam handed her the truck\u2019s keys and slipped the others into his jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cI arranged for our cars to be brought around and parked down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more private. It\u2019s not as if I want an audience when I kiss you good night.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>F rancesca told herself that a man with a plan was a good thing. She should applaud Sam\u2019s sensible nature. Instead she suddenly felt awkward, nervous, clumsy, and just a little tingly. The odd combination of apprehension and anticipation did not sit well on her baked chicken entr\u00e9e.</p><p>The hand resting on the small of her back propelled her up the street. Sam drew her off the sidewalk, between her truck and his car. She had to admit it was private. And quiet. Very quiet. Voices from the restaurant seemed distant. Somewhere a radio played. The night was warm and clear. Everything was in place and pretty darned perfect\u2014except for her sudden need to throw up.</p><p>What had seemed sensible, even funny, when she\u2019d talked with her sisters about having sex with a stranger now seemed insane. What had she been thinking? If she threw herself into the deep end, she was going to end up wet, cold, and quite possible caught up in a riptide. Not that pools had riptides, but still. There were\u2014</p><p>Sam took her face in his hands, then bent low and kissed her. Just like that. She was stuck holding her purse and her keys, which meant she had nothing for her hands to do but sort of twist there on the ends of her arms. Real attractive. If she was the least bit\u2014</p><p>Long dormant nerves came back to life with a loud yippee. She went from intellectual awareness of what he was doing to actually feeling it in a nanosecond. Sam was kissing her. His warm firm mouth brushed against hers, moving slowly, discovering, touching. She could feel heat, from him and within herself. His long fingers stroked her cheeks, then he dropped his hands to her shoulders. She felt both limp and energized. Nothing could have compelled her to move. She wanted the kiss to go on forever.</p><p>He tilted his head and pressed a little harder. Tingling sensations shot through her, making her heart pound harder. For the first time in years she remembered that her breasts were exquisitely sensitive. Her skin tightened everywhere, anticipating the touch of his hands. Hunger filled her and she realized she\u2019d been starving for this kind of intimacy for what felt like three lifetimes.</p><p>He stroked her lower lip with his tongue. A shiver rippled through her as delight overtook whatever common sense she might have once possessed. She raised one hand\u2014the one holding the keys\u2014and wrapped her arm around the back of his neck. He was just tall enough that she had to go on tiptoes. Sam responded by pulling her close so that they touched... everywhere.</p><p>Hard to her soft. She\u2019d heard the words a thousand times, read them in books, but never before had they made so much sense. Every part of him was hard, solid, and unyielding. Her curves molded around him. She felt soft and feminine. She felt safe. When he licked her lower lip again, she parted to admit him.</p><p>At the first brush of his tongue against hers, she felt as if she could fly. At the second, fire consumed her, heating without burning, exciting her to the point of confusion. She couldn\u2019t remember sensations like this. Not when she\u2019d been kissed in the past. She must have been doing something wrong before\u2014or something right this time.</p><p>She wanted more. She wanted all of it. She wanted him to kiss her until she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t do anything but feel and want and need.</p><p>She tried to move closer. When that wasn\u2019t possible, she started to kiss him back. Which was when he moved away, forcing her to pull her arm from around his neck.</p><p>\u201cStreet,\u201d Sam said, stepping back a little.</p><p>Francesca stared at him. \u201cStreet?\u201d</p><p>His gold-brown eyes seemed darker than they had before, and brighter. His lips were damp, making him look even more sexy and powerful. Desire swamped her.</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on the street.\u201d</p><p>Okay. And that mattered how?</p><p>Then reality sank in. The street. She glanced around and realized there were several houses nearby and cars. People out walking their dogs, patrons from the restaurant.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped talking because she didn\u2019t know what to say. A confession that she\u2019d been overcome by passion would only be embarrassing. If not for him, then for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>All right? She was perfect. She was so good, she could have started singing opera.</p><p>She went for a cool, confident, I-do-this-sort-of-thing-all-the-time smile. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>She turned toward her truck and headed for the driver\u2019s door. Whatever sophistication she might have faked crumbled when she completely missed the door lock and nearly put the key through the side of her truck.</p><p>She felt herself blush. \u201cOops,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder and saw him standing behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow afternoon and set up a time for tomorrow night. Will you be in?\u201d</p> <p>In? She would probably be curled up on the sofa, reliving the best kiss since Kelly McGillis and Tom Cruise did the tongue thing in Top Gun. \u201cSure. I have to work on my dissertation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and climbed into the truck. Sam stepped close.</p><p>\u201cThank you for tonight,\u201d he said and carefully closed her door.</p><p>She wanted to respond in kind, or say something clever. But her mind was still reeling from the kiss. So she settled on a wave, then she started her engine and pulled out onto the road.</p><p>As she drove through the intersection, she began humming a peppy tune from Toscanini.</p> <p>Francesca didn\u2019t sleep much that night, and woke with the sun the following morning, so it took half of a second pot of coffee to get her brain functioning.</p><p>Once she was able to think in complete sentences, she cleared her tiny kitchen table of a stack of textbooks, grabbed a sheet of notebook paper and sat down to make a list.</p><p>There were the usual chores of laundry, grocery shopping\u2014always a challenge with her budget\u2014and vacuuming. Then there was the outline for her dissertation that had been due ten days ago and was yet to be started. Finally there was the thrill of doing her best not to think about Sam, their previous date, their future date, and the impending phone call.</p><p>She felt giddy. She felt wonderfully alive and in tune with the cosmos. She felt more than a little stirring low in her belly. Her heretofore silent female bits were currently line dancing in anticipation of rousing activity.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually know he\u2019s going to want to have sex,\u201d she told herself sternly as she poured a fourth cup of coffee. \u201cOne kiss does not a physical relationship make.\u201d</p><p>True. But it had been an amazing kiss. One that deserved, if not its own national holiday, then at least a stamp.</p><p>The way Sam had pulled her close and taken charge. The feel of his mouth on hers. The taste of him, the heat that they\u2019d\u2014</p><p>A knock on the door interrupted her musings. Reluctantly Francesca banished her R-rated thoughts and crossed to the door. When she pulled it open, she found Mia, her baby sister, standing on the threshold.</p> <p>\u201cI came to say good-bye,\u201d Mia said as she stepped into the small apartment. \u201cDo you have coffee? Something for breakfast? I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cAnything else in your list of demands? How about money? You want a loan?\u201d</p><p>Mia hugged her. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re broke.\u201d</p><p>On that cheerful note she led the way into the kitchen.</p><p>Francesca followed, then leaned against the door frame as Mia poured coffee and added a large splash of milk. She took a sip, then set the mug on the counter and opened the freezer door.</p><p>\u201cDid Brenna leave any doughnuts in here?\u201d she asked as she rummaged through a couple of frozen entr\u00e9es, ravioli sent over by Grandma Tessa, and an emergency pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Francesca said, then shook her head as Mia held up a foil-wrapped container.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you check for stuff like this?\u201d she asked. \u201cBrenna lived with you for almost a month after she and Jeff split up. Didn\u2019t it occur to you that she would have put doughnuts in the freezer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone with a degree in psychology, you sure don\u2019t know your twin.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cI thought she\u2019d take the doughnuts with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Mia finished unwrapping the Krispy Kremes and slid them onto a paper towel. Then she set them in the microwave and punched in fifteen seconds.</p><p>The old machine whirred and shook slightly as it hummed to life. Mia frowned.</p><p>\u201cIs this safe? Are we going to get radiation burns from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think microwaves use radiation.\u201d</p><p>As if not willing to risk any potential danger, Mia took a step back. Francesca grinned.</p><p>When the timer beeped, Mia pulled out the paper towel and carried it to the table. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so. If Brenna left the food in the house, then it\u2019s legally mine.\u201d</p><p>Mia grabbed her coffee and pulled out a chair. Despite the relatively early hour on a Saturday, she looked alert and rested. Her big eyes were bright and clear. Her dark hair had been freshly streaked with blond highlights, and for once she wasn\u2019t wearing enough makeup to make a Vegas showgirl proud.</p><p>Francesca settled across from her and took one of the steaming doughnuts.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your face?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mia wrinkled her nose. \u201cMom begged me not to look slutty this summer while I\u2019m in D.C. That was her exact word. Do I look slutty to you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca studied the pretty features, the round cheeks and grinning mouth. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Mia balled up a napkin and threw it at her. \u201cKatie\u2019s always getting on me about my makeup, too. I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re all so old. You\u2019re just jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Mia finished her doughnut and reached for another. \u201cMy plane leaves early tomorrow. The folks are driving me into L.A. this afternoon, and I\u2019m spending the night at an airport hotel. In-room movies and room service. Wanna come? It\u2019s on them. And don\u2019t say you don\u2019t mooch. This is different.\u201d</p><p>Francesca was more concerned with her date that night than sponging off her parents. \u201cI know it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn. You know Mom and Dad would love to help you out financially. Why don\u2019t you let them? I\u2019m in college and they help me. Should I feel guilty?\u201d</p><p>It was a familiar argument. \u201cOf course not. Mia, you\u2019re eighteen, you\u2019re brilliant, and of course the folks want to pay for your school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re old. That doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ignore the \u2018old\u2019 part,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cI was married. I\u2019ve been on my own. It was my choice to go to college after Todd died, and it\u2019s important for me to pay my own way. I want to be independent\u2014it\u2019s one of the reasons I took back my maiden name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think that old poophead would have at least left you a few bucks,\u201d Mia grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think,\u201d Francesca agreed. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t and I\u2019m doing fine.\u201d</p><p>Mia eyed the small dark kitchen. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Now let\u2019s talk about you. Are you excited to go to Washington?\u201d</p><p>Mia shimmied in her chair. \u201cD.C. is going to be so great. I still wish I was taking my language class in Japan, but this is nearly as good. I figure when I\u2019m not studying, I\u2019ll hang out by the Capitol and meet some cute congressional aides.\u201d She sipped her coffee. \u201cI mean, I am recovering from a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. Mia might have recently broken up with her fianc\u00e9, but there weren\u2019t any broken hearts in sight.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have moved from \u2018recovering\u2019 to \u2018recovered,\u2019 \u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cI guess. Which means it\u2019s really good I didn\u2019t marry David, huh? So what are you doing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual. Errands.\u201d She motioned to the list she\u2019d started.</p><p>Mia picked it up.</p><p>Exactly two seconds later Francesca realized her mistake. Mia got it about five seconds after that. Her baby sister\u2019s mouth dropped open, she snorted, then gave a strangled gasp-laugh.</p><p>\u201cCheck your diaphragm? Somehow I know we\u2019re not talking about breathing devices.\u201d</p><p>Francesca refused to be embarrassed. She reached across the table to take back her list.</p><p>Mia held it out of reach. \u201cUh-uh. No way. First you talk. Then I return personal possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d She picked up a doughnut and took a bite.</p><p>Mia stared at her. \u201cFive words doesn\u2019t count as talking. I want details. Start at the beginning and speak slowly.\u201d</p><p>Francesca figured there was no point in putting off the inevitable. Mia had the same stubborn trait as all the Marcelli sisters. \u201cWhen I was married to Todd, I had a bad reaction to being on the Pill, so I started using a diaphragm. In the years since, I\u2019ve had occasion to dust it off once or twice, and I was curious if it was still around.\u201d</p><p>Mia dropped the list and slapped her hands on the table. \u201cYou are such a liar.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded. \u201cI know. I was practicing to see if I was any better at it. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stink. Now spill your guts, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Brenna moved back home, she, Katie, and I were talking one afternoon. Actually we were drinking wine and eating too many cookies, but that\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p><p>Mia pouted. \u201cDammit, why do I always miss the fun stuff? You guys are always hanging out and not including me. I hate that. It\u2019s because you and Brenna are twins and Katie\u2019s only a year older. I\u2019m the leftover kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mia. It wasn\u2019t on purpose. And for the record, we all love you to pieces. You\u2019re not the leftover kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less annoying. So tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Francesca drank more coffee. \u201cWe were talking about boys we\u2019d liked in high school but hadn\u2019t slept with. We talked about Jeff and Todd and Zach. They got on me about not dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr having sex,\u201d Mia added.</p><p>\u201cThat, too. Basically I agreed to sleep with the next normal, available guy I ran into.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to cruise the neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I met someone yesterday. I was working and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mia groaned and leaned forward until her head was resting on the table. \u201cPlease. Not the tattooed biker chick. Tell me you weren\u2019t her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Mia straightened, then gagged. \u201cThat\u2019s gross. He asked out a pregnant lady? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, nothing. He helped me out. We went back to his office, where he guilted me into telling him the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cHe was really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Nice. That must have been painful. Tell me he\u2019s at least good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. Really good-looking.\u201d She reached for her purse and dug out his business card, then passed it to Mia.</p><p>Her sister took it and read. \u201cPresident and CEO? Okay, I take back the gross comment.\u201d She set the card on the table. \u201cIf you\u2019re just now hunting for birth control, I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t do it last night.\u201d</p><p>Francesca was shocked. \u201cI do not have sex on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked unimpressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know that. It would take you dating to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Okay. No, we didn\u2019t do it. We kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a religious experience.\u201d</p><p>Mia chuckled. \u201cWay to go, Sis.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cLet me guess. He\u2019s the reason you can\u2019t join me in Los Angeles for a night of in-room movies and room service?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly. We have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d Mia rose and stretched. \u201cSo let\u2019s find that diaphragm of yours. I want to see what it looks like and you need to practice. It sounds to me like someone might be getting lucky.\u201d</p><p>Francesca followed her into the bedroom. \u201cI thought guys got lucky and girls put out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Mia flopped down on the bed. \u201cSo start looking.\u201d</p><p>Francesca walked to her dresser but didn\u2019t pull out any drawers. She\u2019d added the diaphragm to her to-do list on impulse. She wasn\u2019t actually expecting to get naked with Sam, was she? She\u2019d been a virgin when she married Todd, and after his death she\u2019d never been all that sexually active. There was an assortment of reasons, most of which could be the subject of their own psych term paper.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d promised her sisters, and yes, keeping that promise was the only way she was going to enter the mainstreaming dating world, but still. Sex with a stranger? She reminded herself that simple sex beat a complicated relationship any day.</p><p>Mia groaned. \u201cI can hear you talking yourself out of it from here. Francesca, come on. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Mia flipped onto her stomach. \u201cTrust me. Life with sex is pretty thrilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe my eighteen-year-old sister is offering me advice on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe my twenty-seven-year-old sister needs it. Now, start looking.\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t have to look. She knew exactly where the device in question was parked. She opened the top drawer and moved a pile of socks. The slim blue case sat in the corner.</p><p>When she pulled it out of the drawer, Mia sat up. \u201cHow does this thing work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt provides a barrier against invading sperm,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cYou put a gel on first, then fold the diaphragm in half and insert it.\u201d</p> <p>Mia looked doubtful.</p><p>Francesca opened the case and took out the birth-control device. Mia peered at it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t go on the Pill?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like I said, I had a bad reaction last time. The problem is, even if I could, I have to wait until I can get to a doctor for a prescription.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and then you have to wait for your period to start. Bummer.\u201d She poked at the diaphragm. \u201cI guess this could work, but I gotta tell you that putting it in will really break the mood.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hadn\u2019t thought that part through. \u201cGood point. I guess I can put it in before I leave, although that seems so sleazy. Like I\u2019m expecting something to happen.\u201d</p><p>So many issues to work through, she thought as she walked into the small bathroom and took the diaphragm from its case. She turned on the water and rinsed it.</p><p>Mia followed. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Francesca laughed. \u201cNot so I want to admit.\u201d She liked Sam. They\u2019d had a good time the previous evening. And the kiss, well, she\u2019d already spent plenty of time reliving that. Was she ready to take things to the next level? Did she\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Francesca glanced down at the diaphragm. She\u2019d filled it with water, and now the liquid dripped out the bottom. Panic swept through her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt can\u2019t have a leak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it the first year I was married.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re supposed to last nine years, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Francesca dumped out the water and held the diaphragm up to the light. Sure enough, there were three tiny holes. \u201cJust perfect. I finally decide to do the wild thing, and this is what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d her sister told her. \u201cThe guy\u2019s supposed to wear a hat, anyway. Just make sure he does. Or make him wear two.\u201d</p><p>Francesca tossed the birth control into the sink, then sank onto the edge of the tub. \u201cThis is so unfair.\u201d</p><p>Mia crouched next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Really. Condoms are perfectly safe. Or if you\u2019re really worried, then don\u2019t have sex with him. That solves the problem, too. On Monday head over to the health clinic on campus and talk to someone there. Maybe you can try something slightly more modern in the birth-control department.\u201d</p><p>Francesca brightened. \u201cGood point. I don\u2019t have to do it with Sam. I can just say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said as they walked through the rows of Cabernet Sauvignon. Not yet, meaning they hadn\u2019t started to ripen.</p><p>Brenna Marcelli barely saw the clusters of pea-size green grapes. Instead a gently sloping track of land filled her mind. One that sat in the way of a cool ocean breeze, tucked between hills that blocked out early-morning and late-afternoon sunlight. A place shrouded by morning fog. Perfect conditions for the high quality Pinot Noir growing there. Perfect and possibly up for sale.</p><p>She\u2019d already driven by twice, but she hadn\u2019t had the nerve to stop. Not when she knew that seeing the land would cause her to dream of four perfect acres that she would never own. She didn\u2019t have the money herself and knew the futility of trying to talk her grandfather into purchasing the acreage.</p><p>Probably just as well, she thought grimly. Why buy more when there were rumors that her grandfather was going to sell Marcelli Wines? Persistent rumors that didn\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cWhen does the bottling start?\u201d he asked, crouching in front of a cluster of young grapes that had yet to begin ripening. The Cabs always came in last.</p><p>\u201cMiddle of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ve booked the crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought about the intense process of bottling wine. The various machines were linked together by conveyor belts that wound around like a noisy snake doing the rumba. Bottles clinked and jerked along the line, being blown clean, filled, corked, labeled in a mechanical dance that made her long for the time and manpower to lovingly fill each bottle by hand.</p><p>She hated bottling\u2014knew how the wine could be bruised or aerated or traumatized by the rapid and brutal journey from quiet barrels to jostling bottles. A thousand and one things could go wrong with the equipment. She would check in a few times a day but otherwise planned to avoid the process.</p><p>\u201cThe Chardonnay is ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it all done in time.\u201d</p><p>The bright sun made her pull her baseball cap over her forehead and squint to see, the vineyard stretching out for what felt like miles in every direction. The smell of earth mingled with the fragrance of grapes. The scent wasn\u2019t rich as it would be at harvest, when simply walking through the vineyard could be intoxicating. But it held promise of a good crop and a great wine.</p><p>This was her home, she thought contentedly. This land, these vines all existed within the confines of the only world she had ever loved. It had taken coming back to discover that.</p><p>She knew now she should never have left. That taking what had seemed to be the safe choice had been a mistake she\u2019d paid for over and over again during the past nine years. Now it appeared she would be paying the ultimate price when her grandfather sold the winery. If he sold the winery.</p><p>Brenna couldn\u2019t get confirmation of the rumors, but there were so many of them, she couldn\u2019t help believing them true.</p><p>\u201cPeople are talking,\u201d she began slowly. \u201cAbout the winery. I\u2019ve heard them say you\u2019re considering selling.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather picked up a handful of dirt and let it run through his fingers. He rubbed a few leaves, then straightened and glanced up at the sun.</p><p>\u201cA good day,\u201d he said. \u201cA good season.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Her heart seemed to have frozen solid in her chest. Despite the heat of the afternoon, every part of her was cold.</p><p>Finally he turned to look at her. \u201cYou asked me before. I told you. I\u2019m not selling.\u201d</p><p>She studied his weathered face. He was a stern man who ruled his family with outdated laws and discipline, but he didn\u2019t lie.</p><p>Relief poured through her, hot and welcome. Her heart began to beat again. She sucked in a breath, then another. As long as she had the winery, she had a reason for living. It didn\u2019t matter that her personal life was in the toilet and that she was twenty-seven and had just moved back home. The grapes were everything. They\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe soon.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at him. \u201cNo,\u201d she breathed. Sell? Marcelli Wines? Her chest ached as if someone had stabbed her. \u201cYou can\u2019t. This land has been in the family for over seventy years. Why would you turn all we\u2019ve worked for over to a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m here and working hard.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes narrowed. \u201cFor now. But then what?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d had this conversation before. The unfairness of it burned like a brand. All her life she\u2019d been told her duty was to get married as soon as she turned eighteen. Which she had done. That relationship had taken her away from the vineyard she loved.</p><p>She turned and walked away. Her body ached, but that pain was nothing when compared with the emptiness of her soul.</p><p>Her grandfather blamed her for leaving. After all those years of telling her to get married, he now punished her for listening to him. Worse, Brenna almost couldn\u2019t argue his point. She couldn\u2019t figure out why she\u2019d given up the vineyards to marry her ass of an ex-husband who was knee-deep in preparations for his wedding to wife number two.</p><p>Her eyes burned, but she didn\u2019t cry. Not over Jeff. Not anymore. She\u2019d moved past hate, regret, and revenge. Now she simply wanted that chapter of her life over. Let him get married again. Let him get married a dozen more times. As long as she had the grapes...</p><p>She crested a rise and turned to look back at the land. She\u2019d been born and bred to work the vines, and she had walked away from them all. If only\u2014</p><p>The bright sunlight made her squint. In the distance, on neighboring Giovanni lands, she saw movement. Was it Nic? She was too far away to tell.</p><p>If only what? If only she\u2019d listened to her heart instead of taking the easy way out and marrying Jeff? Things would not have turned out much better with her grandfather. There were no if onlys. There was now and the fact that she\u2019d finally found everything she wanted only to lose it again if her grandfather sold.</p><p>She\u2019d learned her lesson. Unfortunately the education had come too late. What did it matter now if she never again trusted her heart and soul to a man? Without Marcelli Wines she was nothing.</p><p>4</p><p>F rancesca hadn\u2019t spent much time in Montecito, an upscale neighborhood just east of Santa Barbara. She glanced at the directions she\u2019d scribbled down, then back at the street signs and wondered what she was going to do if she got lost. No doubt the local police would want to impound her truck for being the wrong type of vehicle, the wrong age, and definitely the wrong price. In this neighborhood even the maids drove Volvos.</p><p>Francesca chuckled as she recalled her terror when Sam called and suggested a barbecue at his place, or what he\u2019d referred to as Montecito\u2019s best grill kitchen. Her first thought had been she couldn\u2019t\u2014she had faulty birth control. Her second had been wild temptation, followed by bone-numbing fear. Obviously she needed to get out more. Pitifully, she\u2019d accepted his invitation when he\u2019d mentioned a live-in housekeeper who would act as chaperon.</p><p>Less than five minutes later she found the right street and the right house. Make that the right gate. Both sides of the narrow street were lined with tall fences and gates. Some stood open, but others were firmly closed. Francesca pulled in front of Sam\u2019s, then opened her truck window to press the button on the control panel.</p><p>After a couple of seconds a familiar voice said, \u201cHello, Francesca. Glad you could make it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam\u2019s words made her heart flutter like hummingbird wings. She felt giddy and nervous, but excited. \u201cHi, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>The large double wrought-iron gates swung open, allowing her to drive onto the property. A few hundred yards later, after rounding a bend, she stopped in front of an old two-story house built in the 1920s. The mock Tudor facade blended perfectly with the formal gardens stretching out on either side.</p> <p>So the security business paid well, she thought as she opened the door and stepped onto the cobblestone driveway. Despite Sam\u2019s elegant offices and his title as CEO, she\u2019d never considered their economic differences. If she compared family fortunes, she would probably be in the ballpark, but personally she didn\u2019t have a penny. Marcelli Wines belonged solely to her grandfather.</p><p>She glanced down at the simple sundress she\u2019d worn. She\u2019d taken the time to curl her long hair and put on a little makeup, but other than that, there wasn\u2019t much she could do to dazzle anyone. Funny how she found herself wanting to dazzle Sam.</p><p>She crossed to the front door, which opened before she could knock.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said before she got a good look at him. Which was well timed, because after she looked, she wasn\u2019t up for much in the way of conversation.</p><p>She\u2019d been picturing him in a suit, not that she\u2019d wasted her entire day dreaming about him.</p> <p>He wore a red polo shirt tucked into worn jeans and no shoes. Somehow the sight of his bare feet shocked her\u2014as if she\u2019d stumbled into his bedroom and accidentally seen him naked. They were just feet, she told herself. Big feet.</p><p>She held in a smile as she thought of what her sister, Brenna, would say about her observation on the feet front.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>She found herself getting lost in those tawny-colored eyes she\u2019d admired last night. His dark blond hair was tousled, as if he\u2019d been running his hands through it. What was it about a slightly rumpled man that women found appealing? Why did he seem more dangerous now than he had before?</p><p>\u201cThanks for the invitation.\u201d She glanced around the foyer. \u201cSo this is the great grill place, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually the grilling magic happens on my back patio. There\u2019s going to be a write-up in Food and Spirits next month.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be busy. I\u2019m glad I could get in before the rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make room for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean in time I could get my own table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a chair, if you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>This is the place where a sophisticated, experienced woman would purr something about always being good. The words hovered on Francesca lips, but she held them back. Throwing herself into the deep end was one thing, but promising an Olympic performance instead of the ungainly flailing that was likely to follow seemed like a mistake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the nickel tour,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can meet Elena, so you\u2019ll know I wasn\u2019t lying about her, then I\u2019ll take you out to the patio and impress you.\u201d</p><p>His low voice seemed to brush across her skin like warm velvet. She found herself wanting to move closer, to stretch until all the kinks were out, then rub against him. Maybe she could purr without words.</p><p>He took a step, then paused. \u201cTake your shoes off if you want.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca hesitated a second, then slipped out of her sandals and dropped her bag next to them. Somehow the thought of both of them barefoot was more than a little scandalous, but she was playing with the big guys now.</p><p>She followed Sam across the hardwood floor of the entryway, past a large living room. She caught a glimpse of a library, a home office, and a dining room.</p><p>\u201cBig place,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see why you have live-in help.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t used to. Somebody came in and cleaned. My grandfather lives a couple of miles from here. He\u2019s getting up in years and needs more help than he used to. Not that he\u2019ll admit it. I wanted to get him someone, but he\u2019s stubborn and wouldn\u2019t agree. So I complained about wanting to hire a full-time person and not having enough work. He pretended to believe me. Elena spends most of her time with him, but she has a suite of rooms here. It\u2019s a game my grandfather and I play, but it works.\u201d</p><p>They crossed by the kitchen and entered a small hallway at the back of the house. Sam knocked on a closed door.</p><p>\u201cElena? Francesca is here.\u201d</p><p>A small, redheaded woman in her early fifties opened the door. She was casually dressed in sweats and a T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cElena, this is Francesca. Francesca, Elena runs the house. My grandfather and I would be lost without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d She grinned at her employer. \u201cOkay. I agree. This one was worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to say anything to get me in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s smile broadened. \u201cMe? What did I say? Did I mention a word about a man living alone for too long with only an old woman for company? No. Not a word. Did I say it was time he found himself a good woman? Not even close. I mind my own business. That\u2019s what I\u2019m paid to do. I keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of shutting,\u201d Sam said, interrupting her. \u201cI\u2019m closing your door now. You sure you don\u2019t want me to cook you a steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Red meat will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout it, life isn\u2019t worth living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat more vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Elena,\u201d he said and drew the door closed.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she called. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head, then led the way back to the kitchen. \u201cShe makes me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou adore her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. She\u2019s great with Gabriel. He can be a real curmudgeon, but she doesn\u2019t mind. As you may have noticed, she gives as good as she gets. He thinks she\u2019s great, although he\u2019d rather eat worms than admit it.\u201d</p><p>Francesca glanced around at the spacious rooms they passed on their way through the house. \u201cDo you rent out rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could. If the security business ever tanks, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d He led the way into the kitchen.</p><p>She had a brief impression of bleached cabinets and tiled counters. French doors led to an open deck with the ocean in the distance. But she was more distracted by Sam\u2019s words than the view. Very nice, she thought. Too nice. If Sam was so all that, why wasn\u2019t he married with six kids?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked as he took a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m in observation mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExploring your environment?\u201d he asked as he moved a little closer.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d And him. Flawed or not, she wouldn\u2019t mind exploring him.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou like my \u2018executive at home\u2019 look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stink.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, then stepped in front of her and rested his hands on her waist. She had a half second of warning before he bent low and kissed her.</p><p>The light brush of his mouth made her sway toward him. Body parts slowly stirred to life. She rested her fingers on his shoulders, feeling the strength and heat of him.</p><p>Her insides warmed, then melted. Legs quivered. She sighed and leaned into him. This was going to be good.</p><p>And it was. He ran his hands up and down her back, then swept his tongue across her lower lip. She never thought of protesting, or even worrying that they were standing in a kitchen. There were counters and tables and lots of possibilities, not that she could think of even one when she parted her lips slightly and brushed her tongue against his.</p><p>Erotic excitement sizzled. Every inch of skin quivered as they pressed together. He smelled good\u2014male, clean, sexy. He tasted even better. They danced and stroked and explored. He dropped his hands to her rear and squeezed. She instinctively arched against him, which brought her belly in contact with his erection. The proof of his arousal both delighted and terrified her.</p><p>He broke the kiss and stared at her. Fire danced in his gold-brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the kind of girl my grandfather always warned me about. The ones who get guys like me in trouble.\u201d</p><p>His hands were still on her waist. She liked the weight of them there. She lightly squeezed his shoulders. \u201cHow on earth would I get you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of a thousand ways.\u201d</p><p>She could only think of a couple, but she wasn\u2019t prepared to share lists.</p><p>She studied his face, enjoying the way he watched her. As if he liked what he saw. They weren\u2019t moving, weren\u2019t touching, except for where their hands rested. The moment shouldn\u2019t have been special or intimate, yet it was both.</p><p>The aching inside of her grew. It moved low in her belly, then flared out to her thighs. Her body felt heavy. She felt thick, swollen, and wet. All this and they\u2019d only kissed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know. Well, okay\u2014maybe she did.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat sounds promising. Come on. We\u2019ll open a bottle of wine and go sit on the deck. While we stare at the ocean, you can tell me about your day.\u201d</p><p>He released her and crossed to the counter. As she watched him move, she realized she was completely out of her element. Sam obviously knew what he was doing. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she was going to find herself well and truly seduced.</p><p>She walked over to lean against the counter. The sight of the familiar label made her smile.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019ve converted you,\u201d she said, touching the Marcelli Wines bottle.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take much convincing.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out the cork and poured them each a glass of Merlot, then led the way out onto the deck. The afternoon sun had warmed the redwood and the wicker chairs. When Francesca sat down, Sam pulled an ottoman over, positioning it between their chairs.</p><p>\u201cTo summer nights,\u201d he said, holding out his glass.</p><p>She touched hers to his, then took a sip. Summer nights. She couldn\u2019t remember one quite like this. There was still an hour or so to go until sunset. The view of the ocean stretched out in the distance, the vastness of the water offering endless possibilities. A handsome man who made her skin tingle and her heart flutter sat next to her. This was definitely a top-ten moment for the week.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your day,\u201d he said as he shifted and lifted his feet to the ottoman. Francesca had already stretched out her legs to rest her heels on the white wicker. Their bare toes, the proximity, the casual acceptance all made her feel as if they\u2019d done this a thousand times before. It was disconcerting. It was very nice.</p><p>\u201cMy sister, Mia, came to see me,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving for Washington, D.C., in the morning. Mia is eighteen, a junior at UCLA, and brilliant. She\u2019s majoring in political science and is probably going to take over the world some day. As if all that isn\u2019t enough, she\u2019s amazing with languages. This summer she\u2019s taking a six-week language course. She\u2019ll be studying Japanese.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced at her. \u201cIs she your only sister?\u201d</p><p>Francesca thought about her family. \u201cHow scared do you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know about your family history. Is it more intimidating than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me.\u201d She sipped her wine. \u201cMy fraternal grandparents, my maternal grandmother, and my parents all live in a hacienda up by the vineyard. I have a sister, Katie, who is older by a year and a fraternal twin, Brenna. Mia is the baby\u2014she\u2019s nine years younger than me.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked impressed. \u201cI won\u2019t complain about Gabriel anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not. Grandma Tessa, my father\u2019s mother, is pure Italian. For her, everything in life can be healed with more pasta. Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea is my mother\u2019s mother. We call her Grammy M. She\u2019s Irish, tiny, but strong-willed. We\u2019re Italian-Irish and Catholic. The family is loud, volatile, and rosaries appear at the drop of a hat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. \u201cYou love them. I can hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to grow up with a small family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are pluses and minuses.\u201d He set his wine on the table between their chairs. \u201cI\u2019m going to delight you with my culinary abilities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I already have potatoes baking in the oven. Elena made a salad earlier, and I\u2019m going to grill steaks.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed I can barely breathe. Will you actually take the potatoes out of the oven yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Although if it makes you feel better, you can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost too much. I\u2019m going to bet that next you\u2019ll be telling me you can pour milk on cereal and make toast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d He rose. \u201cCome on. You can watch and marvel.\u201d</p><p>She set down her wine and stood. \u201cSo much for you hiring Elena for your grandfather. You sound like you need a keeper, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I can order take-out as well as any other guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t make fun of you. I\u2019m not much of a cook, either. Although I can boil up frozen ravioli like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d he said, and took her hand in his.</p><p>Francesca allowed him to lead her inside. She felt good. Better than good, she was tingling. Being around Sam made her physically aware in a way that was new and exciting. She liked how they teased and laughed. So far there hadn\u2019t been any awkward pauses or stumbling conversations, and this dating stuff was looking pretty good.</p> <p>He walked into the family room, where he released her and moved over to a stack of complicated-looking electronic equipment.</p><p>\u201cAny musical preferences?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>While he flipped through several CDs, she walked around the room. A large, overstuffed sofa faced a widescreen television with massive speakers on either side. To the left was the electronic tower Sam held court over; to the right was a set of French doors leading to the patio.</p><p>Francesca moved to her right, where open shelves displayed everything from books to pictures. There were several of Sam with an older man she guessed was his grandfather, a few shots of foreign locations, and none of his parents. No other women, either, which she supposed was a good thing.</p><p>Magazines lay on a coffee table. Time, Fortune, Car and Driver. Talk about a guy. She smiled.</p><p>As she completed her circuit, soft strains of music filled the room.</p><p>Sam touched her shoulder, causing her to turn toward him. He moved close, putting both his hands on her waist.</p> <p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Awkwardness filled her. \u201cHere? In the family room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be more comfortable in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an explanation. She had the feeling he didn\u2019t wait for much. Instead he began moving her to the slow beat, pulling her closer with each step until they were pressed against each other. She gave into the rhythm and raised her arms so she could link her hands behind his head.</p><p>She found herself caught up in his steady gaze, in the feel of his body against hers. There were defining moments in life, she thought hazily. And magic ones. This dance, this night, this man fell into the latter category. If she was interested in reacquainting herself with a journey exploring life\u2019s possibilities, he seemed like the perfect guide.</p><p>He leaned down and brushed his mouth against hers. This time she immediately recognized the aching for what it was. Desire.</p><p>She gave herself up to the sensation and the kiss. His tongue stroked her lower lip before slipping inside her mouth. She welcomed him, surging against him. The edges of the world blurred, then faded as she lost herself in the passion of the moment.</p><p>He kissed her deeply, thoroughly, slowly. Over and over his tongue stroked against hers, circling, teasing, until she only wanted to surrender. Their bodies continued to move to the rhythm of the music, a steady erotic beat that matched the thundering of her heart.</p><p>Hunger filled her, pulsing, driving, and demanding. Hunger, but not for the promised steak and salad. Instead she starved for this man. Her sisters had teased her about it being too long, but she hadn\u2019t really believed them. Not until this moment, when she felt empty and malnourished. She wanted to be touched all over and to touch in return. She wanted to feel slick heat and surging surrender. She wanted to give herself up to the moment, to the man, and then spend the next forty-eight hours in a sensual fog.</p><p>Between her legs, flesh swelled and wept in anticipation. Her panties grew damp. Her breasts ached as her nipples tightened. Her skin was suddenly too small, her clothes too confining. She ached... all over.</p><p>The kissing wasn\u2019t enough, she thought, fighting frantic need. She pressed harder against Sam, desperate to rub against him, to feel friction and contact and pleasure. Her brain began to shut down as instinct took over. The hunger grew and burned. Unfamiliar, powerful, it should have frightened her. Maybe with another man it would have, but not with Sam.</p><p>He pulled away and stared at her. Passion tightened his features. His breathing was as fast and hard as her own.</p><p>\u201cHell of a kiss,\u201d he murmured, his voice thick and low.</p><p>She stared at him without speaking.</p><p>He swore. \u201cFrancesca, do you have any idea what your eyes are telling me? If you don\u2019t mean them to say yes, you\u2019d better speak up right now.\u201d</p><p>She waited for good sense to take over. Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t have anything to say,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb across her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re pure fantasy material, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Her? A fantasy? That worked. She reached up and kissed him.</p><p>Sam responded with a deep groan that shook her down to her toes. He cupped her face and kissed her deeply. Sometime in all this they\u2019d stopped dancing. She didn\u2019t mind. Nothing really mattered except the fire inside of her and the man in front of her.</p><p>He dropped his hands to her shoulders, then slid them down to her hands. Even as he kissed her cheeks, her jaw, her chin, he was pulling her out of the room. They made it to the hallway, where they clung to each other for a second before racing up the tall, wide flight of stairs.</p><p>On the second floor Francesca saw little more than hardwood floors, windows, and doors before Sam was pulling her along the hallway. At the end he entered through double doors, and pushed them shut behind her. Then he was drawing her close and touching her... everywhere.</p><p>He stroked her back, her rear, her hips, then slipped around to settle his hands on her waist. At the same time he kissed her. His tongue brushed against hers with a passionate tenderness that made her catch her breath.</p><p>She touched him in return. The width of his shoulders. Hard muscles contrasted with the softness of his shirt. She traced the breadth of his chest, then circled to his back. His hands climbed toward her breasts, hers dipped to his rear. They reached their destinations at the same time, and as her fingers dug into high, tight flesh, he brushed against her hard, sensitive nipples.</p><p>They both gasped.</p><p>The ache inside of her intensified. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been touched there. How many years had it been since she\u2019d felt the pressure of a firm caress on tight, hungry skin?</p><p>He cupped her curves, then broke the kiss to bend down. Through the layers of her dress and bra, she felt the heat of his breath. He bit down gently and she nearly screamed.</p><p>He reached for the buttons running down the front of her dress. At the same time she tugged his shirt out of the waistband of his jeans. She vaguely recalled that in the past she\u2019d been somewhat shy and restrained in bed. And she probably would be again. Just not now. Not with the need pounding inside of her like a drum. She ached. Between her legs, the dampness surged until she was wet and slick and ready. She wanted his hands on her\u2014her breasts, between her legs. She wanted his mouth everywhere. She trembled, she shook, she needed.</p><p>He finished with the buttons and pushed the dress off her shoulders. She straightened her arms and let it fall to the floor, leaving her wearing bikini panties and a bra.</p><p>Sam\u2019s gaze swept over her, and he sucked in a breath. \u201cStunning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d She tugged on his polo shirt. \u201cTake this off.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He went one better. After tugging off his shirt, he unfastened his belt, then his jeans and pushed them to the floor.</p><p>She took in the well-toned muscles, the blond hair dusting his chest, the narrow waist, and his erection straining against his briefs. Big feet was right, she thought, mesmerized by the length and thickness of him.</p><p>Then she couldn\u2019t think, because he was touching her. He explored her shoulders, her rib cage, then her back, where he easily unfastened her bra. When the bit of lace had fallen away, he cupped her breasts in his hands and kissed her.</p><p>The combination was electric. Warm fingers teased her breasts, while his mouth worked its magic on hers. She moaned, she squirmed, she nearly came in her panties.</p><p>She touched him back, wanting to get closer. She ached to wrap her legs around him and have him plunge inside of her. She wanted to beg, to scream, to demand. When he began moving them toward the bed, she nearly moaned in relief.</p><p>Once they arrived, Sam pulled open a nightstand drawer and set a condom on the surface. The sight of something that practical should have brought Francesca to her senses, but she was too far gone. She glanced at it, had a moment of gratitude, then slipped off her panties and climbed on the bed.</p><p>He was right there with her. They surged together, naked, hungry, needing. Even as he bent down to kiss and lick her sensitive breasts, he slipped a hand between her legs.</p><p>At the first brush of his fingers, she pulsed against him. She felt ravenous and wanted to swallow him whole. Need made her pulse her hips impatiently.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she whispered, clinging to him. \u201cTouch me\u2014ah.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d found the spot. That single place of pleasure. He pressed his fingers against it, rubbing firmly, gently, perfectly. She dropped her head to the pillow and sucked in a breath.</p><p>It was too good. It had been too long, and damn if Sam hadn\u2019t figured out exactly what made her shake.</p><p>He circled that tight spot, shifted until he could caress her with his thumb, then slipped a finger inside.</p><p>It was too much. Her body contracted, convulsed, and she was gone. Just like that. Her orgasm swept through her, making her shudder and pant and moan. She lost herself in the pleasure.</p><p>So much better than she remembered, she thought hazily as wave after wave of warm, liquid release filled her. Way too good for mortal man.</p><p>When the contractions slowed, she opened one eye, then the other. Sam looked both pleased and stunned. She couldn\u2019t help grinning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He continued to gently stroke her. \u201cAnd here I thought you were going to tell me that I\u2019m really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>She studied his eyes, his mouth, the way the blond hair fell over his forehead. She might have had her appetizer, but she was still hungry for the main course.</p><p>She reached between them and took his impressive arousal in her hand. With one slow stroke she had him groaning.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe we\u2019d take this guy for a test-drive,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my kind of woman.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the condom and quickly put it on.</p><p>Francesca felt her body stretching as he filled her. It took every ounce of self-control not to lose herself in the first thrust. When he was in all the way, he shifted so he was staring down at her. His eyes dilated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back on my account,\u201d he said, his voice low and husky. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn wet and hot, I\u2019m about to lose it.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on his back and stroked him. \u201cHow do you feel about screaming? I never have before, but I have a feeling I might have to this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI consider it the highest praise possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>With that, he began to move. She closed her eyes and lost herself in the pleasure of him filling her over and over again. Within a few strokes, tension built to unbearable and she couldn\u2019t hold on any longer.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Sam,\u201d she breathed, then lost herself in the pleasure. She surged against him, dropped her hands to his rear and pulling him in deeper and deeper.</p><p>Thick, powerful contractions rippled through her. She gasped, she writhed, she surrendered. She might have even screamed.</p><p>And still her orgasm went on. It crested at the moment he shuddered and stilled. His body tensed, then he collapsed against her.</p><p>Francesca lay there, under his body, and slowly opened her eyes. She felt good. Better than good. She felt capable of performing miracles. The lovemaking had been great. Amazing. Sinus-clearing. She wanted to do it again. She wanted\u2014</p><p>Reality chose that moment to crash her party. One second she was basking in afterglow so bright she could tan by it, and the next she was hardly able to breathe. Panic swept through her, making her squirm slightly.</p> <p>Sam raised himself on his arms and smiled sheepishly. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to squash you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d she said, trying not to push him away and bolt for freedom. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t able to school her expression as well as she would like.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She swallowed, then knew she had to come clean. \u201cEverything. I just...\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way I want to get married.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>S am\u2019s dick chose that moment to shrink to the size of a peanut. Sam pushed up into a kneeling position, pulled out of her, and slid to the edge of the bed. When he\u2019d tossed the condom, he turned back to Francesca.</p> <p>She lay on her back, her mouth swollen, her skin flushed. She was gorgeous. Sexy as hell. And quite possibly crazy. Damn.</p><p>He knew better than to make love this soon. He\u2019d given that up nearly a decade before. He preferred to get to know a woman before getting into her pants, and with good reason.</p><p>Francesca bit her lower lip. \u201cThat came out wrong. I mean I know you didn\u2019t propose or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d That was a step in the right direction.</p><p>He stood and grabbed her panties, bra, and dress, then tossed them to her. He collected his jeans and pulled them on, not looking at her until she slipped into her dress and started on the buttons.</p><p>When she\u2019d secured the front of her dress, she sank back on the mattress. \u201cThis was really great,\u201d she told him, motioning vaguely to the bed, then to him. \u201cI haven\u2019t been with anyone in a while and...\u201d She stopped and sighed. \u201cSo my sisters made me promise...\u201d She stopped again.</p><p>He was still wary enough not to approach the bed. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to get married.\u201d</p><p>She brightened. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhat I mean by that is I\u2019m not looking to get involved.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not really into the whole romance-marriage thing. I was married once, and I didn\u2019t like it. After Todd died, I tried dating some, but guys always want to take things to the next level. Does that sound too horrible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Some of his wariness eased. \u201cYou think because I slept with you I\u2019ll want to marry you?\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hands. \u201cThat sounds so horrible.\u201d She dropped her hands to her sides and looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I gave up on the whole male-female thing because it was such a pain. I\u2019m guilted enough by my family. They want my sisters and me to settle down and have dozens of babies. I live with the guilt because I can\u2019t seem to let it go, but it\u2019s not enough to make me do what they want. I have my school and a great career just a couple of years away. Until recently, that\u2019s been enough. It\u2019s just I sort of miss, well, um...\u201d She cleared her throat and shifted on the bed.</p><p>He got it immediately. \u201cSex,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat would be it, yes.\u201d</p><p>His wariness faded completely, and he mentally apologized for thinking she was crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very nice,\u201d she told him. \u201cA really great guy.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and moved closer to the bed. \u201cBe honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want hearts, flowers, or forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He sat next to her and took her hand. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t mind a little slap and tickle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d like any slapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpanking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I get to do it to you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m the dominant male around here.\u201d</p><p>She angled toward him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I blurted out the marriage thing. The sex was so good and then I panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I thought you\u2019d gone postal.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cNo. I was overwhelmed by my physical response is all.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. Beautiful, responsive, and not interested in forever. And honest. The one quality he valued above all others.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m into serial monogamy myself,\u201d he said as he cupped her cheek. \u201cNo plans to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I didn\u2019t like my experience, either.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath. \u201cOkay. At the risk of moving too fast, would you be open to a monogamous sexual relationship with no emotional ties?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to think twice. Not when the woman in question was as appealing as this one. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Francesca thought her experience with Sam had peaked with her orgasms, but maybe she\u2019d been a little hasty in her judgment. Was it possible to have everything she wanted and nothing she didn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other when we want,\u201d he said. \u201cGood conversation, lots of laughs, and plenty of time in bed. When one or both of us want to end it, we will. No expectations. No hard feelings. Deal?\u201d</p><p>She felt wicked. She felt excited. God was probably going to punish her, and if the Grands ever found out, they\u2019d have her hide. But it would be worth it.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>When Francesca arrived at the hacienda for brunch the following morning, she had a bad feeling that everyone was going to guess something was going on with her. She felt radiant, her skin was glowing, and she just couldn\u2019t seem to stop grinning.</p><p>Not that it was all her fault. After striking their deal, she and Sam had spent the entire night making love. They\u2019d crept downstairs about midnight to grab something to eat and then had retreated to the quiet, sensual darkness of his bedroom.</p><p>The only way she\u2019d been able to drag herself from his presence was the realization that if she didn\u2019t show up for her weekly brunch with her family, the Grands would set the FBI on her trail. And she couldn\u2019t very well bring Sam with her. The sight of her in the company of an eligible man would fill the house with the sound of wedding bells. Something neither of them wanted.</p><p>Francesca climbed out of her truck and headed for the back door of the big Spanish-style house. It was early June, which meant every form of plant life was lush, green, and growing. Tall trees provided shade over the rear of the house. The vegetable garden by the garage soaked up the bright sunshine. In the distance acres and acres of vines rustled and danced in the light breeze.</p><p>The flowers on the grapevines had dried up, while the small pea-sized grapes had appeared. From what she had seen on her drive up to the hacienda, they were going to have a banner year. But there was still a lot of time left until harvest, and Brenna would be happy to tell her all the things that could go wrong between now and then.</p><p>The back door burst open. \u201cFrancesca!\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and smiled as Grandma Tessa held out her arms. \u201cCome, child. We have missed you.\u201d</p><p>Francesca ran toward the house and up the three steps, then hugged her grandmother close. \u201cHow are you? Feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m old, eh? Things don\u2019t work as well as they used to, but I\u2019m here. That\u2019s enough.\u201d She released her granddaughter, reached up, and pinched her cheek. \u201cStill a pretty girl. But you\u2019re not so young anymore. You need to be married, Francesca. You need bambinos. It is time.\u201d</p><p>Normally she found the family pressure a little exasperating, but today nothing could puncture her good mood. \u201cBefore I\u2019m too old, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle women over thirty,\u201d her grandmother said knowingly. \u201cI read. Easier for you to be taken by aliens than find a man. You only have three years, Francesca. Don\u2019t waste them.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. Her cheek stung from Grandma Tessa\u2019s enthusiasm, but the pain was as familiar as the entreaty that she marry and produce offspring. Over the past three years the hints had become much less subtle. Fresh off the success of her older sister\u2019s engagement, the family had increased the pressure.</p><p>If she mentioned Sam, they would get off her back about finding a man. Of course, they would also want to meet him and find out if a wedding date had been set. Knowledge of her \u201cno commitment\u201d agreement with him would send both grandmothers scuttling for their rosaries and force her parents to have a long talk with her. Better to play along.</p><p>\u201cTalk to her,\u201d Grandma Tessa said as they entered the open and airy kitchen.</p><p>Grammy M\u2014Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea to the rest of the world and Francesca\u2019s maternal grandmother\u2014glanced up from the dough she\u2019d rolled out on the granite counter.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca! My darlin\u2019 girl.\u201d She wiped her hands on the apron she wore.</p><p>Francesca walked over for another hug\u2014this one without a cheek pinch\u2014and bent down to embrace the tiny woman.</p><p>\u201cGrandma Tessa wants me to get married again,\u201d Francesca said with mock surprise. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Grammy M shook her head, causing her white curls to bounce. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be respectin\u2019 your elders, young lady, not makin\u2019 fun of them. We want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me pregnant.\u201d Francesca snatched a scone from a cooling rack.</p><p>\u201cMarried and pregnant,\u201d Grandma Tessa corrected.</p><p>Grammy M grinned, her blue eyes dancing with humor. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Tessa. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 we could probably find it in our hearts to forgive Francesca if she found herself with a wee one in the oven.\u201d</p><p>Francesca chuckled, but didn\u2019t even try to get in the middle of that conversation. Instead she broke the still-steaming scone in half and took a small bite. The firm, golden-brown crust gave way to a soft, perfectly baked, orange-flavored center that made her mouth water even as it dissolved on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d she breathed. \u201cGrammy M, we\u2019re going to have to try another scone lesson. I want to be able to do this at home.\u201d</p><p>Her maternal grandmother gazed at her fondly before shaking her head and returned to the dough she\u2019d rolled out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl, but you don\u2019t have much success in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took that cake-decorating class a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father nearly choked to death on that piece he ate,\u201d Grandma Tessa reminded her.</p><p>Francesca knew they were right. She was a disaster when it came to cooking, although she continued to take classes. Mostly because despite a degree in psychology, she couldn\u2019t seem to talk herself out of the guilt she felt for not caving to family expectations about marriage and kids. So she substituted a quest for excellence in the domestic arts.</p><p>\u201cThe flowers on the cake were pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they were,\u201d Grammy M agreed. \u201cAnd you make a lovely radish rose.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca took another bite of scone, then crossed to the cupboards above the dishwasher and grabbed a glass. \u201cIs this your way of telling me my cooking has style but no substance? I was thinking of taking a class on Chinese cooking this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re telling you that if you want to win a man\u2019s heart, come by and pick up some ravioli,\u201d Grandma Tessa said cheerfully. \u201cI always have them in the freezer, along with a nice, thick meat sauce.\u201d</p><p>Winning a man\u2019s heart was not a place she wanted to go. \u201cDid Mia\u2019s flight get off all right?\u201d she asked to change the subject.</p> <p>\u201cYou just missed her call to say she\u2019d arrived in Washington,\u201d Grammy M said. \u201cI know she\u2019ll enjoy her language course, but we\u2019ll all be missin\u2019 havin\u2019 her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll miss us, too,\u201d Francesca said, then remembered Mia\u2019s plans to hang out with congressional aides. Somehow under those circumstances, she thought her very pretty little sister might be too busy to be homesick.</p><p>She reached for another scone, only to have her hand slapped by Grandma Tessa. \u201cBrenna\u2019s out in the vineyards, so you\u2019ll have to set the table yourself. Wash your hands first.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother turned to stare at her. Dark eyebrows drew together as Grandma Tessa tried to look fierce.</p> <p>\u201cI love you both very much,\u201d Francesca said impulsively, hugging the Grands before moving into the hallway and the bathroom tucked under the stairs.</p><p>\u201cUse the good china,\u201d Grandma Tessa called after her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on your own a long time, dear,\u201d her mother said, gazing at her intently.</p><p>Colleen O\u2019Shea Marcelli was a petite woman with attractive features, dark hair, and a fashionable dress sense. Even at a casual brunch she looked well put together enough to be in a photo shoot. Francesca had slipped on a sleeveless summer dress because Marcelli daughters weren\u2019t allowed to wear shorts or pants to dinners or any meal on Sunday. While her mother shopped at expensive boutiques that specialized in designer originals, Francesca favored the extra-reduced racks at outlet stores and the occasional castoffs from Brenna, the only one of her sisters to be within two inches of her height.</p><p>Across the large table Brenna and her grandfather talked about the coming harvest. The Grands chatted about which movie they would head out to see later, while her father, Marco Marcelli nodded at everything his wife said. Which meant her parents had planned their attack in advance.</p><p>\u201cFive years,\u201d her mother said. \u201cFrancesca, your devotion to Todd\u2019s memory is a credit to your marriage, but you\u2019re still a young woman. Are you going to mourn him for the rest of your life?\u201d</p> <p>Francesca thought about pointing out that her grandmother had informed her she was reaching the age of no return, at least in the marriage market.</p><p>For the thousandth time she thought about coming clean and simply confessing that nothing about being married appealed to her. Her marriage to Todd had been a disaster. The on-the-surface successful banker hadn\u2019t been interested in an actual person for a wife. Instead he\u2019d wanted only arm candy. His premature death in a car accident had led her to discover that their lavish lifestyle had been financed by credit, not income. She\u2019d been left with plenty of debt, which had forced her to sell everything. In the end she\u2019d walked away, not richer but wiser.</p><p>Brenna had married Jeff and had spent the next nine years of her life supporting him through medical school, internships, and residencies. She\u2019s given up her true love\u2014the winery\u2014to be a good wife. Her reward? Jeff dumped her for someone younger. Yes, their parents were happy, and Grandpa Lorenzo and Grandma Tessa had been married for generations, but that wasn\u2019t enough to convince her. As far as she was concerned, love was highly overrated and marriage wasn\u2019t in her future.</p><p>Not that her parents would understand. Which meant they had the \u201cwhy don\u2019t you find a nice boy and settle down\u201d conversation at least twice a month.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mourning Todd,\u201d she said truthfully and thought of making love with Sam the previous night. Mourning had been the last thing on her mind. Still, she wouldn\u2019t mind skipping the lecture.</p><p>She drew in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I do need to start going out.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended on the table. Everyone turned to stare at her, even Brenna, who raised her eyebrows and placed her hand on her chest in mock surprise. Francesca shot her a warning look.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo, still tall and powerful despite his seventy-plus years, pounded on the table. \u201cAbout time you realized that, young lady. You\u2019re the prettiest of my granddaughters. When I think about all those years you\u2019ve wasted going to college when you could have been getting married and having babies.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca was used to the lecture, but even after all this time the words stung.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s eyes flashed with temper. She turned to her grandfather. \u201cAt some point you\u2019re going to have to realize we\u2019re in a new century, Grandpa. Women don\u2019t need men to make them feel whole anymore. We\u2019re fine on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d spent a little more time paying attention to your husband, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have left you,\u201d the old man shot back.</p><p>\u201cLorenzo!\u201d Grandma Tessa said, and looked sympathetically at Brenna. \u201cWe know you were a good girl. We should never have let you marry that ex-husband of yours. You need a nice Italian boy. My cousin, Marie, has a grandson who lives in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cNo, Grandma. No relatives, or friends of relatives. I\u2019m not even legally divorced yet. Give me a break on this, okay?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa didn\u2019t look ready to back down. Francesca understood exactly what her sister was feeling. While she loved her family, they really knew how to get on her nerves. She decided to give them both a break.</p><p>\u201cHave Katie and Zach set a wedding date yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>That got everyone\u2019s attention. Her mother reminded her about the family meeting later in the week to get the event planned. The Grands started arguing over the menu, and Grandpa Lorenzo threw out several possible wine suggestions.</p><p>Brenna picked up a bottle of Marcelli Wines Chardonnay and poured herself another glass. She held out the bottle.</p><p>\u201cMake mine a double,\u201d Francesca murmured so only her sister could hear. When Brenna had filled her glass as well, they raised them to each other.</p><p>\u201cTo surviving our family,\u201d Brenna whispered. \u201cMay God save me from Cousin Marie\u2019s grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternational oil brokers with families and death threats should not be allowed to travel for pleasure,\u201d Sam said wearily as he tossed a file folder onto his desk.</p><p>Jason reached forward and picked up the papers. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. He called yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Jason flipped through the pages, then put the folder back on Sam\u2019s desk. \u201cAfrica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafari. His daughter is something of an animal lover. This is part of her birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t he just buy her a bike?\u201d</p><p>Sam grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the rich and powerful do things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get the kid a bike store. Africa?\u201d The big man\u2019s dark eyes narrowed. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to stick to the tourist spots are they? Rich and powerful types like the unusual and out-of-the-way. Right?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about camping in the wilderness, visiting native villages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the outdoors,\u201d Jason muttered. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they vacation in Monaco? I could really get into Monaco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re going to have to go there on your own time.\u201d</p><p>Jason scowled. \u201cSo tell me why I volunteered for this job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love a challenge. Want to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Jason picked up the folder again. \u201cAfrica. We\u2019re talking ticks and leeches. I hate slimy things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the jungle. You\u2019re going to be on the savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So I only have to worry about malaria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might see a lion.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s scowl deepened. \u201cHate cats, too.\u201d</p><p>Sam chuckled. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving in September. You have that long to put together the team. He\u2019s letting you pick them all. His regular protection is going on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet they\u2019re not planning to hang out with ticks.\u201d Jason sighed. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to worry about some pantyass European bodyguards.\u201d He slammed the folder shut. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve got to get shots, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a list in the back.\u201d</p><p>Before Jason could complain any more, a familiar uneven footfall sounded in the hallway. Step, clunk, slide. Step, clunk, slide.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the old man was here,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s Sunday.\u201d His grandfather never came in on the weekend, although he still made regular appearances during the week.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Gabriel Reese announced from the entrance to Sam\u2019s office. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all in church?\u201d</p><p>Jason rose to his feet and nodded at the older man. \u201cAfternoon, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason. Is my grandson making you work on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man. I\u2019m the one who told Sam about you. Did he ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Jason grinned. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Sam motioned to the second chair in front of his desk. \u201cHave a seat, Gabriel. Do you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey, but don\u2019t bother telling me it\u2019s too early in the day. I\u2019ll wait until I get home.\u201d He braced his arms on his cane and slowly sank into the seat. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a good man in business, Samuel, but a real pain in the ass when it comes to my health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you dying on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to die on anyone,\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll be alone in my bed. That\u2019s how men should die.\u201d</p><p>Sam got up and crossed to the coffeepot on the small cart in the corner. He poured some in a mug, added generous amounts of sugar and cream, and carried it to his grandfather.</p><p>Gabriel took a sip, then eyed Jason, who had finally returned to his chair. \u201cHeard you were going to Africa. Wish I were young enough to take your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Jason said glumly.</p><p>Sam grinned. \u201cJason\u2019s concerned about the wildlife. Snakes, leeches. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded solemnly. \u201cDry socks,\u201d he announced. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to a healthy safari. Oh, and plenty of bug spray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell. Bugs. I didn\u2019t think about them.\u201d Jason eyed Sam. \u201cI want a trip to Monaco when this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what we can do.\u201d</p><p>Jason grunted, got to his feet, and said good-bye to both men. When he was gone, Sam leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cElena\u2019s sister called this morning,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe fell, broke her hip, and has to have surgery. Elena will have to go stay with her for a month or so.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cWhat do I care? She\u2019s your housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>Sam ignored that. \u201cI can get someone in to clean with no problem,\u201d he told the older man. \u201cCooking is going to be more of an issue.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of myself for over sixty years, Sonny. I can manage until my toes curl up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to move in with me until she gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even on a bet.\u201d</p><p>Sam knew that the knee-jerk refusal didn\u2019t mean his grandfather had made up his mind. \u201cWe could go cruising for chicks together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel\u2019s scowl faded as the corner of his mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019m too old for chicks.\u201d His gaze narrowed. \u201cBut you\u2019re not. You work too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned that from you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave a snort. \u201cGood answer, but there\u2019s a difference. I had you to go home to. What do you have? Some mouthy housekeeper who doesn\u2019t know her place? Soon you won\u2019t even have her. You\u2019re thirty-four.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The old man scowled. \u201cYou need a woman. When are you going to get married again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you do,\u201d he told his grandfather.</p><p>The old man chuckled. \u201cThere\u2019s still some life left in me, Samuel. I just might find someone who strikes my fancy. Then what will you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel laughed, then pushed himself to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to head home. Don\u2019t you work too late.\u201d</p><p>Sam thought of Francesca\u2019s promise to be at his place no later than five. Anticipation made him grin. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>This time when Francesca arrived at Sam\u2019s place, the gate was wide open. One part nervous, three parts wild with excitement, she drove onto the property and parked in front of the impressive house.</p><p>When she\u2019d turned off the engine, she reached for her oversize tote bag. Sam had asked her to spend the night, which meant dealing with logistics like a toothbrush and fresh undies for the morning. While she didn\u2019t want to show up with a suitcase and scare the man\u2014she\u2019d already done that once in the past twenty-four hours\u2014she didn\u2019t want to be without her stuff.</p><p>\u201cYou should never have let your subscription to Cosmo lapse,\u201d she told herself as she stepped out of her truck. \u201cThey always cover this sort of dilemma.\u201d</p><p>She headed for the front door, which opened just before she knocked. Sam grinned.</p> <p>\u201cHey, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. His hair was mused, his expression amused. His mouth curved in what Texans would have described as a shit-eating grin. He was a man who knew he was about to get lucky.</p><p>She took in the Hawaiian-print shirt, worn jeans, and bare feet, and thought he looked good enough to be a poster boy for sin. She wasn\u2019t sure what he saw when he looked at her, but he liked it enough to pull her close and kiss her senseless.</p><p>\u201cThis time I really plan to feed you dinner,\u201d he said when he released her. He kissed her again. \u201cBut it might be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate works for me.\u201d</p><p>He drew her into the house and shut the door behind her. \u201cHow about some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Get me drunk. So typical.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled, put his arm around her, and guided her to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked as he opened a bottle of Marcelli Wines Merlot.</p><p>\u201cGood. I drove up to see my family. We have a brunch every Sunday morning. It\u2019s something of a command performance unless you\u2019re out of town. They make me crazy, but I love them. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He poured the wine. \u201cI went to work. I don\u2019t usually on Sunday, but I felt restless.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYour fault, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing there\u2019s that sound you make when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said, cutting him off. She\u2019d been doing her best not to think about the wild abandon she\u2019d displayed in Sam\u2019s bed... and shower. She\u2019d always thought of herself as sexually conservative and not very passionate. Apparently she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>She clutched her wineglass in both hands and mentioned something that had been bothering her. \u201cI hope we didn\u2019t disturb Elena. That would be really embarrassing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry. Her room is downstairs at the opposite end of the house. There\u2019s no way she could have heard. But if it makes you feel any better, she\u2019s not going to be around for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister fell and broke her hip. Elena flew out this morning to stay with her for about a month.\u201d He shifted toward her. \u201cSo it\u2019s just us. No adult supervision to be had.\u201d</p><p>The closer Sam got, the more her heart raced, her breathing quickened, and before he even reached for her, she felt her muscles tensing in anticipation.</p><p>She put her wine on the counter and reached for him. \u201cSo we can be as bad as we want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. In fact, I\u2019ve been having a very vivid fantasy that involves you, some champagne, and the kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>She shivered with delight. \u201cCount me\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth claimed hers. Francesca surrendered to his passionate kiss. Her mouth parted and she stroked his tongue with hers. Instantly her breasts swelled, her panties got damp, and her bones turned to al dente pasta.</p><p>The hunger returned. Despite the pleasure she\u2019d experienced the night before and this morning, she wanted him again. Touching her. In her. It was as if she\u2019d never experienced lovemaking before being with Sam. It was\u2014</p><p>The ringing of the telephone cut through the quiet of the kitchen. Sam barely raised his head.</p><p>\u201cThe machine will get it,\u201d he murmured as he trailed kisses along her jaw, then down her neck to her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s one of your women?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t have any women right now. No, I take that back. I have you.\u201d</p><p>He returned his attention to her mouth. The phone continued to ring three more times. On the fourth she heard Sam\u2019s voice telling the caller to leave a name and number. There was a click, followed by a voice.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Sam, if you\u2019re out of town...\u201d The woman speaking sighed heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s Tanya. Again. I\u2019ve already called five times without leaving a message. Now I guess I don\u2019t have a choice. You need to call me right away. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>She kept on talking as she gave her number, but Francesca stopped listening. Sam had stiffened and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my ex-wife,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy the hell would she be calling?\u201d He glanced at Francesca. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from her in years. Ten, maybe twelve.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a little push toward the phone. \u201cShe said it\u2019s an emergency. You should pick up.\u201d</p><p>Sam hesitated, not wanting to spoil the moment, then realized it was too late for that. He grabbed the phone. \u201cTanya, it\u2019s Sam. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d she said, sounding both frustrated and impatient. \u201cIt took me the better part of the morning to find your damn number and then you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to speak to you, too,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled loudly. \u201cOkay\u2014good point. I\u2019m being a bitch and you have no idea why.\u201d</p><p>Her nature, he thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d she continued. \u201cOh, crap. I don\u2019t know how to tell you this. It\u2019s been too long. It\u2019s all your mother\u2019s fault. If she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d Sam interrupted. His mother had died nearly eight years ago. \u201cWhat does she have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust her usual meddling. I had these plans, Sam. I worked damn hard, and no one is going to take it away from me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanya, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang. Sam turned toward the front of the house and frowned. He\u2019d closed the gate after Francesca had arrived. How had anyone gotten inside?</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Tanya asked. \u201cOh God, was it the doorbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, wait.\u201d Tanya\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cI\u2019m going to hang up. In a few minutes you\u2019re going to want to call me back. I just left my number on your machine. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>With that, the line went dead. Sam stared at the receiver for a second, then set it back on the base. The doorbell rang again.</p><p>He turned to Francesca. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on. Tanya didn\u2019t make sense, and I need to get the door.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t sweat it, Sam.\u201d</p><p>She looked calm, content, and too sexy for words. He grabbed her, quickly kissed her, then smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d he promised. \u201cThen I\u2019m taking you upstairs and having my way with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He released her and hurried to the front door. He pulled it open, not sure who would be standing there. He didn\u2019t expect to see a girl with red curly hair, freckles, and big green eyes.</p><p>Sam glanced from her to the gate, which was still closed. \u201cHow\u2019d you get in here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI climbed.\u201d She shifted her large backpack. \u201cAre you Sam Reese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2014he didn\u2019t know anything about kids, but he would guess she was in her early teens\u2014squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m Kelly Nash. Your daughter.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>S am stared at the girl. She stared back. Neither of them blinked.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard her correctly, he told himself. Or daughter had become one of those words that had multiple meanings. Like bad meaning \u201cgood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Kelly pushed past him and entered the house. \u201cYour daughter. You know. Your kid, your offspring.\u201d She dropped her backpack on the floor and glanced around. \u201cNice place. Didn\u2019t Tanya call you? It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know where I was going.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door. What the hell was going on?</p><p>\u201cTanya?\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned back to him and rolled her eyes. \u201cTanya Nash. Your ex-wife. My mother. I bugged out this morning. I figured she\u2019d get in touch with you and let you know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out,\u201d he said, speaking slowly because he didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cShe called right before you knocked on the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Let me guess. She hung up and said you should call her back. She\u2019s not real big on taking responsibility, you know. I\u2019m starved. Is there anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He saw Francesca enter the hallway. She smiled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at her, then back at him. \u201cThe new wife?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. This wasn\u2019t happening. Not really. His daughter? With Tanya? He hadn\u2019t seen his ex-wife in years. They\u2019d been divorced. She\u2019d never said anything about being pregnant, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t the type to raise a kid on her own.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked Kelly.</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d She sighed heavily. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know. Right when you divorced. Can I help it if you couldn\u2019t keep your pants on? Do you think this is what I wanted? But I didn\u2019t have a choice. Tanya\u2019s leaving the country, okay? And she\u2019s not taking me with her.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s baby girl,\u201d Kelly said brightly. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a special family moment. Look. I haven\u2019t had anything to eat since the plane. The tip for the limo ride up from the L.A. airport took all my cash, so I couldn\u2019t stop or anything. You got food in this place?\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked as stunned as he felt. Kelly stared at them both, then shook her head. \u201cOkay. While you two sort this out, I\u2019m gonna go get something to eat. Feel free to talk amongst yourselves while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>With that she sauntered down the hall and turned into the kitchen.</p><p>Sam watched her go. No way this was happening. It couldn\u2019t be. A child? A daughter?</p><p>Francesca walked toward him. \u201cYou look shocked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cA kid. She can\u2019t be mine. Tanya and I...\u201d He looked at Francesca. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have agreed to the divorce if she\u2019d known she was pregnant. She would have said something. Hell, she was always looking for an angle. All these years. Why wouldn\u2019t she have come after me for child support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.

Dorky, but true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents? I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be,\u201d Francesca told him.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d he muttered as he led the way into the kitchen.</p><p>He found Kelly spooning leftover enchiladas onto a plate. She glanced at him.</p> <p>\u201cThese look good. Take-out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy housekeeper made them.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cLive-in? Mom said you were loaded. I guess she was right, huh?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and crossed to the answering machine, where he played back the partial message from Tanya. He jotted down her number, then stalked out of the room. Francesca was right. He would take the call in his study, where he could vent his rapidly growing frustration.</p><p>Francesca walked into the kitchen as Kelly put the plate into the microwave. The girl studied the control panel, then punched several minutes. The state-of-the-art machine barely hummed as it began to cook the food.</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re not the wife, are you the girlfriend?\u201d Kelly asked as she settled on a stool.</p><p>\u201cSam and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Friends. So you\u2019re having sex, but it\u2019s not serious, right?\u201d</p> <p>Francesca did her best not to react. Precocious didn\u2019t begin to describe Sam\u2019s daughter. Still, there was something about the air of bravado that was painfully familiar. Francesca remembered being out of step with the world, yet desperate to convince everyone she was fine. Maybe it was just a part of growing up, but that didn\u2019t make it any less painful.</p><p>Kelly leaned back and rested her elbows on the counter behind her. She was pretty. Slender with big eyes and a head full of beautiful red curls. Freckles dotted her nose and cheeks. She wore a cropped peach T-shirt and low-rise jeans. Both looked expensive.</p><p>\u201cFriends are different from \u2018special friends,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cSpecial friends means the woman wants to get married and the guy doesn\u2019t. He uses the word special to fake her out. Special for her, but not for him. Basically he\u2019s looking around for something better, but doesn\u2019t have the balls to leave without someone else to sleep with. Tanya says that most problems between men and women happen because the woman gives in too soon. Sexually, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Francesca leaned against the counter, mostly because her head was spinning and she didn\u2019t want to lose her balance. Sam was right. Kelly was forty on the inside.</p><p>She mentally replayed Kelly\u2019s comments. No doubt they\u2019d been deliberately chosen to get a reaction. She settled on responding with something less controversial.</p><p>\u201cYou call your mother Tanya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Kelly brushed a loose curl off her forehead. \u201cSee, she lies about her age all the time. Half the guys she goes out with don\u2019t even know she has a kid. Just in case we\u2019re ever spotted together shopping or something, she wants me to call her Tanya. That way I can be her much older sister\u2019s kid. Guys think that\u2019s really sweet. Like she\u2019s all maternal or something.\u201d Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cMost guys are so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So this line of conversation wasn\u2019t any safer. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cNew York. The Upper West Side. New York is pretty cool. I didn\u2019t want to leave, but Tanya wouldn\u2019t let me stay in the apartment on my own after she moved to Europe. I don\u2019t think Raoul even knows about me. So typical. I mean I have all my classes there. I can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019m going to miss while I\u2019m out here. Santa Barbara isn\u2019t exactly a big city.\u201d</p><p>Francesca was losing ground. \u201cYou go to school in the summer?\u201d</p><p>The microwave beeped. Kelly slid off the stool and walked to the machine. \u201cBallet,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cI dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pulled out her steaming plate and carried it back to the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s more than nice. I work hard. I plan to be a professional dancer. I did find this one school here on the Internet. The teacher used to be a principle dancer with several big companies. So that\u2019s okay. Sam will have to call her in the morning and get me an audition right away. I would have done it myself, but I only decided I was leaving yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wished this was a movie so she could push the Pause button. She needed a few minutes to catch up.</p><p>\u201cDecided? Why?\u201d</p><p>Kelly began opening drawers. She found the one with the flatware and pulled out a fork. \u201cI finally found out my dad\u2019s name. Until a few months ago I thought he was dead. Tanya had always told me he was. Then I overheard her talking about me with one of her friends.\u201d Kelly looked at her. \u201cA girlfriend. Anyway, she mentioned Sam, so I knew he was alive. I started bugging her to tell me who he was. Yesterday we had a really big fight and she blurted it out. Once I had his name, I waited until Tanya went out with Raoul, then I went through her stuff. I finally found his address in some old files.\u201d</p><p>This was the second time Kelly had mentioned Raoul, and as much as Francesca wanted to know who he was, she had a more pressing question.</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to get here on your own?\u201d</p><p>Kelly took a bite of the enchiladas and chewed. When she\u2019d swallowed, she said, \u201cEasy. I bought the ticket over the Internet. I have this credit card I can use to buy pretty much what I want. My grandmother\u2019s estate pays for all my expenses, so Tanya doesn\u2019t care. Anyway, I bought the ticket, arranged for the limo, and prepaid that. I forgot about the tip, though, which is a bummer. I guess Sam will give me more cash.\u201d</p><p>She considered the problem for a second, then continued. \u201cTanya spent the night with Raoul, so she wasn\u2019t home. I got a cab, went to the airport, and got on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been that easy,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cSure it was. I\u2019m old enough to fly on my own. I just waited until the flight was boarding, then I went up to the gate person and announced myself. She started to freak, asking about my parents. I said my mom was parking the car. Have you been to JFK airport? Do you have any idea what a pain that is? She knew if she waited for someone to show up, they\u2019d never get the plane out on time. Oh, and I lied about my age. I said I was fifteen. She believed me. So I got on board and here I am.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sounded calm and competent, but Francesca couldn\u2019t help thinking no twelve-year-old should have to fly across the country on her own to find a father she\u2019d never met because her mother was moving to Europe.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything to drink?\u201d Kelly asked, eyeing the open bottle of Merlot.</p><p>Francesca crossed to the refrigerator. \u201cHow about some milk?\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cFine. I need the calcium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Sam demanded. He held the cordless phone to his ear and paced the length of his office.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how your mother found out I was pregnant,\u201d Tanya said. \u201cFor all I know she paid off my doctor. That\u2019s not the point. What I\u2019m saying is that two weeks after you and I agreed to get a divorce and I moved out, I found out I was expecting. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. No way that was true. Tanya would have been calculating how much having his baby would earn her.</p><p>\u201cTwo days later your mother showed up on my doorstep. She knew about the divorce and the pregnancy. She didn\u2019t want me going back to you or even telling you about the baby.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against his desk and rubbed his eyes with his free hand. \u201cShe knew I wouldn\u2019t have divorced you if I\u2019d known you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. At that point she was willing to do anything to get me out of your life. Even give up her own grandchild.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t want to believe it, but he understood his mother. She\u2019d spent her entire life manipulating people and events to suit her purpose, including him.</p><p>He knew his mother and he knew Tanya, which made the next question easy. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Two hundred and fifty thousand up front, five thousand a month until she was eighteen or went to live with you, and payment of all her expenses. In return I was to move to New York and make sure you never found out about Kelly.\u201d</p><p>He was numb. \u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve worked my ass off for the past twelve years, Sam. I\u2019ve married twice to men with money, and by God I earned every penny of my settlements. I\u2019m finally financially secure, and I\u2019m ready to live my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kelly would get in the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-four. That\u2019s practically middle-aged. I can\u2019t have a twelve-year-old daughter.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m getting married and moving to Europe. Kelly can\u2019t come with me. I was going to put her into a boarding school, but when I told her, she freaked out. She wanted me to let her stay in the apartment. She\u2019s involved in ballet and that\u2019s all that matters to her. I suppose with the right staff... but I couldn\u2019t risk it. All it would take is one emergency, and Raoul would find out about her.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying a man who doesn\u2019t even know you have a daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told him about her. I\u2019ve been careful to keep them apart.\u201d</p><p>All he could do was wonder what he\u2019d ever seen in Tanya. Then he remembered. He\u2019d been twenty-two, fresh out of college, and abroad on his own. Tanya had been beautiful, charming, and the living, breathing embodiment of every fantasy he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left a message with your mother\u2019s law firm telling them you now have custody of Kelly,\u201d Tanya said. \u201cThey\u2019ll take care of the paperwork. I\u2019ve dealt with her for the past twelve years, Sam. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis means you\u2019ll be giving up the money,\u201d he said cynically.</p><p>\u201cI know. I can afford to. She\u2019s actually not that much trouble. Get her into a dance class and a private school, and you\u2019ll barely notice she\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>Her callousness stunned him. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me out to be such a bitch,\u201d Tanya said. \u201cKelly\u2019s done fine. She doesn\u2019t want for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about parents?\u201d</p><p>Tanya laughed. \u201cRight. Because if I\u2019d come back twelve years ago, you would have been so happy to find out we were having a child together. You hated me, Sam. You wanted me gone and you were willing to pay any price to get that. So here\u2019s the rest of the bill. I\u2019m having her things packed up. They\u2019ll be there by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to talk to Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I doubt she wants to talk to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hung up.</p><p>Sam slowly pushed the Off button on the phone and set it on the desk. As he did so, he glanced at his watch. It had been less than twenty minutes since Kelly had walked into his house. Twenty minutes during which his entire world had spun out of control.</p><p>Now what?</p> <p>Sam walked into the kitchen to find Kelly finishing off her plate of enchiladas. Francesca stood by the sink, a glass of wine in her hand. He couldn\u2019t blame her for that, although he wanted something stronger than Merlot.</p><p>\u201cI talked to your mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelly carefully put down her fork, then wiped her mouth on a paper towel before turning toward him. Her wide green eyes didn\u2019t show any emotion.</p><p>He studied her face, looking for similarities. He thought he might see traces of Tanya, maybe in her high cheekbones and the shape of her mouth, but he wasn\u2019t sure. Nor did he see any resemblance to himself. Was his ex-wife lying?</p><p>He dismissed the question. Tanya might be out for the easy buck, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. Why would she try to pass someone else\u2019s kid off as his? All it would take was a DNA test to determine paternity. If he wasn\u2019t the father, he would hunt Tanya down and return Kelly. If Tanya was really running off with some guy who didn\u2019t know about Kelly, she wouldn\u2019t want to risk Sam showing up with her kid.</p> <p>\u201cDid she tell you about Raoul?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cHis father is some minor count or something. Euro-trash. But Tanya is totally into the title thing and Raoul\u2019s the heir. His dad is pretty old, but Raoul is only like twenty-five. They\u2019re going to live part-time in Paris and part-time at some big house Raoul has in the south of France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe only mentioned that she would be living abroad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>She spoke the words casually, as if they didn\u2019t matter. Sam tried to see past them. Wouldn\u2019t a twelve-year-old girl care that her mother had abandoned her? But Kelly met his gaze calmly, barely blinking, displaying no emotion.</p><p>\u201cShe said you\u2019re into ballet,\u201d he told her, avoiding the \u201cstuck with\u201d part of Kelly\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cApparently there\u2019s a prestigious teacher here in Santa Barbara,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cKelly did some research on the Internet.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly nodded, her curls bouncing with the movement. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to set up an audition. I brought workout clothes with me in my backpack, but that\u2019s all. So I guess I need to go shopping for some stuff. You can drop me off at a mall in the morning. Or can I take a cab? Do you have cabs out here?\u201d</p><p>Sam held up his hands. \u201cHold on. One thing at a time. Your mother said she was sending your things. They\u2019ll be here at the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd between now and then what am I supposed to do? Tanya never said you were cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He wasn\u2019t going to argue with her about shopping. There were more important issues. School. No. It was June. School was out for the summer. Shit. Which meant she was going to be around all the time. Could he leave a twelve-year-old alone while he went to work?</p><p>He thought of her ability to travel from New York to Santa Barbara. Leave her alone? It sounded more like he was going to have to lock her up.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of things to figure out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cWhatever. I just want to get back to dance class right away. You\u2019ll call in the morning, right? I have the number in my backpack.\u201d</p> <p>Dance class would keep her busy\u2014probably a good thing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>Kelly slid off the stool. \u201cGood. I wrote down the names of my teachers and where I\u2019ve been studying. Be sure to sound forceful when you call. Dance teachers respond to pressure from crabby parents. You might want to mention you\u2019re rich. They like that, too.\u201d</p><p>The longer she spoke, the more he could see his ex-wife in her. \u201cThanks for the advice,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>She left the kitchen. Francesca crossed to the counter and picked up her dirty plate. \u201cAt least she\u2019s not a wallflower,\u201d she murmured as she carried the dish, fork, and glass to the sink.</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d He swore. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Elena left this morning. Talk about timing.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that. You can\u2019t leave her alone all day.\u201d</p><p>Kelly returned before Sam could ask Francesca why not. From what he could see, the kid could sure take care of herself.</p><p>He glanced at the backpack. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any more luggage than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I didn\u2019t want to bring a lot of clothes. I didn\u2019t know what would be in style out here. I mean, is it West Coast chic or just backwoods ugly?\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t know how to answer the question, so he ignored it. Instead he led the way out of the kitchen and upstairs.</p><p>On the second floor he walked to the far end of the hall\u2014at the opposite end of the house from his bedroom\u2014and door.</p><p>While there were five bedrooms upstairs, only three were furnished. He\u2019d given Kelly the largest guestroom. The big, open space held a queen-size bed, a dresser, a desk, and an armoire with a television. The attached bathroom was as spacious as the bedroom.</p><p>Kelly dropped her backpack on the bed and prowled the room. Her stride was long and graceful. She held her head high. Years of dance training, he thought, then wondered if she was going to need some kind of workout room. Didn\u2019t dancers need hardwood floors and a wall of mirrors?</p><p>Kelly pushed open the closet and examined the space, then pulled on the armoire\u2019s doors. \u201cOh, good. A TV. Do you have cable or satellite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCable.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a DVD player. We\u2019ll need to take care of that this week. I\u2019m sure Tanya will be sending my DVDs along with my other stuff. Once I\u2019m settled and stuff, we need to redecorate this room.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBlue isn\u2019t my color.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at the light blue walls and the multicolored quilt on the bed. Elena had taken care of fixing up the two guest rooms. His level of involvement had stopped at signing the check.</p><p>He was five seconds from overload, he thought and grabbed the door handle.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll just watch TV, then go to bed early. I\u2019m still on East Coast time. Plus I got up early for my flight.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, not sure what to say to her. Then he simply nodded, wished her good night, pulled the door shut, and stepped back into the hall.</p><p>He found Francesca still in the kitchen. When he walked into the room, they looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d He thought about their plans for the evening. No way that was happening now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all this messing up our evening,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sign up for anything like this. If you want to take off, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks for giving me an out, but I don\u2019t mind sticking around. I have a feeling you\u2019re going to need someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>Some of his tension eased. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019re friends.\u201d She hesitated over the last word, then shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m glad to help. I might not have kids of my own, but I used to be one, just like you. We can brainstorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. But first I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the bottle of wine. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI want something a lot stronger than that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly listened at the door. When she couldn\u2019t hear anything, she slowly pulled it open. There was only a faint murmur of voices from downstairs.</p><p>Good, she told herself as she returned to the bed and opened her backpack. She was tired, just like she said. Being alone was better than hanging out with someone she didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>She pulled out her dance clothes and tucked them in a drawer. She\u2019d brought a change of clothes, a bathing suit, a small bag of makeup and skin-care stuff, and a toothbrush. Tucked in an interior zipper compartment was the credit card she always used. If Sam didn\u2019t take her to the mall, she would order what she needed online. It wasn\u2019t as cool as actually trying stuff on, but she\u2019d done it before. She checked that the card was still there.</p><p>Some kids had parents who took care of things like buying clothes and CDs and stuff. Tanya had never been into maintenance. Kelly couldn\u2019t remember her mother ever cooking for her, or laying out clothes. Whatever maid was around did that kind of stuff. At least she used to. Kelly had been handling that herself for years.</p><p>After she\u2019d washed her face and brushed her teeth, she changed into cotton pjs and carried her backpack to the closet. But before stuffing it on the top shelf, she opened it one last time and pulled out a worn, tattered Pooh bear. The fur was rubbed off one side of the face. One arm hung at an awkward angle, and the cheerful yellow T-shirt the bear had been wearing had faded to a dingy gray.</p><p>Kelly studied the stuffed animal, then shoved the backpack in the closet and closed the door.</p><p>She would be fine, she told herself. Except she didn\u2019t believe it. After years of threatening, her mother had finally gotten rid of her. What if her dad didn\u2019t want her, either? If he threw her out, where was she going to go?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about it, so she climbed into bed and pulled up the covers. After tucking Pooh under one arm, she tightly closed her eyes. But no matter how hard she squeezed her eyelids, she couldn\u2019t stop the tears from escaping and dripping down her cheeks.</p><p>7</p><p>S am poured himself a scotch, then moved to the sofa where Francesca had already settled.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d he said, leaning his head against the back of the sofa and resting the glass on his flat belly. \u201cTwelve-year-olds do not fly across the country on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one did. Kelly explained the process.\u201d Francesca told him about the Internet purchases and the limo service.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s resourceful,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIndependent. Mouthy.\u201d</p><p>And used to being taken care of, Francesca thought, remembering the dishes Kelly had left on the counter. She was not a child who picked up after herself.</p><p>He took a sip of his drink. \u201cShe informed me that the room was acceptable, but she needed a DVD player, and when things were settled she wanted to talk about redecorating.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cApparently blue isn\u2019t her color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not afraid to ask for what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d He closed his eyes and sucked in a breath. \u201cA daughter. After all this time.\u201d</p><p>Francesca knew she felt shell-shocked, and she was only an interested bystander. Sam must feel as if he\u2019d been hit by a truck.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to check paternity?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at her. \u201cDNA test? I thought about it. I guess I\u2019ll have to at some point. But while Tanya has no problem lying to get what she wants, she\u2019s not stupid. She knows I wouldn\u2019t keep a child who wasn\u2019t mine, and the last thing she wants right now is Kelly being returned to her. I don\u2019t know. Do you think she looks like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Around her mouth. But she didn\u2019t get that hair from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He stretched out his legs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think about all of this. I had no idea. When Tanya left\u2014hell, I don\u2019t remember much about that except wanting her gone. All these years I never guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you? You had no clues. She\u2019s been living on the other side of the country. It\u2019s not as if you ran into her and Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cI should be mad or something. I missed out on Kelly growing up. But I can\u2019t get angry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned toward him and lightly touched his arm. \u201cGive yourself a break. Right now you don\u2019t feel anything, and that\u2019s not so bad. You\u2019ll start processing the information over time, and with that will come emotion.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s your degree talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I have to use it every now and then or it gets dusty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Ms. Psychologist. What\u2019s my next move? Is it mentally healthy for me to run for the hills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. As for what\u2019s next, you\u2019re going to have to play that by ear. You and Kelly need to get to know each other. That will take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime, huh? Want to give me a ballpark of how long it\u2019s going to take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. About any of it.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cThe bitch took money.\u201d</p> <p>It took Francesca a second to figure out who he meant. \u201cTanya?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy mother paid her off to keep Kelly a secret. Two hundred and fifty thousand up front, five thousand a month, plus expenses.\u201d</p><p>Francesca felt her mouth drop open. She consciously pressed her lips together. \u201cBut why would she want to get rid of her own grandchild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to know my mother to understand that.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cLily Reese liked to rule her kingdom, and she would use any means to keep her subjects in line. My father died when I was pretty young. I don\u2019t remember him much. When Lily was around, her word was law. When she was gone, which was most of the time, I lived with my paternal grandfather. Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you hired Elena for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. He was sane and normal. Two claims my mother couldn\u2019t make. God, they fought. He threatened to sue for custody more than once, but she got right back in his face. She was more than willing to take him on. She had money, power, and was fearless.\u201d</p> <p>The tone of his voice told her he didn\u2019t mean the words as a compliment.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was ten, I had already learned to mistrust everything she said. She lied because she liked to. Because it worked. As I got older, I was sent away to prep school. I spent holidays with Gabriel. After college I escaped to Europe, where I met Tanya.\u201d He raised his glass. \u201cA Miss California runner-up, well traveled, but not rich. She wanted money, I wanted...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe met, I fell in love, or so I thought, and we got married two months later. My mother was furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she like Tanya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey loathed each other because they were so much alike. In one of those humorous twists of fate, I\u2019d traveled all the way to France only to find the one woman exactly like my mother.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cYou could write a paper about me.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cPeople fall for partners just like one of their parents all the time. If that parent is a good, loving person, the relationship works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the new wife is lying and manipulative, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me three months to figure out my mistake. By then my mother was already campaigning for the marriage to end. I was torn between my own happiness and doing what she wanted. Rebelling against that kept me in the marriage another six months. Then I ended it. All Tanya wanted was a big settlement. There were no broken hearts on either side.\u201d</p><p>He told the story easily, as if it no longer mattered. As it had been twelve years ago, Francesca didn\u2019t doubt Sam was long recovered. He\u2019d moved on. Until Kelly had arrived, literally at his door, bringing the past back to life.</p><p>\u201cSo when she found out Tanya was pregnant, she paid her off to keep her away from you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019d known she was pregnant, I would have put the divorce on hold, at least until the baby was born.\u201d He frowned. \u201cA baby. I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a baby anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have that right.\u201d He straightened. \u201cSo what do I do with her? Are you sure she\u2019s not old enough to be left alone while I\u2019m at work?\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly capable of taking care of herself for a few hours, but I wouldn\u2019t leave her in the house by herself all day. She\u2019s into ballet. That gives you a place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She mentioned a school or a class. That will fill some time. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you get to know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does she eat? How much? What about clothes? She wants a DVD player. Should I buy her one?\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve all the problems at once. Having a child dropped in your lap with no warning is going to offer some logistical challenges. Take them one at a time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLogistical challenges? Is that the professional term for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I hope you appreciate that I\u2019m volunteering all this information for free. I\u2019m a highly paid professional.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWell, I will be in about eighteen months.\u201d</p><p>He shifted so he was facing her. After setting his glass on the coffee table, he stretched out his arm along the back of the sofa and touched her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being great. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t mind helping.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t tell him was the way he\u2019d handled the entire situation had made her like him more. He wasn\u2019t just a pretty face and great in bed. He could have gone ballistic when Kelly showed up. Instead he\u2019d remained relatively calm. Despite the shock he had to be feeling, he was planning things through, worrying about his daughter, and not blaming anyone.</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her. His mouth was warm, firm, and tender, but not passionate. Francesca understood. Having an unexpected child show up had a way of changing the flow of a date.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much going on over the next few days,\u201d she told him. \u201cI should be working on the outline for my dissertation, but I\u2019m practicing creative avoidance instead. Would you like me to come over tomorrow morning and help out with things?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYou have no idea how much I want to say yes. But this isn\u2019t your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s yours. So? Do you really want to do this all on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. But we had that definition of great sex and no complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an exception this one time.\u201d She looked into his eyes. \u201cI mean it, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll stop pushing back and say thank you.\u201d He glanced at his watch, then shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t make any arrangements tonight, so I guess I won\u2019t be going into work tomorrow.\u201d He touched her face. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind coming over, that would be great. At least then there will be two of us on the side of the grown-ups. You think that will make things even?\u201d</p><p>Francesca thought about Kelly\u2019s precocious sophistication. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably still outthink us, but at least we can band together.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re terrific. Thanks for all of this.\u201d</p><p>His words made her feel warm inside. Sort of melty and squishy. Good thing she\u2019d sworn off romantic entanglements years ago, or she could be in real danger here.</p><p>She rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to head home. We\u2019re both going to need our rest for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cWhen we face the terror of the preteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Just remember. You\u2019re the adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. Kelly\u2019s the one we have to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure she\u2019s not dead?\u201d Gabriel asked as he leaned back in the kitchen chair. \u201cIt\u2019s after nine. Maybe you should check on her.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t think Kelly had passed away in the night. He doubted he\u2019d been lucky enough that she\u2019d run away. Of course, her leaving would be only a temporary reprieve. He would be forced to find her and drag her back. Not exactly how he wanted to start his day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her another half hour, then go check on her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Sam still hadn\u2019t made peace with that concept. A child. It didn\u2019t seem right. Not after all this time. And from what he\u2019d seen of Kelly, she wasn\u2019t exactly the kid he would have chosen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with her?\u201d his grandfather asked.</p><p>Sam glanced out the large window over the sink. \u201cHell if I know. Get her settled. She wants to take some ballet classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about carting her around? She can\u2019t drive. You\u2019re going to have to hire someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019d already spent some time on the phone, but professional day care for preteens was sadly lacking. \u201cThe nannies all want to work with little kids and babies. I have a few people checking. They\u2019re supposed to get back to me.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather picked up his coffee mug. \u201cTanya\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>After Francesca had left the previous evening, Sam had called his grandfather to tell him what had happened. Gabriel had been furious at the deception, but not surprised. He\u2019d shown up bright and early to examine his great-granddaughter, but Kelly had yet to make an appearance.</p><p>\u201cAt least the kid isn\u2019t an idiot,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cIt took brains for her to travel all this way herself. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Sam was trying not to say much until Gabriel had met Kelly. Maybe she would be better this morning. Maybe last night\u2019s demands and attitude had been more about being tired than anything else.</p><p>Unlikely, he thought grimly. Very unlikely.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m taking responsibility for her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound like a dog you brought home,\u201d Kelly said as she breezed in the kitchen. \u201cDo I get my own leash and water bowl, too?\u201d</p><p>So much for a good night\u2019s sleep improving things, Sam told himself.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said. \u201cGabriel, this is my daughter, Kelly. Kelly, this is your great-grandfather Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>The old man looked her over. Sam saw she\u2019d pulled on the same low-rise jeans and yet another abbreviated T-shirt. This one was green, tight, and proclaimed \u201cGirls Rule.\u201d She was barefoot. Her toes were painted, her skin pale.</p><p>Kelly tucked several curls behind her ears as she walked past them and headed for the refrigerator. \u201cWhatever. So is there anything for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s temper boiled, but before he could say anything, Gabriel pounded his cane on the tiled kitchen floor. Kelly jumped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou should lock this one up until she learns some manners,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelly planted her hands on her hips. \u201cWe\u2019re not in that century anymore.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say she was a smart-mouth, Sam. She got that from her mother.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cAre we done? Can I eat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at him as if he\u2019d started speaking Russian.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cMay I eat now,\u201d he told her. \u201cCan is ability. May is permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re one of those.\u201d She turned back to the refrigerator and muttered something about \u201cweird old men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of freckles,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBecause until this moment I hadn\u2019t been sure. I kept scrubbing my face, but they wouldn\u2019t come off. Freckles. Who knew?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cCan we send her back?\u201d</p><p>I wish, Sam thought. \u201cWe all need time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shut the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019d rather be back in New York. Tell you what, Grandpa. Just set me up in an apartment and I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll go to school, then my ballet classes, and you won\u2019t even have to remember that you ever met me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel grumbled something under his breath. Sam wondered if he was doing the math to figure out how much it would cost him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to New York,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cIt\u2019s been less than twenty-four hours. Why don\u2019t we back off for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Kelly scowled. \u201cTell him to back off.\u201d She walked to the pantry. \u201cWhat did the ballet teacher say when you spoke with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned on him. \u201cWhat? I asked you to do one thing. Just one. Not twenty, not even five. And you couldn\u2019t do it. Why? Is this just to torture me or do you have a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith things that are important to you. Not with things that are important to me.\u201d</p><p>Sam gripped his coffee mug so tightly, he thought he might snap it in two. His first instinct was to send Kelly to her room and ground her for life. Not that he knew what terms would be considered grounding. Locking her up sounded pretty damn good, though.</p> <p>He thought about telling her she\u2019d just lost her chance at ever attending a ballet class, but quickly reconsidered. Getting her out of the house for a few hours a day could be a blessing for both of them.</p><p>He sucked in a breath. \u201cYou know that DVD player you wanted?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can forget it until you learn to speak politely and respectfully.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou are so kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll buy it myself.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. The credit card, compliments of his mother\u2019s estate. He would have to take care of that next.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you calling the ballet teacher?\u201d she asked through gritted teeth. \u201cI want you to do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get to it when it\u2019s convenient for me. You can hurry the process along by being civil or you can wait. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I absolutely am. I know you\u2019ve been through hell, and I\u2019m sorry about that. However, your circumstances don\u2019t give you the right to mouth off.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked at him as if he were dog crap on her shoes. \u201cIf you\u2019re so worried about what I say, then you shouldn\u2019t swear in front of me. Or do the rules only apply to me? Don\u2019t you have to be civil, too?\u201d</p><p>With that she turned on her heel and left the room.</p><p>Sam clutched his mug, not sure if he was going to drink the contents or throw it across the room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a handful,\u201d Gabriel said.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess locking her up would be against the law,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t completely sure he was kidding. \u201cYou know it would be. And it wouldn\u2019t solve any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would. You could report me and the state would take her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. What I want is for this to be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only day one,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>It was mid-afternoon. She\u2019d arrived about an hour before to find Kelly eating lunch by herself and Sam holed up in his office. Neither of them seemed to be speaking to the other, and Kelly had barely acknowledged her.</p><p>She and Sam were out on the deck, enjoying the warm afternoon, with a soft ocean breeze blowing over them. He was holding her hand, which made her want to talk about tangled sheets instead of his daughter. But that wasn\u2019t an option right now. Which was really too bad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d he told her, then explained what had happened that morning when Gabriel had been over to meet Kelly.</p><p>Francesca winced. \u201cOkay, so we won\u2019t describe her as shy or timid. What did your grandfather say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can repeat in mixed company. He wasn\u2019t a fan of my ex-wife\u2019s, either, and to his mind, Kelly is too much like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you handled the situation really well. If she wants a DVD player, that gives you something to hold over her head.\u201d She glanced at him and smiled. \u201cI mean that figuratively, not literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not interested in hurting her. What I would like instead is to deal with a regular child instead of Teen-zilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have access to a computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In the other guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she could go buy the player herself. She\u2019s good at that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot anymore. I\u2019ve canceled her credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI contacted the law firm handling my mother\u2019s estate. Tanya had already told them that I had custody of Kelly. The lawyer I spoke with said I was entitled to the same monetary provisions Tanya had\u2014Kelly\u2019s expenses covered plus five thousand a month.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI told them that wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be crabby when she finds out she can\u2019t shop at will.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI know. I figured I\u2019d let her find out for herself.\u201d His humor faded. \u201cThe lawyer told me something else. When Kelly was born, my mother had the paternity checked. The kid is mine.\u201d</p><p>Francesca was afraid to ask if that was good or bad. \u201cAt least you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot of doubt, but yeah, I know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI got in touch with that ballet teacher, too. Angelina something. She\u2019s willing to see Kelly tomorrow. Apparently there\u2019s an audition process to get into this class. It must be a big deal. She has an appointment at eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to take her?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at her. \u201cYou have your own life and it doesn\u2019t include Teen-zilla.\u201d</p><p>Francesca smiled. \u201cAgreed, but I was serious when I said I would help. Hey, I spent the morning organizing my closet just to avoid working on my outline. Driving Kelly to her ballet audition would be a far better displacement activity. I could come here first thing and you could go to work.\u201d</p><p>He looked as hopeful as a drowning man spotting a rescue boat. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to return the favor.\u201d He brought her hand to his mouth and lightly kissed her knuckles.</p><p>The brush of his lips against her skin sent heat racing through her body, but before she could do something wild like throw herself at him and beg to be taken, he lowered his arm back to the table between their chairs.</p><p>Oh, well. Maybe next time.</p><p>\u201cI have this theory about Kelly,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking about her while cleaning out my closet. I think she\u2019s in a lot of emotional pain.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at her. \u201cFrom her mother dumping her on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. The way Kelly talks about her life in New York, she was completely on her own. Even if you factor out a child\u2019s inclination to exaggerate, it\u2019s still pretty awful. You mentioned that Tanya was seeing someone she wanted to marry who never knew about Kelly. Combine those elements and you have a child who feels unloved and unwelcome. In her mind she could be thinking she\u2019s so horrible, she has to be kept a secret. Then her mother abandons her, and she meets a father she never knew about. Kelly has to be terrified, lonely, and really hurting.\u201d</p><p>He considered the information. \u201cYou think that\u2019s why she\u2019s being so difficult? She\u2019s lashing out like a wounded animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. With some time and positive attention, she\u2019ll be a completely different person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that person is worse?\u201d</p><p>Francesca chuckled. \u201cShe won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d He rubbed his thumb across the back of her hand. \u201cI went online, looking for some parenting books. There are a bunch on raising teens, and the descriptions scared the hell out of me. I want to back up and get her younger. Or when she\u2019s eighteen. Plus none of them had any practical information on things like what to feed her and how much sleep she needs.\u201d</p><p>Francesca did her best to ignore the tingling brought on by his light stroking and instead pay attention to the conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s not a llama. She doesn\u2019t have a special diet. Offer her healthy food and let her pick what she wants. As for sleep, by the end of summer you will know how much she needs so she\u2019s alert for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealthy food? I was going to order in Chinese tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine once in a while. You don\u2019t have to dine on tofu every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dining on tofu ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a steak guy?\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m a man of simple tastes. I know what I like and I go after it.\u201d</p><p>She melted. Right there on the chair. Sam leaned forward and kissed her. Just as she parted her mouth, a door slammed in the house. Sam swore.</p><p>She considered the single word, then sighed. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>\u201cA nd one, and two, and three, and now!\u201d</p><p>Kelly moved in time with the music. She swept her arms up in the air, then bent low at the waist, turning slightly. Her young face was the picture of concentration. Despite the plain black tights and leotards, with her hair pulled back and her skin bare of makeup, she reminded Francesca of a butterfly in a flower garden, flitting with grace and delight on a perfect summer day.</p><p>As she had learned in the past hour, the reality of ballet was far more about hard work than flitting, but the end result was just as beautiful. As the music swelled slightly, Kelly rose on her toes and began to turn slowly. Her little skirt swayed with the movement.</p><p>Francesca knew she should be working on organizing her paper, or reading the research book she\u2019d brought with her, but she\u2019d been unable to tear her attention away from Kelly\u2019s dance audition. What she knew about ballet and classical music wouldn\u2019t fill a thimble. She\u2019d seen The Nutcracker a couple of times, but other than that her cultural education had been limited to the occasional trip to the opera.</p><p>Sitting at the edge of the practice room, she could see firsthand how difficult the moves were. The first half hour had been devoted to specific moves done at slow speed. But the lack of speed didn\u2019t make it easy. Parts of different dances had filled the second half hour. The instructor had called out the name of a ballet and some other instructions in French, then Kelly had performed.</p><p>Francesca watched her. The slender preteen moved with a grace that made Francesca envious. With her hair pulled back, she looked older than twelve. Her eyes seemed more green than they had the night before. She was already pretty\u2014becoming beautiful was only a few years away. Sam was going to have plenty of trouble when the boys started to come calling.</p><p>The instructor\u2014Miss Angelina\u2014spoke in rapid French. Francesca had taken a couple of years of Spanish in high school and knew a smattering of Italian from her father\u2019s family. For all she knew, Miss Angelina was telling Kelly to get ready to rob a convenience store. But instead of reaching for weapons, Kelly curtsied.</p><p>Miss Angelina nodded and left the room. Kelly stared after her.</p><p>In that moment, longing tightened the girl\u2019s features. She looked alone, vulnerable, and very young.</p><p>Francesca stood. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m in. No biggie. You saw those other girls when we got here. Some of them are good, but the rest...\u201d She shrugged and started toward the dressing room.</p><p>Francesca wanted to follow her and shake her. Being accepted into the dance class was a big deal. Why couldn\u2019t Kelly be excited? Why didn\u2019t she jump around like a normal kid? Or had life taught her not to show emotions because they could be used against her?</p><p>\u201cI have Kelly\u2019s application papers here,\u201d the instructor said as she walked back into the studio. Her voice was lilting, and tinged with a French accent. \u201cShe will join my upper-intermediate class. If she works hard, she\u2019ll be with the advanced students within a year.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angelina\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are her mother?\u201d She sounded doubtful.</p><p>\u201cNo. A friend of the family.\u201d</p><p>Angelina looked her over. Francesca fought against the sudden need to stand straighter and square her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cShe will need a practice room. Class is five days a week in the summer, but when school begins it is only three times a week.\u201d She shrugged delicately. \u201cShe will have to dance on her own the other days. Unless you hire a private tutor, she must attend academic classes, yes?\u201d</p><p>A private tutor? So she could dance the rest of the time. This was so not her world. At least Sam\u2019s house had plenty of bedrooms. One could probably be converted to a practice room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass the message along to her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bill.\u201d The teacher handed her another sheet of paper. \u201cThis is for a month\u2019s worth of lessons.\u201d</p><p>Francesca glanced down at the total at the bottom and nearly fell over. She could easily live on that amount for two months.</p> <p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked, trying not to look shocked.</p><p>Angelina shook her head and smiled. \u201cThe rest is up to Kelly. Soon we will see if she has the backbone and the drive to devote herself to the ballet. She has much talent, but at this stage in her career, success will be about hard work. Oui?\u201d</p><p>Kelly was only twelve. Francesca didn\u2019t think anyone should be using the word career in reference to anything she id.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for your time,\u201d Francesca told her.</p><p>Angelina nodded gracefully, then returned to her office. Seconds later Kelly emerged from the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cThat was something,\u201d Francesca said as she approached. \u201cI\u2019m amazed and impressed. I had no idea a class could be so much work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a regular class. Miss Angelina wanted to see what I could do. Is that the application and stuff?\u201d she asked, pointing at the folder.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll give it to your father when we get back to the house. Speaking of which, do you want to head home or go out for lunch? It\u2019s only a little after noon.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gave a heavy sigh of the long-suffering. \u201cLunch would be okay.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wanted to tell her not to put herself out, but she held back. As she\u2019d told Sam the previous evening, Kelly was acting up because she was scared. Somewhere under that prickly exterior was a charming young woman waiting to blossom. At least, that was the fantasy.</p><p>Thirty minutes later they were seated on a patio table in the shade. Kelly had left her hair up, but had pulled on jeans and a T-shirt over her ballet clothes. Francesca studied the menu and mentally winced at the prices. Twelve-fifty for a salad? If this was lunch, how much would dinner cost?</p><p>Not her problem, she reminded herself. That morning Sam had handed over cash, along with phone numbers and instructions to have fun. She\u2019d been uncomfortable taking money from him, but as he\u2019d pointed out, she was taking care of his daughter. That was favor enough without making her pay for anything.</p><p>She had agreed, mostly because she didn\u2019t have a choice. Places like this weren\u2019t in her budget.</p><p>The waitress arrived. They each ordered a Chinese chicken salad. Kelly asked for a cup of soup to start with while Francesca decided to content herself with the incredible French bread they\u2019d brought.</p> <p>When the two of them were alone, Francesca looked at Sam\u2019s daughter. The girl watched her carefully, as if not sure what was going to happen. Okay, so the situation was a little strange for both of them. Less than forty-eight hours ago neither had known the other existed. As the adult, Francesca knew it was up to her to make Kelly comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an incredible dancer,\u201d she began, buttering a piece of bread. \u201cHow long have you been studying ballet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was six. I took a lot of different kinds of dance. Tap, modern, and ballet. Then a couple of years later I decided to focus on ballet.\u201d</p><p>Francesca tried to remember focusing on anything but having fun with her sisters when she\u2019d been that age. \u201cDoes it hurt to go up on your toes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. You get used to it. I\u2019ve been dancing on pointe for over a year. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Francesca doubted that. \u201cIt seems like a big deal to me, but then, I\u2019ve never been very coordinated. If I tried any of those moves you were doing, I\u2019d probably take someone\u2019s eye out.\u201d</p><p>Kelly started to smile, then pressed her lips together. \u201cDid you ever dance?\u201d</p><p>Francesca knew she wasn\u2019t talking about flailing about at school dances. \u201cI was a cheerleader in high school. Does that count?\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. I can\u2019t even say I was really good at it. I was enthusiastic, but I didn\u2019t have a lot of talent. Some of the other girls had studied gymnastics, and they could do things with their bodies that astounded me. Of course, I never saw the point in being a human pretzel.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached for the bread and took a slice. \u201cAre you divorced?\u201d</p><p>The change in topic startled Francesca, but at least they were having a normal conversation. \u201cNo. I was married before, but my husband died.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFor real? Was he old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was twenty-eight. He was killed in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at her. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who died. Is it really spooky having to go to the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much about it.\u201d Todd\u2019s death had been unexpected, and the days that followed had passed in a blur. \u201cI moved back home for a few weeks, and that made a big difference. My whole family was around me. My sisters especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have sisters?\u201d Kelly actually sounded interested.</p><p>\u201cThree. Katie is a year older. Brenna is my twin, and Mia is nine years younger than me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly leaned forward. \u201cYou have a twin?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re fraternal, though, so we don\u2019t look that much alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandparents really wanted my folks to have a boy, but I kind of like that it\u2019s only girls.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s expression turned wistful. \u201cI would have liked a sister, but there was no way Tanya would ever get pregnant again. I was an accident.\u201d She picked up another slice of bread. \u201cShe used to say a mistake. She said that nothing was worth feeling sick and being fat. Plus I guess labor is really bad. You didn\u2019t have any kids, huh?\u201d</p><p>Too much information, Francesca thought. \u201cTodd and I wanted to wait a couple of years to start our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he was gone. Bummer.\u201d Kelly eyed her. \u201cAre you going to marry my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She started to say they were just friends, but then she remembered Kelly\u2019s definition of the word. While it described her relationship with Sam very well, she was uncomfortable with a twelve-year-old assuming she and Sam were having sex.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rich,\u201d Kelly informed her. \u201cTanya always said that was the most important quality a man could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cOh, please. You drive an old truck and wear cheap clothes. Why wouldn\u2019t you want someone with plenty of cash?\u201d</p><p>Francesca bristled, then reminded herself Kelly was pushing back to get a reaction. \u201cI\u2019m in graduate school. Being poor comes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like college, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have a bachelor\u2019s degree. That took four years. Now I\u2019m in a program for my master\u2019s and my Ph.D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents? Why aren\u2019t they paying for stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want them to. Going back to college was my decision. I want to pay my way.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked genuinely shocked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it gives me a sense of accomplishment. I want to be independent. This decision is about who I am as a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stupid,\u201d Kelly muttered as her soup arrived. She picked up her spoon.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you dance?\u201d Francesca asked, ignoring the \u201cstupid\u201d remark. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hard work. You sweat, you get sore. No one pays you. You might be able to have a career as a dancer, but what if you don\u2019t? You\u2019ll have put in years of hard work, and what will you have to show for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s pretty much the same. We both have long-term goals that require a lot of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I expect Sam or Tanya to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may change as you get older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Kelly ate her soup. After a couple of minutes she said, \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, perfect. So you\u2019re going to tell my dad everything you think is wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s green eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re also resourceful, independent, and self-motivated.\u201d</p><p>Kelly started to smile.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you have no sense of community, you don\u2019t seem to care about anyone but yourself, and you have no respect for authority or rules.\u201d</p><p>The smile faded.</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kelly. We all have flaws.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. So what do you want to do this afternoon? I was thinking we could go shopping and get you a few things to tide you over until your belongings arrive.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at Francesca\u2019s sundress and shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks. I don\u2019t like bargain shopping.\u201d</p><p>Did the kid know how to lob the insults or what? Francesca sipped her iced tea. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019d thought going to a movie after shopping would be fun, but if you\u2019re not interested, we\u2019ll just go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>Kelly dropped her spoon and glared, but didn\u2019t speak. Francesca could feel her outrage. Sam\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t like being maneuvered into a corner, but Francesca didn\u2019t know any other way to teach her lessons about courtesy. If Kelly wanted to blow everyone off, that was her business. But it was going to cost her things like movies and trips to the beach. With a little luck, and time, she would see the value of being more gracious.</p><p>Of course, Francesca could be wrong about all of this. Underneath the angry, hostile teen facade might be a really unpleasant kid. She hoped not, for Sam\u2019s sake. And for Kelly\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI come bearing Italian food,\u201d Brenna said as she stepped into Francesca\u2019s small apartment. \u201cMore important, I brought wine.\u201d</p><p>Francesca took the offered bottles and carried them into the kitchen. \u201cGood. I need a drink. I was getting so desperate, I was about to go to the grocery store and buy a bottle of something.\u201d She looked at the chilled bottles of Marcelli Reserve Chardonnay. \u201cThis is much better.\u201d</p><p>Brenna set a large Styrofoam container on the counter and pulled off the top. She wore her short dark hair pulled back with a headband. A loose shirt hung to mid-thigh, nearly covering her cutoff jean shorts.</p><p>\u201cSchool giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have to have actually started my dissertation for it to be a problem. Right now it\u2019s just nothing.\u201d</p><p>Brenna pulled out foil-wrapped plates. \u201cChicken Marsala, roasted potatoes with red and yellow peppers, and green beans with almonds \u00e0 la Grammy M.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s stomach growled. \u201cThanks for calling and suggesting this. I could use some company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have come to the hacienda for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of company I need. Besides, you sounded like you were looking for an escape.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was.\u201d Brenna carried the serving dishes to the table, then dug around for a corkscrew.</p><p>Francesca grabbed plates, napkins, and flatware. When the table was set, she collected a wineglass for each of them, then pulled out a chair.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa Lorenzo is making me crazy,\u201d Brenna said as she poured the wine. \u201cI\u2019ve heard several rumors about him selling the winery. A couple of our neighbors have talked to me about it. I\u2019d already asked him once, and I thought we had things settled. But with all the talk, I had to ask him again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Francesca asked as she slid a golden brown chicken breast onto her plate.</p><p>\u201cAnd he says he\u2019s considering selling.\u201d</p><p>Francesca froze. She met her sister\u2019s troubled gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Marcelli Wines is family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d She scooped a spoonful of green beans onto her plate. \u201cWe\u2019re talking nearly seventy years of tradition. I just...\u201d Brenna picked up her wineglass and took a long drink. \u201cDamn him. He\u2019s saying he has to sell because he can\u2019t depend on me to stick around. For the first eighteen years of my life, all I heard was that I had to find a man, get married, and have babies. I married Jeff right on schedule. Like I was supposed to. And now our grandfather is complaining.\u201d</p><p>Francesca felt her twin\u2019s pain. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair. If you\u2019d stayed, he would have complained about that, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. The thing is, I\u2019m back. I\u2019ve learned my lesson about men. Since Jeff and I split up, I\u2019ve buried myself in work. Within two days I realized I shouldn\u2019t have left. There\u2019s nothing I love more than the vineyards and making wine. That\u2019s all I want to do. If he sells...\u201d</p><p>Brenna angrily cut off a piece of chicken and shoved it in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to him about this?\u201d Francesca asked, even though she already knew the answer.</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cDo you think it would help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If he understood how much you cared, it might make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen. He only wants things his way.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca knew that was true. Her grandfather ruled the family with an iron fist. Make that an iron fist from the nineteenth century. His outdated rules and ideas about family life meant anyone disagreeing with him could be tossed out at a moment\u2019s notice. The exiles were usually temporary, but still painful.</p><p>\u201cI have so many ideas,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cThere are these wonderful Pinot grapes coming up for sale. I desperately want to buy them, but he won\u2019t listen. Worse, the land could be going on the market. I\u2019d kill for that.\u201d</p><p>Francesca might be floating just above the poverty level because of her studies, but Brenna\u2019s precarious financial situation was thanks to spending the past nine years supporting her soon-to-be ex-husband through his medical training. Once established as an up-and-coming cardiologist, Jeff had dumped his wife for a newer, younger model.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the divorce settlement? Can\u2019t you use that money to buy the grapes?\u201d she asked as she bit into a piece of the chicken and tried not to moan. As usual, the Grands had created something delicious, tender, and addictive.</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cIt would help, but then what? I\u2019d have grapes and no way to process them. Renting equipment and space. Jeez, Francesca, we\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She poked at the grilled potatoes on her plate. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve been whining long enough. What\u2019s going on with you? I called last night and you were out. Give me good news. Tell me you\u2019ve met a fabulous new guy and you were having hot monkey sex for hours and hours.\u201d She laughed. \u201cOn second thought, I might find that information a little depressing.\u201d</p><p>Francesca pushed a few green beans around her plate. \u201cFunny you should say that,\u201d she told her sister.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWay. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed, then raised her glass. \u201cGood for you, girlfriend. I can\u2019t believe you had sex. Are you sure? Were you all naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs there were only two of us in the room at the time, I\u2019m pretty sure I can remember that part. Yes, we were naked.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hooted. \u201cThis is so cool. Okay, start at the beginning. How did you meet? Who is this guy, and what on earth made you give up your quest for nunhood?\u201d</p><p>Francesca told her about her experiment, and Sam\u2019s rescue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that you found someone willing to rescue helpless pregnant women, but slightly put off by him asking you out while you looked like that.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what Mia said when she was here on Saturday. I\u2019d already told him I wasn\u2019t pregnant. He\u2019s in the security business and was impressed that I could pull one over on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Now get to the sex part.\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. \u201cIt just happened. I was attracted to him, and he seemed to be attracted to me. Normally I avoid that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Because it\u2019s so much more interesting to go out with guys you\u2019re not attracted to.\u201d</p><p>Francesca ignored her. \u201cI remembered what we\u2019d talked about a few months ago. When you and Katie made me promise to fall into bed with the next normal guy I met.\u201d</p><p>Brenna had been drinking. She nearly spit out her wine. \u201cFrancesca, we were kidding. If I remember correctly, we were drunk. Jeez, you can\u2019t take that kind of stuff seriously. Is that really why you slept with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Maybe.\u201d Francesca remembered the night and her feeling of being so aroused, she was out of control. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past few years avoiding relationships because I don\u2019t want to get married again. But talking with you and Katie made me wonder if maybe there was a compromise. The occasional casual relationship with a man, complete with perks, and no ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in favor of that,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cMarriage is trouble. So is love.\u201d She cut off a piece of chicken. \u201cLooking back on my sorry excuse for a marriage, I\u2019m not sure I ever loved Jeff. He was the safe choice. At least, that\u2019s what he looked like then. Now I know he was nothing but a lying weasel dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodd didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Francesca said slowly, remembering her late husband. \u201cBut he wanted arm candy instead of a partner. I hated that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. Every time you expressed an opinion, he practically patted you on the head. As if you were as cute as a puppy performing a trick.\u201d</p><p>Not what she\u2019d wanted for her life, Francesca thought. Not then and not now.</p><p>\u201cSo this Sam guy isn\u2019t like that?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Plus, he\u2019s no more interested in a commitment than I am. Especially now.\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Francesca told her about Kelly\u2019s arrival. Brenna dropped her fork as her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cA kid? He has a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeen-zilla, according to him. I don\u2019t think Kelly\u2019s all that bad, although she is a handful. Her mother ignored her, gave her everything she wanted just to shut her up, and never set down any rules. Kelly is more than independent, she\u2019s dictatorial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a fun kid. Are you sure the sex is worth it? Didn\u2019t this unexpected arrival mess up your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d Sam had been worried about that, too, Francesca thought. \u201cSometimes I really like her, but she makes everything a challenge. I feel bad for her. She needs to be loved.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI recognize that tone. It\u2019s the same one you used every time you wanted to drag home some stray dog or cat. You\u2019re too soft-hearted for your own good. Do not go falling for this guy and his kid. Do you really want to take on a ready-made family? Now? You\u2019re less than two years from finishing school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I agree. I don\u2019t want to get married. I used to think I\u2019d have children, but lately I\u2019m not sure. If I don\u2019t want a husband, then I\u2019m stuck doing it on my own. I don\u2019t know that I could stand the guilt of getting pregnant without being married. I mean, the whole family is Catholic and the Church really frowns on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d send the Grands into a Hail-Mary frenzy. Grandpa Lorenzo would have your hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d throw me out of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days I don\u2019t think that would be such a great loss.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. I have no plans to get pregnant, and I\u2019m not falling for Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the kid,\u201d Brenna told her sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t you even think about rescuing her. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Brenna refilled both their glasses. \u201cNow I want to hear all the details about the sex. I haven\u2019t even seen a naked man in months, and I\u2019m going to have to live vicariously through you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then make something up. I won\u2019t know the difference.\u201d</p><p>Kelly typed in the Internet address for one of her favorite clothing Web sites. \u201cCool,\u201d she murmured. \u201cFree shipping.\u201d</p><p>After studying several camis and tops, she selected three of each, then moved on to skirts. A mock wrap with a slit caught her attention. Not that she went out all that much, but maybe Sam would take her to dinner or something.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d she told herself. He was turning out to be a real pinhead. Francesca?</p><p>Another no, especially after what had happened that afternoon.</p><p>She guessed she knew that Francesca was only trying to be, like, nice with her offer to go shopping. Kelly had really wanted to say yes. A trip to the mall would have been fun. And a movie. The one on the plane had been totally dumb. But she\u2019d reacted without thinking. Not just saying no, but being mean, too.</p><p>Kelly shook her head. It was all Tanya\u2019s fault. How many times had her mother asked her something like that? \u201cDo you want to go shopping, Kelly?\u201d Or if not shopping, then to the ballet or the theater. And if she said yes or acted interested, Tanya always gave her that smirky smile and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not taking you. Ask Mary.\u201d Or Rosa or Sarah, whoever was currently in charge of taking care of her.</p><p>Kelly had a feeling that Francesca wasn\u2019t like that. That she really would have taken her to the mall. But what if she\u2019d just been playing, too?</p><p>Pushing the question to the back of her mind, Kelly completed her order. She changed the ship-to address on her account, so the clothes would come here instead of to the New York apartment, then clicked on \u201cPlace my order.\u201d</p><p>But instead of the cheerful notice telling her that her order had been placed, there was only a single line explaining that her credit card had been denied.</p><p>Kelly frowned. That didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>She fished the credit card out of her backpack and checked the expiration date. It wasn\u2019t until 2006. So what...?</p><p>Horror filled her. She remembered Sam yelling at her, telling her she wasn\u2019t getting her own DVD player and her claim that she would simply buy it herself. He\u2019d looked mad when she\u2019d said that. He couldn\u2019t have canceled her card, could he?</p><p>Three minutes later she hung up the phone and screamed. She flew out of her room and down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she screeched as she ran into the kitchen.</p><p>Her father stood at the stove, which was weird. Except for a couple of gay chefs her mother knew, she\u2019d never seen a guy cook. Not that she cared right now.</p><p>Sam put down a spatula and faced her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>She curled her hands into fists. \u201cYou canceled my credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou had no right.

Sort of brown, but gold, too. Right now they were dark and cold and he looked mean.</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t scared, she told herself. She was mad. \u201cIt was mine,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHow am I supposed to take care of myself if I can\u2019t buy stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll buy what you want me to have. You won\u2019t care about what I want.\u201d Without her credit card she was stuck.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about the logistics of what and where the purchases will be after dinner. You\u2019re just in time to wash your hands and set the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! We\u2019ll talk about it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you said. I don\u2019t even have any clothes to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you turned down Francesca\u2019s offer to take you shopping. Now you\u2019ll have to wash what you have and wait for the rest of your things to arrive.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes burned. She turned away as betrayal cut through her. She couldn\u2019t believe Francesca had told Sam what had happened about the shopping. It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cKelly, I\u2019m not trying to make your life miserable, although it may seem that way to you. Things are going to be different here. You\u2019re not going to buy whatever you want, whenever it suits you. I will take care of you, but on my terms.\u201d</p><p>So she didn\u2019t matter at all. She squeezed her eyes shut.</p> <p>\u201cYour things will arrive on Friday. That\u2019s only three more days. If you don\u2019t know how to do laundry, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>She spun back to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t do laundry. That\u2019s why you\u2019re supposed to have a maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs is gone right now. Either you do it yourself or you wear dirty clothes. I don\u2019t care which. Now wash your hands and set the table.\u201d</p><p>He turned off the grill set in the center of the stove. Two chicken breasts lay there. They were pale and unappealing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not eating that,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting looking. Did you cook them?\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened. \u201cYes. And I made the salad.\u201d</p> <p>She turned toward the table. There was a bowl of iceberg lettuce in the center. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even count as a vegetable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healthy,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. So you\u2019re not going to get me any clothes to wear, and now you\u2019re trying to starve me. You\u2019re really a lousy father.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s been forty-eight hours since you showed up, and I think I\u2019m doing a hell of a job. If you\u2019ve got a complaint, then put it in writing. Otherwise, wash your hands, set the table, and eat dinner.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d she said, speaking each word slowly, then walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then something slammed into a wall.</p><p>But Kelly didn\u2019t feel victorious. She didn\u2019t feel anything at all except empty, hungry, and very much alone.</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cI \u2019ve decided to run away,\u201d Sam said after dinner. \u201cWant to come?\u201d</p><p>Francesca curled up against him on the family room sofa and closed her eyes. \u201cWhere would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere hot. An uncharted island in the South Pacific. You\u2019d have to spend the day naked.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThere are parts of me I don\u2019t want sunburned.\u201d</p><p>He shifted so his mouth pressed against her ear. \u201cWe\u2019d be making love all the time, so they\u2019d be covered.\u201d</p><p>The low, sexy words made her stomach clench and her thighs relax. \u201cWhat about food and water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be there. We\u2019d do take-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn an uncharted island? How would they find us.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped both arms around her and drew her close. \u201cShh. You\u2019re spoiling the fantasy. There would be plenty of food and water. A big bed, champagne. Ready to sign up?\u201d</p><p>She thought about the feeble start she\u2019d made on her outline and Sam\u2019s child sulking upstairs. They were halfway through the first week, and things weren\u2019t looking any brighter.</p><p>\u201cSure. When do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my kind of woman.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, pressing his mouth against hers as he pulled her close. She felt surrounded by sensual heat. Need sparked to life, making her part her lips.</p><p>As he swept his tongue inside, he groaned low in his throat. The sound of masculine need made her tremble. Wanting grew, as it had the first time they\u2019d been together. It enveloped her until it was all she could think about. Until rational thought wasn\u2019t possible. She ached for him.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she breathed as she rubbed her palm against his chest.</p><p>He swore, then kissed along her jaw and down her neck. Her breasts swelled and her nipples tightened.</p><p>As she arched against him, he slipped a hand under her T-shirt and cupped her left breast. She gasped as his thumb brushed across the sensitized peak, then shuddered as he continued to caress her.</p><p>Despite her need to get lost in the moment, she was aware that they weren\u2019t alone in the house.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, even as she covered his hand with hers, urging him to keep touching her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just playing.\u201d</p><p>If this was play, she thought as he nibbled her neck and made her skin break out in goose bumps, what would it be like if he got serious?</p><p>But she already knew. She\u2019d made love with Sam, experiencing the sureness of his touch, the ease with which he pleasured her. Her insides tightened as she recalled how he\u2019d filled her, thrusting deeply until she\u2019d lost herself. She wanted that now\u2014his body covering hers, touching and teasing.</p><p>Think about something else, she told herself as need turned frantic. Her breathing increased, as did her heart rate, and she couldn\u2019t find the strength to push him away when he slipped his hand from her breast to the waistband of her shorts.</p><p>Any halfhearted protest she might have made died away when he unfastened the waistband and drew down the zipper.</p><p>\u201cJust for a second,\u201d she whispered, even as his fingers slid between curls and settled against swollen flesh.</p><p>He pressed his mouth to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She sagged back against the sofa and closed her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. You\u2019re touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like touching you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed against the one sensitive spot and she gasped. \u201cWhat about Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hear her if she comes downstairs.\u201d He bit her earlobe. \u201cJust a couple of minutes. You don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>He circled around, then slipped a finger inside of her. At the same time he pressed in with his thumb. The unbelievable combination made her gasp. Her hips pulsed slightly as her body surged and tensed.</p><p>She was close in a heartbeat. A few more strokes, a little rubbing, and she would lose herself in the pleasure.</p><p>Awareness of her surroundings made her hesitate. She put her hand on his wrist. \u201cWe have to stop.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at her, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. If things get going too much, we won\u2019t hear Kelly.\u201d He withdrew his hand.</p><p>Half relieved, half disappointed, Francesca fastened her shorts. She felt aroused, edgy, and in serious need of some satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I have an original Picasso?\u201d he said.</p><p>She blinked at the change in topic. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my office. Come have a look.\u201d</p><p>He stood and drew her to her feet, then led the way toward the front of the house. There was a small hallway just past the formal living room. The first door on the right led into a bookcase-lined study, complete with runway-sized desk and heavy drapes.</p><p>She barely had time to notice the small painting on the far wall when the door closed and Sam turned the lock.</p><p>\u201cNo condom,\u201d he said, pulling her close. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be creative.\u201d</p><p>His mouth settled on hers. The relief was nearly as sweet as the need was sharp. Under the circumstances\u2014no birth control, limited time, and strange surroundings\u2014she probably should have told him to forget it. But she couldn\u2019t. Not when his hot, deep kisses made her rub herself against him. Her swollen center came in contact with his hard, thick erection and they both groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said, pushing her back until she settled against the desk. He was already fumbling with her shorts.</p><p>She helped, then pushed them off, along with her bikini briefs. Then his tongue was in her mouth and his fingers were between her legs, and nothing mattered but the way he made her feel.</p><p>It was too good, she thought, barely able to stay standing. She clung to him as she sucked on his tongue and parted her thighs even more. Fingers plunged in and out of her. His thumb rubbed and circled and teased. She was seconds away from losing herself when he broke the kiss and crouched down.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She was hardly going to protest. With one quick push, she sat on the edge of the desk. Sam knelt on the floor and drew her swollen flesh apart. He leaned close, then placed an open-mouthed kiss on the very heart of her.</p><p>The orgasm came from nowhere. One second she\u2019d been anticipating the intimate act and the next she was caught up in a whirlwind of pleasure and release. She bit back a scream as she clutched at his head. He licked and sucked, forcing one orgasm into two, then three. She shuddered and gasped, finally stilling.</p><p>When she was done, he straightened and smiled at her. Francesca felt more than a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI, ah, should have taken longer.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me think I have super powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>She slid off the desk and reached for the front of his jeans. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He covered her hands with his. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to grin. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged places, with him leaning against the desk and her standing in front. She unfastened his belt, then the button. When the zipper was released, she pushed jeans and briefs down his thighs. His erection sprang free.</p><p>He was already hard. She pressed her mouth to his neck as she took him in her hand. He tasted sweet and salty, and he felt like barely controled power encased in baby-soft velvet. The first stroke made her wish they\u2019d brought a condom with them. The second stroke made them both moan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat your record,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d She rubbed her thumb against the tip of his penis.</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she knelt on the thick carpeting and took him in her mouth. He clutched the edge of the desk and muttered something about control. She held in a chuckle and began to move.</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t sure he beat her record, but he certainly matched it. In thirty seconds he was breathing hard, in forty-five he was swearing, and somewhere around a minute, he lost it completely.</p><p>\u201cI like your enthusiasm,\u201d she murmured as they straightened their clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring.\u201d</p><p>He dropped a kiss on her forehead. \u201cSo are you. But now I\u2019m starved. Is there any pasta left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m half Italian. There were three of us for dinner, so I brought enough for, oh, twenty.\u201d</p><p>Sam grinned, then crossed to the door. After unlocking it, he glanced into the hallway, then nodded.</p><p>Francesca could hear Kelly moving around upstairs as they made their way to the kitchen.</p><p>While she reheated ravioli and sauce, Sam poured them each a glass of wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I thank you for bringing dinner?\u201d he asked as he leaned against the counter.</p><p>\u201cAbout four times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was really good.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d already told her about his attempt to provide a \u201chealthy\u201d dinner the previous evening. She\u2019d done her best not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe Grands know how to cook,\u201d she said. \u201cGrandma Tessa does all the traditional Italian dishes, while Grammy M could bake her way into heaven.\u201d</p><p>She pulled steaming bowls out of the microwave and tried not to notice the delightfully squishy sensation that lingered after their quickie. She felt satiated, content, and just a little bit wicked.</p><p>\u201cDo you cook?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Francesca pulled out a chair at the kitchen table and sat. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve taken tons of classes on every kind of cooking. I do fabulous garnishes, but I\u2019m lousy at real food. Honestly, I don\u2019t even like cooking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why do you take the classes?\u201d he asked as he settled next to her and picked up a fork.</p><p>\u201cGuilt,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the traditional marriage role, and in my family that\u2019s about as blasphemous as not acknowledging the Pope. So I study cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can rebel enough not to remarry, but not enough to tell them you don\u2019t like to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but even being aware of what\u2019s happening doesn\u2019t take away the guilt. I\u2019m Irish, Italian, and Catholic. Guilt is my birthright.\u201d</p><p>Sam chewed a mouthful of ravioli. It had been pretty good at dinner, but after what they\u2019d just done in his office, it was delicious. As was Francesca. Her mouth was swollen, her skin flushed. She looked content and satisfied, which pleased him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make trouble here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut shouldn\u2019t your professional training make a difference?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPsychologist, heal thyself?\u201d she asked, then laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d think it would, but then you\u2019d be wrong. Besides, without guilt, I\u2019d have too much mental free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI never did show you my Picasso.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, blushed slightly, then laughed. \u201cOh. Yes, well, we\u2019ll have to do that another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say the word.\u201d</p><p>Not that he wanted to make a habit of five-minute sex. Not with her. Their night together had been too extraordinary. But with Kelly in the house, everything was different.</p><p>\u201cI can tell by your change in facial expression that you\u2019ve shifted to another mental topic,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Francesca leaned toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. We both have to adjust. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201d He pushed the bowl away. \u201cI understand all that, but I\u2019m ready to get on with fixing the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you defined what\u2019s wrong yet?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, some kid he\u2019d never known about had unexpectedly entered his life. Instead of being someone he could relate to\u2014a boy, or quiet, or normal\u2014Kelly was difficult, stubborn, and ill-mannered.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly get along,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>\u201cThat will come. First you have to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot easy when she spends all her time pissed off at me.\u201d He picked up his wine. \u201cWas I wrong to cancel her credit card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m shocked her mother let her have one. The thing is you have one set of expectations and she has another. You\u2019re going to have to find some middle ground. And maybe next time warn her before you cancel her card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Too bad her idea of middle ground is for me to do everything she wants and stay out of her face.\u201d He took a sip of wine, then set the glass on the table. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be annoyed when she finds out I\u2019ve hired a nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found someone?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe service wasn\u2019t thrilled to be providing car service and baby-sitting for a twelve-year-old, but for the right money, they\u2019ll do it. She starts Monday.\u201d He reached across the table and took her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve been great helping me out, but I can\u2019t take up all your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t minded. If nothing else, I\u2019m learning about ballet.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve been debating this for a while and I\u2019d like to take Kelly to my folks\u2019 place after class. My older sister is getting married, and we have a \u2018girls only\u2019 planning meeting scheduled.\u201d</p><p>Sam squeezed her fingers and released them. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be in the way. I\u2019ll take the day off work and cart her around myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she told him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind taking Kelly to meet my family. I think they\u2019ll overwhelm her with attention, and that won\u2019t be such a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you say you\u2019d been debating it for a while?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cMy family. They\u2019re going to read too much into the situation and start planning a double wedding.\u201d</p><p>He could see why that would make her uncomfortable. \u201cSo don\u2019t take her. I can play hooky for the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I understand a lot of what Kelly\u2019s feeling. Or I think I do. When I was growing up, there were a lot of times when I felt like an outsider. But the feeling didn\u2019t last long because I had my family to adore me.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably. No way he adored Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I dislike her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She touched his arm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to make you feel bad. My point is I think my family could be good for her.\u201d</p><p>He understood more than she was saying. Even though it meant setting herself up for unwelcome matchmaking, Francesca was willing to take Kelly home because it was the right thing for the girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a woman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNot really, but I\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. I have no idea what my family might say to Kelly, so I\u2019m warning you in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what Kelly is going to say to them, so we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Kelly is going to be cheek-pinched and hugged and fed until she\u2019s one big ball of good feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be a change.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s smile faded. \u201cSam, have you thought anymore about what I said? About Kelly acting out because she doesn\u2019t feel secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it. You\u2019re probably right, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not very lovable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the need.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was right. Funny, he would have thought loving his own child would be immediate and overwhelming. As it was, he had trouble liking Kelly.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to charge me billable hours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She grinned, leaned forward, and lowered her voice. \u201cI was thinking more of taking it out in trade,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Francesca whispered something Kelly couldn\u2019t hear, but it didn\u2019t matter. She was so mad, she was shaking. She hated her father. Hated him with all her heart.</p><p>The smell of food had lured her from her room a few minutes ago. She\u2019d come downstairs and had heard Francesca and Sam in the kitchen. She\u2019d just decided she would maybe join them when she\u2019d heard Sam say she wasn\u2019t very lovable.</p><p>Spinning on the ball of her foot, she ran to the stairs and raced back to her room.</p><p>He was a horrible man. She should report him to the police or something for child abuse, and then they would lock him up and he\u2019d have to spend the rest of his life in prison. That\u2019s what he deserved.</p><p>Kelly threw herself on her bed and pulled her Pooh bear close.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca\u2019s not so bad,\u201d she whispered into the scuffed fur. \u201cBut he\u2019s the worst.\u201d</p><p>She hated him and she would never, ever forgive him. No matter what.</p><p>Halfway to the hacienda the next day, Francesca still hadn\u2019t come up with an explanation for Kelly\u2019s presence. It was hardly as if the Grands wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>She glanced at Kelly, who had changed into shorts and a shirt after her morning ballet class. The preteen stared out the window without saying much. Francesca tried to figure out the best way to admit she had a problem. A big problem.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDid I mention that my father\u2019s side of the family is Italian?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kelly turned to look at her. Not a flicker of interest showed on her face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. My mother\u2019s family is Irish. Basically we\u2019re talking about grade-A European meddlers.\u201d</p><p>Kelly continued to watch her without speaking.</p><p>\u201cTheir idea of perfection is to see all four of their daughters happily married with five or six kids, which, to date, hasn\u2019t happened. But there is a ton of family pressure.\u201d</p><p>She waited to see if Kelly would say anything. Sam\u2019s daughter simply watched her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that your dad and I are friends,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe thing is, they\u2019re not going to believe me. So brace yourself for a lot of very unsubtle hints about weddings, marriage, engagements, not to mention questions about how many brothers and sisters you want. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Kelly shrugged and turned her attention back to the view out the window. \u201cI understand. Parents can totally overreact.\u201d</p><p>Francesca had a feeling that comment was a slam on Sam, but she ignored it. \u201cThe other thing I need to warn you about is that my grandmothers love everyone. They\u2019re going to make a big fuss over you, which I know you\u2019ll think is totally uncool. So you need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s expression turned wary. \u201cWhat do you mean, a big fuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll hug you and tell you you\u2019re pretty and try to get you to eat a lot of cookies and stuff. They\u2019re grandmothers.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe usual boring stuff.\u201d</p><p>The wariness faded. \u201cI can probably handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. I just wanted to let you know it might be a real drag.\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t want to back Kelly into a corner. If she was enthused about her family, then Kelly would have to take the opposite side and instantly hate them. The girl had a defense ready to go in every situation.</p><p>Instead, she had decided to make it all sound like an imposition. Kelly\u2019s natural reaction to be stubborn meant she might actually want to like the Grands. Francesca had a feeling that an afternoon at the Marcelli hacienda just might shrink the massive chip on Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She saw the arched entrance to the Marcelli property. As she turned under the arch and onto the long paved road, Kelly swung around and gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Marcelli Wines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. My grandfather owns the winery, not me, but this is where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking wine?\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned in her seat, glancing first to the left, then to the right. Grapevines stretched out for acres. It was the first excitement she\u2019d shown since arriving nearly a week before. Francesca was thrilled.</p><p>\u201cSo these will be wine soon?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I think so.\u201d Francesca glanced out her side window. \u201cI\u2019m not the expert. If you have any specific questions, you should talk to my sister Brenna. She\u2019s the one who knows everything.\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked a few more questions, then fell silent when they rounded the corner and she saw the three-story Spanish-style hacienda. The pale yellow structure was topped with a tiled roof. Wrought-iron balconies decorated the front windows, and a porch circled the entire structure. Coordinating outbuildings lay in the distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca pulled to the side by the multicar garage her parents had built when their daughters had started driving their own cars.</p><p>Kelly turned to her. \u201cYour family is rich. Why don\u2019t you have money?\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cMy grandfather is rich. He\u2019s the one who owns the winery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut when he dies, doesn\u2019t this all go to the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a complicated question.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the car and slammed her door shut. Kelly followed suit. As they approached the rear door of the house, Francesca put a hand on Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stalled in mid-step. Francesca saw the hesitation in her eyes, but before she could head back to the relative safety of the truck, the backdoor opened and the Grands appeared.</p> <p>\u201cFrancesca,\u201d Grandma Tessa called. \u201cWe thought maybe you were too busy to come to plan your own sister\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M smiled as she hurried behind her taller in-law. \u201cDon\u2019t be scoldin\u2019 her, Tessa. She\u2019s here. And with a wee one.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wrapped her arm around Sam\u2019s daughter. \u201cThis is Kelly, the daughter of a friend. She\u2019s joining us for the afternoon. Kelly, these are my grandmothers. Grandma Tessa is married to Grandpa Lorenzo.\u201d She leaned close and lowered her voice. \u201cThey\u2019re the Italian side of the family.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Ma\u2019am? Francesca nearly fainted. Was Kelly being polite?</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Grandma Mary-Margaret. When we were little, her name was a mouthful, so we call her Grammy M.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>The Grands exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d Grammy M asked. \u201cWould this friend be a man?\u201d</p><p>Francesca glanced at Kelly. \u201cHere goes.\u201d</p><p>Kelly actually smiled. \u201cFrancesca dates my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Grammy M murmured, her pale eyebrows rising toward her hairline. \u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there, Kelly. Come give us a hug.\u201d</p><p>The Grands descended. Francesca stepped out of the way as Kelly was hugged, kissed, and cheek-pinched. The latter caused her to wince in pain and rub the affected patch of skin. But her look of \u201crescue me\u201d quickly changed to wonder when they were all hustled inside and she caught a glimpse of the food spread set out for the afternoon meeting.</p><p>Francesca was used to the array of cookies, cannolis, scones, cakes, and pastries that were her grandmothers\u2019 hobbies, but she doubted Kelly had seen anything like it outside of a bakery.</p> <p>The girl had just been seated at the table with a plate and two hovering grandmothers when Brenna strolled in. She glanced from Kelly to Francesca.</p><p>\u201cIs this who I think it is?\u201d she asked as she leaned on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Brenna took off her baseball cap and brushed her short hair off her forehead. \u201cSam of the hot, naked sex?\u201d she asked, her voice low enough to keep Kelly and the Grands from hearing.</p><p>Francesca refused to think about what had happened the previous night. Seeing her blush would only encourage Brenna. \u201cI don\u2019t actually know any other men with children.\u201d</p><p>Brenna reached for one of the cookies and took a bite. \u201cHow long are you on baby-sitting detail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust today. He\u2019s hired someone from a service.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at the Grands, then lowered her voice. \u201cAnd the naked part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s still going great.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cGood for you!\u201d</p><p>The backdoor opened and Katie breezed in. There were hugs all around, then Francesca introduced Kelly to Brenna and Katie. More hugging followed.</p><p>Katie gave Francesca a speculative glance as she looked at Kelly. Obviously there were going to be plenty of questions later.</p><p>Francesca watched Kelly closely to see if this was all too much for her, but the preteen seemed to be soaking up the attention.</p><p>\u201cAm I the last one to arrive?\u201d Francesca\u2019s mother asked as she hurried in from the hallway. \u201cYour father and I have that sales trip in two days, and I\u2019m still trying to get ready.\u201d</p><p>She kissed each of her daughters, then smiled at Kelly. \u201cHello. I\u2019m responsible for these girls being here. But please don\u2019t hold it against me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly carefully wiped her hands on a napkin and stood. \u201cNice to meet you, Mrs. Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>Once again, the shock of the girl\u2019s excellent manners nearly made Francesca fall into a coma.</p><p>Francesca\u2019s mother smiled. \u201cCall me Colleen.\u201d She turned back to everyone else. \u201cAre we ready?\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of agreements. The six of them headed for the dining room. Francesca pulled Kelly aside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking about Katie\u2019s wedding. Planning it and discussing the dress she wants. You\u2019re welcome to join us, but if you think you\u2019ll be bored you can watch TV in the family room.\u201d</p><p>Kelly ducked her head. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. But if you change your mind, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and followed her into the dining room.</p><p>In a matter of minutes they were working their way through wedding details like dates and how many for the guest list. Katie sat at one end of the table, with her mother next to her. Francesca sat next to her with Kelly beside her. The Grands and Brenna were across the table. Pads of paper had been distributed along with pens, cups of coffee, milk for Kelly, and plates of the treats from the kitchen.</p><p>Her mother pulled off her glasses. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about early October, we have the rain issue.\u201d</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take my chances. I really want to be married here by the house. We can have tents in reserve. I know a terrific place that rents them. They\u2019ll give me a good deal.\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned toward Kelly. \u201cMy sister runs a company called Organization Central. She plans parties and puts people\u2019s lives in order. Speaking as someone who can barely find matching socks some mornings, I find that very frightening.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned.</p><p>Katie turned to her sister. \u201cAre you complaining already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What if harvest isn\u2019t over? Have you considered that, Oh Sister-bride?\u201d</p><p>Katie bit her lower lip. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. I guess if it isn\u2019t over, you\u2019ll have to shower fast, come to the house for the wedding, then head back out to the fields to be with your precious grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll even stay for the reception before going back to work,\u201d Brenna said with a grin.</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>Katie reached into her briefcase and pulled out a folder neatly labeled with the words wedding gown.</p><p>\u201cAbout the dress,\u201d she said.</p><p>Francesca laid her head on the table and groaned. Her mother patted her arm.</p><p>\u201cI know sewing isn\u2019t really your thing, dear, but it\u2019s a family tradition.\u201d</p><p>Francesca opened one eye and glanced at Kelly. \u201cWe make the wedding dress. No store-bought confections for our family. It\u2019s so much work, and I\u2019m not very good at it. I bleed on the satin. You\u2019d think that would be enough to get me out of helping, but it isn\u2019t. Grammy M and Katie always manage to get the stain out. How sick is that?\u201d</p><p>Kelly giggled.</p><p>\u201cSo here are my choices,\u201d Katie said, passing around several pictures of wedding dresses.</p><p>Francesca straightened and glanced over her mother\u2019s shoulder. Her heart sank. The first dress was a sheath style literally covered with beaded lace. The second dress would be even more work. Beading swirled through the long sleeves and full skirt, then wove an intricate pattern on the train.</p><p>Francesca passed the picture to Brenna, who actually blanched. Even Grammy M looked a little concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 they\u2019re lovely gowns, Katie darlin\u2019, but we\u2019re only givin\u2019 ourselves a few months to get everything ready. Even if we beaded day and night, I\u2019m not sure we could finish this one in time. Will you be wantin\u2019 to change the weddin\u2019 date?\u201d</p><p>Katie gazed at them all with a wide-eyed, innocent expression. Brenna groaned, then tossed a cookie at her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking the B word, Katie, and it\u2019s not bead,\u201d Brenna said as she took back the picture of the heavily beaded dress and ripped it in half.</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cYou should have seen the looks on your faces.\u201d</p><p>Relief tasted sweet. Francesca wrinkled her nose. \u201cAren\u2019t you the humorous one. Where\u2019s the real dress?\u201d</p><p>Katie pulled out a picture of a sleeveless wedding gown with a scooped neck. The dress was fitted to the waist before flaring out into a full skirt. Seed pearls were scattered across the bodice and skirt. There wasn\u2019t a speck of lace in sight.</p><p>\u201cWe could practically do this in a weekend,\u201d Francesca said in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Katie looked pleased. \u201cI love the dress and you guys are going to owe me for picking something simple. A win-win.\u201d</p><p>Kelly took the picture and studied the gown. The Grands got up from their seats and crowded around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Katie asked, coming over and pointing at the picture.</p><p>The twelve-year-old sighed. \u201cThe dress is beautiful.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cDo you think I could help with the beading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. There\u2019s plenty of work for everyone.\u201d Katie lowered her voice. \u201cMaybe you could help Francesca. She\u2019s really awful at sewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Francesca said sternly.</p><p>Kelly giggled.</p><p>Katie touched her chest. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>The Grands disappeared into the kitchen only to reappear with big bowls of salad.</p><p>\u201cBecause all the sweets weren\u2019t enough,\u201d Brenna muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here before I end up looking like a sumo wrestler.\u201d</p><p>Francesca followed her out of the dining room. At the backdoor Brenna pulled on a baseball cap.</p><p>\u201cThe kid seems okay. What happened to Teen-zilla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She was her usual surly self on the drive over. I guess the Grands are working their magic. If this keeps up, Sam is going to be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how exactly will he show his appreciation?\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can imagine, which is really depressing. Just don\u2019t go falling for this guy. Remember\u2014Katie\u2019s relationship with Zach aside\u2014marriage sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not about to go there a second time. I don\u2019t love Sam, I\u2019m just using him for sex.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cYou make me so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir house is huge. It\u2019s really pretty and there are vineyards all around. Brenna is the sister who knows the most about wine. Katie runs some company that organizes parties, and Mia\u2014I didn\u2019t meet her\u2014she\u2019s in Washington, D.C., studying languages and stuff. The Grands were great. There was so much food. It was like a buffet or something, but it was just their house. And then we talked about Katie\u2019s wedding, and the whole family makes the dress. Well, just the women. But Katie said I could help.\u201d</p><p>Kelly paused and sucked in a breath. \u201cWith the sewing and stuff. And I\u2019m going to. Not because it\u2019s like fun or anything, but to be polite.\u201d</p><p>Sam actually rubbed his eyes. He checked the clock over the stove and saw the second hand moving in the normal direction.</p><p>So if he hadn\u2019t fallen into an alternative universe, what the hell was going on?</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize the girl sitting across from him at the dinner table. She looked like his daughter, but she didn\u2019t sound like her. Plus, this kid was smiling. Until this second he hadn\u2019t known Kelly had teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had a good time,\u201d he said cautiously.</p><p>Francesca gave him an \u201cI told you so\u201d smile. \u201cThe Grands loved Kelly. I\u2019m afraid she might have a bruise from all the cheek-pinching, though.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rubbed her cheek. \u201cGrandma Tessa pinches really hard, but she\u2019s still nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Sam said as he cut into the lasagna. \u201cThey provided us with dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have given you enough for a week if I\u2019d let them,\u201d Francesca told him. \u201cWhen I mentioned you didn\u2019t have anyone to do your cooking, I thought maybe Grandma Tessa was going to move in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrammy M made these scones,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey were really good. And there were cookies. We brought a pie back for dessert.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. Francesca could crow all she wanted, and he wouldn\u2019t complain. She\u2019d been a hundred percent right. Kelly had been transformed by grandmotherly affection and a big family.</p><p>He smiled at his daughter. \u201cSeveral boxes were delivered to the office today,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s your things. I already put them in your room.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened. She bounced to her feet, then actually hesitated. \u201cMay I be excused?\u201d</p><p>Sam almost fell out of his chair. \u201cAh, sure,\u201d he said.</p><p>She ran out of the room.</p><p>He turned to Francesca. \u201cWas she just polite?\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. \u201cI know. It\u2019s incredible. As it turns out, she\u2019s been hiding good manners from us. You should have heard her with the Grands. She even said ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stunned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled. I think this is a big breakthrough, Sam. Kelly had a good time, but more important, she relaxed. Once she feels safe and secure, you\u2019re going to see a whole new child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be terrific. So how did it go with your family?\u201d</p><p>She patted her mouth with her napkin. \u201cAs expected. They\u2019ve picked out china for us, but not the flatware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that? You didn\u2019t have to take her. Not that I\u2019m not grateful for the transformation.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI tell myself it\u2019s for a good cause. And it is. But there were lots of questions and speculations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI only have my gene pool to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do owe you. Kelly is a different kid, and I\u2019ll pay a lot to keep her that way.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cName your price.\u201d</p> <p>He expected her to tease him or be suggestive. Instead her expression turned apologetic. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing so simple as money. My family has a big Fourth of July party every summer. My mom invited you and Kelly to attend. Kelly has already accepted on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t mind. \u201cA party sounds fun, as long as I can bring my grandfather along. With Elena out of town, he\u2019d be all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. It\u2019s just two hundred of our closest friends.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThe thing is my family now thinks you and I are more than friends, and there\u2019s going to be fairly serious matchmaking. You need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAre they going to talk about how wonderful you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, more likely they\u2019ll want to see your last two tax returns, check out your teeth, and get you to commit to a wedding date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hard sell, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will redefine the term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou say that now, but you haven\u2019t faced them yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle anything.\u201d</p><p>A sudden explosion of sound made the house shake. Sam winced and glanced up at the ceiling. The steady beat of a drum vibrated through his chest.</p><p>\u201cI guess she has a CD collection,\u201d Francesca said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd a powerful set of speakers.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>B renna sat on the edge of her desk while her grandfather paced the length of her small office.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re high quality grapes,\u201d she said, trying to sound calm when all she wanted to do was scream. \u201cThose four acres have a reputation for producing some of the best Pinot Noir in the state. The buyer called to tell me he\u2019s pulling out of the deal and wanted to let me know so I could buy them. No one knows about this yet. I could make a fabulous wine with those grapes.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo paused in front of a map of the Marcelli property. He traced the line between their land and that of the Giovannis\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Just like that. No.</p><p>Anger burned inside of her. The request wasn\u2019t unreasonable. What she really wanted was to buy the four acres, but she didn\u2019t have the money, and her grandfather wouldn\u2019t be interested. Not when he was talking about selling.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked before she could stop herself. Arguing never changed his mind.</p><p>He stared at her, his dark eyes narrowed. \u201cWe don\u2019t buy grapes from strangers. Marcelli Wines are grown on Marcelli land. Our name means something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to mean shit when you sell it.\u201d</p><p>The words were out before she could stop herself, then she told herself she didn\u2019t care. She was tired of him not listening.</p><p>Her grandfather stiffened, then muttered something in Italian. She didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, which was probably for the best.</p><p>\u201cWe could start a new label,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big companies do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much work. No point.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her with a wave, then walked out of her office. Brenna picked up her Day Runner and threw it across the room. The binder snapped opened and pages went flying everywhere.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair, she thought. Not that fair ever meant anything. She\u2019d sealed her fate the day she\u2019d decided to marry Jeff. Her other option\u2014eloping with the enemy\u2014would have made her entire family go ballistic, but at least then she would have been following her heart instead of her head. As it was, she had only herself to blame. Well, herself and a very stubborn grandfather.</p><p>Her phone rang.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t snap at me,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cWhatever\u2019s going on there isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sagged into her chair. \u201cSorry. I just had a run-in with the old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t victorious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with him.\u201d Her sister sighed. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m calling to invite you to join Katie and me for lunch. As she\u2019s the one with the wildly successful business, she\u2019s buying. Are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I need to get away from this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look mad enough to spit,\u201d Francesca said when she walked into the caf\u00e9 and saw Brenna already sitting at an outdoor table.</p><p>Her twin rose and hugged her, then collapsed back into her chair. \u201cI had another go-round with our esteemed grandfather. He makes me insane.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sat and put her purse on the stone floor. \u201cAbout the Pinot grapes?\u201d</p><p>Brenna sighed. \u201cI know better. I\u2019m not stupid. But I went ahead and asked, and of course he said no. What\u2019s the point, right? I mean if he\u2019s really selling.\u201d</p><p>Francesca touched her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s dark brown eyes clouded with sadness. \u201cI doubt I\u2019m going to like the outcome of any plan he has. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve finally figured out where I belong, only to learn it\u2019s not going to exist anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, who died?\u201d Katie asked as she walked over to the table.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Brenna said as she rose. \u201cJust any chance I had at happiness.\u201d</p><p>Katie hugged her. \u201cOkay, so we\u2019re going to need wine and dessert at this lunch.\u201d</p><p>Francesca smiled as she stood. \u201cI\u2019m thinking real dressing on our salads, too. None of that low-fat stuff.\u201d</p><p>She kissed Katie\u2019s cheek, then held her sister at arm\u2019s length. Katie wore her long reddish-brown hair up. An elegant summer dress with a short-sleeved jacket made her look like the successful businesswoman she was. Katie had always been pretty, but since falling for Zach, she had positively bloomed.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Francesca told her as they sat.</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s the whole \u2018in love\u2019 thing. All that happiness aerates my skin or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sex,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cHot monkey sex on a regular basis is way better than any night cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your professional opinion?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m writing up an article. You\u2019ll be able to read it in the medical journals next month.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be young forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tire Zach out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s man enough to keep up with me.\u201d Katie\u2019s humor faded. \u201cSo what\u2019s the crisis?\u201d</p><p>Francesca and Brenna looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cNo crisis,\u201d Brenna said, then sighed. \u201cNot yet. Grandpa Lorenzo might be selling the winery.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. He\u2019s obsessive about family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any male heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou love the winery. You know more than he does. Whenever he doesn\u2019t listen to you, he\u2019s eventually forced to admit he made a mistake. Brenna, this is crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is our family,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cHe\u2019s accusing me of not being loyal and not sticking around. By marrying Jeff and moving to L.A., I\u2019ve proven I can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cWe should all talk to him or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019d never listen. Instead he\u2019d get mad and throw us out of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething he likes to do on a regular basis,\u201d Katie grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told Brenna.</p><p>The waitress arrived. As this was a favorite place, the sisters all knew what they wanted. They ordered salads, extra bread, and diet soda.</p><p>When she\u2019d left, Katie picked up the conversation. \u201cI wish there was something we could do about this, Brenna. Have you talked to the folks?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it. I know Grandpa makes Dad crazy, too, but the thing is they work together. They live in the same house. I don\u2019t want to make them choose. Plus, going to them would make me feel like I couldn\u2019t handle things on my own.\u201d</p><p>Francesca understood her sister\u2019s reluctance to get her parents in the middle of a big fight. Brenna would consider this a fight she had to manage by herself, much as Francesca insisted on paying her own way through college and grad school.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t buy the Pinot grapes yourself?\u201d Francesca asked. \u201cWith the money you\u2019re going to be getting from the settlement on your divorce, couldn\u2019t you rent equipment?\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with the wine. All three sisters clinked their glasses together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done the math,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have enough. Plus, it would be such a small production. However, it did get me thinking....\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d Katie prompted.</p><p>\u201cStarting my own label.\u201d She held up her hand before either sister could respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in the \u2018maybe\u2019 stage. It\u2019s a little scary to consider.\u201d</p><p>Francesca couldn\u2019t imagine the work involved. Or the money. She sucked in a breath. \u201cDo I want to know what you\u2019re looking at in start-up capital?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna grinned. \u201cSomewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly fell out of her chair. Katie gasped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked,\u201d Brenna told them. \u201cI would have to start big. Wine making is no longer a business for the gentleman farmer. Small wineries are failing left and right, or being bought by larger concerns. I would need to be big enough to survive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA million dollars?\u201d Francesca said, hardly able to comprehend that much money. \u201cWhat would the loan payment be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Brenna took a piece of bread and tore it in half. \u201cActually I don\u2019t want to know, either. Like I said, I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m doing. Right now it\u2019s just a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Katie patted her arm. \u201cIf you decide to go for it, I\u2019m good for a few thousand. Although when compared with a million, that doesn\u2019t seem like much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your money,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need it when you start popping out babies.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re not even married yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard women can get pregnant before marriage these days,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cIsn\u2019t science wonderful?\u201d</p><p>Katie threw a roll at her. \u201cVery funny. Zach and I want to wait about a year before getting started on the whole family thing. We want to enjoy each other.\u201d</p><p>Brenna looked at Francesca. \u201cSex. She\u2019s talking about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Francesca grinned. \u201cWhere are you going on your honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s mentioned Tahiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those all-nude resorts?\u201d Brenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is with you?\u201d Katie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend my honeymoon naked.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWell, that came out wrong. Let me rephrase it. I don\u2019t want to spend my honeymoon naked with anyone other than Zach.\u201d She turned to Francesca. \u201cAnd speaking of naked, what on earth is going on in your life?\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly choked on the bit of bread she\u2019d just swallowed. She had a bad feeling she was blushing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but you brought a twelve-year-old girl to the house. From what the Grands told me, you\u2019re dating the girl\u2019s father. Is this true? Do I have to hear about that kind of gossip from my grandmothers rather than my sister herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Francesca pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been calling me every fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get crabby when I do that,\u201d Katie said. \u201cSo start talking.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with their salads. Fajita chicken for Katie and Francesca, a Cobb for Brenna.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Let me,\u201d Brenna said with a grin. \u201cI want to tell her.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cFeel free.\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned toward Katie and lowered her voice. \u201cRemember a couple of months ago, when we all got drunk and admitted to wanting to sleep with Nic Giovanni?\u201d</p><p>Katie held up a hand. \u201cExcuse me, but we all agreed we wanted to sleep with him back in high school. Not today. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cAnyway, we were both bugging Francesca about finding some guy and getting involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We made her promise to sleep with the next normal, single man that she\u2014\u201d Katie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou didn\u2019t actually do that, did you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca popped a piece of chicken in her mouth and chewed.</p><p>Katie turned to Brenna. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. She met this guy while on one of her experiments.\u201d</p><p>Katie winced. \u201cNot the tattooed biker chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s worse. She was pregnant. They talked, she came clean about her disguise, and then they had sex.\u201d</p><p>Francesca swallowed. \u201cWe went out to dinner, and I did not sleep with him on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Both her sisters looked at her. She sighed. \u201cIt was the second date, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kate and Brenna laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine. The second date.\u201d</p><p>Francesca refused to be embarrassed or apologize. \u201cIt just happened. I didn\u2019t mean it to, but I can\u2019t regret it. Sam is really great.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked surprised. \u201cMiss \u2018I never want to be married again\u2019 isn\u2019t changing her mind, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Sam is in complete agreement with me on that, too. We\u2019re both looking for a monogamous relationship with no risk of too much emotional involvement. He doesn\u2019t want to get married again any more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re basically talking about cheap, easy sex and idle chitchat,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cHonest to God, it sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the romance in that?\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked at her twin. \u201cEver the soft-hearted one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soft-hearted,\u201d Katie protested. \u201cPractical. Do you really think you can have a physically intimate relationship with a man without falling for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cI\u2019ve been married. Todd wasn\u2019t the devil, at least not on purpose, but there was very little I liked about being married. And look what Brenna gave up for Jeff.\u201d She touched Brenna\u2019s arm. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it ever since he walked out on me. Katie, you were the smart one. You waited to get married until you found the right guy. You fell for Zach and I think it\u2019s great. But neither Francesca nor I is interested in a walk down the aisle again.\u201d</p><p>Katie didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to avoid emotional bonding. What happens if you fall for him? It could get complicated. Especially with him having a daughter. You\u2019ve always wanted kids. And you love to rescue people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is not in need of rescuing,\u201d Francesca said firmly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll admit that the kid thing could be a problem, but I will just make sure I don\u2019t bond with either of them. Sam and I want to keep this completely uncomplicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife doesn\u2019t always let you choose,\u201d Katie reminded her. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re using condoms. How much safer could we be?\u201d</p><p>Teen-zilla had returned, Sam thought on Monday morning. There had been nearly ten days during which he\u2019d thought having a kid around wasn\u2019t such a bad thing. But he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe smells,\u201d Kelly hissed. \u201cAnd she\u2019s weird-looking.\u201d</p><p>Sam stood in front of the bathroom mirror and tucked his tie under his shirt collar.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t smell,\u201d he told his daughter, although he\u2019d noticed some sort of decaying plant smell whenever he was around Doreen. As for her not looking normal, Sam thought she was fine. Okay, her glasses were a little thick, and there was something strange about her mouth, but he wasn\u2019t interested in her appearance, just her skills.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been working with children for twenty years,\u201d he told Kelly as he looped around the narrow end of his tie. \u201cShe has a clean driving record, no tickets in three years, she\u2019s bonded and highly recommended. If you want to get to ballet class, she\u2019s your ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put up with her for all of last week. I gave her a chance. She\u2019s horrible. She doesn\u2019t talk at all. She has no sense of humor, and she never takes me anywhere but class and home. I asked about going to the movies or the mall, and she just said no.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to go places after class,\u201d he said. \u201cI never meant to keep you locked up.\u201d Not really. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her when I go downstairs. I\u2019m sure once she understands that it\u2019s all right, you can start doing more fun things in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be alone than with her.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glared at him in the mirror. She was already dressed for her dance class, in a black leotard, tights, and a short skirt. Her feet were turned out in the classic \u201cballerina\u201d position\u2014heels together, toes pointing away from the body. It ma de his back hurt just to look at them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m too old for a baby-sitter,\u201d she said, her voice low but filled with fury. \u201cJust get me a driver and a car and I\u2019ll be fine. Any car. A Town Car, even. I don\u2019t need a limo.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted the tie one last time and reached for his jacket. \u201cGood to know that you\u2019re so flexible, but I\u2019m not getting you a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy it, you could just rent it or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Doreen around here. She\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not going to ballet class, and you\u2019re going to spend the day in my office because I\u2019m not leaving you home by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s green eyes practically spit fire. \u201cI knew you were going to say that,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019re so difficult. You never think about what\u2019s right for me.\u201d</p><p>If only, he thought grimly. \u201cI think about that all the time. Unfortunately our definitions are different. If Doreen is abusive in any way, then I\u2019ll not only fire her butt, I\u2019ll have her arrested. Until then, you\u2019re stuck, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Francesca take care of me? She\u2019s totally cool.\u201d</p><p>He thought so, too. Unfortunately between Kelly, his workload, and Francesca\u2019s need to finish the outline for her dissertation, he\u2019d only been able to see her a couple of times in the past week, and both of those had been at a dinner chaperoned by his daughter. Not exactly the romantic, sexy, sensual relationship he\u2019d envisioned.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca has her own life. She\u2019s given you more than enough of her time. I\u2019m not going to ask her to cart you around.\u201d</p><p>Kelly folded her arms over her chest. \u201cThis isn\u2019t making me like you.\u201d</p><p>He figured the fact that she hadn\u2019t called him a bastard and run out of the room meant they were making progress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to like me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m your parent, not your friend.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading stuff, haven\u2019t you. You didn\u2019t come up with that sentence on your own.\u201d</p><p>He was saved from answering by the sound of the doorbell. Doreen was downstairs and would probably answer it, but even so he walked through his bedroom into the hallway. He didn\u2019t usually have visitors at nine in the morning.</p><p>Kelly pushed past him and raced down the stairs. She ran to the foyer and spoke to Doreen, who retreated to the kitchen. Francesca entered the house.</p><p>Sam\u2019s initial reaction of pleasure turned to curiosity when he saw Kelly hug Francesca.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d his daughter said as he approached. \u201cYou have to save me.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cDoreen is awful!\u201d</p><p>Curiosity turned to annoyance when he figured out his daughter had called in her version of the cavalry.</p><p>Francesca pulled one of Kelly\u2019s red curls. \u201cYou barely know the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe smells funny,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>The corner of Francesca\u2019s mouth twitched. She glanced at Sam. \u201cAh, the executive look. The power suit is very flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t have much power in my own home.\u201d He narrowed his gaze. \u201cKelly, did you call Francesca and ask her to take you to class?\u201d</p><p>Teen-zilla rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, duh. I can\u2019t face a whole summer with her\u2014\u201d She pointed toward the kitchen. \u201cI had to do something. I just knew you weren\u2019t going to get me my own car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca looked surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re giving away cars? Can I put in my order? I\u2019ve always wanted something flashy. In red or silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA convertible?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be nice.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly stamped her foot. \u201cWould you two please pay attention to me. This is important.\u201d</p><p>Sam ignored her and took Francesca\u2019s arm. \u201cHave you had coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I can always use more. I\u2019m not really a morning person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kelly asked in a shriek.</p><p>\u201cIgnoring you until you can act like a civilized person,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m civilized!\u201d Kelly yelled. \u201cI\u2019m polite and well mannered and you\u2019re just a stupid butthead.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned back to Kelly. She stood with her hand over her mouth. At least she looked shocked.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re not going to have class today, huh?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She dropped her hand, opened her mouth, closed it, then burst into tears. Seconds later she was running up the stairs, sobbing as if her heart would break.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cI know you said to be patient, but nothing about this is easy.\u201d</p><p>Francesca squeezed his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Things were going so well last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably because Kelly was getting her way. She\u2019s one determined kid.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the kitchen. Doreen sat at the table, reading the paper. She looked up at them and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Reese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoreen. This is my friend, Francesca.\u201d</p><p>The nanny nodded pleasantly. \u201cIs Kelly about ready to leave? I know she doesn\u2019t like to be late for her class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be going today. She needs to learn to control her temper.\u201d</p><p>Doreen nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age, Mr. Reese. They get human again in a few years.\u201d</p><p>Sam wondered if he would survive. He poured two mugs of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI would like Kelly to stay around the house today so she can think about what went wrong this morning. Tomorrow she\u2019ll be heading back to class. As those are only in the morning, feel free to take her shopping or to the movies in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Doreen nodded. \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>She spoke pleasantly enough, but Sam had the idea that hanging out with a twelve-year-old at the mall wasn\u2019t Doreen\u2019s idea of a good time.</p><p>He and Francesca took their coffee onto the deck. Sam was careful to shut the French doors behind them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Doreen likes children that much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably more into babies,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cPlus, Kelly can be a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe swears she\u2019s being pleasant to Doreen, and when I\u2019ve asked, there haven\u2019t been any complaints. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He sipped his coffee.</p><p>Francesca leaned close. \u201cI know you\u2019re going to hate me for siding with your daughter, but, Sam, the woman smells.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cGreat. So I have to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your call.\u201d She leaned back in the wooden chair. \u201cIt\u2019s just too bad Kelly can\u2019t get into some summer programs and meet kids her own age. Has she made any friends at her dance class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple. She went home with one Friday afternoon. I guess it went well. The mother wasn\u2019t screaming when I picked Kelly up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter can be pleasant when she chooses to be, but the rest of the time, she\u2019s a complete...\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked at him. \u201cAre you editing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019d be shocked if you knew what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. \u201cI doubt that. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re doing a terrific job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It means a lot.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, taking in her long thick hair, and the tank top and shorts. She was sexy, pretty, intelligent, and caring. Talk about a tempting package. He\u2019d met a lot of lying, cheating, using women in his life, and she was nothing like them.</p><p>\u201cI have my grandfather to thank for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those years he pounded good manners into me. They finally paid off.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t stopped to help you that day you were in the building, we never would have met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try telling Kelly that story,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it would convince her manners have merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d He brushed his fingers against her bare arm. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to have a sleepover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you know, but what about Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in sneaking around?\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it before. Is it fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s exciting and erotic.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know this from personal experience, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He pretended shock. \u201cI don\u2019t do that sort of thing. I\u2019m an upfront guy.\u201d He leaned toward her and brushed her mouth with his. \u201cKelly\u2019s usually in bed by ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at your front door at eleven,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>His blood surged at the thought. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Sam said sometime close to two in the morning.</p><p>Francesca stretched out next to him, her bare leg brushing against his. \u201cOf course I can. I want to. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to get anyone new for a couple of weeks. Tell Kelly she only has to deal with Doreen full time this week. The Fourth is Friday and that\u2019s a holiday. Next week I\u2019ll take her Tuesday and Thursday. I\u2019m sure Doreen will appreciate the break, as will your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He rose on one elbow and stared into Francesca\u2019s green eyes. \u201cWhat do you get out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Kelly. She\u2019s fun.\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cWhen she\u2019s not being a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dissertation?\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand along his back. \u201cYou are looking at the author of a completed outline. So there!\u201d</p><p>He was torn between offering her money and telling her she didn\u2019t owe him anything.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust be gracious and say yes. Or better yet, show your gratitude in a more carnal way. Be inventive. Startle me with\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shrieked as he suddenly flipped her onto her stomach. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, her voice muffled by the pillow.</p><p>He nipped at her backside. \u201cBeing inventive.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hummed through her morning. She\u2019d been up most of the night, her insides felt mushy and sore, and she couldn\u2019t be happier. Sam Reese was a man who knew his way around a woman\u2019s body. Contentment didn\u2019t begin to describe the feeling of well-being that swept through her.</p><p>She pulled her date book out of her purse and flipped through the pages. If she was going to take Kelly for a couple of days for the next week or so, she needed to schedule writing time on her dissertation. An outline was one thing, but actually getting all the information together and processing it was something else.</p><p>She penciled in several blocks of time, then flipped back to check the dates of her experiments. The one in Sam\u2019s building had been just over three weeks ago, and the one before had been five weeks ago and\u2014</p><p>Francesca frowned as she stared at the small three-dimensional box she\u2019d drawn by the date two days after the experiment at the old mission. She\u2019d been in a wheelchair that time, tormenting tourists. And two days later she\u2019d gotten her period.</p><p>She flipped back a month. There was the little box indicating her start date, then she flipped forward. No box. Not even the hint of a box. She slammed the date book shut.</p><p>No way, she thought, trying to avoid panic. Not possible. They\u2019d used a condom. Every single time. She knew. She\u2019d been there.</p><p>Three hours later she stared at the plus sign on the slender stick. Her mind was blank. She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t believe.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening, she told herself. It couldn\u2019t be. She absolutely could not be pregnant.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the point,\u201d Gabriel grumbled as he poked his cane into the floor mat of the passenger seat. \u201cNot that anyone asked me. I guess when a man reaches a certain age, his family sees him as little more than a piece of furniture to be moved around and kept out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Sam held in a grin. \u201cYou said you wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather glared at him. \u201cWhen did I say that? I never said that.\u201d</p><p>From the backseat Kelly leaned forward as far as her seat belt would allow. \u201cSure you did. When you came to dinner. I remember. You complain a lot.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grumbled something under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to complain. It\u2019s a privilege of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you get moved around like a piece of furniture because you\u2019re old. So is it good or bad?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned around and eyed his great-granddaughter. \u201cIt beats being dead.\u201d</p><p>Sam quickly glanced in the rearview mirror. Kelly blinked, then grinned.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabriel chuckled and Sam relaxed his grip on the steering wheel.</p><p>After their disastrous first meeting, he\u2019d been hesitant to have Gabriel over to the house for dinner. But he knew Kelly and Gabriel needed to develop a relationship. Also, he didn\u2019t like to leave his grandfather on his own, especially with Elena out of town. Fortunately the meal had occurred right after Sam had agreed to find a replacement for the fragrant Doreen and Kelly had been in a good mood.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa Gabriel, I\u2019ve been to the hacienda before, and it\u2019s this big, beautiful house,\u201d Kelly said cheerfully. \u201cSort of Spanish style with a tile roof and everything. Plus you can see the grapevines. Brenna\u2014that\u2019s Francesca\u2019s sister\u2014said I could come down and watch them bottling. Only not today because it\u2019s a holiday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlackers,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>Sam shot him a warning glance.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca said her whole family would be at the party,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cAlong with a lot of friends. She has three sisters, but only two of them are going to be there. Her youngest sister, Mia, is in Washington, D.C., studying Japanese. She\u2019s supposed to be this really amazing language expert. And Francesca\u2019s older sister, Katie, is getting married. She\u2019s the one I told you about, Sam. I\u2019m going to help with her dress. It\u2019s so beautiful. Isn\u2019t it like totally cool that they all work on it so when she walks down the aisle she can know that all her sisters and her mom and her grandmothers helped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many damn people if you ask me,\u201d Gabriel grumbled.</p><p>Kelly ignored his ill temper. \u201cUp there,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cSee the sign?\u201d</p><p>He did. An arch proclaimed MARCELLI WINES. The turnoff from the highway was a long, narrow road. After about a quarter mile a sign pointed toward the tasting room and public areas of the winery. Sam turned in the opposite direction.</p><p>Kelly continued to bounce. \u201cDo you see the house? Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Then he did. The large structure in the distance surprised him. While he\u2019d known that Francesca was a part of Marcelli Wines, he never actually thought about where she\u2019d grown up.</p><p>The stucco house stood on a slight rise. Several other smaller buildings were clustered all around. But what really caught his attention were the grapevines stretching out in neat rows, for as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Sam enjoyed wine and knew what he liked, but the process of turning grapes on the vine to Cabernet Sauvignon in the bottle was a mystery to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at all the cars,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a great party.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grumbled again. Sam ignored him and parked. The car had barely come to a stop when Kelly flung open her door and stepped out into the warm afternoon.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca! We\u2019re here!\u201d</p> <p>Sam climbed out of the car and saw Francesca coming down the rear steps. He moved around the car to help Gabriel, but the old man waved him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so bent that I can\u2019t stand on my own,\u201d he muttered, leaning heavily on his cane as he straightened.</p><p>Which meant Sam could focus his attention on the woman greeting his daughter. Francesca wore a loose-fitting white dress that shouldn\u2019t have looked the least bit sexy, yet sent his blood pressure rocketing up to the boiling level. She wore her hair back in a braid. Gold hoop earrings glinted at her ears and minimal makeup emphasized her features.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gawking at?\u201d Gabriel asked, then raised his head. One corner of his mouth turned up as his gaze settled on Francesca as she gave Kelly a quick hug, then pointed toward the backdoor.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell. If she\u2019s the woman you\u2019ve been keeping company with, you\u2019re not as half-dead as I\u2019d figured.\u201d</p> <p>Sam glanced at his grandfather, but before he could say anything, Francesca moved close enough to hear.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cYou must be Mr. Reese, Sam\u2019s grandfather. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. He nodded. \u201cIf he told you who I am, he probably told you I was as surly as a bear and as old as the hills.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cActually he said you were tremendously charming and that I was forbidden to run off with you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave a rusty-sounding chuckle. \u201cI like being flattered, young lady. You keep it up. And don\u2019t call me Mr. Reese. That makes me sound like an old man.\u201d He winked. \u201cI\u2019m Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Kelly came tearing out of the house. \u201cLook!\u201d She skittered to a stop in front of them and held out her hand. A flag-shaped cookie rested on her palm. The shaky flag design already told Sam the name of the artist even before she said, \u201cI decorated it myself. Want a taste?\u201d she asked Sam.</p> <p>The question caught him off guard. \u201cOf course. But only half. You need to eat some, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly carefully broke the cookie in two and gave him half.</p><p>He took a bite. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Kelly beamed. \u201cGrandma Tessa said she wants to teach me to cook. That it will make me be a good wife. I told her I didn\u2019t really care about that, but I would like to be able to cook stuff so I could throw parties.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cMaybe when I make friends at school I could have them over and stuff.\u201d</p><p>More twelve-year-old girls filling his house? He swallowed hard. \u201cSure. That would be great.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pointed toward several chairs in the shade. \u201cI\u2019m going to go plant these old bones. Why don\u2019t you help me, Kelly?\u201d</p><p>The girl hesitated for a second, then nodded. \u201cOkay. Want the rest of my cookie?\u201d</p> <p>The old man eyed the half-eaten snack, then shrugged. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>They walked off together. After a couple of steps Gabriel reached for her hand and settled it in the crook of his arm. Kelly didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cI think my grandfather likes her,\u201d Sam said, surprised and pleased in equal measures.</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s not half bad,\u201d Francesca told him.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHeady praise.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him.</p><p>He was about to say something else, when her smile faltered. He looked more closely and saw shadows in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She leaned close. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my dissertation. It\u2019s not easy trying to get all the data into charts and graphs without putting myself to sleep. I would much rather just talk about what I learned. But that\u2019s not how higher education works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart and pretty. Do I have to worry about Gabriel stealing you away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. He\u2019s charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I get it from,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThanks for sharing. I\u2019d wondered.\u201d She glanced at the house, then took his arm and led him toward his car. \u201cYou\u2019re going to meet my family today,\u201d she said and sighed.</p><p>He raised his hand to rub away the frown line between her eyebrows, then lowered his arm to his side.</p><p>\u201cI figured I would,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat with the party being at their house.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGood point. I just want to go over this one more time so we\u2019re all clear. When I brought Kelly over to meet everyone, I tried to tell them we weren\u2019t dating, not really, but no one would listen. For them, it\u2019s a very short journey from an introduction to happily married. Once they see you in the flesh, they\u2019ll start hearing wedding bells. These people are not subtle.\u201d</p><p>She looked worried, which he thought was charming. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that. Your family can\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that because you haven\u2019t met them yet.\u201d She studied him. \u201cI just want you to know I\u2019m not implying anything behind your back.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek. \u201cFrancesca, I trust you. You\u2019re not a deceptive person.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, but before she could speak, the backdoor opened and several people spilled out into the yard. Older, younger, and ages in between. As they approached, he thought he saw some physical resemblances. If he hadn\u2019t been sure, Francesca\u2019s groan would have told him this was her family.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She gave him a pitying look, then turned to face the group. Ten minutes later Sam knew he\u2019d misjudged the situation. Badly.</p><p>Introductions passed in a blur. Even with Kelly having explained who everyone was, he had trouble keeping the names straight. One of the grandmother\u2019s got his cheek in a wrestling lock that nearly brought tears to his eyes and both of Francesca\u2019s sisters eyed him with expressions that warned him there would be questions asked later.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d the cheek pincher said, taking hold of his arm and drawing him toward the house. \u201cYou can help me. While we work, we talk, eh?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Francesca, who shrugged as if to say none of this was her fault. Her mother asked something and she turned away. Sam was on his own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mrs. Marcelli?\u201d he asked as they stepped into the house. The rear utility room gave way to a massive kitchen with a multiburner stove that would cause trouble in his house if Elena ever saw it. She\u2019d been petitioning for a bigger stove since the first day she started work.</p><p>\u201cYou call me Grandma Tessa,\u201d the woman said as she directed him to the sink. \u201cWash. Use soap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He did as she directed, dried his hands, then walked over to the huge center island. Hundreds of flag cookies waited to be frosted.</p><p>She handed him a bag of red frosting, picked up one for herself, then showed him how to squeeze out the right amount of icing.</p><p>\u201cIn rows,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep the lines straight.\u201d</p><p>Six cookies later he got the hang of it and was able to apply fairly straight red stripes on the cookies. Grandma Tessa worked at about five times his speed, applying tiny blue dots to take the place of the stars.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you meet our Francesca?\u201d Grandma Tessa asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was conducting one of her experiments. I offered to help. She was in disguise and I couldn\u2019t tell. That impressed me.\u201d</p><p>The older woman looked at him. \u201cShe\u2019s an impressive girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a daughter. Where\u2019s your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn her way to Europe to marry someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t know anything about the child before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d Sam was surprised to feel a burst of anger. \u201cShe had no right to keep Kelly from me.\u201d For the first time since his daughter had shown up, he realized he\u2019d missed a hell of a lot. Her birth, her first word, her first step. He\u2019d missed things that could never be recovered.</p><p>Grandma Tessa smiled. \u201cYou look fierce. Good. You take care of your own.\u201d</p><p>His own? He supposed that described Kelly. \u201cShe can be a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting independent. They grow up and then they don\u2019t listen. What can we do?\u201d</p><p>He doubted Kelly had ever been much for listening.</p><p>\u201cYou have a good business? You have money?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re not subtle, are you?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m an old woman. I\u2019ve lived long enough to say what I think. Francesca is a lovely girl. Her husband died a long time ago. She has mourned him like a good wife, but time moves on. Things change.\u201d</p><p>Sam made a mental note never to complain about Gabriel\u2019s gruff inquires about his love life. Compared to Francesca\u2019s grandmother, Gabriel was a lightweight.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca needs to be married,\u201d Grandma Tessa said. \u201cShe comes from good stock. Her hips are a little narrow, but we can\u2019t all be built like Brenna. She\u2019s Francesca\u2019s twin.\u201d</p><p>A woman walked into the kitchen. She was about Francesca\u2019s age, but a little shorter, with short dark hair and brown eyes. She winced as she caught her grandmother\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Brenna of the childbearing hips,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. I\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa frowned. \u201cSam doesn\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to ask him?\u201d Brenna took the icing bag from him and set it on the counter. \u201cCome on. I know a secret way out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Sam said as he hurried after Brenna.</p><p>She took him out the front door.</p><p>\u201cI see I didn\u2019t have to ask you twice,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed meeting your grandmother,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And the matchmaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a little intense.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled. \u201cMarcellis tend not to do things by halves. Just remember that you owe me.\u201d</p><p>They circled around the house, coming out in the back, where the tables were set up for the party. Large trees provided shade. To one side young children ran around playing a game. He could smell the charcoal from the barbecues and something fruity he thought might be the grapes.</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Brenna said, pointing.</p><p>He followed the direction and saw Francesca talking with her mother and her other sister. The light breeze played with the hem of her dress and a few loose strands of hair. When she leaned her head back and laughed, something caught in his gut, making him feel as if he\u2019d been kicked.</p><p>Francesca looked up and saw them. She said something to her mother and sister and walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cI rescued him from Grandma Tessa,\u201d Brenna said when she was within earshot. \u201cI don\u2019t know how bad it got, but when I walked in they were talking about your skinny hips, so they\u2019d already moved to childbearing.\u201d</p><p>Francesca stumbled and blushed. \u201cSorry, Sam. I didn\u2019t know it would go that far.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo permanent harm done.\u201d</p><p>Brenna excused herself. He waited until she was gone to continue. \u201cNow I know why you didn\u2019t mention dating to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a place I don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she admitted. \u201cFor a lot of reasons.\u201d She pointed to a path. \u201cThat heads through the gardens. Up for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Your grandmother thinks you\u2019ve been in mourning for your late husband?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I tried to explain that my feelings about marriage have nothing to do with being in mourning, but the Grands didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not the traditional woman they want me to be. I keep my guilt in check with my craft classes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you been involved with anyone since Todd?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter a couple of years I dated some. But I was busy with college, and my heart wasn\u2019t in it. Honestly, it was never worth the trouble before.\u201d</p><p>He paused in front of a low fence surrounding a vegetable garden. \u201cWhy now? Why with me?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re fishing for compliments, and I\u2019m not going to bite.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSure you are. You like to bite.\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and wrapped his arms around her. Just before he kissed her, he thought she stiffened. He straightened.</p><p>\u201cIs this too public?\u201d he asked. While they couldn\u2019t see any of the party-goers, they could hear them.</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just a little on edge.\u201d</p> <p>He brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her fingers. \u201cThen I can control myself until we\u2019re alone. Fair enough?\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded and did her best to smile. After pointing at the neat rows of vegetables in the garden, she started talking about how Grandma Tessa and Grammy M went on a planting frenzy every spring because the mundane topic kept her from blurting out what was really on her mind.</p><p>She was pregnant with Sam\u2019s baby. In the past two days she\u2019d probably reminded herself of that truth a thousand times, but she still couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>Life was nothing if not unfair, she thought as they headed back for the house. Condoms were supposed to be effective ninety-six percent of the time. She and Sam had made love four times that first night. What were the odds of her getting pregnant in just four times?</p><p>Sam took her hand in his and squeezed her fingers. The gentleness in his expression made her want to cry. Or throw herself on the ground and confess all.</p><p>She was going to tell him. She had to\u2014it was the right thing to do. But not today. Not with her family around. And probably not tomorrow, because he still hadn\u2019t adjusted to having a daughter who was twelve. What would he say about a newborn?</p> <p>A baby. She sucked in a breath. This was going to change everything in her life and his. What about her studies, her goals? Could she do all that and be a single mother? There were months she had trouble balancing her checkbook.</p><p>As for Sam\u2014she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. He wasn\u2019t going to be happy. She mentally cringed as she remembered his shock at Kelly\u2019s arrival. At least his daughter was able to dress and feed herself. She was only six years from being an adult.</p><p>Sam was like her\u2014he\u2019d made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested in long-term commitments or happily ever after. He\u2019d already had to adjust his thinking to accommodate Kelly. What would happen when he found out there was about to be another child in his life?</p><p>Brenna drove one of the small trucks to the north end of the property and stopped by the fence line. Once she\u2019d stilled the engine, she climbed out and checked on the Chardonnay grapes.</p><p>She glanced from the tight clusters to the sky. This was the part of the season her grandfather claimed made believers of them all. They prayed for the right temperatures, for the right balance of sun, cloud, and fog. For rain to fall on certain weeks, but not on others.</p><p>Brenna straightened and brushed off the skirt of her dress. She shouldn\u2019t have left the party, but for reasons she didn\u2019t understand, the crowd had started to get to her. She\u2019d felt out of place and awkward.</p><p>She started walking the fence line. Dammit, she thought. She refused to be missing Jeff. The ass had dumped her for a younger woman, leaving her lost, confused, and a twenty-seven year-old clich\u00e9. She didn\u2019t want him back. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. But this was the first time she\u2019d had to go out in a large gathering and be a single woman again. She\u2019d been married in a double ceremony with Francesca when they\u2019d both been eighteen. In the past nine years she\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to be alone.</p><p>A flash of movement caught her attention. Brenna froze in place, knowing what she would see before she turned. She only had a heartbeat to be grateful she looked better than the last time she\u2019d seen him a couple of months ago.</p> <p>She remembered everything about their encounter, from how she\u2019d found him too sexy for words and how they\u2019d instantly jumped from social niceties to sniping at each other. This afternoon she was determined to take the moral high ground and be only pleasant.</p><p>\u201cHello, Nic,\u201d she said as she turned toward the fence.</p><p>Nicholas Giovanni, sole heir to the Giovanni lands and Wild Sea Vineyards, strolled toward her. He moved with a laconic grace that made her remember being sixteen and wildly in love with the neighborhood bad boy.</p><p>Time must be a woman, because it had graced him with a few wrinkles by his eyes that only added to his dark good looks and sexual appeal.</p><p>\u201cBrenna.\u201d He paused by the fence. \u201cI can hear the party from here.\u201d</p><p>She turned in the direction of the Marcelli hacienda, but she couldn\u2019t see anything but grapevines. The faint sound of music and laughter did indeed carry on the light breeze.</p><p>\u201cMy invitation must have gotten lost in the mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather\u2019s too old to change his ways,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll never forgive you for being a Giovanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need forgiving.\u201d</p><p>Men like him never did, she thought. They sinned with impunity.</p><p>She looked at his jeans and T-shirt, the latter with cutoff sleeves. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not celebrating at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be heading out later.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. His dark eyes seemed to see past her fragile defenses to the insecurity beneath. Self-consciously she put her hand up to her short hair.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he said, his gaze following her actions. \u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>Simple words. Meaningless words. She swore silently as pleasure blossomed inside of her and heat flared, as it always had when Nic was around.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. Mortification followed instantly. She cleared her throat and changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cLooks to be a good harvest.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou heard about the Schulers going out of business? I\u2019ve put in an offer.\u201d</p><p>Which was just like him. \u201cDammit, Nic, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re buying them, too. Do you have to own every damn acre in the valley?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s the Brenna I know. I got worried when you were so polite. I thought maybe the family had put you on medication.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cVery funny. You\u2019re on the verge of overproducing.\u201d</p><p>She thought of the map in her grandfather\u2019s office, the one that showed the Marcelli\u2019s lands, along with those belonging to Wild Sea Vineyards. Over the past twenty years their rivals to the north had nearly doubled in size. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can keep control of that much acreage. Or is that the point? Will you be hiring people to manage it for you so you don\u2019t have to get your hands dirty anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be the biggest, and the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible. Besides, you\u2019ve already decided volume is more important than quality. I\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against a fence post. \u201cI heard Lorenzo has put you back in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d she told him, thinking of her grandfather\u2019s threat to sell. \u201cI\u2019m going to try a new Cuv\u00e9e with the whites. It\u2019s going to be a winner. You won\u2019t want to go up against me in competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t make a Cuv\u00e9e. But it\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you can\u2019t be original, then copy.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll make it cheaper and sell about ten times as much.\u201d</p><p>He would, too, damn him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be the best,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be broke.\u201d</p><p>Or out on the streets if her grandfather sold. But she didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>A loud burst of music made her turn toward the direction of the hacienda. \u201cI\u2019d better head back,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because you really enjoy arguing with me.\u201d</p><p>He surprised her by grinning. \u201cActually, I do. See you, Brenna.\u201d</p><p>His statement stunned her into silence.</p><p>When he\u2019d disappeared into the vineyard, she headed back to her truck. As she slid onto the worn seat, she remembered when it had all been different. Years ago Nic had been her universe. She had thought she couldn\u2019t possibly live without him, but she\u2019d been wrong. In a world where Marcellis and Giovannis were sworn enemies, Nic had asked her to chose. She had... but she hadn\u2019t chosen him.</p><p>Francesca set a pile of flatware on the table and began to sort through the pieces. The afternoon had warmed up enough to make her grateful for the shade of the nearby trees. The party-goers clustered in large groups all around the property, while music from the band her parents had hired added to the festive mood.</p><p>Every few minutes she found herself glancing around and trying to find Sam. When she caught a glimpse of him, guilt, fear, and terror made her stomach clench and her throat close up. Neither were pleasant.</p><p>\u201cDid you see?\u201d Kelly asked as she raced up to the table. The preteen practically vibrated with excitement. Her face was flushed and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>Kelly pointed and Francesca turned in that direction. She frowned, unable to see what was so interesting. Two people sat together in shade. They were talking, their heads bent close together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my great-grandpa and your Grammy M,\u201d Kelly breathed. \u201cI saw them laughing a little bit ago. I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s really great or totally gross.\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. She knew what her vote would be. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d she said.</p><p>Kelly wrinkled her nose. \u201cThey\u2019re so old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fact should give you hope for the future. With a little luck you\u2019ll still have a love life at that age.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned. \u201cThat is totally gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t think so then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d</p><p>Francesca turned and saw Sam walking up.</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cGabriel has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Sam saw what was going on with Gabriel and Grammy M.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca thinks it\u2019s cute,\u201d Kelly told him. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove happens at every age,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI hate it when people fall in love. They act stupid and forget what\u2019s important. They forget about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>She turned and ran toward the house. Sam stared after her.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-wife has a lot to answer for,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cFor what she did to both of us. She put Kelly through hell and kept me from being there to make my daughter\u2019s life bearable. I can forgive her for a lot of things, but I\u2019ll never forgive her for the lies.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>T he last of the plates were cleared away just as the sun slipped below the horizon. In the distance the fireworks were set up on a patch of graded land that had yet to be cultivated.</p><p>Francesca and Brenna strolled in the twilight, heading away from the tables and toward the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to explode,\u201d Francesca said, touching her stomach. The troubles in her life had done nothing to reduce her appetite. \u201cWhy do I always eat too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Grands are the best cooks in the world,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here and get my own place. If I stay much longer, I\u2019ll weigh four hundred pounds by the end of summer.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cYou look great. Quit complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look okay,\u201d her sister said. \u201cYou look amazing. There\u2019s this strange glow about you.\u201d Brenna\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s Sam, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca swore silently. Glowing? She couldn\u2019t be glowing. She was maybe three weeks pregnant. The baby wasn\u2019t even a rice grain yet. \u201cIt\u2019s this new moisturizer I\u2019ve been using. Really. It\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cYou are such a liar.\u201d</p><p>Francesca knew she was teasing, but the \u2018L\u2019 word made her wince.</p> <p>\u201cAdmit you like him,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cCommitment or no commitment, you think he\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>At least this was something she could talk about. \u201cOkay, yes. He\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you like the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly is a good kid.\u201d</p><p>They circled around to the rear of the house. Brenna came to a stop. \u201cThen watch yourself, Sis, because I\u2019m seeing sparks between you two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. There\u2019s nothing...\u201d She hesitated. Nothing serious between them? Didn\u2019t a baby count as that? \u201cWe\u2019re still not picking out rings. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watch yourself. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that, either. Sam and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of harsh, angry voices caught her attention. Francesca looked toward the house and saw her father arguing with her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is that about?\u201d she asked, heading toward them.</p><p>\u201cDad looks mad,\u201d Brenna said as she hurried after her.</p> <p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d her father was saying as the two of them hurried up. \u201cBrenna has always known about the grapes. What would it hurt you to listen?\u201d</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo waved a hand in dismissal. \u201cThis is not the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Buying the Pinot Noir grapes was a good idea. We need to expand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not for you to say!\u201d the old man roared. \u201cThis land is mine to do with as I will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they drunk?\u201d Francesca asked quietly as she and Brenna hovered a few feet from the two men.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa hurried up, as did Grammy M, who was with Gabriel. Francesca\u2019s mother appeared from around the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cMarco?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father,\u201d he said, obviously furious. \u201cHe\u2019s being as stubborn as ever. I just found out Brenna tried to buy some grapes, but the great family patriarch wouldn\u2019t let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in charge,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo declared. \u201cMy name is on the label of these wines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have the same name,\u201d his son blasted back. \u201cWe all care about the winery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care more. I wait and wait, but there is no heir. Now what? Everything is to be lost.\u201d</p><p>His son rounded on him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw that up in my face again, old man. If anyone is to blame, it\u2019s you. Not me, not Colleen. You and Mama decided. You chose this path.\u201d</p><p>Francesca had no idea what they were talking about, but she was stunned by the guilty expression on Grandpa Lorenzo\u2019s face. She turned to Grandma Tessa and saw tears in her eyes. Even Grammy M look worried.</p><p>Francesca glanced at Brenna, who looked as confused as she felt. Their mother began to cry.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Marco,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her husband put his arm around her. \u201cIt\u2019s been thirty years and it still hurts every day.\u201d He glared at his father. \u201cDamn you for your arrogance and your pride. Damn you for making us give up our son.\u201d</p><p>Like many other party-goers, Sam had been drawn by the sound of loud voices. Now there was only silence as Marco Marcelli\u2019s words echoed in the twilight.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Kelly asked quietly as she hovered by his side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, the family didn\u2019t need an audience.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen the fireworks.\u201d</p><p>Sam figured they had, only not the kind she meant. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch the ones over the pier back home,\u201d he said and headed over to where Gabriel stood with Grammy M.</p><p>His grandfather looked up as he approached, said something to Grammy M, then began his slow walk toward Sam.</p><p>\u201cThis is family business,\u201d Gabriel said unnecessarily. \u201cThey don\u2019t need us around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Let me tell Francesca we\u2019re leaving. I\u2019ll meet you by the car.\u201d</p><p>The Marcelli family clustered together. Francesca was next to Colleen, her arm around her mother. They both looked shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to head out,\u201d he told Francesca.</p><p>She glanced at him and nodded, but he wasn\u2019t sure she saw him. He wanted to offer the same kind of comfort to her that she offered to her mother. Right now Francesca seemed to need a shoulder to lean on.</p><p>She managed a shaky smile. \u201cWe usually do a better job at our parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a great time. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Light from the house spilled out and illuminated the side of her face. He visually outlined the curve of her jaw and the strand of dark hair curving against her neck.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything,\u201d he said. \u201cKelly and I will be around all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He waved and turned toward the car.</p><p>Ten minutes later they\u2019d left the Marcelli house behind and were approaching the highway.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened back there?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Sam figured Francesca would explain things when he finally saw her. Until then there was no point in speculating.</p><p>\u201cMary-Margaret was damned upset,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>Sam glanced at his grandfather. \u201cI noticed you spent a lot of time with her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave a wolfish grin. \u201cShe\u2019s a fine woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is totally gross,\u201d Kelly complained.</p><p>Gabriel chuckled, then winked at Sam. \u201cI told you I still had some life left in me, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you did.\u201d</p><p>Francesca and Brenna stood across from Katie. All three of them were in the kitchen, while their parents and grandparents talked in low voices in the living room.</p><p>\u201cThis is completely crazy,\u201d Brenna said, her voice harsh, her eyes glazed with shock and disbelief.</p><p>Francesca knew she probably looked just as stunned, but unlike Brenna, she didn\u2019t have as much to lose if the bombshell was true. Sure, their grandfather had hinted about selling the winery, but Francesca hadn\u2019t believed that was likely. Eventually Grandpa Lorenzo would relent and Brenna would inherit. Unless there was a male heir.</p><p>\u201cA brother,\u201d Katie repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than possible,\u201d Brenna said bitterly.</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they have said something? This is a thirty-year-old secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Dad isn\u2019t the father,\u201d Katie said, sounding as stunned as Francesca felt.</p><p>\u201cHe said our son,\u201d Brenna reminded her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about all the times Grammy M said the family was being punished by God?\u201d Francesca asked. \u201cWe never figured out what that meant. What if it was about this?\u201d</p><p>Zach, Katie\u2019s fianc\u00e9, walked into the kitchen, then paused. \u201cYou want me to go wait somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Katie glanced at Francesca, who shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a little too late for secrets,\u201d Francesca said, trying to lighten the tone.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Brenna demanded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This is complete bull.\u201d</p><p>Francesca touched her twin\u2019s arm. Brenna\u2019s pain was as real to her as the ache in her own heart.</p><p>\u201cNow we go find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cGrandpa Lorenzo already sent us away. You know if we go in there, he\u2019s going to threaten to throw us out of the family. Speaking as the last person that happened to, it\u2019s not fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened before. We should have stood together. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he bothers you,\u201d Brenna said bitterly. \u201cTry working for him.\u201d She took her sisters\u2019 hands. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re joining them.\u201d Zach put his arm around Katie.</p><p>The four of them walked into the living room. Her parents sat together on the sofa. Her mother was in tears. She pressed a tissue to her face with one hand and held on to her husband with the other. Grammy M huddled next to her daughter. For the first time Francesca realized her grandmother was an old woman. Pain emphasized the lines in her face and pulled at her mouth.</p><p>Grandma Tessa sat alone on a chair by the fireplace and Grandpa Lorenzo stood next to her.</p><p>They all looked up when Francesca, her sisters, and Zach entered. Grandpa Lorenzo frowned.</p><p>\u201cThis is not your business.\u201d</p><p>Francesca ignored him and crossed to the sofa. She squeezed in next to Grammy M and took her frail hand in hers. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother offered a trembling smile. \u201c \u2019Tis something I knew would have to come out one day. None of us meant to hurt you girls. You have to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary-Margaret!\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo roared. \u201cYou will be silent!\u201d</p><p>Grammy M flinched.</p><p>Francesca rose and faced her grandfather. \u201cThere has been too much silence for too many years. We are all a part of this family. You can threaten us, Grandpa, but you can\u2019t scare us away. We want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Her parents exchanged a look of silent communication. Grandma Tessa looked at her husband. Grammy M nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis time,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Her father stood. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>I t took a few minutes for everyone to get settled. Francesca found herself on the sofa between Brenna and Grandma Tessa. Her mother sat next to Grammy M on one loveseat, while Katie and Zach shared another. Only Lorenzo and his son stood alone.</p><p>They glared at each other from across the living room. Tension filled the air, nearly crackling with intensity. Francesca wondered how long they had been avoiding this particular topic\u2014how many years had they needed to clear the air. She and her sisters had always known there were secrets, but they had assumed they were silly, inconsequential bits of information that might be interesting, but would never impact their lives. They\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Still glaring at his father, Marco spoke first. \u201cYou girls know that your mother and I dated in high school.\u201d</p><p>All three of them nodded. Francesca watched her father turn his gaze from Grandpa Lorenzo to his daughters. He smiled at each of them. She saw the love in his eyes, and the unspoken promise that they would survive whatever he had to say. Some of her tension eased slightly.</p><p>\u201cWe were young and very much in love.\u201d He shifted his attention to his wife, who gave him a warm and tender smile, despite the tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know is that our families were opposed to our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Francesca straightened. She glanced at Brenna, then at Katie. Her sisters seemed as shocked as she felt. She turned to Grammy M for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t approve of Dad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Grammy M twisted her hands together. \u201cIt was a long time ago, darlin\u2019. Things were different.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa shrugged. \u201cWe wanted a good Italian girl for our Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was in the 1970s. Did people really care about those things back then?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Her mother gave her a sad smile. \u201cMore than you can believe. Your father and I had a lot of family pressure to stop seeing each other. We were both fighting with our parents. In the end, we agreed to keep the peace, but continued to see each other in secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grandpa Lorenzo opened his mouth to say something, but his son cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling this story,\u201d Marco said curtly.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo hesitated, then nodded.</p> <p>Brenna shifted closer and took Francesca\u2019s hand in her own. Francesca tried to give her sister a reassuring smile, but had a feeling it didn\u2019t come out very well.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was only sixteen when we found out she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe proposed right away,\u201d her mother said, picking up the story. \u201cWe\u2019d planned to get married anyway, but this moved up our timetable. Unfortunately the news didn\u2019t please either of our parents.\u201d</p><p>Francesca couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what that must have been like. Two teenagers surrounded by disapproval. They must have been terrified.</p><p>\u201cWe sent her away,\u201d Grammy M said softly, tears filling her blue eyes. \u201cLord forgive us.\u201d</p> <p>Grandma Tessa nodded, withdrew her ever-present rosary from her pocket, and kissed it lightly.</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cI was sent to a school for unwed mothers before I could run away with your father. No one knew where I was. They thought\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWe all thought...\u201d</p><p>Grammy M stared at her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019ll not be takin\u2019 the blame for what others made you do.\u201d She turned to her granddaughters. \u201cMy Connor, God rest his soul, Tessa, Lorenzo, and myself decided it would be best if they were givin\u2019 up the wee one for adoption. Colleen and Marco were just babies themselves. But they were stubborn and they fought us. In the end we won, though.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound especially happy about that.</p><p>Francesca looked at her mother. \u201cYou had a boy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I never saw him. They said it would be easier if I didn\u2019t.\u201d Her mother swallowed as tears returned to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anything could have been harder. They took him away and I came home.\u201d She turned her attention to her husband. \u201cMarco was waiting for me. Our parents insisted we stop seeing each other, but we didn\u2019t listen. When I turned eighteen, we married.\u201d</p> <p>Marco crossed to his wife and took her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNow you girls know what happened.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wondered who was going to tell Mia, but decided that could be determined later. Next to her, Brenna caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s out there somewhere, with no idea who is he or what\u2019s waiting for him here?\u201d</p><p>Francesca swung to face her sister. Brenna\u2019s expression was stark and empty. Her twin\u2019s pain slammed into her as if it were her own. Francesca wanted to point out that a male heir couldn\u2019t possibly matter at this late date, that Grandpa Lorenzo would never give the winery to a virtual stranger, regardless of his connection by blood, but she knew she was wrong. It was more than possible.</p><p>\u201cGod punished us,\u201d Grandma Tessa said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have insisted she give up the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re not being punished.\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound as sure as he could be.</p><p>Francesca couldn\u2019t absorb all she\u2019d been told. How could events from thirty years before have such an impact on their lives? And yet in a matter of minutes\u2014with only a few words of information\u2014everything was different.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone contacted him?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe never thought there was a need,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said.</p><p>Francesca stared at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about need, it\u2019s about family. You have a grandson out there. We have a brother. My parents have a son. Does that matter to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure,\u201d Colleen said quietly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to interfere with his life. We didn\u2019t know if he would be interested in hearing from us.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t know if he would forgive us.</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t speak the words, but then she didn\u2019t have to. Everyone heard them.</p><p>Katie clutched Zach\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Their father shrugged. \u201cThere was never a good time.\u201d</p><p>Katie started to protest, then stopped. Francesca wondered if she was thinking about the secrets each of them kept from the family. Katie had had secrets about her broken engagement all those years ago. Francesca had never confessed the truth about the state of her marriage to Todd, and Brenna... Francesca studied her twin. What secrets did Brenna keep?</p><p>\u201cWe need some time to absorb all this,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cI think we should let the subject drop for a couple of days and talk about it again at Sunday brunch.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded. \u201cI agree. This is no longer just your issue. We all have a stake in what happens now.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo glared at her. \u201cBe quiet,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou are not the head of this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Grandpa,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou\u2019re the head of the family, and in this matter you\u2019ve done a real lousy job.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo sputtered, but before he could say anything, Brenna stood. Francesca rose as well, followed by Katie. The three sisters moved to stand next to each other.</p><p>\u201cWe decide together,\u201d Francesca said, facing her parents. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d her father said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk on Sunday. We\u2019ll decide as a family.\u201d</p><p>Katie led them out of the living room. By silent agreement they didn\u2019t talk until they were upstairs in the old bedroom Francesca and Brenna had shared. The room Brenna had returned to when her marriage had ended. They sat on the two beds and stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cHappy Fourth of July,\u201d Brenna said grimly.</p><p>Francesca touched her arm. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Katie said. She flopped back on the bed. \u201cWhy on earth didn\u2019t they say something ages ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset,\u201d Francesca said, eyeing her twin.</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cWhat I am is screwed. It was bad enough to find out that Grandpa Lorenzo was thinking of selling the winery. I figured I might still have a shot because he wouldn\u2019t want strangers on the land. But if there\u2019s an heir floating around out there somewhere, I don\u2019t have a prayer.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wanted to offer some words of comfort, but she didn\u2019t know what to say. Everything had changed, and she had a bad feeling their lives would never return to normal again.</p><p>It was a perfect summer\u2019s day, but Francesca couldn\u2019t summon the enthusiasm even to open the drapes. Instead she curled up on the sofa, her legs pulled to her chest, her forehead resting on her knees.</p><p>How had everything changed so completely in such a short period of time? One minute she\u2019d been well on her way to achieving her goals while dating a terrific guy who not only made her see stars in bed, but who wasn\u2019t interested in marriage or forever. The next she was pregnant, unsure how to tell Sam, and suddenly had a long-lost brother who could inherit the winery and break her sister\u2019s heart.</p><p>There were also all the subtleties that went along with the new circumstances. Things like the logistics of being pregnant and having a child, how to tell her family, how to tell Sam. What to tell Sam. That her parents had lied to her and her sisters for years, that Mia had to be told, and that while she didn\u2019t want anything like a commitment or a permanent relationship with Sam, she couldn\u2019t help wishing he were with her right now. She could use a good hug.</p><p>She sighed softly and shook her head. No point in wishing for the moon, she told herself. It was a perfectly good Saturday afternoon. He was probably taking Kelly sailing or to the beach or for a drive along the coast. Or pulling his hair out because Kelly was driving him crazy. Whatever the circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t be thinking about his sometime bed partner, except in the context of being grateful that he hadn\u2019t committed to her or her insane family.</p><p>This line of thought wasn\u2019t making her feel any better. \u201cSo think about something else,\u201d she told herself.</p><p>Like what? That she hadn\u2019t had any symptoms of her pregnancy, but that didn\u2019t make it any less real? That she had to get to a doctor and start taking vitamins or something? And didn\u2019t she need to be drinking lots of milk to get her calcium?</p><p>A knock on the door interrupted her musings. She straightened and rose. It was Brenna, she told herself as she walked to the door. No doubt her sister wanted to talk about what had happened with\u2014</p><p>It was Sam.</p><p>Francesca stared at him. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might need a friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>He looked good. Too good. Shorts, a T-shirt, and slightly mussed hair. Staring at him made her throat get all sore and her eyes burn. She had a bad feeling she was thirty seconds from bursting into tears.</p><p>She stepped back to let him in.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded and swallowed. \u201cThanks for coming by. That was really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what happened last night at the party. I wanted to make sure you\u2019d survived the bombshell.\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the sofa, then crossed to the window, where she opened the blinds and let the morning sun spill into the small room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still processing information,\u201d she admitted as she sat next to Sam and angled toward him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have a brother, that he\u2019s been alive for all these years and my parents never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cI know all about parental secrets,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She wanted to protest that her parents hadn\u2019t acted at all like his mother, but she supposed there were some similarities.</p><p>She told him what her parents had shared with her. \u201cI guess that once they gave him up for adoption, they tried to move on.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut honestly, I can\u2019t decide if not telling us about him was for our good or theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the lies,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Francesca shivered. She was currently sitting on a really big secret of her own. She would tell Sam\u2014she not only had to, she wanted to. It was a matter of timing. She wanted things to be more stable with Kelly, and honestly, she wanted a little more time with Sam. She knew that as soon as she came clean, nothing was ever going to be the same.</p><p>Was it so wrong to want a few more days of him liking her?</p><p>Before she could answer, he slid toward her and pulled her close. She snuggled against his warm body and let herself relax.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to run out on you last night,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured you needed family time, not guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine. We sort of all abandoned the party to have it out with our parents. Thank goodness my mom always has a staff in charge of events like that. We know our guests got fed and that someone started the fireworks.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cThe ones in the sky, not the verbal ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly and I went down to the pier to watch the fireworks,\u201d he said. \u201cShe stayed pretty normal the whole time, which was nice. I think hearing your family argue shocked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she brings it up, you might want to tell her that we\u2019re just like everyone else. We get mad and we get over it. My grandfather likes to throw people out of the family for weeks at a time. Eventually all is forgiven and life returns to normal. At least as normal as we get.\u201d</p><p>Sam kissed the top of her head. \u201cI wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. But to quote someone we both know, you didn\u2019t sign up for this kind of trouble.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cFrancesca, you\u2019ve been the only life raft I\u2019ve had to cling to these days. If you hadn\u2019t been around when Kelly showed up, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d</p><p>His words made her smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my point. So now it\u2019s my turn. I want to help. I might not know much about raising kids or extended families, but I\u2019m in security. I have access to some interesting databases. I\u2019m sure I could find your brother.\u201d</p><p>She drew back so she could stare at him. \u201cYou know how to do that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd modest.\u201d She considered the offer. \u201cLet me check with my parents, before I tell you for sure, but I can\u2019t imagine they wouldn\u2019t want to get in touch with him. Now that he\u2019s not a secret, he should be a part of the family.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d His tawny gaze locked with hers. \u201cYou know what? I think we\u2019ve changed the rules.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. He couldn\u2019t have guessed about her pregnancy, could he? \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur uncomplicated, monogamous, sex-only relationship has evolved into a friendship.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Right up until he went ballistic when he found out about the baby.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He leaned forward and brushed his mouth against hers. \u201cMore than okay.\u201d</p><p>She felt the exact moment the tender kiss became passionate. Heat flared and his hug tightened slightly. Low in her belly, muscles tensed.</p><p>Despite the trauma, the questions, the knowledge that she was going to have to come clean, she couldn\u2019t help responding to Sam\u2019s closeness, his touch. There was a whisper of guilt, but she pushed it away with the promise that she would tell the truth in a few days. Just a few days of him still liking her, wanting her, and everything being the same between them.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca,\u201d he breathed as he slid his hand down her back to her hip, then up to her breast. \u201cAm I pushing you with this?\u201d</p> <p>His question filled her with warmth. Not the heat of passion but the comforting protection of tender concern.</p><p>Instead of answering directly, she covered his hand with hers and squeezed. His fingers closed around her breast.</p><p>\u201cMy bed is smaller than yours,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat means we\u2019re going to have to be a lot closer. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, then pressed his mouth to her neck. \u201cThe sacrifices I make to satisfy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery one of them is appreciated.\u201d</p><p>He licked and kissed his way down to her collarbone. She arched her head back, giving him room, encouraging his attentions. At the same time he cupped her breasts and rubbed his thumbs against her sensitive, tight nipples.</p><p>The contact was exquisite. Fire roared through her, melting her from the inside out. Her panties were already damp, her body swollen. She wanted and needed with a fierceness that matched the first time they\u2019d been together. Somehow she would have thought that intensity would fade some with time, but it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>When he tugged at the hem of her T-shirt, she helped him. She was the one who unfastened her bra and pulled it off. Sam dipped his head and drew her sensitive nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>The sensual tugging made her catch her breath. She clutched at his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped as her body clenched in pleasure.</p><p>Even as he continued to caress her breasts, he dropped his hands to her hips and urged her to straddle him. She moved over him, then settled her dampness against his thick erection.</p><p>Even through the layers of his clothing, she felt the pulsing need of his arousal. He wanted her as much as she wanted him. His rapid breathing told her, as did the urgency in his hands as he squeezed her and drew her closer. Suddenly he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>Her first thought was that they didn\u2019t need to bother. Her second was there were other reasons to be protected. Her third was that she didn\u2019t want to have that conversation right now.</p><p>Fortunately their decision to become lovers had propelled her to the drugstore, where she\u2019d bought a box of protection. Just in case Sam ever visited.</p><p>\u201cGet naked,\u201d she said as she stood and hurried into her bedroom. She found the box in her nightstand and tore it open. Clutching a condom in her hand, she returned to the living room, where she found a very undressed Sam sprawled on her sofa.</p><p>She slowed as she took in the broad chest, flat belly, and impressive erection. Pausing only to slip out of her shorts and briefs, she tossed him the package, then waited until he had sheathed himself before straddling him again.</p><p>They resumed their positions, his mouth on her breast, her hands on his shoulders, his hands on her hips. But this time when she lowered herself, he slipped inside of her.</p><p>Her body shivered in pleasure, as the familiar stretching, tensing, filling brought her to the edge. That, combined with the gentle tugging of his mouth on her nipples, made her want to scream. It was too much and she never wanted any of it to stop.</p><p>\u201cOh, Sam,\u201d she breathed as she raised and lowered herself. She wrapped her arms around his neck and tried to hang on to control. It would just be too embarrassing to come this quickly.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Everything felt too good.</p><p>The hands on her hips urged her to go faster and faster still. Friction increased, as did tension. And then she would have done anything, said anything, because when her body convulsed into perfect release she could only ride him, crying out his name until he stiffened and lost himself in his own orgasm.</p><p>The waves of pleasure slowed, receded, then faded. She leaned back, just as he looked at her. Neither of them smiled, neither of them spoke. The connection between them lingered, growing in the silence until she wanted to crawl inside of Sam and be as much a part of him as his heart or his blood.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what the feelings meant, and they scared the crap out of her. Still, when he rubbed his thumb against her mouth and asked if she would like to spend the day with him and Kelly, she could only nod mutely and hold him close.</p><p>Kelly sat in the front seat of the truck and glanced at Francesca from under her lashes. Francesca had been quiet all morning. While she always claimed not to be a morning person, she\u2019d never been this out of it before.</p><p>\u201cAre you, um, okay?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>Francesca glanced at her and offered a sad smile. \u201cSorry. I have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>Kelly thought about the angry conversation she\u2019d overheard at the Fourth of July party nearly a week before.</p><p>\u201cIs your family fighting?\u201d She shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to spy or anything, I just\u2014\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou know. We sort of heard.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded. \u201cI\u2019m guessing everyone heard. Things got a little loud.\u201d Her grip on the steering wheel tightened. \u201cWe\u2019re okay now, but things were a little shaky for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wanted to ask more, but knew it wasn\u2019t polite. Normally being polite wasn\u2019t a high priority, but she liked Francesca and was really trying.</p><p>\u201cMy folks started dating while they were still in high school,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cNeither set of parents approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cEverybody in your family loves each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Apparently things were different before. Back then they faced a lot of disapproval. They refused to break up and started dating secretly. Then my mom got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Kelly caught her breath. \u201cWow. Her mom and dad must have been really mad.\u201d</p><p>Francesca smiled. \u201cI doubt they were happy. They ended up sending my mom away to a special place for pregnant girls. After she had her baby, he was given up for adoption. That was thirty years ago. We\u2019ve been talking about the situation, and we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re going to try to find him and bring him back into the family. Your dad offered to help with that. Apparently security experts can also find people.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was less impressed by her father\u2019s abilities than what Francesca\u2019s parents had done. \u201cThey gave their baby away?\u201d She knew people did that sort of thing. Of course they did. But she\u2019d never known anyone who was adopted or anyone who\u2019d let their baby be taken away. The thought of it made her feel cold inside.</p><p>\u201cFrom what my mom said, they didn\u2019t have a choice. It\u2019s sad for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t like to think about being abandoned. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever spent one whole day feeling safe and wanted. Not with her mom and not now with her dad.</p><p>They pulled up in front of the ballet school. When Francesca turned into the parking lot, Kelly touched her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay. I\u2019m going home with Cindy. Dad said it was okay.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hesitated, then shrugged. \u201cOkay. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Francesca watched Kelly as she headed for the side entrance. Despite being only twelve, the girl moved with a grace that made Francesca envious. When Kelly waved and disappeared into the building, Francesca backed out of the parking lot, then headed home.</p><p>Once there she flipped through her dissertation. Her mind raced with thoughts of her long-lost brother, the paper she should be working on, and her pregnancy. Nearly another week had passed. At some point she was going to have to come clean with Sam. And she would. Very soon. Just as soon as she figured out what to say.</p><p>She finally settled down to work about eleven. At three-thirty the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Kelly with you?\u201d Sam asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with a strangled growl. \u201cIf she\u2019s not with you and she\u2019s not home, where the hell is she?\u201d</p><p>Francesca arrived at Sam\u2019s place less than twenty minutes later. She walked into the house and found him pacing the length of the entryway.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from her,\u201d he said, obviously furious and worried in equal measures. \u201cWho is this Cindy person and why didn\u2019t you get a phone number?\u201d</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t willing to take the fall on this one. \u201cShe said you had told her it was fine. I assumed you had.\u201d</p><p>Sam had pulled off his suit jacket and tie and rolled up his sleeves. Even without all the trappings of success, he still looked powerful and angry.</p><p>\u201cShe told you I said it was okay and you believed her?\u201d he asked, sounding incredulous. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a kid who thinks nothing of lying to get her own way.\u201d</p><p>Francesca refused to be intimidated by his size or his temper. \u201cWhen has she lied? To the best of my knowledge, Kelly is completely upfront about her wants and desires. Are you saying this morning she didn\u2019t ask you about going to Cindy\u2019s and you didn\u2019t say it was all right?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, then closed it. Rage faded from his eyes.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. Now it was her turn to glare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He turned away and walked into the kitchen. \u201cI was reading the paper this morning,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>She followed him. \u201cSo?\u201d Then the pieces clicked into place. \u201cOh. You were reading and not listening. In fact, you can\u2019t remember one thing your daughter may or may not have said. So for all you know she did tell you about going to Cindy\u2019s. You might have even agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you at least have gotten a phone number?\u201d he asked, turning to face her.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have at least listened for thirty seconds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not. Kelly is your child and your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d he yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t take a breath without thinking about it. I didn\u2019t ask for this responsibility, but I\u2019m doing the best I can. Everything about my life is different, with no warning, no explanation.\u201d</p><p>Francesca tried not to panic. Sam hadn\u2019t actually come out and said he didn\u2019t want his child, but he\u2019d skated close to it. Close enough to make her press a protective hand over her stomach. This was not good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then the front door opened. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d Kelly called. \u201cFrancesca, you\u2019re here. Did Sam call and ask you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kelly walked into the kitchen and looked from Sam to Francesca and back. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, suddenly looking wary.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask permission to go to Cindy\u2019s this morning?\u201d Sam demanded.</p> <p>Francesca winced at his harsh, accusing tone.</p><p>Kelly took a step back. \u201cOf course I did and you said it was fine. I even wrote down her telephone number.\u201d</p><p>Sam blinked. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>Kelly stalked over to the pad by the phone and pulled off the top sheet. She carried it back to her father and slapped it down on the counter next to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cI guess I overreacted.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cWhy are you all mad? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI came home early and when you weren\u2019t here, I got worried. When I called Francesca, she said you were at a friend\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t remember us talking about it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly took a step back. \u201cYou weren\u2019t listening to me?\u201d she asked, sounding both insulted and hurt. \u201cWas I too boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off with a shake of her head. \u201cYou were reading your damn paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you swear, young lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? You don\u2019t listen. I thought you were different!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t like her. But you are. You\u2019re a lousy parent. You\u2019re horrible. I hate you!\u201d</p><p>Sam stepped toward her. \u201cKelly, I\u2019m sorry I hurt your feelings. I never meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt my feelings. I don\u2019t care anything about you. No, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re my father. I wish you weren\u2019t. I wish I\u2019d never come here.\u201d</p><p>She ran out of the room. Francesca hesitated, not sure if she should go after her.</p><p>Sam leaned against the counter and rubbed his eyes. \u201cThat would be my parental screwup for the day. Why can\u2019t I get control of this situation? I can manage everything else in my life. Why not Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you talked to her\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to her.\u201d Sam walked to the refrigerator and took out a can of soda. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to deal with any of this. I want things like they were before she ever showed up.\u201d</p><p>He offered her the can. Francesca could barely breathe, but she managed to shake her head. Her throat was tight, her heart heavy. She\u2019d known Sam was still adjusting to having Kelly around, but she\u2019d thought he was coming to care about his daughter.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you need me to stick around,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called in a panic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou were worried. That\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He walked her to the door. Francesca said a quick goodbye and hurried to her truck. She had to get away before she gave into the need to burst into tears. She\u2019d been a fool, because in her heart of hearts, she\u2019d actually hoped Sam might be happy about the baby. Now she knew he would consider the child nothing but an inconvenience and her little more than a liar who had tricked him into a situation he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>Sam waited an hour before heading up to Kelly\u2019s room. She didn\u2019t answer when he knocked, but the door wasn\u2019t locked. He considered that a good sign.</p><p>When he stepped inside, she was stretched out on the bed, her back to the door. He crossed the room and sat on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it does.\u201d He studied her red curls and the curve of her back. When she was going toe-to-toe with him, she seemed so grown-up, but here, curled up on her bed, she was small and defenseless. A child. His child.</p><p>He wanted to be in control, but Kelly was her own person. Maybe the best he could hope for was an alliance between them.</p><p>He smiled as he remembered plenty of fights with Gabriel. No doubt he\u2019d been just as stubborn and difficult when he\u2019d been growing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it you called me before?\u201d he asked. \u201cA pinhead?\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. Her eyes were swollen and red, her face damp from her tears. The sight of her pain stabbed him right in the gut.</p><p>\u201cA butthead,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with that. How about if you call me a pinhead, I promise to listen, and we\u2019re even?\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at him without speaking.</p><p>He leaned toward her and lightly touched the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. You followed the rules. You asked for permission, you left a phone number, you even told Francesca. I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to buy me a DVD player to make up for what you did?\u201d she asked with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I know a great rib restaurant that has a pretty cool video game room in back. I\u2019ll front you five bucks\u2019 worth of quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a DVD player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>She sat up. \u201cThanks for apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre these Chicago-style ribs?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThey\u2019re ribs. Meat, bone, barbecue sauce. Just ribs.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a hissy fit just because you don\u2019t know what kind they are.\u201d</p><p>He growled. She giggled, then smiled. Without thinking, he held open his arms. Kelly stared at him as if he\u2019d turned into a rat. But just as he was about to lower his arms, she moved close.</p><p>He hugged her, and for the first time since she\u2019d shown up on his doorstep, he felt how small she was. Thin and frail. But full of life. His daughter, he thought with pride. His child.</p><p>14</p><p>T he late morning sun was warm as Francesca adjusted her straw hat and wove her way through the row of grapevines.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked her sister.</p><p>Brenna stopped walking and pressed her lips together in an expression of disgust. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know the different kinds of grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re red,\u201d Francesca said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cWow. You can do your colors. What\u2019s next? Shapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t mock my intelligence,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cI was the slow learner, remember? I\u2019m very sensitive about my abilities.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cThat was nearly twenty years ago. Since then you\u2019ve gone to college, graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and you\u2019re in a Ph.D. program. That \u2018I\u2019m not the smart one\u2019 card doesn\u2019t play anymore.\u201d</p><p>Francesca started to protest, then stopped herself. She still remembered her frustration at being unable to read while everyone else in her class caught on so quickly. She\u2019d been nine before she\u2019d suddenly figured out what the jumble of letters meant and saw they could form words and sentences and entire thoughts. No one knew what had caused her learning disability. A few doctors had speculated there was a part of her brain that had simply taken longer to mature. Regardless, she\u2019s spent a lot of years feeling stupid and slow.</p><p>Had that really been almost twenty years ago? When she thought of it in those terms, she was forced to admit she\u2019d come a long way.</p><p>\u201cSo now I\u2019m smarter than you,\u201d she said, teasing her sister.</p><p>Brenna bent over and checked the trellis holding the grapevine in place. \u201cNot about growing grapes or making wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Brenna straightened. \u201cAnd we\u2019re both idiots when it comes to men. Unless you\u2019ve improved through practicing on Sam?\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t want to think about him. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t even get into the family problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should. We have to talk about it, Brenna.\u201d</p><p>Her twin shrugged. \u201cIs that why you came by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason. I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>About them both. There was so much going on right now. Francesca didn\u2019t think she could handle one more thing.</p><p>\u201cThey want Sam to find him,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cMom already called him and he agreed.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019d passed along Sam\u2019s offer. Her parents had still been in shock, but when that faded, she knew they would want to get in touch with their firstborn.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you they\u2019d accepted?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Francesca glanced at the rows of grapevines. \u201cNo, but we haven\u2019t actually seen that much of each other in the past week or so.\u201d</p><p>Not since Kelly had gone to spend the afternoon with a friend and Sam had gone ballistic.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>Francesca brushed aside her concern. \u201cThat\u2019s not important. I\u2019ve been worried about you. About how you\u2019re handling all this. Grandpa Lorenzo talking about selling was one thing. It could have been a lot of bluster on his part. But finding out about another child...\u201d</p><p>Brenna plucked at a leaf. \u201cNot just a child. A grandson. Our sexist grandfather is so happy he positively beams. I\u2019m guessing he has visions of bringing the long-lost man into the folds of family and teaching him all he needs to know to run Marcelli Wines.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wanted to say that wasn\u2019t possible, except she knew it was. It might even be likely. \u201cMaybe he won\u2019t be interested.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cMarcelli Wines is worth about forty million dollars. Would you walk away from that?\u201d</p><p>Francesca swallowed. \u201cForty million?\u201d She\u2019d known the land and the vines had value, but that much? \u201cTell me again why I\u2019m scrimping and saving to put myself through college.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled. \u201cBecause you have integrity, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Think I could get a cash advance on my inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to talk to your brother about that.\u201d</p><p>A brother. She still couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThey should have told us a long time ago. We would have understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have hurt so badly,\u201d Brenna murmured.</p><p>Francesca agreed. Keeping secrets created trouble, which was something she\u2019d been telling herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird since the Fourth. And don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about our long-lost brother, because you were weird before that.\u201d</p><p>Francesca tried to smile. \u201cGee, thanks for the endorsement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I can tell there\u2019s something off. So what is it? Did you go and fall for Sam? Are you starting to think that marriage might not be such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s guess was so far from the truth that Francesca laughed. \u201cNot even close. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brenna waited.</p><p>Francesca sighed. Maybe it was time to come clean, if not to Sam then to her twin sister. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her twin\u2019s eyes widened and her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I took a pregnancy test about ten days ago, and it was positive. I haven\u2019t gotten my period since, so there\u2019s no reason to think anything has changed.\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned over the row of grapes and hugged her. \u201cWow. This is so amazing. You\u2019re going to have a baby!\u201d She straightened. \u201cOkay, so this isn\u2019t exactly how you had your life plan set up. I know you don\u2019t want a husband, but kids are different. Aren\u2019t you thrilled?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled. \u201cYou should be. A baby! Remember how we used to talk about how many kids we\u2019d have and how they\u2019d all grow up playing with each other, like you, me, and Katie did? How we\u2019d take them to that grove of trees and let them play dress-up? You\u2019re having a baby!\u201d</p><p>Francesca touched her still-flat stomach. \u201cHonestly, Brenna, I don\u2019t know what I feel. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m worried. And if we\u2019re going to have our kids all playing together, then you\u2019d better get a bun in the oven of your own.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna grimaced. \u201cThat would require me having sex, and right now that\u2019s not likely to happen. But with Katie getting married, there will be cousins for your little one.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stopped talking and sucked in a breath. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told Sam yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at her. \u201cHow about something along the lines of \u2018Hey, big guy. One of your little tadpoles got a bit too frisky.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Despite her emotional angst, she couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cYou really want me to call him \u2018big guy\u2019 and refer to his sperm as tadpoles?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Brenna turned toward the winery. \u201cThis is sure going to change your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why haven\u2019t you told him?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of reasons. For one thing, I\u2019ve been in shock. We used a condom. I know they\u2019re not a hundred percent effective, but having me get pregnant the first night seems really unfair.\u201d</p><p>Brenna looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty lousy argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019m... scared. At first I didn\u2019t want to say anything because he was dealing with Kelly showing up in his life and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Brenna swore. \u201cKelly! I\u2019d forgotten all about her. Oh, kid, you are in big trouble. Practically the same week Sam finds out he\u2019s the father of a teenager, you turn up pregnant. Talk about lousy timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making me feel better,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cBut you\u2019re also right. That\u2019s why I waited. I didn\u2019t want to dump this on him, and I was still getting used to the idea myself. Then I found out we had a brother and it\u2019s been crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cAnd Sam is having a tough time adjusting to Kelly. She\u2019s a great kid, but a handful. Last week he got really angry and said some things about her disrupting his life and how he didn\u2019t ask for the responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want Kelly, he\u2019s not going to want your baby?\u201d</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t surprised Brenna understood. \u201cYeah. Plus, things have been really good with Sam and telling him is going to change all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so screwed,\u201d Francesca muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re also not \u2019fessing up to the most important part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Brenna stopped walking and faced her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell Sam because you don\u2019t want to hear what he has to say. Not because he\u2019s going to reject your child, but because you have this fantasy in mind. One in which he sweeps you off your feet and confesses undying love.\u201d</p><p>Francesca rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s so much bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? You\u2019re nearly as romantic as Katie. You\u2019re like the middle child, seeing everyone\u2019s point of view, rescuing the world. Sam is a great guy. After years of not wanting a man in your life, you finally hook up with him and he\u2019s terrific. Sexy, smart, successful. It\u2019s okay if you fall for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fall for him. I don\u2019t love him. I don\u2019t want anything from him but sex. Now we\u2019re having a child and that complicates everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cThe baby is just logistics. If you weren\u2019t worried about getting hurt, you would have told him. You have to work out details like custody. If your heart weren\u2019t engaged, stuff like that wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t like anything her sister was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to admit I\u2019m right because it scares the crap out of you and because you don\u2019t like me figuring out something about you that you couldn\u2019t figure out yourself. It violates your view of yourself as psychologically superior.\u201d</p><p>The verbal slam caught Francesca like a blow. \u201cThat is so unfair.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true. You planned this whole affair with Sam as if you were shopping for a wardrobe. Oh, you need a little black dress, so go to the stores until you find the right one. But this isn\u2019t a dress. It\u2019s sex. And you\u2019re not shallow enough to give your body without your heart being engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about being shallow. It\u2019s about being sensible. I don\u2019t want a man in my life right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to you, you don\u2019t want one ever. You\u2019re afraid, Francesca. Like I said, it\u2019s been twenty years since you were the dumb kid in class, but you can\u2019t let that go. I remember you crying yourself to sleep because you felt stupid. And when you confessed your fears to our wonderful, caring Grandfather, he told you not to worry yourself. That you were so pretty some nice man would always be around to take care of you. Which Todd did and you hated.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wanted to run away. Why was Brenna turning on her? What was going on?</p><p>\u201cThis is all old information, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has everything to do with Sam. You got scared, Francesca, and I don\u2019t blame you. For so long you were afraid you couldn\u2019t measure up. Todd acted as if you had the mental acuity of a stamp. He wanted you to shut up and look pretty, which you did. But you weren\u2019t allowed to be a person. You\u2019ve spent the last six years becoming your own person. Of course you\u2019re afraid of being with a man again. All your life you\u2019ve been told that only the men matter. That we have to take care of them. If you get involved with Sam, you risk losing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not involved, and I haven\u2019t lost myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose yourself,\u201d Brenna told her, obviously annoyed. \u201cThat\u2019s my damn point. You\u2019re not that insecure teenager anymore. You\u2019re a successful woman. You\u2019re confident and capable, and it\u2019s okay to admit you care about Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Francesca yelled. \u201cI\u2019m not involved! I\u2019m just pregnant!\u201d</p><p>A sharp intake of air made them both turn. Francesca nearly fainted when she saw her grandfather standing not five feet away from them. She and Brenna had been so busy arguing, they hadn\u2019t heard him approach.</p><p>Panic flared, and with it a sense of her life spinning out of control. Just when she\u2019d decided it couldn\u2019t get any worse, she was fighting with her sister and had just spilled her secret to the person least likely to keep it quiet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word,\u201d she told her grandfather. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d</p><p>The old man wasn\u2019t the least bit impressed with her instructions.</p><p>\u201cIs it Sam? That young man who was over at the party?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lie and she didn\u2019t want to tell the truth. \u201cGrandpa, this is my problem and I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cMen who get women pregnant have a responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re not talking to Sam. I mean it. You\u2019re not to say anything. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he shouldn\u2019t. And he doesn\u2019t know about the baby yet, so don\u2019t you even think about telling him. Grandpa, you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>It was like bargaining with the weather. No matter how much energy she put into the process, she had absolutely no control over the outcome.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. Instead he looked from her to Brenna, then turned and started for the winery.</p><p>Francesca folded her arms over her midsection. \u201cThis is bad. This is really, really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cSam and Kelly have been invited to dinner tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d head out to the mission,\u201d Gabriel said as he settled on a kitchen chair.</p><p>Kelly put down her spoon and pushed her cereal bowl away. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You and I can take the day to get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t sure about that. She thought her great-grandfather might like her more if they didn\u2019t get to know each other. \u201cThe new nanny starts the day after tomorrow. With my dance class canceled for the day, I can just hang out. You don\u2019t have to bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bother.\u201d Gabriel leaned his cane against the table. \u201cI\u2019ve made reservations for a boat cruise this afternoon. It goes over to the Channel Islands. They\u2019re just south of here.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the tall, white-haired man sitting across from her. She could kind of see bits of her dad in him. Gabriel wasn\u2019t exactly friendly, but he wasn\u2019t too scary. The odd-smelling Doreen\u2019s last day had been the previous Friday. Sam had stayed home yesterday, and Gabriel was with her today, while Francesca was taking the Wednesday shift. Kelly had lobbied for Francesca to take care of her the whole week, but Sam had said they\u2019d bothered her enough already.</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t like the sound of that. She\u2019d thought Sam was interested in Francesca and that they might want to get married or something. Kelly wouldn\u2019t mind having Francesca around more. Sometimes her dad was okay, but sometimes he made her crazy.</p><p>Now she had a grandfather to deal with.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right on a boat?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel drew his bushy, white eyebrows together. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m too old to go on a boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, young lady, I\u2019ve forgotten more about boats than you\u2019ll ever learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve forgotten it, then you\u2019re not going to be much help, are you?\u201d</p><p>The words were out before Kelly could stop them. She flinched slightly, waiting for Gabriel to get mad. Sam would never believe it, but she\u2019d really been working hard to think before she spoke. With Tanya nothing had ever mattered because her mother was too busy with her own life to care. But here things seemed to be different. Fortunately Gabriel only chuckled.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cGood news that I\u2019m not the captain, eh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou been on a boat before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of the maids took me on that tour around Manhattan once. It was pretty cool to see the whole city that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your mother while this was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Out, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou miss her?\u201d</p><p>Kelly considered the question. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be here instead of there, you know? But miss her?\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>Not really. She\u2019d never spent any time with Tanya. The staff were always taking her places, not her mother.</p><p>Here it was different. Sam was in her face all the time, but he wasn\u2019t so bad. Maybe he didn\u2019t spoil her, and she really hated not having a DVD player, but they had some good times. They\u2019d started going out to dinner a few nights a week. Different places with different kinds of food. And they\u2019d gone to the movies. He\u2019d refused to take her shopping, but he\u2019d promised the next nanny would. And honestly, thinking of Sam in the teen department of a mall store was kind of funny.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s a good man,\u201d Gabriel said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re his grandfather. You have to like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She turned her spoon over in the bowl. \u201cI don\u2019t really know him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there. And he\u2019ll get to know you.\u201d</p><p>His words were meant to reassure, but they made Kelly feel all cold inside. Staring at a few floating bits of cereal, she cleared her throat. \u201cWhat about after?\u201d she asked, her voice quiet. \u201cWhen he sends me away. Do you think it will be to a boarding school or something?\u201d</p><p>It was the thought of the \u201csomething\u201d that terrified her the most.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Sam\u2019s not sending you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked at her great-grandfather. \u201cMy mom said he\u2019d probably keep me around for a couple of years and then he\u2019d send me away when I got to be too much trouble. Maybe one of those boarding school places or even to a dance school. I guess that would be okay.\u201d</p> <p>The last bit was more to convince herself than because she believed it. She didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. She wanted to be a part of a family. She wanted to feel safe.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go away?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>Kelly opened her mouth, then stunned both of them by bursting into tears.</p><p>\u201cSilly girl,\u201d he muttered as he shifted his chair close to hers and drew her against him. \u201cThis is where you live now. I know it\u2019s hard to adjust, especially with your mother dumping you like this. But we\u2019re your family now. You\u2019re stuck with us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wanted to believe him. Really. \u201cSam gets mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. I used to get so angry with him that I wanted to lock him in his room forever. But I got over it. Then he screwed up again. It\u2019s what kids do. Think of it as your job.\u201d</p> <p>He smelled of peppermint and sports cream. His arms were thinner than Sam\u2019s, but being in them made her feel just as safe. She raised her head and looked at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He brushed her hair off her forehead. \u201cMy late wife was one of the most beautiful women I ever had the pleasure of knowing. Whenever we\u2019d walk down the street, the other men would watch her and wonder how somebody like me got so lucky. Want to know a secret?\u201d</p><p>Kelly swiped away her tears. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look just like her. She had red curls and green eyes, too.\u201d</p><p>Wonder filled her. Wonder and something light and warm that made it feel as if her heart was floating. \u201cEven freckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially freckles. Freckles just like yours.\u201d</p><p>Francesca parked in front of the hacienda. Kelly raced toward the backdoor and burst inside, but Francesca was slower to follow. If she hadn\u2019t had Kelly for the day, she might not have had the courage to show up at all. Except with Sam due for dinner, she hadn\u2019t had a choice. There was no way she could let him face her family without her first knowing what they knew and what they planned to say.</p><p>Oh, but she didn\u2019t want to go inside. Not now. If Grandpa Lorenzo had told anyone... She leaned her forehead against the steering wheel. If? Was there any alternative universe in which he wouldn\u2019t spread the news? She wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find her father standing just inside the door, a shotgun in one hand and a list of available priests in the other.</p> <p>The only bright spot was that she knew no one would say anything to Kelly. Her family would never hurt or upset the girl. If only they felt that way about their adult daughters, she thought wryly.</p><p>Unable to avoid the inevitable, she climbed out of the truck and made her way to the house.</p><p>The kitchen was the usual chaos. Even though it was only early afternoon, the Grands were in the midst of preparing dinner. Pots bubbled, vegetables lay on the countertops, and something delicious baked in the oven. Her mother stood with Kelly, next to Katie, who was sitting at the table and working on a list. As she entered, they all turned to look at her. There was a second of silence, and in that second she knew that they knew. Francesca braced herself against the need to bolt.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Francesca said weakly.</p><p>Her grandmothers rushed forward to embrace her. When she\u2019d been squeezed, hugged, and cheek-pinched, Grammy M offered tea and Grandma Tessa told her to sit \u201cand take a load off your feet.\u201d</p><p>As the baby wasn\u2019t even as big as a pencil eraser, worrying about her carrying around extra weight seemed excessive, but Francesca knew they all meant well. She tried to look on the bright side, but all she could think about was what was going to happen when Sam arrived.</p><p>Katie gave her a sympathetic look, then rose. \u201cKelly, I\u2019m going to start beading the train. Want to help?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cSure. You mean you\u2019d really let me sew on your dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. There\u2019s a special pattern for around the hem. I thought you\u2019d like to work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Okay. Great!\u201d</p><p>Katie led the girl from the kitchen. Francesca watched her go with a sense of impending doom. Her mother crossed the kitchen, stopped in front of her, and reached for her hands.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been a fool ever to hope Grandpa Lorenzo had kept her secret for a second. \u201cDid he run right back to the house to tell you or did he announce it at dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Grandma Tessa frowned. \u201cLorenzo is very worried about you. We all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca, darlin\u2019,\u201d Grammy M murmured. \u201cAre you feelin\u2019 all right? Are you happy about the wee one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t commit to happy. Not when she was still floundering in confused.</p><p>\u201cDoes Sam know?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want any of you to tell him.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked disapproving. \u201cFrancesca, if he\u2019s the father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s the father. I don\u2019t go around sleeping with more than one guy at a time. And for the record, there haven\u2019t been any other guys in a long time, okay?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa pulled out her rosary and started murmuring. Francesca crossed to the table and sank into a chair. This was not going well.</p><p>\u201cI know I have to tell Sam and I will. I just need a little more time to sort some things through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be takin\u2019 too long,\u201d Grammy M said. \u201cThe weddin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>Francesca stared at her. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a wedding. Let\u2019s make that clear. No marriage. No Mr. and Mrs. I\u2019ll be having the child on my own.\u201d</p><p>The three women looked as if they\u2019d just witnessed a murder. They were stunned, shocked, and more than a little disapproving.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about Sam, your father will be happy to have a talk with him,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Francesca rose. \u201cNo talking. No anything. This is my life and you\u2019re not to interfere. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca\u2014\u201d her mother began.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to make my own decision. I don\u2019t want you to get involved. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>The three women looked at one another, then back at her and nodded. Francesca knew it was the best she could hope for. They had agreed not to interfere, but that didn\u2019t mean she believed them.</p><p>Sam exited the freeway for the two-lane highway that would take him to the hacienda. The late July afternoon was warm and clear\u2014perfect California weather. While he should be back in his office, dealing with any number of crises that were bound to crop up in his absence, here he was playing hooky instead. The thing was, there wasn\u2019t anything he would rather be doing.</p><p>He was even willing to admit the reason for his good mood\u2014he couldn\u2019t wait to see Francesca. Since the party on the Fourth, nearly three weeks ago, they\u2019d barely spent any time together. Between his work, getting to know Kelly, Francesca\u2019s need to work on her dissertation, and a five-day crisis involving the kidnapped son of a French banker, they hadn\u2019t had much time alone.</p><p>Funny how in the past couple of weeks he\u2019d found himself missing her. He missed talking to her, listening to her. He missed the sound of her laughter and looking at her across the dinner table. He missed her in his bed.</p><p>At first he\u2019d been able to ignore the ache inside, but it hadn\u2019t gone away. If anything it had gotten worse. Deeper, darker, more uncomfortable. He wanted to see her smile. He wanted to touch her face, kiss her, tease her, see her blush, watch her taking care of his daughter.</p><p>Basically, he had it bad.</p><p>Telling himself all the reasons he shouldn\u2019t get involved didn\u2019t seem to be helping. He didn\u2019t want to believe he was thinking with the wrong head, but there didn\u2019t seem to be another explanation.</p><p>So here he was, driving to the hacienda, grateful her family had insisted. They\u2019d wanted to thank him for looking for their son. He glanced at the file folder on the passenger seat. To make the visit more official, he\u2019d brought along what he\u2019d been able to find out about the Marcelli\u2019s firstborn.</p><p>He turned from the highway onto the long private road that led to the house. The grapes had grown since his last visit. Heavy clusters swelled in the afternoon light. He rolled down the window and inhaled the scent of earth and fruit. There was a heady sweetness in the air. The promise of harvest only a few weeks away. At least, that\u2019s what it smelled like to him, he thought with a grin. Like he knew anything about making wine.</p><p>He was still chuckling as he parked the car in the driveway behind the hacienda. He cut the engine and stepped out in the shade. The afternoon was still and quiet. Santa Barbara wasn\u2019t a huge city, but it was a major metropolis when compared with the solitary splendor of the hacienda.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He turned and saw Brenna walking toward him. She wore shorts and a T-shirt, with a large hat covering her head. The wide brim protected her face.</p><p>He studied her as she approached, looking for similarities between her and her twin. Their eyes were the same shape, but different colors. Francesca\u2019s features were more of a blend of the two families, while Brenna had inherited Italian features from the Marcelli side. She was full-breasted and full-hipped to Francesca\u2019s slender lines. Her beauty was less obvious than her sister\u2019s but just as powerful.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not here to help with Katie\u2019s dress,\u201d she said when she stopped in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIs that what they\u2019re doing? Working on the dress?\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a real estrogen fest in there. Want to take a walk until they\u2019re ready to break? I suspect if you go in too soon, they\u2019ll put you to work.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m not into beads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your daughter would say, well, duh. Come on. I\u2019ll let you admire my grapes.\u201d</p><p>He followed her back the way he\u2019d come. She headed into the rows of vines closest to the house, pausing every now and then to bend down and study the growing clusters.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a good year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould that change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. In a heartbeat. Too much sun, not enough sun, rain at the wrong time, no rain, too much rain. If it gets too cold, too hot, too foggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re lucky to get any harvest at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome years we are.\u201d She stepped back and pointed to the grapes. \u201cChardonnay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know when they\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperience. This is my first harvest in a long time, so I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cI thought you were the sister who was completely into the vineyard. Francesca told me you love it here.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but what she apparently forgot to mention is that I\u2019m also an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She started walking and he followed along. Several questions came to mind, but he didn\u2019t want to go anywhere dangerous. Just when he was about to change the subject, she started talking again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPer family expectations I got married when I was eighteen. Jeff was just entering medical school, and someone had to pay the bills. He was at UCLA, so I couldn\u2019t be married to him and still work here. So over the course of a few years I became less and less involved with the winery. Life went on, I missed it, but I knew my place was with my husband.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cThat would be the idiot part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the marriage didn\u2019t work out?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI became a twenty-seven-year-old clich\u00e9. Dr. Jeff left the wife who had supported him all those years and took up with a younger woman. They\u2019re getting married in a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just plain relieved to have it behind me.\u201d She shoved her hands into her shorts pockets. \u201cI was too young to marry anyone. Even being with the right guy would have been a challenge. But family expectations can be a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>There was something in her tone of voice that caught his attention. \u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cMy parents are pretty anchored in this century, but not the Grands and Grandpa Lorenzo. They don\u2019t take to newfangled ideas. They\u2019re traditional.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre they concerned because I divorced Kelly\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Brenna pressed her lips together. \u201cI love my sister. She\u2019s annoying at times, but I love her. They love her, too. You\u2019re a single guy with a daughter. Francesca\u2019s single. There\u2019s been talk.\u201d</p><p>The lightbulb went on. He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re warning me that they\u2019re not going to be subtle in their matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Before he could figure out an answer, Kelly ran out from the backdoor of the house, calling his name. She waved when she saw him and ran up to greet him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d she said, sounding delighted. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the dress all afternoon. It\u2019s the most beautiful dress I\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019ve been using shiny beads and little glass balls to make tiny flowers and a vine pattern. I haven\u2019t even pricked my finger once today, but Francesca did.\u201d She paused to suck in a breath. \u201cShe bled and everything, but Grammy M says she can get the stain out and Katie said she was sticking herself to get out of having to bead the dress because she\u2019s not very good at sewing, but she\u2019s good at lots of other stuff, so that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>She stopped to breathe again. This time he laughed. \u201cSo you\u2019re bored and want to go home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. I may never leave. I love it here. Francesca and her family are so cool.\u201d</p><p>A noise made him look up. He saw Francesca standing in the doorway of the house. She wore shorts and a shirt. Her hair was loose and a little messy. There was a Band-Aid on one finger and a smudge on her cheek. She shouldn\u2019t have looked beautiful. She shouldn\u2019t have looked anything.</p><p>In that second, as he stared at her and she stared back and their eyes locked together, fire flared. It burned bright and hot. In that heartbeat, all his determination to avoid messy relationships, to listen to his brain and not his hormones, faded away. He wanted her\u2014in bed, out of bed, whatever was available he would take, and the hell with the consequences.</p><p>15</p><p>\u201cS am, would you help me for a second?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He followed her into the kitchen, where she put him to work washing tomatoes for the salad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do with all the vegetables we have in the garden this year,\u201d she said as she peeled zucchini. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if we send you and Kelly home with a few pounds of our bounty. We\u2019re being overrun.\u201d</p> <p>Sam held up the tomato he was washing. \u201cOnly if you send them with instructions for preparing them. Otherwise this is about all I can handle.\u201d</p><p>Colleen Marcelli, stylishly dressed in light-colored pants and a coordinating short-sleeved shirt, raised her eyebrows. \u201cI thought Francesca could take care of that for you.\u201d</p><p>He thought of his recent warning from Brenna and held in a grin. \u201cShe\u2019s not at my house all that often, but when she is, I rarely put her to work in the kitchen. After all she\u2019s done to help me out with Kelly, I think it would show a lack of gratitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Francesca enjoys spending time with your daughter very much. She\u2019s always liked children. Then I suppose most women do.\u201d</p><p>He thought of his ex-wife. But then Tanya wasn\u2019t like most women.</p><p>Colleen finished with the zucchini and went to work on several red and yellow peppers. \u201cYou never remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s mother smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m prying, I know. It\u2019s just...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI worry about my children. Francesca is very special. She deserves a world of happiness. Sometimes life gives us situations that at first don\u2019t seem ideal, but over time we come to see that it all worked out for the best.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at her. When had he lost track of the conversation? \u201cMrs. Marcelli\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Colleen. I think Francesca\u2019s great and I want her to be happy, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also Kelly. Being an only child can be so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Sam looked up and saw Francesca standing in the doorway to the kitchen. Her eyes were flashing with temper.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Colleen ducked her head. \u201cSam and I were just talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time for the conversation to be over.\u201d Francesca turned to him. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s take Kelly for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Sam wiped his hands on a paper towel and followed her out of the room. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but there were enough undercurrents to float a ship in this place. He hadn\u2019t noticed them at the party. Was that because there\u2019d been such a large crowd around, or had something happened in the past few weeks? Something other than the mystery brother. Something he didn\u2019t know about?</p><p>Nightmare didn\u2019t begin to describe dinner, Francesca thought when the meal was finally finished and the family moved into the living room. The family matchmaking had abandoned anything remotely subtle and risen right to hard sell. While Sam had laughed off most of the more obvious comments, she\u2019d sensed his confusion as to the intensity of the attack. Her family was keeping her secret, but only just. If she didn\u2019t want the Grands to break out the yarn and start knitting receiving blankets in front of Sam, she was going to have to come clean and soon.</p><p>All decisions for another time, she thought, forcing her attention to the situation at hand. At dinner Sam had said he had news about the long-lost Marcelli son. Everyone gathered to hear what Sam had to say. They all watched as he opened the folder he\u2019d set on the wood coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found him,\u201d he said, addressing his words to her parents.</p><p>Her mother gasped and clutched her husband\u2019s hands. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Joe Larson. He was taken in by Cynthia and Joseph Larson when he was four days old. They lived in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>Francesca listened as Sam sketched out her brother\u2019s life. Where he went to elementary school, that he had no other siblings.</p><p>\u201cHis adoptive parents were killed when Joe was twelve.\u201d</p><p>Francesca froze. Her parents gasped, her mother began to cry, as did the Grands.</p><p>\u201cHe was alone?\u201d Grandma Tessa asked.</p><p>Sam consulted his notes. \u201cNo other family members stepped forward. He went into foster care.\u201d</p><p>Her mother covered her face with her hands. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not right. It can\u2019t be right. Why wouldn\u2019t they tell me?\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t answer, but Francesca already knew the truth. When the baby had been given away, all rights and responsibilities had been lost. The state would have placed him with strangers rather than returning him to the mother who had decided she wasn\u2019t interested in raising her child.</p><p>Grandma Tessa pulled her rosary from her pocket and began to finger the beads. Grandpa Lorenzo paled. Sam continued to read from his report.</p><p>\u201cJoe went into the Navy after high school. They tapped him for OCS right away. Officer Candidate School. A year after graduating, he entered Navy Seal training. That\u2019s what he does now. He\u2019s a Seal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a picture?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Sam reached forward and pulled it out, then passed it to her. She studied the photo for nearly a minute, before closing her eyes.</p><p>Francesca took the picture. A man in his late twenties stared back at her. She saw the likeness immediately, the blending of Irish and Italian features. He favored his father\u2019s side more than his mother\u2019s. He was good-looking. A stranger who was her brother.</p><p>Brenna stared over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s really one of us,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWas there any doubt?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for some,\u201d her sister admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to confirm the relationship with a DNA test,\u201d Sam said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t a difficult trail to follow. He\u2019s the missing Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to get in touch with him right away,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said as he took the picture. \u201cTell him who he is. He has a history here. A heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn inheritance,\u201d Brenna muttered.</p><p>The old man nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her mother murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. He must hate us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d her husband told her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever he\u2019s feeling, this is going to be a shock,\u201d Francesca said, unable to imagine finding out she had an entire family somewhere. \u201cJoe Larson has lived his life for thirty years without knowing about us. He\u2019ll need time to absorb everything. You can\u2019t just spring it on him. This needs to be planned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s family. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stood and left without saying anything. Francesca watched her go. For Brenna, the arrival of a long-lost son was the death of a dream.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca is right,\u201d her mother said. \u201cWhen I was sixteen I listened to all of you and did what you said. What I should have done was listened to my heart. This time Marco and I decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just your son,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s my grandson. He could be my heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colleen and Marco rose to their feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay out of it,\u201d Colleen said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll decide what we want to do.\u201d</p><p>She brushed away her tears and turned to Sam. \u201cThank you for finding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy to help. I\u2019ll leave the contact information here,\u201d he said as he dropped a card into the folder and handed it to her.</p><p>Kelly shifted next to her father. Francesca turned her attention to the girl and gave her a smile. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked as her parents left the room.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo was still muttering. The Grands alternately hugged each other and wiped away tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really weird,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI feel bad for everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamilies are complicated,\u201d Francesca agreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s going to like finding out he has a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this information is going to change a lot of lives,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cLike when Tanya sent me to live with my dad.\u201d She glanced at Sam, who had risen and was talking with Lorenzo. \u201cIt was weird at first, but it\u2019s better now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Francesca said and meant it more than the girl could know. If Sam could adjust to life with Kelly, maybe he wouldn\u2019t freak out at the thought of having a second child. Or was that just wishful thinking?</p><p>Sam touched Kelly\u2019s shoulder. \u201cReady to head home?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and rose. \u201cI want to say good-bye to the Grands and Katie.\u201d</p> <p>As Kelly crossed to be with the rest of the family, Sam moved close to Francesca.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019re all in shock.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about tonight. I know my entire family went crazy with the matchmaking thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI survived.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cAt the risk of facing a shotgun wedding, what are your plans for this weekend? I thought we could spend some quality time together.\u201d He leaned close. \u201cKelly and I are going to the beach Saturday afternoon, then she\u2019s staying at a friend\u2019s house for the night. I thought we could have a sleepover, too.\u201d</p><p>Francesca studied his face, the crinkles by his tawny eyes, his easy smile. She was still trying to recover from his \u201cshotgun wedding\u201d remark. He had no idea how close he had skated to the truth.</p> <p>A few more days, she thought. She would be with him a few more days. Next week she was watching Kelly, and that Friday, just over a week from now, she would tell Sam about the baby. It was past time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to spend the night,\u201d she told him with a smile, even as she knew it might be their last time together. \u201cBut only if I get to sleep on top.\u201d</p><p>The night was warm and they\u2019d left the balcony doors open. Night creatures serenaded them with soft music, while their rapid breathing provided counterpoint and rhythm.</p><p>She stood with Sam in his bedroom. They\u2019d made it that far without ravishing each other, but she had a feeling they couldn\u2019t hold out much longer.</p><p>The hand cupping her cheek moved slightly as long fingers stroked her skin. She wrapped her arms around his waist. His hard back muscles rippled at her touch. She moved her hands up and down, feeling his strength, the hard planes of his body.</p><p>She returned her attention to the still-chaste kiss. He\u2019d kept the contact light, so it was up to her to entice him. She licked his lower lip. Instantly he groaned. She licked his lip again. He groaned. When he opened for her, she swept inside, eager to explore, to play, to excite. Anticipation swelled. Heat ignited in her belly before spiraling out and settling between her legs. When her tongue touched his, sparks flared. His taste, his warmth, the way he moved with her, the way they moved together. The opening moves of their sensual dance left her trembling and hungry.</p> <p>He raised his other hand to her face and cupped her jaw. Suddenly he was back in charge. He deepened the kiss before closing his lips around her tongue and sucking gently. Pressure started between her legs, and her breasts began to ache.</p><p>She arched against him, wanting to be closer. She could feel the dampness of her swelling, the heat of her rising passion. Sam broke their kiss only to nibble his way along her jaw toward her ear. He licked the outside curve before sucking on the sensitive skin just below her lobe. His hands moved to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both way too dressed,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI agree. We should do something about that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her collarbone just as his thumbs brushed over her tight nipples. She gasped. He cupped her breasts, squeezing gently. Her head fell back.</p><p>\u201cIn a second,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop kissing you just yet.\u201d</p><p>His fingers circled her curves, then his thumbs flicked against her nipples again, and fire shot through her.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>With one swift, fluid move, he pulled his polo shirt free of his jeans and tugged it over his head. \u201cTouch me,\u201d he said, taking her hands in his and placing them on his skin.</p><p>He was warm. The light dusting of hair tickled her palms and made her fingers tingle. While she explored hard, male contours, he went to work on the buttons down the front of her dress. Just as she had discovered the pleasure of stroking him from shoulder to waist, he pulled her dress over her arms. She straightened and the garment fell to the floor.</p><p>She stood there in bra and panties, along with her sandals, which she quickly kicked away. Sam skimmed his hands down to her breasts and cupped them. She sought out his erection. He was hard, long, and he flexed into her touch. She explored the length of him, then rubbed her thumb over the tip. He groaned, then kissed her deeply.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d Sam mumbled against her mouth.</p><p>He started urging her to step backward. As she complied, he moved his hands around to her back and expertly unfastened her bra. The garment fell away.</p><p>He broke their kiss and lowered his head to take her nipple in his mouth. Warm, damp heat surrounded her. Rational thought fled. She came to a stop and cupped his head to hold him in place.</p><p>Tension flooded her. Heat made the balls of her feet burn and her toes curl. As he licked and sucked on one breast, he used his hands on the other. Dual pleasure swept through her. She whispered his name, then spoke it louder. He shifted mouth and fingers so her other breast now received his kisses. The ache between her legs intensified to actual pain. Heat spiraled. Need grew. Tension flared higher and higher. His fingers moved back and forth in a rhythm that made her head spin.</p><p>Sam straightened and kicked off his shoes. Before she knew what was happening, he\u2019d pulled off her panties and shed his jeans. His briefs went with them. They were naked in a heartbeat.</p><p>She barely had a second to anticipate how great it was going to be, when she found herself being lowered into a sitting position on the bed. Somehow her legs were apart and his hand was easing between them. He kissed her and slipped inside of her at the same moment.</p><p>Tongue and finger in perfect synchronization. He withdrew once, twice, then a contraction began deep inside of her. As always with him, her orgasm exploded with little warning and incredible intensity. She couldn\u2019t control it or herself. She clung to him. He shifted slightly and brushed his thumb deep into her wetness until he found that one swollen point of need. He circled it once and she was lost.</p><p>Her entire body shook as her release overwhelmed her. Her legs opened wider, her breath stopped, her head fell back. Every muscle in her body tightened, then relaxed in rhythmic surrender. Hot pleasure rolled through her until her mind went blank and she could do nothing but accept and feel.</p><p>She opened her eyes to find Sam watching her. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so amazing,\u201d he said before kissing her mouth, her cheeks, her nose, her eyelids. \u201cI\u2019m shaking. I want you so damn much and I want it to be good, but how the hell am I supposed to hold back after watching that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one said you had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a reputation to uphold,\u201d he reminded her as he reached for his jeans and pulled out a condom. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>She shifted back on the bed and held open her arms. \u201cSam, that\u2019s not physically possible. You just have to show up and I\u2019m ready. Flash that at me\u201d\u2014she stroked his erection\u2014\u201cand I\u2019m three quarters of the way there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty easy,\u201d he said, slipping on the condom. \u201cIt\u2019s one of your best qualities.\u201d</p><p>She was still chuckling as he knelt between her thighs and slipped inside her.</p><p>Her body stretched to accommodate the familiar length and breadth of him. He stroked her breasts, then gently squeezed her nipples with his thumbs and forefingers.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come for me again,\u201d he said, his voice low and husky.</p><p>She opened her eyes and found him watching her. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He dropped one hand to her stomach, them moved lower. Once again he moved his thumb deeper, slipped it between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t close your eyes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWatch what we\u2019re doing for as long as you can.\u201d</p><p>Watch?</p><p>She lowered her head slightly. They were both naked, he was inside of her and touching her, and she could see it all. He found the one place designed for pleasure and began to slowly circle it. At the same time, he withdrew, then entered her again.</p><p>She could see and feel all at the same time. In and out. Slowly, except for his thumb which moved faster and faster. Her breathing increased. The combined sensations were irresistible. Her muscles began to tense.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he breathed. \u201cCome for me, Francesca.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to his face and saw he was watching as well\u2014what they were doing and her. He leaned forward and kissed her. At the same moment his thumb brushed over her most sensitive place and he plunged inside of her.</p><p>It was too much. No, it wasn\u2019t enough and then it was and then the contractions began again. She clung to him all through the whirlwind of sensation. At some point his hands settled on her hips as he drove himself into her again and again. She felt him stiffen and knew he was close. The realization was just erotic enough to make her climax one last time, surrounding him with a pulsing massage that sent him over the edge.</p><p>They held on to each other until they were both still and their breathing had slowed.</p><p>\u201cI screamed,\u201d she said when she finally gathered the strength to open her eyes.</p><p>Sam smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They slept, they awoke sometime in the night, made love, and slept again. Francesca got up sometime before dawn.</p><p>She pulled on her clothes and crossed to the balcony doors that still stood open. From there she could see to the ocean, and to the horizon. It was still dark, although there were hints of gray at the edges of the sky.</p><p>Behind her Sam lay sprawled across the bed. She\u2019d had to slide out from under the arm he\u2019d rested across her belly. He\u2019d been warm and relaxed. The powerful man relaxed in sleep.</p><p>Awake he was many things. Strong, gentle, caring, seductive. When he smiled at her...</p><p>Brenna\u2019s words came back to haunt her. That the reason she hadn\u2019t told Sam about the baby was that she was afraid of what he would say. And the reason she was afraid was because he mattered.</p><p>While she\u2019d been busy enjoying her first ever adult sex-only affair, and helping him with his daughter and enjoying his company, had she really allowed herself to fall for him? Was love a possibility?</p><p>No, she thought firmly. There was no way she would ever allow the rules to change like that. She hadn\u2019t wanted the complication. She\u2019d wanted something easy. Fun. A diversion, nothing more.</p><p>Only this was a lot more, and now there was a baby to think about.</p><p>She turned and watched Sam sleep. She\u2019d promised herself she would tell Sam and she would. Friday. Six more days. Just six. And then... then she didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me, boss?\u201d Jason asked as he entered Sam\u2019s office.</p><p>Sam nodded at the leather club chair in front of his desk. \u201cHave a seat. I\u2019ve been on the phone with a couple of clients finalizing holiday party plans.\u201d</p><p>Jason sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s July. Even the department stores don\u2019t have their Christmas decorations up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we book up early.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cWhat seems to be popular this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual. Aspen, London, Paris.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s company provided protection to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest families. When those families decided to entertain, the workload increased as the firm was expected to protect guests, as well.</p><p>\u201cWe also have three corporations requesting increased security for their senior executives and one former Mafia informant looking to live into his senior years.\u201d</p><p>Jason drew his eyebrows together. \u201cAren\u2019t we having a planning meeting on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>Sam kept his expression neutral. \u201cThe Johnsons just phoned about their holiday plans. They plan to travel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason groaned. \u201cSam, no. Not another trip to the wilderness. I don\u2019t even have all my shots yet for that African safari. We\u2019re going inside the blue zone. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>Trying not to laugh, Sam shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe blue zone is African airspace where there isn\u2019t much in the way of traffic control. No one is in charge, so planes have a real good chance of running into each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hell,\u201d Jason muttered. \u201cPure hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Johnsons don\u2019t want to go to Africa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked for you specifically. Apparently their youngest adores you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam,\u201d Jason growled. \u201cWhere are they going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that winter for us is summer in the southern hemisphere?\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s dark eyes widened. \u201cHoly shit. Not Antarctica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get there by boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>He allowed himself a slight smile. \u201cMonaco, Jason. They\u2019re spending Christmas in Monaco.\u201d</p> <p>Jason slapped his large hands on Sam\u2019s desk and grinned. \u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Just then they heard a familiar uneven step in the hallway.</p><p>Jason rose to his feet as Gabriel walked into the room. \u201cMorning, sir,\u201d he said, holding out the chair he\u2019d just vacated.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d Gabriel nodded. He glowered at Sam, then sank into the chair Jason offered.</p><p>\u201cHallway\u2019s getting longer,\u201d the old man grumbled. \u201cIt used to take me only a few steps to get to your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Gabriel,\u201d Sam said, ignoring his grandfather\u2019s complaints. He\u2019d made the mistake of offering the use of a wheelchair once before and had nearly had his head chewed off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out and about early,\u201d he said instead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for some information.\u201d His grandfather stared at Jason. \u201cSit down. You\u2019ll give me a crick in my neck if you just stand there.\u201d</p><p>Jason winked at Gabriel. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandson works you too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel muttered something under his breath and turned his attention back to Sam. \u201cThere\u2019s a restaurant by the Four Seasons Hotel. Supposed to be a nice place. What do you know about it?\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at his grandfather. \u201cYou\u2019re eating out? You hate restaurants. Do you want to come stay with Kelly and me for a few days?\u201d</p><p>As soon as he issued the invitation, he wanted to call it back. His need to be alone with Francesca grew exponentially every day. Having one more person in the house would only complicate an already difficult situation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine on my own,\u201d Gabriel growled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t a man go out to dinner once in a while?\u201d</p><p>Jason made a choking sound. When Sam glanced at him, he seemed to be having some kind of spasm.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem?\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d Jason cleared his throat and straightened in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with that restaurant. It\u2019s excellent. What kind of food does the lady like?\u201d</p><p>Lady? Sam nearly fell out of his chair. \u201cYou have a date?\u201d he asked his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Mary-Margaret out for dinner, yes. Not that it\u2019s any business of yours.\u201d</p><p>Mary-Margaret? The pieces fell into place. \u201cGrammy M?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glared at him. Sam would have sworn that the old man was blushing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fine figure of a woman,\u201d Gabriel told him. \u201cBeen widowed for some time. She makes me laugh. No law against that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all,\u201d Sam agreed, more than a little impressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll both be pleased by the restaurant,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Gabriel pushed himself to his feet and leaned heavily on his cane. He headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cYou two get back to work,\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p><p>Sam waited until his grandfather was out of earshot, then leaned back in his chair. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled. \u201cYou should see the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think about my grandfather dating after all these years. On the other hand, I\u2019m pleased to know the Reese family sports equipment works well into the golden years.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>E arly Monday morning Francesca walked out of her apartment only to find Brenna leaning against her truck. She slowed her step as she studied her twin. For once Brenna actually had a dress on, and makeup.</p><p>\u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d Francesca said when she reached her twin.</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cI thought you might want company.\u201d</p><p>Considering how quickly news traveled through the family, Francesca found it amazing that no one had said a word about a long-lost brother for nearly thirty years.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad called last night,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cWhen did you find out they\u2019d asked me to get in touch with Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes after they hung up. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to go on your own.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hadn\u2019t, but after the fight they\u2019d had in the vineyard, she\u2019d been uncomfortable calling Brenna.</p><p>\u201cYou might have been right,\u201d she said by way of apology.</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cAbout what specifically?\u201d</p><p>Francesca pushed her toward the front of the truck. \u201cGet in and I\u2019ll grovel all the way to San Diego.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later they were on the freeway, heading south.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have Kelly this week?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Francesca nodded. \u201cI had to call Sam last night and explain I couldn\u2019t pick her up from ballet today. He\u2019s taking her to work with him when she\u2019s finished with class, which is a good thing. They can hang out together and bond. I\u2019ll have her the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t spilled the beans about the little one yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday. I wanted to get through this week first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBecause you were right. I do care about him. And don\u2019t ask me to define what care means. He matters. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe details aren\u2019t important.\u201d Brenna leaned back in her seat and sighed. \u201cI love being right. It\u2019s a good way to start the day.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cFine. If you\u2019re so smart, have you figured out what we\u2019re going to say to our big brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. Although I\u2019ve considered the fact that we don\u2019t want to piss him off. Joe Larson is a Navy Seal. Doesn\u2019t the military train those guys to be killing machines? He can probably take us out with a cocktail napkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Two and a half hours later they entered San Diego County. Brenna shifted uneasily in her seat. \u201cMaybe this was a bad idea. Me coming along, I mean. I don\u2019t know if I want to meet this guy, although I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be thrilled at the possibility of inheriting millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think Grandpa Lorenzo will offer Joe the winery and he\u2019ll say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you? Even if he\u2019s not interested in it, he can sell it and pocket the cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa Lorenzo wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I think he\u2019ll be blinded by the thrill of finally having a male heir. It\u2019s been his dream since we were kids. Regardless of how or where he was raised, Joe is family. You know what that means in our house.\u201d</p><p>Francesca couldn\u2019t argue. Family was everything. She still wasn\u2019t used to the idea of having a brother. What would he be like? Would he be angry about being given up for adoption?</p><p>They entered the city. Thirty minutes later they pulled up into the hotel parking lot. Her parents had used a lawyer to arrange the meeting in the lobby-level coffee shop.</p><p>\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d Brenna said as they climbed out of the car. \u201cIf I start to go for his throat, hold me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he has all the training you claim and you go for his throat, he\u2019ll be able to take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the open hotel lobby. A small sign pointed the way to the caf\u00e9. The lush plant life and sound of a nearby fountain should have been soothing, but Francesca found herself fighting nerves. She placed a hand against her stomach.</p><p>Brenna squeezed her arm. \u201cMe, too,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of a funny opening line, but I can\u2019t seem to get beyond \u2018Hi.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about \u2018Hi, I\u2019m your sister.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Brenna rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the professional psychologist here. Wouldn\u2019t you want me to be more subtle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But sometimes getting everything on the table is a better idea.\u201d</p><p>They approached the caf\u00e9. The waiting area was empty. Brenna glanced at the chairs. \u201cWant to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>They tried to make small talk. Francesca scanned the people in the lobby, looking for a dark-haired man with Marcelli features.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll recognize him from the picture? After all he could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Just then a man turned onto the path and approached the caf\u00e9. He was tall, dark-haired, and nearly the spitting image of their father. Francesca\u2019s mouth went dry. Beside her Brenna sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been hoping there was a mistake, but obviously there isn\u2019t,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The man, well-built and handsome, wore jeans and a T-shirt. When he caught sight of them, he raised one eyebrow. His mouth curved up in a grin.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said when he was within earshot. \u201cWhen that lawyer guy called and asked me to meet you here, I nearly blew him off. Glad I didn\u2019t. Looks like my lucky day.\u201d</p><p>Francesca blinked. She couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Brenna told the man.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve never done a threesome. But hey, I\u2019m open to it.\u201d</p><p>Francesca blanched.</p><p>Brenna simply smiled. \u201cJoe Larson, in about two minutes you\u2019re going to think that\u2019s the most disgusting thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look the least bit worried. \u201cYou two vice cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse. We\u2019re your sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is just an office,\u201d Kelly said as she looked around the large open space of her father\u2019s business. \u201cI thought it would be...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDifferent.\u201d</p><p>Sam grinned. \u201cLike the workshop in the James Bond movies?\u201d</p><p>Kelly considered the question, then nodded. \u201cYeah. What about really cool machines and stuff? Things to help you take down the bad guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. These are just offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to have, you know, like weapons and ray guns.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cRay guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever watch TV? There are a lot of secret weapons on the black market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe try to keep our operations mostly legal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly, huh?\u201d She smiled. \u201cWant to tell me about the other parts?\u201d</p><p>He pulled one of her curls. \u201cNot even on a bet.\u201d</p><p>At first Kelly had been kind of upset when Francesca had called to say she was going to San Diego to meet her brother. Sam had already let Doreen go and the new nanny wasn\u2019t starting until next week. She\u2019d been surprised when he\u2019d told her he would bring her to work with him after her ballet lessons. Although she would never admit it, not even if she was tortured or threatened with a ray gun, she sort of liked hanging out with her dad. When he wasn\u2019t being too domineering or stubborn. He could be nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she wasn\u2019t going to like it too much, she told herself. Because Sam could still get tired of her and send her away.</p><p>They rounded a corner just as a huge man stepped out of his office. He was tall, with massive shoulders and dark skin. His head was shaved. He was like old and everything, maybe even over thirty, but he was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJason.\u201d Sam put his hand on Kelly\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is my daughter. Kelly, Jason Carlton. He runs several special security operations for our most demanding clients.\u201d</p><p>Jason grimaced. \u201cWhat your dad means is he puts me in charge of the crabby rich people.\u201d</p><p>Kelly giggled.</p><p>Jason winked. \u201cSo you\u2019re giving her the grand tour, Sam? You show her the gadgets?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cKelly is already dangerous enough without her learning how to use a gun.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly was about to say she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to learn how to use a gun when Jason sighed.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of stuff. The other things. Infrared, night-vision goggles.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced at her. \u201cWould you like to see that?\u201d</p><p>Kelly wasn\u2019t sure exactly what it was, but it sounded fun. She nodded eagerly.</p><p>Sam glanced at his watch. \u201cI have a call coming in from Germany in a few minutes, but maybe after that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, boss,\u201d Jason said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Johnsons\u2019 African safari all planned. I\u2019ll take Kelly through the playground.\u201d</p> <p>Sam hesitated. \u201cAll right, but keep her away from anything dangerous. I don\u2019t want her taking me out in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>Kelly watched him walk away. She was pretty sure her dad had been kidding, but not a hundred percent. Didn\u2019t Sam trust her? She sighed. Tanya never had.</p><p>Before she could think about that too much or get sad, Jason lead the way to the rear of the office. They stepped through a set of double doors and into a mock street with buildings on both sides. There was a huge locked cabinet against the wall by the door. Jason pressed his thumb against a small glass square, and the doors swung open. He dug around and came up with an assortment of goggles, head gear, weapon-looking devices, and small discs he tucked into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cJust so you don\u2019t get any ideas about breaking in on your own, kid,\u201d he said as he closed the doors and motioned her forward. \u201cGive it a try.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, then at the small glass square. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot even a little. Suck it up, little girl.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly she pressed her thumb to the glass. A female computer voice announced, \u201cYou are not authorized to open this unit. If you attempt to gain access, an alarm will sound. Please return to the front office immediately for processing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Kelly breathed.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? So don\u2019t be thinking you can bring your friends over and impress them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He set a pair of goggles on her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to night vision first, then we\u2019ll do infrared.\u201d</p><p>He handed her a long rifle-looking gun thing. It was big and really lightweight.</p><p>\u201cThese only work on targets,\u201d he told her as he pulled on his own goggles. \u201cWe program them, depending on the training session.\u201d He showed her a small pad in the butt of the weapon. \u201cThey fire a burst of light that\u2019s picked up by the sensors on the target.\u201d He grinned. \u201cEver play paint ball?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAfter this game, you\u2019ll be an expert.\u201d</p><p>Francesca, Brenna, and their brother sat at a table, ignoring the food they\u2019d ordered. Joe pushed around the French fries on his plate.</p><p>\u201cMy adopted parents died when I was twelve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a car accident. I\u2019d been spending the night with a friend, or I would have been with them. They didn\u2019t have any relatives, so I got shoved into the foster-care system.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes no longer sparkled with humor. Francesca leaned toward him. \u201cBut if you knew you were adopted, why didn\u2019t you tell someone? Wouldn\u2019t they have tried to get in touch with your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already been given up once. Why would I think anyone had changed their mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you didn\u2019t try to find your birth parents?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to go to one of those registries. I figured I could leave the information there. If someone was looking, they would find me.\u201d</p><p>The simple statements told Francesca a lot. Joe was willing to give them a second chance. He\u2019d listened while they\u2019d told him the circumstances of his birth and how desperately their parents wanted to meet him. That had to count for something.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found you,\u201d Brenna said, swiping a French fry from his plate. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cYou should come get to know your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Navy is my family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually there are three generations of Marcellis dying to get to know you,\u201d Brenna told him.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t look real impressed. Francesca turned her attention to her twin. Brenna had the most to lose if the long-lost Marcelli heir made an appearance, yet she was the one who had clicked with Joe.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Brenna challenged.</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t bother answering. He leveled his steady gaze on her and didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>Brenna only smiled. \u201cGoing to threaten me with a really big knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need props.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intimidate me, Joe. But I think we terrify you. I think you\u2019re finally looking at the one thing you\u2019ve wanted all your life. So why would you walk away from it? Your parents, our parents, want to get to know you. Is that so terrible?\u201d Brenna shrugged. \u201cThen there\u2019s the matter of the inheritance.\u201d</p><p>Francesca stared at her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find out about it eventually.\u201d</p><p>Francesca recognized the pain in her sister\u2019s eyes and suddenly understood Brenna\u2019s plan. Her twin wanted to know if Joe was going to be interested. She would rather know now than wait and wonder. Brenna had always been the gutsiest of the Marcelli sisters.</p><p>Joe leaned back in his seat. \u201cWhat inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver hear of Marcelli Wines?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He frowned. \u201cSame Marcellis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Just pictures acres and acres of vineyards, one traditional grandfather who owns it all, and four sisters. Not a male heir in sight. Until now.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You just won the jackpot.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved into a slow grin. \u201cHow much is it all worth?\u201d</p><p>Brenna swallowed. Francesca felt her pain and it tore at her.</p><p>\u201cAbout forty million. Think you might make your way north for a visit now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Hell, I\u2019d visit for two million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we know you can be bought.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s grin never faded. \u201cEvery man has a price. Every woman, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine\u2019s only a million,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d He pointed at Francesca.</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cShe has principles.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s gaze settled on Francesca\u2019s face. \u201cMoney\u2019s a whole lot more dependable. Speaking of which...\u201d He slapped a twenty on the table. \u201cI have to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut to kill and maim?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s just how I spend my day.\u201d</p><p>They all rose. Francesca scribbled the house number on a piece of paper. \u201cPlease call.\u201d</p><p>He took the number and stared at it. \u201cSure.\u201d He studied them both. \u201cNice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Joe,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>He turned and walked away.</p><p>Francesca watched him go. \u201cHe\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. The hell of it is, I sort of like him. Except for him wanting the money, which I don\u2019t like but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Think he\u2019ll call?\u201d</p><p>Brenna picked up her purse. \u201cIn a heartbeat. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca touched her arm. \u201cI know you\u2019re not okay. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Brenna blinked several times. A single tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll get over it. Just give me a few days. I need to come up with a plan or something.\u201d</p><p>Getting over the possibility of losing everything she\u2019d ever wanted? Francesca knew it was going to take a whole lot longer than a few days.</p><p>\u201cIt was so cool, Gabriel,\u201d Kelly breathed as she sat on her great-grandfather\u2019s desk and clutched a can of soda. \u201cThere were these terrorists and they had hostages and we caught them and everything. I had a sixty percent kill rate.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glanced at Jason. \u201cAre you sure Sam is going to approve of this?\u201d</p><p>The large man shrugged. \u201cShe had fun. She\u2019s good, too. Must be in the genes.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re turning into a Daddy\u2019s girl, huh?\u201d</p><p>Kelly had never had a father before, so she wasn\u2019t sure what was involved with being a Daddy\u2019s girl, but she liked the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had a good time,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>His phone rang. As he picked up the receiver, Kelly slid off the desk. She started to leave the office, but before she could go, he waved her back. When she stepped close, he put his arm around her, pulled her close, and kissed her forehead.</p><p>Kelly walked out into the hallway. Wow. Gabriel had just acted like he really liked her. That had to be good, right?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have planned for the rest of the afternoon?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m staying here until my dad\u2019s ready to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you come with me. I have to run an errand, and I could use some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into Sam\u2019s office. Her dad was on the phone, too. She thought security was about being a bodyguard, but a bunch of it was just talking on the phone.</p><p>Jason made an unlocking motion. Sam reached into the top of his desk and drew out a key attached to a bright blue key ring. A plastic disk hanging down was printed with the words SECURE FILE.</p><p>Jason led the way into the supply room. He unlocked the file cabinet with the key. Inside were various forms along with a small metal box.</p><p>Jason motioned to the paperwork. \u201cTop secret,\u201d he said in a low voice, then opened the box. Inside were a stack of bills. He took several twenties and closed the box.</p><p>\u201cYou keep cash around here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. There\u2019s always an emergency stash in case someone has to leave the country and the bank\u2019s not open. Plus there\u2019s petty cash for things like birthday parties.\u201d</p><p>He paused expectantly.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWho\u2019s having a birthday?\u201d</p><p>Jason locked the cabinet, then put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cYour dad, Kelly. His birthday\u2019s in a week. I\u2019d like you to help me pick out a cake. We have to choose the lunch menu, too. We\u2019re having food brought in. Sam hates the fuss, which is one of the reasons I like to do it.\u201d</p><p>Jason was grinning and Kelly tried to smile back at him, but inside she felt kind of weird. It was her dad\u2019s birthday and she hadn\u2019t known. What if she\u2019d missed it? He would get really mad.</p><p>She would have to get him a really cool present, she thought as she followed Jason out of the building. But what? And how? He\u2019d canceled her credit card, and she didn\u2019t have any money. She would have to think of something and soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam turned out of the parking lot. He felt pleased about the afternoon. Kelly had seemed to enjoy herself in the office. Jason had taken care of her for much of the time, and he\u2019d only had good things to say about her behavior. Maybe Teen-zilla was gone for good.</p><p>As he waited at a signal, he glanced at Kelly. While he could see Tanya in her, he also saw his grandmother. Yet much of Kelly was uniquely herself.</p><p>\u201cHow about Italian for dinner?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe could go back to that place by the beach.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She faced him. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s just\u2014you need to give me an allowance, okay? I mean, I\u2019m twelve. I\u2019ve more than proved I know how to handle money. I\u2019ve had my own credit card for years. But you took that away from me. I need to have some cash to buy stuff.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was an odd combination of pleading and defiant. He turned his attention back to the road. When the signal turned green, he stepped on the gas.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need money for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter? Do I need to give you a list?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d An allowance. While he didn\u2019t agree that her having her own credit card meant that she was capable of handling money, he knew she would need to learn. An allowance might accomplish that. But how much? And how often? Should he tie it to chores or just give it to her?</p><p>Too many questions, he thought as his head began to pound. \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d</p><p>She rounded on him. \u201cYou are so mean. How can you not say yes? You don\u2019t give me anything I want. Not ever. How many things have I asked for lately?\u201d</p><p>She continued to rant. When they pulled into the driveway, all he could think about was that he\u2019d been too hasty when he\u2019d assumed she\u2019d morphed into a normal child. Apparently raging Teen-zilla still lurked just under the surface.</p><p>\u201cKelly come out of your room right now!\u201d Sam yelled through the closed and locked door.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. Go to work and leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>Leave her alone? Not likely. He glanced at his watch and groaned. He had a nine o\u2019clock meeting with clients who had flown in from Brazil. Kelly had been in a temper all the previous evening, still upset about the allowance discussion, but he\u2019d expected her to be over it by morning. Obviously, he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Their relationship could definitely be defined as two steps forward, two and a half steps back. He wished he could find a way to get through to her so they could communicate like rational people. Between her being a teenager and him being a clueless father, that wasn\u2019t likely.</p><p>\u201cKelly, I know you\u2019re angry, but sulking isn\u2019t going to change my mind. If you don\u2019t get out here right now, you\u2019re not going to ballet class for the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>He heard something that sounded like a sob. \u201cF-fine,\u201d she told him, her voice thick with tears. \u201cJust leave me here. Okay? Just go away.\u201d</p><p>While her temper got on his nerves, her tears made him nervous. \u201cKelly, dammit, tell me what\u2019s going on. Are you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She sniffed. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that. I can\u2019t tell you. Just stop asking me, okay?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t okay. He rattled the door handle. He knew with a screwdriver and thirty seconds, he could have the door open, but something inside told him that wasn\u2019t the best way to handle the situation.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t talk to me, will you talk to someone else?\u201d he asked. \u201cGabriel or Francesca?\u201d</p> <p>He heard Kelly crying. Then there was silence and finally she said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Francesca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get her on the phone, then you pick up.\u201d</p><p>He practically ran to his bedroom, where he dialed the number from memory.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Sam. I\u2019m sorry to bother you so early. I know you wanted to work until you have to pick up Kelly after class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. Kelly won\u2019t come out of her room, and she won\u2019t tell me why. But she agreed to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cOh, Sam, I thought things were getting better with you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. Obviously they\u2019re not. Can you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He hurried back to Kelly\u2019s room and knocked on the door. \u201cFrancesca\u2019s on the line. You can pick up.\u201d</p><p>He heard a click, then Kelly\u2019s voice. \u201cSam, hang up now. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then did as she requested.</p><p>As he paced the hall, he heard murmured conversation. Three minutes later the phone rang. He grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t sound frantic. She\u2019s fine. I promised not to tell you what\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t freak out about that. I\u2019m coming over now and she and I are going to talk, and then I\u2019ll call you at work and tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, you\u2019re going to have to trust me on this. Just go to work and I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Trust her. He relaxed. That was one thing he could do. \u201cPlease call before noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThanks, Francesca. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Bye.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to work,\u201d he called through the door. \u201cFrancesca will be here shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Everything is fine now, Sam. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He heard the relief in Kelly\u2019s voice. The tears seemed to have disappeared. Somehow Francesca had worked a miracle in just a few minutes. Damn, she was good. Better than good.</p><p>He\u2019d long ago learned that women lied to get what they wanted, that they couldn\u2019t be trusted under any circumstances. But Francesca wasn\u2019t like that. She was honest, straightforward, and she would never manipulate him. He could trust her. And he did.</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cT his is just too gross,\u201d Kelly said as she came out of her bathroom and flopped on the bed.</p><p>Francesca thought about pointing out she would get used to the process over the next thirty or forty years, then decided that was too depressing to consider. Better to focus on the positive.</p><p>\u201cAt least you know you\u2019re growing up.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at her and smiled. \u201cI kind of already knew that was happening.\u201d She winced slightly and pressed a hand to her stomach. \u201cHow long does it take for the pain to go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a half hour or so.\u201d She pointed to the hot pad she\u2019d brought along. \u201cTry that. It really helps.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pulled the flannel-covered square over her midsection, then picked up the control and hit the On button.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was gaining weight or something,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been kind of puffy for the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood old bloat. It happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with cramps and that disgusting bleeding. Who thought that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the flow of life, if you\u2019ll excuse the pun.\u201d</p><p>Kelly wrinkled her nose. \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>Francesca lay down next to her. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. Her lower lip trembled slightly. \u201cI knew all about it and stuff. My mom had said a few things, and we\u2019d talked about it in school, but hearing about it and seeing blood are not the same thing. For a second I thought I was dying. Then I remembered, but I couldn\u2019t tell my dad and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Francesca stroked her bright red curls. \u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it easy today. Just relax and hang out. Tomorrow, if you feel up to it, you can go to class. In the afternoon I\u2019ll need to stop by my adviser\u2019s office for about a half hour. Otherwise, I have no plans for the week.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled. \u201cI like the idea of hanging out today. Maybe we can use the DVD player in the family room, seeing as I don\u2019t have one up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. How sad. Imagine having to go through life without your very own DVD player. Maybe you could write UNICEF and ask for one. Oh, wait. They\u2019re busy feeding starving children in poor countries.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swatted away her hand. \u201cI get it. I\u2019m a spoiled brat who doesn\u2019t appreciate all she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stop complaining about the DVD player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I were you.\u201d Francesca sat up. \u201cI have to call your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! I don\u2019t want him knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be a surprise to him. Sam\u2019s been around women before, and he completely understands the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s my dad. Telling him is completely sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting your period is a natural part of life. Kelly, he has to know what had you upset this morning.\u201d</p><p>The preteen sighed heavily. \u201cAll right, but I don\u2019t want to talk to him about it. Ever. I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Why don\u2019t you sort through your movie collection, and I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Francesca had to wait on hold for a couple of minutes, then she heard Sam\u2019s chocolate-on-velvet voice.</p><p>\u201cSo what was the crisis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly got her period. It was her first one and it freaked her out, which is completely understandable. Plus, she wasn\u2019t prepared with supplies, and she was too embarrassed to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was it?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cHer period?\u201d</p><p>Francesca frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. Girls have a lot of ambivalence about the whole concept of growing up. This is physical proof things are never going to be the same again. Plus, it\u2019s not like a guy\u2019s first wet dream. There\u2019s no pleasure and usually a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. She can\u2019t hide out every time she has a problem. Look, I\u2019m in a meeting and I have to get back to it. Thanks for letting me know what\u2019s up. I\u2019ll deal with it when I get home tonight. Bye.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Francesca stared at the phone. \u201cWhatever?\u201d she repeated, more than a little outraged. \u201cThat\u2019s your entire response to this incredibly significant event in your daughter\u2019s life? And now you\u2019re going to deal with it? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Kelly walked into the kitchen. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Francesca set down the phone and smiled. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she lied cheerfully. There was no point in upsetting Kelly. Not when the poor kid wasn\u2019t feeling well. Francesca would make sure to corner Sam before he could talk to Kelly. Somehow she would make him see that he had to give his daughter a break and show a little more sensitivity.</p><p>Sam could feel another headache coming on. They were a regular occurrence ever since Kelly had appeared in his life. He ignored the wine rack on the counter and went right to the hard stuff. After collecting a glass, he headed for the wet bar and opened a bottle of single malt scotch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Sam,\u201d Francesca said as she followed him. \u201cYou are completely in the wrong. This is a female thing and you can\u2019t possibly understand. You\u2019re going to have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>He drank half the contents of his glass in two swallows. The liquid burned its way to his belly.</p><p>\u201cShe could have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she couldn\u2019t. She was embarrassed and scared. You try waking up to blood everywhere and we\u2019ll see how you react.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t comfortable with the visual image, so he ignored it. \u201cShe locked me out of her room, she wouldn\u2019t come out, and she wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stranger. It\u2019s been what\u2014a month? That\u2019s not enough time to get to know each other.\u201d She leaned against the bar. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even decided if you like having her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t,\u201d Sam admitted. He crossed to the sofa and sat down. \u201cSometimes...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Francesca perched on the edge of the club chair and leaned toward him. \u201cGive her a break on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was wrong to lock me out of her room. This weekend I\u2019m taking the lock out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but don\u2019t be in a snit when you do it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cWhy are you taking her side? I thought you were on my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a neutral third party.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cFrancesca, I\u2019ve had a hell of a day. I have clients in from out of town, I was worried about Kelly all morning only to find out she\u2019d fussed about nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing to her.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cI just want to spend a quiet evening. No fighting, no misunderstandings, no lectures. Is that too much to ask? We could order in, you could stay for dinner, then for breakfast.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the entire point. Kelly had a hard day, too. She needs to be cuddled and pampered. She needs to feel special. She needs you to understand. Right now she has to be the most important thing in your life.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the rest of his drink. \u201cWhy the hell not? She\u2019s ruining it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Francesca rose and glared at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d</p><p>His guilt was faster than her accusation. \u201cI know. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d He hadn\u2019t. It was just he didn\u2019t understand Kelly. Every time he thought he had her figured out, he found out he couldn\u2019t be more wrong. He cared about her; he just wished she wasn\u2019t so frustrating.</p> <p>\u201cGet to know her, Sam. Make some effort to spend some time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. You don\u2019t understand her, and that\u2019s why this isn\u2019t going smoothly. You\u2019re the adult in the relationship. Maybe you should act like it.\u201d</p><p>With that, she turned and walked out of the room. Seconds later the front door slammed.</p><p>Sam leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes. Looked like he wouldn\u2019t be getting any tonight. His morning had started badly, and his evening wasn\u2019t showing signs of improvement.</p><p>He heard a noise from upstairs. Kelly.</p><p>Get to know her, Francesca had said. He was. Sort of. He\u2019d taken her to work the previous day. Okay, she\u2019d spent most of her time with Jason, but still...</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered and set down his glass. Francesca was right. Again.</p> <p>He walked upstairs and knocked on Kelly\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called.</p><p>He opened the door and found her curled up on her bed, reading.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She eyed him warily. \u201cFine. I know Francesca told you and everything, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>Great. That was helpful. He thought about what he used to do with his grandfather when he\u2019d been Kelly\u2019s age and it had been a cold, rainy day. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cEver play chess?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cCould you be more boring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Because if you were to win a game, I\u2019d get you a DVD player.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay, kid.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the book. \u201cJust one game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all it would take.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled off the bed. \u201cShow me the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell him, Francesca.\u201d</p><p>Francesca curled up on her small sofa and watched her mother pace the length of her living room.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Her mother stopped and faced her. \u201cYour grandfather has already started threatening to contact Sam himself. You don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d</p><p>Francesca had to agree. Having Sam told about the baby and threatened in the same sentence would probably send him into heart failure.</p><p>\u201cLorenzo is expecting an engagement out of all this.\u201d</p><p>Francesca straightened and set her feet on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not his decision to make.\u201d</p><p>Her mother walked to the sofa and sat next to her. \u201cDon\u2019t you love Sam?\u201d</p><p>Admitting to her mother that she\u2019d slept with a man she didn\u2019t love wasn\u2019t her idea of a good time. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Not exactly. She hadn\u2019t loved him at first. But now... now she was pregnant, confused, and a liar.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam isn\u2019t the marrying kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they fall in love, they all are.\u201d</p><p>But that was the thing. Sam didn\u2019t love her, and she... well, she didn\u2019t know what she felt about him. Was wanting to be with him all the time love? Was adoring him and his daughter and imaging a future together enough?</p><p>\u201cWe both agreed the relationship would be casual,\u201d she said at last and held her breath.</p><p>Her mother only looked mildly disapproving. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t want to be married,\u201d Francesca blurted out, then groaned. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t use to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Todd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly. Because I was never sure of myself.\u201d She thought of the conversation she\u2019d had with Brenna last week. About it being time to let go of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt capable before. Confident. Growing up, I was the stupid Marcelli sister. With Todd, I was arm candy. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think if you love a man you\u2019re going to lose yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>Now everything in her life was a mess. Sam, Kelly, the pregnancy. \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her mother cupped her chin and looked into her eyes. \u201cFrancesca, whatever you and Sam decide about your future, he must know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday. No matter what. The new nanny starts Monday. Friday is the last day I have Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t wait any longer. You weren\u2019t raised to be a deceptive person.\u201d</p><p>Francesca winced. The statement was perilously close to the \u201cI raised you better than this\u201d complaint that always made her feel about six years old.</p><p>Her mother dropped her hand to her lap. \u201cOne more thing. Whatever you do about Sam, do it because it\u2019s what you want, not because of what other people say. Not even me.\u201d</p><p>Francesca knew she was thinking about her decision to give up Joe for adoption. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise, Francesca. Promise to follow your heart. Even if you\u2019re afraid. There is no greater regret in life than not having tried. Believe me. I\u2019ve lived with that one for thirty years.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hugged her mother close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Not yet. I\u2019ll hold off your grandfather until Friday, but no longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Although she had no idea what she was going to say. Telling Sam about the baby was one thing, but telling him about her heart... she wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted. Somehow life without him didn\u2019t seem as appealing as it once had. She liked being with him, talking to him. She liked Kelly. But Sam was a man who didn\u2019t forgive lies. Would he understand why she\u2019d waited to tell him about the baby, or would he see her as little more than yet another woman who had set out to deceive him?</p><p>Francesca\u2019s second unexpected visitor arrived shortly after nine the following morning. She opened the door to find Sam standing there.</p><p>He wore one of his power suits and looked good enough to appear in a calendar. Her heart gave a little flutter, her chest tightened, and her thighs went up in flames. If she didn\u2019t know better, she would think she had malaria. Or that she\u2019d fallen in love.</p><p>She stepped back to let him into her apartment, then closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou were really mad at me last night,\u201d he said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands into his pockets and rocked back on his heels. \u201cSo I was wondering if you were still going to pick Kelly up from her dance class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Then she got it. \u201cJust because you and I were fighting doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to duck out of my responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You were right.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly, her getting her period. That I didn\u2019t get it. I see now that it\u2019s a big deal for girls.\u201d</p><p>Francesca felt more amused than vindicated. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading your teenage parenting books.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He straightened. \u201cKelly and I had a long talk last night. About her life here, and how things are different. About getting to know each other better. We\u2019re each going to write down a list of our expectations and how we\u2019d like the family to run. Then we\u2019re going to talk about them and negotiate. We\u2019ve set up a meeting for Saturday morning. Kelly suggested you be there to mediate and I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Francesca told him honestly. She was thrilled that Sam was willing to meet his daughter halfway and get to know her. She was touched that they both wanted her to be a part of the family meeting. She was terrified to think how things could be between them, come Saturday.</p><p>\u201cAs Kelly pointed out last night, you\u2019re as much a part of the family as either of us. Maybe not by blood, but certainly by time and effort.\u201d</p><p>She desperately wanted to agree, but didn\u2019t feel she had the right.</p><p>He pulled his hands out of his pockets and moved closer. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t what we agreed to,\u201d he murmured as he brushed her mouth with his. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more messy and complicated, but is that such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI d-don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible for her to be rational while he was kissing her. Her mind went fuzzy, her body surrendered, and all she wanted was to take Sam to bed.</p><p>He nipped her lower lip. \u201cWell, think about it,\u201d he said as he released her and moved toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone. Francesca leaned against the wall and closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t mind messy or complicated. Not if things turned out well in the end. But would they? Time was ticking. Come Friday, where would she and Sam be?</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Francesca asked that afternoon as she and Kelly drove away from the ballet school.</p><p>\u201cBetter. No cramps, but the bleeding is still too incredibly gross for words. Oh, and I\u2019m not bloated anymore, so that\u2019s something.\u201d Kelly pulled out the pins holding her hair back and fluffed her curls. \u201cYou said you had to see your adviser this afternoon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If it\u2019s okay with you, I thought we\u2019d stop and see her first, then head out to a caf\u00e9 I know by the beach afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>They chatted about movies and fall fashions until Francesca drove onto the university grounds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really big,\u201d Kelly said, looking around.</p><p>\u201cHave you been on campus before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know it would be so pretty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca pointed out several buildings, then parked close to the psychology labs. \u201cMy adviser has an office in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to see anything icky, are we?\u201d Kelly asked as she climbed out of the car. \u201cNo cats with wires in their heads or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d Francesca said as she stepped onto the pavement. \u201cWe torture people here. Not animals.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly grinned. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>They walked along the pathway toward the double doors.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do here?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cYou\u2019re like still in college, but how is grad school different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d Francesca explained. \u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. It takes like four years, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup. After that people can come back for more education. I\u2019m in program where I\u2019ll get both a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. In fact, I\u2019m supposed to be writing the paper for my master\u2019s right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turn it in and get a grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Francesca said, leading the way down the long corridor. \u201cBut there\u2019s a little more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>She briefly explained about research projects, committee approval, distilling data, and coming up with a topic.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou could be going to school forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. I plan to have a life of my own eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have to be willing to make a big commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Some people have trouble with that, but getting my Ph.D. is really important to me. When you want to be good at something, you have to be willing to work hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my dance,\u201d Kelly said as they climbed the stairs to the second floor.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the end of the hallway, then entered the main lab. A reception area fronted several observation rooms. The offices were on the left.</p><p>An older woman sat behind the front desk. She smiled when she saw Francesca.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding us,\u201d Marg Overton said with a grin. \u201cI want to think you\u2019ve been home typing your fingers to the bone, but somehow I doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d Francesca agreed. \u201cMarge, this is Kelly. Kelly, Marg. While there\u2019s a department head in charge, Marg actually runs this place. We\u2019d be lost without her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you would,\u201d Marg agreed.</p><p>Kelly smiled shyly and said, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on today? Any interesting work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan is working on his association game with some four-year-olds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She turned to Kelly. \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy watching that. I\u2019ll get you settled before I head to my meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later Kelly sat next to a red-haired grad student in the observation room. Dan pulled out his computer-generated graphs and began explaining them to Kelly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twelve, Dan. Don\u2019t get into the calculus,\u201d Francesca said as she walked to the door. \u201cKelly, if he starts to bore you to death, I\u2019ll be in the first office on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Francesca chuckled. Dan would probably be talking in techno-jargon in about thirty seconds, but he was a good guy with a real dedication to children.</p><p>She crossed to the first office on the left and tapped on the open door.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca,\u201d her adviser said. \u201cYou finally remembered where to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d Francesca walked in and settled in front of Emily\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ve finished my outline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Her adviser, an attractive woman in her forties, picked up the papers Francesca held out. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you that you can\u2019t spend all your time tormenting innocent bystanders, but I wasn\u2019t sure you were listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always listen to what you say.\u201d</p><p>Emily smiled. \u201cIf only that were true.\u201d She drew on her glasses and pushed her dark hair off her forehead. \u201cAll right. What have we got here?\u201d</p><p>One of the four-year-olds picked up a kid-sized chair and threw it at the boy across from him. Kelly\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cAre they supposed to do that?\u201d she asked, pointing at the second boy, who promptly hit the first. They both burst into tears.</p><p>Dan muttered something under his breath and raced out of the observation room. Kelly wasn\u2019t exactly sorry to see him go. Some of his theories were interesting and stuff, but he\u2019d gotten way too technical. At first she\u2019d been insulted that Francesca had said she was only twelve, but after ten minutes of listening to Dan, she understood why.</p><p>She stood and strolled out of the room, back into the hallway. Francesca had said she would be about a half hour and that time was nearly up. She spied a chair by the office Francesca had told her she would be in and plopped down to wait.</p><p>She and her dad were supposed to play chess again that night. Last night Kelly had barely figured out how the different pieces moved. She knew now that she\u2019d been tricked. It would be years before she was good enough to beat her dad and win that DVD player, but that didn\u2019t bother her at all. He\u2019d known what he was getting into when he made the offer. Maybe he was planning on keeping her around for a while. While he was kind of a stick in the mud about some things and annoying, he wasn\u2019t really so bad. He was\u2014</p><p>Kelly jumped as she realized she could hear what was being said in the office. She leaned back against the frosted glass window so the words would be more clear, then stiffened when she heard her own name.</p><p>\u201cKelly is the daughter of a friend of mine,\u201d Francesca was saying. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful dancer and takes classes all the time. We\u2019re hanging out together this week. It\u2019s been lots of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a great mini-vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Kelly is really easy to be with. Basically a great kid.\u201d</p><p>While Kelly didn\u2019t appreciate the \u201ckid\u201d remark, Francesca\u2019s words made her feel good.</p><p>\u201cI saw you two walk in,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cShe has beautiful hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She hates the curls, but I think they\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>The other woman laughed. \u201cI tried to get a perm that would do what her hair does naturally. Eighty dollars and three hours later, I looked like a badly cut poodle. It was very disheartening.\u201d</p><p>Kelly bit back a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe also has the most adorable freckles,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cI think they\u2019re charming. Ah, to be that young and pretty. When I watch her dancing, I feel like an old crone by comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, by comparison, you are an old crone.\u201d</p><p>Francesca laughed. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stood up and quickly walked to the far end of the hall. Her face burned and her stomach was all jumpy. Every time she\u2019d overheard her mother talking about her\u2014which wasn\u2019t very often because only a few friends even knew she existed\u2014Tanya said mean stuff. Nothing like this.</p><p>Francesca thought she was pretty. Francesca liked her. If Francesca and Sam got together, then Kelly might never have to worry about being sent away.</p><p>She thought about how her mother had always hidden her and ignored her. Francesca would never do that. She would never leave her child. She would never forget birthdays, or say things that hurt Kelly\u2019s feelings. She knew a lot of her friends had stepparents, and while some of them were okay, others were really awful. What if her dad started seeing someone else?</p><p>That couldn\u2019t happen, she told herself. Francesca was exactly who she and her dad needed in their lives. Somehow she would find a way to bring them together.</p><p>18</p><p>W ednesday morning Sam adjusted his tie, then stepped back into his closet to collect his cell phone, wallet, and jacket. He had another meeting with the Brazilian clients, then a working lunch with his office manager. A local business association wanted to sponsor a mini film festival the following summer and had asked Sam to meet with them to discuss security.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. Francesca was going to be taking Kelly to dance class that morning, so he could get into the office early and get a head start on his day. Without her, he couldn\u2019t possibly get everything done. She was\u2014</p><p>He reached for his wallet, but instead of grabbing it, he accidentally knocked it onto the floor, where it fell open. As he bent to pick it up, he noticed a strip of silver. Anger exploded.</p><p>\u201cDamn her hide,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Straightening, he examined the platinum credit card. It was right where it was supposed to be. Right where it hadn\u2019t been the afternoon before when he\u2019d stopped and gotten gas.</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d he roared as he walked out into the hallway.</p><p>His daughter poked her head out of her bedroom. She was already dressed for her dance class. Her hair was a mass of curls, and she held a white ribbon in one hand.</p><p>\u201cStop yelling,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m right here. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She was so casual about it all, he thought, fighting the need to put his fist through the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou took my credit card,\u201d he said, his teeth clenched.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She sounded concerned and baffled, as if she had no idea what he meant. But he\u2019d known her long enough to recognize the slight tension in her thin shoulders and the stubborn set of her chin.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I noticed my Visa card was missing from my wallet. This morning it\u2019s back where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cRight. So you want to blame me. Maybe you misplaced it or didn\u2019t see it when you looked before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t there. So I called and canceled it last night. Funny how there had only been one charge on it. To a clothing store on the Internet.\u201d He narrowed his gaze. \u201cI canceled the order, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThat is just so typical. You want to ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d caught her stealing, and he expected her to go on the attack, but he was still stunned by her blaming him for stopping the order.</p><p>\u201cYou stole from me!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou stole from me, too,\u201d she said as she stepped into the hall and glared at him. \u201cYou had no right to take away my old credit card. I wasn\u2019t doing anything bad with it. And I wasn\u2019t doing anything bad this time, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were stealing. Maybe that\u2019s okay in New York, but it\u2019s damn wrong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked for an allowance, and you said you\u2019d think about it. You haven\u2019t said anything since, and I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is my fault? What is wrong with you? If you\u2019re grown-up enough to steal, why aren\u2019t you grown-up enough to take responsibility for what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only twelve. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter behavior than this. You\u2019re grounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s news.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cSo you really like being a bully, don\u2019t you. When you were little, did you beat up on the smaller kids?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to get more angry, but he\u2019d been wrong. \u201cDo not make this about me, young lady. You are the one who stole from me. I can see I\u2019m going to have to start locking up my money and credit cards, which is a pretty sorry state of affairs around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lock me up, too?\u201d she taunted. \u201cIt\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could just be me, but from where I\u2019m standing, it sounds like both of you need to take a deep breath and calm down,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Sam turned and saw her leaning against the railing by the stairs. Relief flooded him. At least she would know what to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere between the opening shot and the last salvo,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glared at her. \u201cHe\u2019s a hundred percent wrong. Don\u2019t you dare take his side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak to her in that tone of voice,\u201d Sam ordered.</p><p>Kelly huffed. Sam glared. Francesca had the feeling she should have slept in and avoided the whole fight. But now she was here, stuck in the middle of what could be a sticky situation. Because as much as Sam had the right to be furious with his daughter, there was one piece of the puzzle missing. Why had Kelly taken the credit card?</p><p>In the past few weeks her stuff had arrived from New York, she\u2019d been to the mall to flesh out her wardrobe, and from what Francesca had been able to tell, she was adjusting well and pretty happy. So why would she risk her father\u2019s wrath and steal his credit card?</p><p>She turned to Sam. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>He recounted going to get gas the previous afternoon, finding his credit card missing, and then calling to cancel it.</p> <p>\u201cThere had only been one charge that day,\u201d he said. \u201cTo an Internet clothing company.\u201d He glared at his daughter. \u201cWe all know how Kelly likes to shop with a keyboard.\u201d</p><p>Francesca ignored the sarcasm. \u201cOkay, Kelly, let\u2019s hear it. Did you take the credit card?\u201d</p><p>Sam started to say of course she had, but Francesca held up a restraining hand. \u201cPlease let her answer.\u201d</p><p>The preteen sighed heavily. She ducked her head so her curls fell in her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Francesca ignored him. \u201cKelly, are you going to answer the question?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly raised her head and thrust out her chin. \u201cOkay, I took it, but it\u2019s not what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>Francesca studied the girl\u2019s green eyes, seeing the shadows of pain and fear. This hadn\u2019t been an act of defiance, she realized. It was something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cWhat I think is that you took it and used it without permission,\u201d Sam said, still sounding furious. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to be punished.\u201d</p><p>Francesca agreed that no reason was good enough to avoid all consequences, but she still wanted to know one more thing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam turned to her. \u201cWhat does it matter why? She wanted more clothes. More whatever she doesn\u2019t think she has enough of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid!\u201d Kelly yelled. \u201cYou think you know everything, but you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cKelly, you know better than to speak like that. Calling an adult stupid is never a good idea. You\u2019re making your father more angry, and you\u2019re using up your good-will with me.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s mouth trembled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Just punish me. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She cared so much, it hurt Francesca just to look at her. \u201cTell us why, please.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sucked in a breath and faced her father. \u201cIt was a leather jacket for you,\u201d she said, her voice high and shrill. \u201cFor your damn birthday, okay? I asked for an allowance and you blew me off. You didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. Your birthday is next week, so what was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cDon\u2019t you swear at me, young lady. You\u2019re already in enough trouble.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly fell over. All he\u2019d gotten from Kelly\u2019s confession was that she\u2019d used a bad word? What about the fact that she wanted to get him something for his birthday? The means might suck big time, but the motive was pure.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s mouth trembled. Francesca knew exactly what she was thinking. That she\u2019d tried to show she cared, that her father mattered to her, and he\u2019d thrown it back in her face.</p><p>Without saying a word, she turned and raced into her bedroom. The door slammed and the lock clicked.</p><p>Sam groaned. \u201cGreat. I was waiting until the weekend before taking out her lock. I can see I should have done it last night.\u201d</p><p>He headed for his bedroom. Francesca hesitated, not sure who to go after first, then she remembered Sam would be leaving for work in a matter of minutes while Kelly would be around all day.</p><p>\u201cSam, wait,\u201d she called as she hurried after him. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave yet.\u201d</p><p>She found him in the closet, slipping into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cI have out-of-town clients,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will have to wait. I don\u2019t want Kelly to go to dance class today. I don\u2019t want her going anywhere. She should stay in her room and think about what she\u2019s done wrong. We\u2019ll talk about it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and she may talk about it tonight, but you and I are going to talk about it right now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cFrancesca, I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better make time.\u201d She faced him. \u201cSam, you\u2019re wrong about this. I don\u2019t approve of what Kelly did. There\u2019s no excuse for her taking your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re in agreement.\u201d He picked up his briefcase and stepped around her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grabbed his arm. \u201cShe bought you a birthday present. She found out it was your birthday and wanted to get you something really nice. Doesn\u2019t that matter to you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe could have made me a card or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twelve, not five. She asked for an allowance first, so she was willing to use legitimate means to get you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA leather jacket?\u201d he asked, sounding incredulous. \u201cWe\u2019re talking a lot of money. I don\u2019t know the going rate for an allowance for someone her age, but it better not be enough for her to buy a leather jacket in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. But can\u2019t you see she\u2019s trying to show you she cares? That you matter? That she wants you to be a family together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that, but you\u2019re missing the fact that she lied and stole.\u201d He drew his eyebrows together. \u201cI can forgive a lot of things, Francesca, but not deception.\u201d</p><p>Francesca swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m not defending her actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow strange. Because that\u2019s exactly what it sounds like to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left.</p><p>Francesca walked to the top of the stairs and sat down. She felt queasy, but didn\u2019t think this was the onset of morning sickness. Instead it was a combination of fear and guilt. If Sam got this angry when Kelly acted out, what would happen when he found out the truth about her little secret?</p><p>She told herself she had two days left before the big confession. If things could just stay calm between now and then, maybe he would relax enough to understand. Of course, it could start raining silver coins in the morning, too.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she sat there, trying to find the right combination of words to explain it all to Sam. At some point she heard a door open, then quiet footsteps on the carpeted landing. Kelly settled next to her on the top stair.</p><p>The twelve-year-old pulled her knees to her chest and wrapped her arms around her legs. \u201cI really blew it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Francesca nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s as good a definition as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t think it through. I found out it was his birthday, and when he wouldn\u2019t give me an allowance, I panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me for a loan.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked at her. Tears filled her green eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any money. I was afraid you\u2019d say yes when you couldn\u2019t afford it, and then you\u2019d have to go without food or something.\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t know if she should laugh or cry. Instead she put her arm around the girl and hugged her. \u201cI might be a struggling grad student, but I have enough for the basic necessities. Besides, the Grands always send me home with enough food to take care of the entire population of Baltimore.\u201d She leaned her head against Kelly\u2019s. \u201cBut it was sweet of you to worry.\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned toward her and held on tight. \u201cHe said he canceled the order. That means I don\u2019t have a present for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, kid, I think that\u2019s the least of your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted to get him something nice. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m going to be here for his birthday.\u201d</p><p>Francesca heard the intensity in her voice and remembered feeling every emotion, every nuance when she\u2019d been the same age. Life was so much more raw.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but do you know why your dad got so mad?\u201d</p><p>Kelly ducked her head and nodded. \u201cI took his credit card and that was wrong. And maybe stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>Kelly gave a strangled laugh-sob and looked up. \u201cOkay. It was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re making progress. Now do you want to tell me what you could have done instead of just going for the plastic?\u201d</p><p>Kelly sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. You\u2019re a smart girl. What other alternatives did you have?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a second, then straightened and rubbed her fingers across her damp cheeks. \u201cI could have talked to you. Or Gabriel. I sort of forgot about him. He might have loaned me the money and maybe even taken me shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked at her. \u201cYou want me to say I could have told my dad why I wanted the money, but that would have spoiled the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it would have been honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing honest is more important?\u201d</p><p>Francesca felt as if there were a scarlet H on her chest. Talk about being a hypocrite. \u201cI think so, and I suspect your dad thinks so. He has this thing about people lying to him.\u201d</p><p>Kelly flinched. \u201cHe was so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to apologize to him when he gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. He was wrong, too.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t make you, but I\u2019m going to tell you a secret. Things will never be right with your dad until you say you\u2019re sorry, and the longer you wait, the harder it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked doubtful. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI guess we\u2019re not going to dance class this morning, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll never be a professional dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s concentrate on getting you all the way to age thirteen first. Then we\u2019ll sweat your career of choice.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled, then threw herself at Francesca. \u201cThank you for understanding. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>Francesca hugged her close. Kelly and Sam both had a lot of tough times ahead of them, but she knew they would be okay in the end. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to be a part of this family? To watch the evolution of the relationship between father and daughter? She found herself wanting that chance more and more.</p><p>Sam walked into the house shortly after six. He found Francesca putting cooked chicken and a sauce onto dinner plates.</p><p>\u201cChicken Marsala,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom stopped by to see me last night and brought along enough to feed ten or twelve. I thought I\u2019d share the bounty.\u201d</p><p>He set his briefcase on the counter. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking at him as she spoke. He had a feeling she was still annoyed.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you that I think I should have listened to you, will it make things better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I need to take a deep breath before I react. Maybe listen more.\u201d</p><p>She stopped working and glanced at him. \u201cWant to share the details of that thought process that got you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mad this morning. Too mad to think clearly. What Kelly did is inexcusable, but you\u2019re right. Her motives put a different light on the situation.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cNot that I\u2019m saying she shouldn\u2019t be punished.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sounds more reasonable than what you were saying this morning.\u201d</p><p>Francesca set down the pan of chicken. He took that as a sign of forgiveness and moved toward her. She melted into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I need you,\u201d he said as he stared into her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re talking gratitude?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cSome, but it\u2019s more than that.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cYou\u2019re very important to me.\u201d</p><p>More than important, Sam thought. Vital.</p><p>He was about to tell her just how vital when she stepped free of his embrace. \u201cYou should probably head upstairs and put your daughter out of her misery. She\u2019s convinced her punishment is going to include being banished to a small cot outside and surviving on little more than leaves and tree bark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking along the lines of no TV for a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that will be a relief.\u201d She gave him a little push toward the door. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll get dinner ready, then I need to head home.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been about to ask her to spend the night, but if she didn\u2019t want to...</p><p>Sam headed out of the kitchen. He wanted to clear things up with Kelly, but as he climbed the stairs, he couldn\u2019t help thinking there was something going on with Francesca. It was almost as if she\u2019d known he wanted to talk about their relationship, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to have the conversation. Which made him wonder why. Was all this too much for her?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that. Losing her would be a disaster. Not just because of Kelly, but because of how much he\u2019d grown to care about her. He needed her. He trusted her.</p><p>He came to a stop at the top of the landing. Need. Trust. Desire. Longing. Well, hell. Somehow, when he hadn\u2019t been paying attention, he\u2019d gone and fallen in love.</p><p>Still stunned by the revelation, he crossed to Kelly\u2019s room. When he opened the door, she looked at him. He could see the fear and regret in her eyes.</p> <p>Neither of them spoke. He wasn\u2019t sure what her reasons were. His were about not wanting to get it wrong. Finally he held out his arms. She raced toward him and flung herself into his embrace.</p><p>He held her close. \u201cOne of these days we\u2019ll get it right,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThink it will happen soon?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cYou know you\u2019re still in trouble.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled close. \u201cI know. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Funny how suddenly it was.</p><p>19</p><p>K elly watched herself in the floor-to-ceiling mirror. She raised her left leg a little higher, trying for the perfect line.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Miss Angelina said approvingly. \u201cStretch. Like Kelly, girls. See how hard she tries.\u201d</p><p>Kelly felt a sharp pain in her leg and her hips, but she ignored it. Perfection came at a price. How many times had she been told that? Dance class was the only place she never screwed up, so she was determined to be the best here.</p><p>Against her will, her gaze slid from her own reflection to the window high in the opposite wall. She could just catch a glimpse of blue sky and part of a palm tree. If she closed her eyes, she could imagine the sound of the surf. She knew if she asked, Francesca would take her to the beach later. That they would talk and have fun. That Francesca would never say anything more about Kelly apologizing to her father, even though Kelly knew she wanted her to.</p><p>Kelly knew it was the right thing to do, too, but it was hard to say the words. Hard and scary. Because what if he was still mad? What if saying she was sorry wasn\u2019t enough? What if she didn\u2019t matter?</p><p>\u201cAnd turn,\u201d Miss Angelina called.</p><p>The instruction caught Kelly off-guard. She began to rotate, then something happened and she was falling. Her ankle twisted painfully as she slammed into the ground.</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and saw Francesca rushing forward. Her notes for her paper lay scattered on the floor. Miss Angelina crouched by Kelly.</p><p>\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d the instructor asked, reaching for her ankle. \u201cNot broken, I think. Just a slight strain.\u201d</p><p>Pain shot through her, but that wasn\u2019t why Kelly started to cry. Instead the tears formed because she was tired and because she desperately needed her dad to be proud of her and to maybe even love her, but what if he didn\u2019t?</p><p>It was too much. All of it. What she wanted was to go home. So when Miss Angelina made her stand and put her weight on her sore ankle, it was so much easier to simply fall into the pain, let her eyes roll back, and faint.</p><p>Sam hurried into the house. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d he asked when he saw Francesca coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. The doctor says it\u2019s a strain, not even a sprain, and she\u2019ll be dancing her heart out by Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can take any more,\u201d he muttered as he set his briefcase on the floor and loosened his tie. \u201cThis has been the week from hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Francesca murmured.</p><p>\u201cAt least tomorrow\u2019s Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goodie.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy the week is almost over.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cLike you say, it\u2019s been one thing after another.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his tie, then shrugged out of his jacket. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure we have a quiet weekend together. Just the three of us. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Francesca smiled, but he could see there was something bothering her. Before he could ask what, she stepped back and pointed upstairs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go check on our patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He gave her a light kiss, then started up the stairs.</p><p>Kelly lay on top of her bed, her right foot propped on two pillows. Sam crossed the room and sat on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cA sports injury, huh? Are you scarred for life?\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It was just a silly twist. I don\u2019t know why I wasn\u2019t paying attention more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca said you fainted, too. It must have hurt pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cTough, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her curls off her forehead. \u201cAre you supposed to ice your ankle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the first twenty-four hours. We\u2019re taking a break.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to leave work early and stuff. I thought...\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t want to say what she was thinking. That she hadn\u2019t wanted Francesca to call Sam because if he didn\u2019t come home, it would mean he didn\u2019t care. And she wanted him to care. But she didn\u2019t want to know if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, he was here, and he looked worried, which was good.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know you were all right,\u201d he said gently, and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter. I care about what happens to you.\u201d</p><p>Her chest tightened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes and tried to see if he meant it or not. She wanted to believe him so badly she could barely breathe. Maybe if she apologized for taking his credit card, he would say something else really nice.</p><p>She opened her mouth. \u201cI know I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Francesca walked into the room. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s time to come up with a different hobby,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cSomething safer, like painting.\u201d</p><p>Irritation ripped through Kelly. As much as she liked Francesca, she hated that she\u2019d just waltzed in here when things were going so good with her dad. If Francesca hadn\u2019t interrupted, she, Kelly, could have apologized.</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, I actually have my life together,\u201d Kelly snapped without thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to be a poor struggling student when I\u2019m almost thirty. I intend to be successful.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words were out, she knew she\u2019d made a really big mistake. She felt small and mean and sick to her stomach. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. The really bad part was the look in her father\u2019s eyes when he turned back to stare at her, and the pain and betrayal on Francesca\u2019s face.</p><p>Francesca made a small, choking sound and quickly left the room. Sam stood.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Kelly,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>Horror filled her. She\u2019d hurt Francesca, which she\u2019d never meant to do. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou might have your life planned out, but at the rate you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll be living it alone because no one is going to want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>She was crying too hard to see very much, but the silence that followed told her she\u2019d been left all alone.</p><p>Francesca made it down stairs, but she couldn\u2019t find her purse. She was still fumbling through the kitchen when she felt Sam come up behind her. He turned her, pulled her into his arms, and held her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to say it was okay, that she understood, only it wasn\u2019t and she didn\u2019t. Kelly\u2019s words had pierced her like poisoned arrows. They\u2019d struck deep and true, wounding her to the soul. In a couple of short sentences she\u2019d reduced Francesca to that scared, stupid kid she\u2019d always been. The one who was afraid of never being smart enough to make it in the world. The girl whose grandfather had told her over and over that she wasn\u2019t to worry her pretty head about it\u2014some nice man would take care of her. But Francesca had never wanted to be taken care of. She\u2019d wanted to be strong enough to stand on her own. And she was. Only it didn\u2019t feel like it.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I know it hurts,\u201d Sam whispered into her ear as he stroked her back. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on Kelly\u2019s side since the second she walked into this house. You\u2019ve put yourself out for her, and this is your reward. I wish I could change things.\u201d</p><p>He drew back and cupped her face. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re amazing. These past few weeks have shown me that you\u2019re a very special woman, and I\u2019ve been lucky to have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>Light poured from his eyes. A warm, gentle light that bathed her in a glow that should have made her happy enough to float.</p><p>Instead, it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cSam, don\u2019t,\u201d she said, pushing away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything nice about me.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cBecause I\u2019m changing the rules? Because I want more than something casual?\u201d</p><p>It was as if someone had ripped her heart from her chest. If she hadn\u2019t been pregnant, if she hadn\u2019t spent the past month lying to him, she couldn\u2019t have been happier to hear those words and know that he cared about her. Maybe even loved her. Because over the past few days she\u2019d come to see that he mattered more than anyone ever had.</p><p>She could imagine a life with him, a future. She could see them growing old, being happy. Sam didn\u2019t see her as a pretty face, or an ornament. He saw her as a confident, capable woman. He depended on her, believed in her. He thought she was strong. He thought of her as his equal. A partner. With him, she\u2019d finally found everything she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>But could she keep it?</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down,\u201d she said, moving to the kitchen table and pulling out a chair. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cFour words every man hates to hear.\u201d He took a seat. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re not interested in anything more than an affair.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned in her eyes, but she blinked them away. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\u201d</p><p>He brightened. \u201cGreat. Then what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>There was no easy way to break the news, so she went for blunt and simple. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at her, then laughed. \u201cRight. So tell me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t react. Instead he just sat there, looking at her. She tried to read his expression, but she couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he said at last.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he was asking when she\u2019d gotten pregnant or when she\u2019d found out. Neither was going to please him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about seven weeks along. It must have happened the first night we were together.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and very deliberately pushed in the chair. Tension tightened his body and his face. His mouth got pinched, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d he asked, his voice low and disbelieving. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baby?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI know this is a shock to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shock?\u201d He paced to the far counter, then leaned against it, his arm folded across his chest. \u201cA shock? How the fuck did this happen?\u201d</p><p>The attack shouldn\u2019t have surprised her, but it did. She gripped the table. \u201cThe usual way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was there.\u201d Something occurred to her. \u201cAre you doubting that this child is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been sleeping around, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, but holy hell, did you have to go and get pregnant? Isn\u2019t having Kelly drop into my life enough for one month?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d known he wouldn\u2019t be happy, even though that had been her fantasy. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised he was upset. Neither of them had wanted this. Except after she\u2019d recovered from the shock, she\u2019d found that she liked the idea of a baby\u2014especially Sam\u2019s baby.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say we have equal responsibility here.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to blame you. But a baby. Now. I didn\u2019t want...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off, leaving her to fill in the rest of the sentence. He hadn\u2019t wanted Kelly and he certainly didn\u2019t want a baby? Was that it? Or was it even worse? He didn\u2019t want to tell her he refused to have anything to do with their child?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said as she rose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be involved.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to abandon my responsibilities here.\u201d</p><p>His responsibilities. Because of course he didn\u2019t want the baby.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She was so caught up in feeling rejected that she spoke without thinking. \u201cAbout five weeks.\u201d</p><p>The quality of the stillness in the room changed to something dark and dangerous. Francesca instinctively took a step back.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t move, but that didn\u2019t mean he was still the same caring man she\u2019d grown to love. He seemed to get bigger, angier. Whatever last hope she might have clung to died when his expression of frustration and confusion turned to loathing and contempt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cDammit, Sam, don\u2019t give me that look. I\u2019m not the enemy here. I didn\u2019t tell you because Kelly had been in your life all of two or three weeks. You were still in shock and you didn\u2019t need one more thing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words sound right,\u201d he said, his voice low and almost silky. \u201cTidy, reasonable. You were thinking about my feelings. I really appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what I need to be. You lied to me. You betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>She knew the danger in him thinking that. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou withheld the truth. In my book, there\u2019s not much difference.\u201d He glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been lying for weeks. I let you in my house, in my life, in my bed. I made love with you. I thought you were different. I thought you weren\u2019t anything like Tanya, but damn if I wasn\u2019t wrong. Looks like I picked another winner.\u201d</p><p>The unfairness of the accusation froze her to the bone. \u201cNo! That\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve been here for you. I\u2019ve been good to you and to Kelly. I don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you finally want to tell me? Do you need money?\u201d</p><p>She felt as if he\u2019d slapped her. \u201cHow dare you say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can say anything I damn well please. When I think about all the times I\u2019ve listened to your advice. Like you knew what the hell you were talking about. Like you weren\u2019t in it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward her, which made her walked backward until she bumped into the stove. He stopped less than a foot from her and loomed over her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a liar, and if you think for one second you can use this against me, you\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t care what it takes, but you\u2019ll never get a piece of me or my daughter again.\u201d</p><p>Horrified didn\u2019t begin to describe what she was feeling. What about their baby? What about her feelings and his? He cared about her\u2014she\u2019d been sure of it. How could that have died so quickly?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout me, about all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked out of the kitchen. Francesca stared after him. She didn\u2019t know what to do, and then it didn\u2019t matter because she couldn\u2019t be in this house one second longer. She ran to the foyer, where she found her purse by the front door. After picking it up, she raced outside and vowed never to return.</p><p>Kelly carefully held on to the stair railing. Her ankle throbbed, but that wasn\u2019t the reason she couldn\u2019t seem to move. Nothing was right. Maybe nothing would ever be right again.</p><p>She\u2019d started to come downstairs to apologize to Sam and Francesca. She\u2019d wanted to make everything right. But instead she\u2019d heard them fighting. It had been bad. Way worse than anything that had happened with Tanya and her boyfriends.</p><p>Francesca was pregnant. Kelly had figured out that much, and if Francesca was going to have a baby, then she didn\u2019t need Kelly to be a part of her family. Not when she was going to have a child of her own. And Sam had thrown Francesca out. Which meant they weren\u2019t going to get married. And if Sam found someone else, she might be as horrible as Raoul. He might decide that his new fianc\u00e9e wouldn\u2019t want a twelve-year-old hanging around, and then he would send her away.</p><p>He would send her away, and she didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go.</p><p>20</p><p>S am didn\u2019t sleep. He spent the hours until midnight pacing downstairs, then around one in the morning he started walking the grounds. By the time the sun came up, he was exhausted, sore, and not completely convinced he\u2019d handled the situation with Francesca as well as he could have.</p><p>She\u2019d lied. He was still having trouble reconciling what she\u2019d done with the woman he\u2019d grown to love. If she had been anyone else, he would have dismissed her from his life and never thought of her again. That\u2019s what he\u2019d done with Tanya, with the other women he\u2019d met. Even with his mother, after she\u2019d died. He turned his back on bitter memories and had vowed never to make that mistake again.</p><p>Until now he\u2019d succeeded. He\u2019d kept his relationships superficial. No one had gotten under his skin, no one had mattered, and no one had betrayed him.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted more of the same with Francesca, but that hadn\u2019t happened. Kelly had shown up, throwing his life the kind of curve designed to show the measure of his character. He figured he\u2019d succeeded as much as he\u2019d failed with her. And any part of his success was due to Francesca.</p><p>Damn her hide, but she\u2019d made him look at things he hadn\u2019t wanted to see. He and Kelly might have a long way to go before they had something close to a normal father-daughter relationship, but if not for Francesca, they would still be spending all their time screaming at each other.</p><p>Francesca had taught him to listen, to be calm, to look at Kelly\u2019s side of things. Francesca had given him hope that he could learn how to be a good father. She\u2019d made him believe in himself, in her, in them.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen in love with her. Only to find out she was just like all the rest of them.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t get his mind around that last thing. That she was like Tanya. Because Tanya had never cared about anyone but herself. And his mother had only been interested in manipulating those around her, using whatever means she could to manage the outcome. He\u2019d known women who were in it for the money, the house, the family business, or the name. So what was Francesca in it for? A baby?</p><p>He shook his head. No. He would bet his soul that she hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant on purpose. They\u2019d used protection and it had failed. So he wasn\u2019t angry because of the baby, but because\u2014</p><p>He stopped in the middle of the garden, cold, damp with dew, and barely able to see straight. The first fingers of pink light had barely crept over the house. They were going to have a baby.</p><p>He\u2019d heard the words when she\u2019d said them, but he hadn\u2019t internalized them. Not until that second. A baby. An infant.</p><p>His brain filled with pictures of diapers and blankets, of rocking chairs and car seats. Of a baby smile, a toddler, of a first step, a first word. All the things he\u2019d missed with Kelly. No, not missed. All the things that had been stolen from him.</p><p>He clenched his hands into fists and raised his face to the sky. If there was one woman in the world he would have been willing to have a child with, Francesca was the one. He loved her. Had loved her. And she\u2019d betrayed him.</p><p>Why had she kept it a secret? Five weeks. Not a couple of days or even one week. Five. She\u2019d made love with him, knowing she carried his child. She\u2019d laughed with him, smiled at him, held him close, all the while living a lie.</p><p>How could he reconcile what he wanted with what he knew?</p><p>There weren\u2019t any answers. At least not here in the garden. Tired beyond words, he headed for the house and walked into the kitchen. Maybe a couple hours of sleep would make things more clear. Maybe he would wake up and find out this was all just a bad dream and that it was still okay to trust and give his heart.</p><p>Didn\u2019t anybody on the planet carry cash anymore? Kelly wondered angrily as she tried yet another key in the door of Security International. The third one worked, the lock giving way with a loud click.</p><p>It was nearly six-thirty on Friday morning. She figured she had a couple of hours before office staff started showing up, but she wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Not when there was so much on the line.</p><p>Sam had been up all night. She knew because she kept checking his room. Finally, just after dawn, she\u2019d heard him go into his room. He\u2019d been snoring when she left fifteen minutes later.</p><p>She really hated that she\u2019d had to come to the office first, but when she\u2019d gone through his wallet around midnight, she\u2019d found all of twenty dollars. Not nearly enough to allow her to run away and not ever be found. Which meant she needed more cash, and she knew only one place to get it.</p><p>After carefully closing and locking the front door behind her, she made her way to Sam\u2019s office. There she went through the key ritual again until she found the one that unlocked his desk. She pulled out the key that would open the cabinet holding the petty cash box and crept down the hall.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to steal. Not really. But what choice did she have? It wasn\u2019t like she had her own credit card anymore. And not having a credit card had meant having to look up the bus routes and then take the right one to get her to the office. She\u2019d lost a lot of time. But she had a plan. Once she had the money, she would take a bus to San Francisco. She figured a bus was really safe because Sam would assume she was taking a plane. While he was busy checking first-class reservations, she would disappear into the city.</p><p>She walked into the storeroom and opened the cabinet. She was in the process of counting out the bills when a hand dropped onto her shoulder. She screamed and the money went flying. When she turned, she found her great-grandfather standing right behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d he said.</p><p>She opened her mouth, closed it, then burst into tears.</p><p>Sam woke at eight-thirty. A shower and two cups of coffee later he still felt like roadkill. By nine-fifteen he decided he\u2019d better check on Kelly. She\u2019d been hurting last night, and he felt badly for not talking to her at the time. Francesca\u2019s announcement had thrown him.</p> <p>As he climbed the stairs, he wondered how he was going to tell Kelly about the baby. Maybe he should wait on that until he knew what was going to happen. They could discuss it\u2014</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>Sam stood inside her room and stared at the neatly made bed. There weren\u2019t that many things missing, but he knew in his gut that she\u2019d left. Run away.</p><p>Panic didn\u2019t begin to describe what he was feeling. His daughter, he thought frantically. Where would she go?</p><p>Just in case his gut was wrong, he carefully searched the house, then checked his wallet. His credit cards were all there, but the last of his cash was missing.</p> <p>He grabbed the phone on his nightstand and punched in Francesca\u2019s number. A thick, tear-filled voice answered.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she with you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca cleared her throat. \u201cWhat? Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Kelly with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not. What happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing. She ran away. I was up all night, so it must have been sometime this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Oh, Sam, she can\u2019t be out on her own. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help?\u201d</p><p>Frustration, fear, and the need to get moving steeled his resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you,\u201d he said before hanging up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all fired,\u201d Sam announced at noon the following day. \u201cEvery single one of you is fired. We\u2019re the most successful security company on the West Coast, and you\u2019re telling me we can\u2019t find one twelve-year-old girl?\u201d</p><p>The portion of his security staff in town gathered in the main conference room. Sam paced in front of the dry erase boards. Gabriel sat in a chair by the door.</p><p>Jason ignored the news of his job loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked all points of departure, boss. Airports, train stairs, bus depots. We\u2019ve talked to cab companies, limo companies. Hell, even car-rental companies in case she had fake ID.\u201d</p> <p>Sam glared at him, not bothering to point out the obvious\u2014that Kelly was twelve and unlikely to know how to drive a car.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s seen her. There aren\u2019t any clues.\u201d The man shifted uneasily in his seat. \u201cIt\u2019s like she vanished.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned his back on his staff. \u201cGet out,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cAll of you, get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>There was movement behind him, then silence. He turned back to find Jason and Gabriel still in the room. He crossed to the table and sank down next to Jason.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Jason looked as tired and worried as Sam felt. \u201cIt\u2019s time to talk to our liaison at the police department.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t even want to admit defeat\u2014to go to the police when he knew his people could work faster by avoiding all that messy legal protocol. But never had he felt the sharp blade of failure more acutely than today.</p><p>He stared at his friend. \u201cWe have to find her, Jason. Dear God, she\u2019s out there by herself. Anything could happen.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel excused himself and walked wearily from the room. His limp had gotten more pronounced over the past twenty-four hours. He was showing his age.</p><p>Sam and Jason made up a new list of plans. When they were finished, Sam covered his face with his hands.</p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing I said to Kelly...\u201d Just thinking about it made him sick to his stomach. \u201cShe can\u2019t be gone. She just can\u2019t. I missed so much with her. All those early years. I can never get them back, but I want the future we were supposed to have. I want to watch her grow up and teach her to play chess. I want to be there on her first date.\u201d He dropped his hands. \u201cAnd scare the shit out the guy.\u201d</p><p>Jason gave him a weary smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll do a good job at that.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cI want to help her pick out a college.\u201d His throat got tight. \u201cDammit, Jason, I just want to hold her in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>The soft voice, the single word, made his heart stop in mid-beat. He turned toward the door and saw Kelly standing just inside the conference room.</p><p>A thousand thoughts flooded his brain, but he couldn\u2019t focus on a single one. Instead he could only stand and move around the table. Then Kelly was running toward him.</p><p>She threw herself against him just as he grabbed her and pulled her close. She was warm, alive, breathing, and crying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d he said, unable to process the information. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Sam stroked her hair, her back, then touched her chin so she looked up at him. Her green eyes were wet with tears, but still precious to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, then nodded. \u201cI was running away. I came here to get cash and Gabriel found me.\u201d</p><p>Sam couldn\u2019t feel anything but happiness. He glanced over her to where Jason sat grinning like a fool. \u201cYou know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. The old man pulled one over on both of us.\u201d</p><p>Sam remembered his grandfather showing up within minutes of being called. He\u2019d insisted on searching the house while Sam had been on the phone calling staff members. No doubt the wily old bastard had used the time to slip the keys back into place. Sam had never noticed they were gone.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo one bothered to check the office, right?\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cSorry, boss.\u201d</p><p>He rose and left, just as Gabriel stepped into the room. The old man looked very pleased with himself. Sam noticed the limp didn\u2019t seem so bad now.</p><p>\u201cYou fooled us all,\u201d Sam said, too relieved to be angry.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to fool you.\u201d</p><p>Sam sat down and pulled Kelly onto his lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said the other night. About no one wanting to be with you. Not only was that mean of me, it was wrong. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She wrapped her thin arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cKelly, you mean the world to me. I know things haven\u2019t been easy, but I think we\u2019re making progress. Good progress. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine life without her. He cleared his throat. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my whole heart. I\u2019d be destroyed if you left.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to send me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not ever.\u201d He took one of her hands in his. \u201cI can honestly tell you that never crossed my mind. Not even once.\u201d He gave her a slight smile. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d She looked at him, ducked her head, then blushed. \u201cI called you Daddy before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I liked it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, then smiled. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She flung herself against him and he held her close. As he rubbed her back, he glared at his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are going to have words later, old man.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cIt was for a good cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack. I know you needed to let Kelly know how much she mattered to me, and I\u2019m glad she got the message, but you shouldn\u2019t have carried things on for so long. When I thought Kelly was out there by herself...\u201d He shook his head, not wanting to think about it.</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cSam, you\u2019re such a horse\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>Sam stiffened, Kelly gasped and sat up, but Gabriel didn\u2019t stop talking.</p><p>\u201cYou think I did this for Kelly, when the truth is, I did it for you. You\u2019re the one who needed to figure out how much she mattered.\u201d</p><p>Sam glared at him. \u201cWhy you meddling, old\u2014\u201d He stopped and leaned back in the chair. Well, hell. Gabriel had taught him a lesson and a half. The last twenty-seven hours had been a living nightmare he would never forget. If that\u2019s what it had taken to make him realize how much he loved his daughter, then maybe it had been worth it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t approve of your methodology,\u201d Sam muttered as he touched Kelly\u2019s cheek. She smiled at him.</p><p>Gabriel settled into a chair. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019ve always been a cowboy at heart, doing my own thing.\u201d He nodded at Kelly. \u201cShe told me a real interesting story about you and Francesca. So you\u2019ve got another one on the way, huh?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sounded more proud than surprised, which was fine, because Sam was shocked enough for both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d he asked Kelly.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was coming downstairs to apologize to Francesca for what I said and to you for taking your credit card.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit, the kid is damned resourceful.\u201d</p><p>Sam ignored him. \u201cAnd you heard about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She wiped her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran away. Francesca was always the one making things right with you and me. I\u2019d been hoping the two of you would get together or something. But when I heard about the baby, I knew she wouldn\u2019t want me anymore. Not when she was going to have one of her own.\u201d New tears spilled down her cheeks. \u201cThen when you told her to get out, I figured you weren\u2019t going to get married and that I wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel making a tisking sound. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some groveling to do, boy.\u201d</p><p>Before Sam could respond, there was a loud commotion outside.</p><p>Gabriel glanced at his watch. \u201cRight on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Marcelli family. I called them when you went missing.\u201d The old man chuckled. \u201cThey\u2019ve been worried and wanted to know what to do. I suggested they show up here this morning.\u201d He winked at Sam. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be at your breaking point about now, and Kelly and I would take pity on you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly jumped off Sam\u2019s lap and hurried toward the door. \u201cThey were really worried about me?\u201d she asked, sounding delighted. \u201cWow. That\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d stepped out of the room, Gabriel looked at Sam. \u201cIt seems they all know about Francesca\u2019s bun in the oven. Lorenzo\u2019s not taking it well. He was expecting an engagement announcement, followed by a quickie wedding.\u201d</p><p>Sam rose. \u201cThey knew? Did everyone know but me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>Sam headed into the hallway. Sure enough, the Grands, Grandpa Lorenzo, and Colleen and Marcus stood around talking with various staff members. He supposed he should be pleased that Katie and Brenna hadn\u2019t tagged along.</p><p>His daughter was being hugged, squeezed, and cheek-pinched by the Grands. The pleasure on her pretty face eased some of the tightness in his chest. It had been a hell of a morning, and it didn\u2019t seem to be getting any less stressful.</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by,\u201d he said above the din. \u201cAs you can see, Kelly is fine.\u201d</p><p>Conversation ceased. Five adults looked at him. Five pairs of eyes turned reproachful. Sam suddenly felt as if he were eight and had just hit a baseball through the church window.</p><p>He tried to smile and somehow couldn\u2019t make his mouth move. Grandpa Lorenzo stepped toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou dishonor my granddaughter. We have a word for men like you.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t want to know what it was. Nor did he know how to defend himself against the much older man. While he knew enough moves to take out Lorenzo twenty times over, it seemed in bad form to use them against a soon-to-be great-grandfather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lorenzo started muttering in Italian. The Grands didn\u2019t look any more friendly. He didn\u2019t want to know what Francesca\u2019s parents were thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry her,\u201d the old man said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone turned and saw Francesca walking down the hallway. She walked over to Lorenzo and got between him and Sam.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather roared. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant. He\u2019s the father. He should do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned and saw Gabriel leaning against a wall. \u201cDid you call her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She needed to be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny more surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>Great.</p><p>Francesca glared right back at Lorenzo. \u201cSam and I will do what is right for us. Not what you want, not what my parents want, not what anyone else wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be fine. I\u2019ve already married one man I didn\u2019t love. I\u2019m not doing it again.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t love him? The words burned deep. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me?\u201d he asked without thinking.</p><p>She whirled on him. \u201cDo you really want to have this conversation right here?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around at her family, at Gabriel and Kelly and most of his staff hovering in the background.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d fired all of them,\u201d he muttered, then motioned to the conference room. \u201cHow about in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She swept past him.</p><p>He followed and closed the door, all the while trying not to think about everyone out there pressing close and listening.</p><p>Francesca paced the length of the room. When she reached the far end, she turned back to him but didn\u2019t speak.</p> <p>Sam studied her\u2014the long brown hair that swayed with each movement. The shape of her greenish-hazel eyes. The set of her mouth. He remembered the first time they\u2019d met. She\u2019d been seriously pregnant. Maybe it had been a sign.</p><p>She was having his baby. He recalled being furious with her just a couple of days ago. He\u2019d said a lot of things he now regretted. After the last couple of days, he understood why she\u2019d kept the truth from him. He\u2019d been reeling from dealing with Kelly. She\u2019d wanted to give him time. She hadn\u2019t acted anything like his ex-wife. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot to answer for,\u201d she said, her voice thick with tension. \u201cYou were a real bastard, Sam. And you don\u2019t fight fair.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp words were so at odds with the warm and friendly thoughts he\u2019d been having that it took him a second to switch gears. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cYou. If we\u2019re going to fight, we\u2019re going to fight fair. No name-calling and no walking out. We stay here until it\u2019s settled. No matter how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>She was right, he thought. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sorry I called you a liar. I was stunned and wounded and I lashed out, but it\u2019s not an excuse. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t looked convinced, but she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I walked out. I should have stayed and fought with you, no matter how upset I was. And just to make things clear, I didn\u2019t keep the information from you just to entertain myself. I found out about the baby right before the Fourth of July. I didn\u2019t want to tell you then because I didn\u2019t believe it myself. Then I learned about my brother and there was all that. Then there were problems with Kelly. I wanted to give you time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have made that decision for me. It wasn\u2019t yours to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I was wrong and I apologize.\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason I didn\u2019t tell you. I knew you\u2019d get upset, and I didn\u2019t want things between us to change.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby. Of course they\u2019re going to change.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe that he loved her and wanted to yell at her in equal measures. \u201cHow could things not change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew they would be different,\u201d she said, her voice rising. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. I liked being with you. I liked what we had. I was starting to care about you, which not only broke the rules, but scared the crap out of me. So I hid the truth. And I felt really guilty.\u201d</p><p>He matched her volume with volume. \u201cYou should have trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it.\u201d</p><p>She stomped her foot. \u201cDammit, Sam, I am a calm, rational person. Not a screamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be a screamer with me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare bring up sex right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant when we fight. You yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yelling right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d She pressed her lips together, then dropped her voice. \u201cYou bring out the worst in me.\u201d</p><p>Color stained her cheeks. She was breathing hard and standing her ground. In that second, he knew she would always go toe-to-toe with him. If she thought he was wrong, she would tell him. Whether it was about Kelly, their baby, or any other part of their lives.</p><p>He circled around the large table and walked toward her. \u201cI love you, Francesca Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>In the silence that followed, he heard not only her gasp, but a sigh from outside.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I lied. I knew how much you hated deception, and I did it anyway.\u201d</p><p>He walked closer and took her hands. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d She blinked back tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose you and I thought I might. I... I love you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>His heart did a double beat. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEven when you make me crazy. You don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m stupid. With you I\u2019m an equal. You listen to me, you trust me. At least you did.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her. \u201cI still do. How could I not? You do the right thing, even when it hurts. No matter what happens, you keep showing up.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou do, too. Having Kelly appear without warning really messed with your world. But even when you were angry and frustrated and backed into a corner, you kept trying.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the door behind them, then lowered his voice. \u201cI said some things I regret. About being sorry she was around.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded. \u201cBut you said them to me. In private. It\u2019s okay to have doubts. We\u2019re judged by what we do with those doubts. You kept on trying. Working the program. Falling for her.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI love her.\u201d He pulled her close. \u201cI love you, too. I want us to be a family, Francesca. I\u2019m still in shock about the baby, but I\u2019m excited, too. I want you to marry me. Not because it\u2019s the right thing to do or because of pressures outside this room, but because you want to. Because you can\u2019t imagine life without me.\u201d</p><p>Francesca kissed him. If she\u2019d had any doubts about her feelings for Sam, the last twenty-four hours had destroyed them. She\u2019d been more than miserable: she\u2019d been lost.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot half so much as I need you. Say you\u2019ll marry me. Promise to love me forever, which is almost as long as I\u2019m going to love you.\u201d</p><p>She held him and sighed. \u201cI do love you, Sam. With my whole heart. And yes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>There was a loud cheer from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t have to make a formal announcement,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy family doesn\u2019t exactly stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he said and kissed her. </p> </body></html>"]
