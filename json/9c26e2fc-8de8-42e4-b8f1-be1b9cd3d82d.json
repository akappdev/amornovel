Since the current situation wasn\u2019t Lonzo\u2019s fault, he\u2019d aimed his temper at something that wouldn\u2019t bruise\u2014or hit back\u2014although right now a good down-and-dirty fight held some appeal. Pain was slow to register, but his blood stood out in stark relief against the wall\u2019s white paint.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Larem, was that really necessary? I hope you didn\u2019t break anything; it\u2019s your night to do the dishes.\u201d Lonzo\u2019s comment held an equal mix of worry and disgust. \u201cWe both know Devlin has no choice in the matter. He\u2019s only asking that you and Barak lie low for a while. Besides, it\u2019s only temporary.\u201d</p><p>Larem flexed his hand gingerly. Nothing broken. Nothing solved. He was still caught between two worlds, neither of which wanted to lay claim to him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right. Why not make it easier on everyone concerned and tell the Regents to make one big cage and stuff all your pet Kalith into it?\u201d Larem said bitterly.</p><p>Swallowing hard against the acrid taste of his rage, he slowly turned to his worried friend. \u201cOr better yet, shove us back across the barrier. With any luck, the Sworn Guardians will solve the problem for you with just a few swings of a sword.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo had his own temper and shoved Larem hard, sending him bouncing back against the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a dumbass. None of us would let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Larem got right back up in his friend\u2019s face. \u201cCorrection, Lonzo. Some of the Seattle Paladins wouldn\u2019t want that to happen, but you\u2019re paid to follow orders. If the Regents decide they want us gone, what can you do to stop them? If you refuse to rid the world of a few inconvenient Kalith, they can always find others who will.\u201d</p><p>He looked down the hall where more Paladins were congregated. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t have to go far to find them.\u201d</p> <p>A deep voice joined the discussion. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Larem. That\u2019s not happening. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. We owe you and the others too much.\u201d</p><p>Larem wanted to believe Devlin Bane. He really did, but he\u2019d been betrayed too many times by his own kind to easily accept that his former enemies would behave any differently. Gods above, he missed his old life so damned much. As a Blademate to a Sworn Guardian, he\u2019d known his place in their world and served his people with honor.</p><p>Here, he accepted a paycheck from the Paladins for teaching weapons practice a few hours a month. He hated living on their charity, but he was still learning his way in this new life. Eventually, he\u2019d be able to strike out on his own and be free to make his own choices. Some days he seriously thought about crossing back over into Kalithia and taking his chances that his death sentence would be rescinded. So far he\u2019d resisted the urge.</p><p>Another Paladin came out of the conference room and headed straight for Larem. \u201cThis new policy is crap, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter Fitzsimon glared at Devlin, his green eyes blazing with pure rage. \u201cI have more reason than most to hate what comes boiling across the barrier at us, but Larem is different.\u201d</p><p>Devlin rolled his huge shoulders, no doubt trying to shrug off some tension. \u201cListen up, all of you. You\u2019ll get no arguments from me on that score. However, until this new rep from the Regents is actually here, we just need to be careful. Arguing by e-mail won\u2019t change anything, but I can and will make our case in person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right, and if he doesn\u2019t buy what you\u2019re selling? What then?\u201d Hunter turned his attention to Larem. \u201cPack up your things. You\u2019re coming home with me and Tate. The apartment over the garage is yours as long as you need it.\u201d</p><p>Devlin looked like he wanted to argue, but then the big man shut his mouth and shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Larem. I can\u2019t guarantee this new guy will listen to me. If you\u2019d feel safer moving up north with Hunter, I wouldn\u2019t blame you. Go camp out in Hunter\u2019s apartment, at least until the dust settles and we know more what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since Devlin had called the morning meeting to order, Larem didn\u2019t feel quite so alone. As tempting as it was to take off with Hunter, the thought of hiding out didn\u2019t sit well with him. A warrior both by training and by nature, he would not run.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait to see what happens. Besides, I\u2019m not the only one affected by this order.\u201d Larem nodded down the hallway to where Barak q\u2019Young stood talking to his sister, who had two Kalith children at home. \u201cWe can\u2019t all go into hiding.\u201d</p><p>Devlin sighed, clearly tired of dealing with all the bureaucratic bullshit. \u201cThis guy is supposed to show up by the end of the week. I suggest we go about business as usual until then.\u201d</p><p>Like anything had been \u201cusual\u201d for Larem in a long, long time. \u201cAre we done? If so, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, he headed for the gym, intent on working off some anger banging blades with someone, anyone. A few seconds later both Hunter and Lonzo caught up with him. He\u2019d rather be left alone for a few minutes but couldn\u2019t fault them for their show of support. The least he could do was show his appreciation by bruising them up some.</p><p>The three warriors walked into the gym and headed straight for the rack of practice weapons. Larem reached for one of the Kalith-style curved blades that the armorer had recently added to the collection. After a few warm-up swings, he tossed his shirt in the corner and faced off against his two friends.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, gentlemen, who wants to bleed first?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s wolfish grin was a mirror reflection of Larem\u2019s own. With a quick salute, the battle was on.</p><p>Watching Chaz Willis squirm was a rare pleasure. Right now the two of them were staring out of a tenth-floor office window at the sidewalk below. Thanks to her fiery red hair, it was easy to pick Sasha out of the crowd even from that height.</p><p>Her father glanced at George, his mouth a straight slash of anger. \u201cLook, I know Sasha takes her orders from the entire Board of Regents, but I really hate this. No matter how much I argue, she won\u2019t listen to reason.\u201d</p><p>George sipped the glass of expensive scotch Chaz had poured for him, savoring the twin burns of the liquor and his friend\u2019s frustration. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from, but you really need to lay off the girl before you drive a permanent wedge between the two of you. She\u2019s well qualified for the job and deserves a chance to prove herself.\u201d</p><p>Chaz topped off his own glass and took a large swig. \u201cShut up, George. She\u2019s my daughter. That gives me the right to interfere when I think it\u2019s in her best interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s my goddaughter,\u201d George snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t screw this up for her because you\u2019re not ready to cut the apron strings. She\u2019s all grown up\u2014it\u2019s time you realized that.\u201d</p><p>Chaz glared at George over the rim of his glass. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt my daughter\u2019s abilities. But as both her father and a Regent, I have some misgivings about what kind of situation we\u2019re sending her into. We both know Kincade made a mess of things in Seattle, and it\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d</p><p>George strolled over to perch on the side of Chaz\u2019s desk. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking he wasn\u2019t working alone.\u201d</p><p>Chaz finally turned away from the window. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want Sasha caught up in any fallout. By the way, I\u2019m still pissed you helped her rally enough support to get this assignment in the first place. You should\u2019ve stayed out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChaz, you and I both know that Sasha deserves this chance. Besides, we need someone out there who we can trust to do the job right. Would you rather the Board pick someone else, someone we can\u2019t control?\u201d</p><p>For the first time all morning, Chaz laughed. \u201cIf you think you can control Sasha, especially from almost two thousand miles away, you\u2019ve sorely overestimated your influence on her.\u201d</p><p>George clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cCome on, Chaz, how much trouble can she get into? We both know Devlin Bane and the rest of the Paladins have no use for number crunchers. At best, they\u2019ll tolerate her. At the worst, they\u2019ll ignore her. They certainly won\u2019t trust her. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve managed to buy ourselves some time to deal with Kincade himself. We have to find out who else was involved in his shenanigans before we assign a permanent Regent to that sector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the problem\u2014Sasha doesn\u2019t see her assignment to Seattle as a stopgap measure. She has every intention of being appointed as the new Regent for that whole area. We\u2019ll just have to find a way to monitor her actions carefully.\u201d</p><p>Actually, George suspected Sasha would report in only when she absolutely had to and, even then, tell them only what she wanted to share. To maintain control over the situation, it would be better to have another pair of boots on the ground.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have another man on-site. You know, to keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>Chaz immediately perked up. \u201cGood idea. She\u2019ll kick our asses if she finds out, but I\u2019d sure feel better about the situation. Any suggestions who we can trust to keep a low profile?\u201d</p><p>After running down his mental list of possible candidates for the job, George made a quick decision. The man he had in mind had served as a reliable spy in the past. There was no reason to think he wouldn\u2019t this time.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. We\u2019ve even used him before in similar situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Call him.\u201d</p><p>George hit a number on his speed dial. When the guy on the other end picked up, George kept it simple.</p><p>\u201cPack your bags. You just got transferred to Seattle. I want someone I trust to keep me informed about what\u2019s going on out there and to do what\u2019s necessary to keep things from going to hell. There\u2019s a bonus in it if you get there by the end of the week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A minute later George hung up, satisfied he\u2019d done the right thing. Certainly Chaz looked happier. Now, only time would tell if he\u2019d made things worse or protected his agenda.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Sasha\u2019s plane had flown disturbingly close to Mount Rainier on the way over the Cascades, but the view of the mountain from her hotel room was stunning. The helpful pilot had also pointed out St. Helens and Mount Adams, two of the other volcanoes in the region, as he guided the plane into its final approach to Seattle. A chill slithered over her skin at the memory, but she resisted the urge to close the drapes. She had to get used to the sight eventually, and the sooner the better.</p><p>Granted the three peaks were beautiful, but she knew their truth. Underneath all that magnificent splendor beat the cold hearts of killers. At times unstable, always unpredictable, and when the mood hit, totally lethal. Even if the mountains didn\u2019t do the killing themselves, they also harbored the Others, crazed murderers from another world. Sasha couldn\u2019t just enjoy the volcanoes\u2019 rugged beauty, not when she knew about the trained warriors who lived and died under those scenic slopes, all to keep people like her safe.</p> <p>The Paladins\u2014a society shrouded in secrecy. Even working for the Regents, she\u2019d caught only an occasional glimpse of the St. Louis contingent. Her father had done his best to protect her from the world the Paladins lived in. Even with her limited experience, she knew why.</p><p>They were warriors in the finest sense of the word\u2014alpha males in all their glory, the kind of men who attracted women wherever they went. But not her. Not again. She knew better. It\u2019d been another secret she\u2019d kept from her father and the Regents; if they\u2019d found out, they might have terminated her employment immediately. Despite the passage of time, the memories remained sharp and clear; the pain still ached like an old sports injury that acted up whenever it rained.</p><p>But enough of that. It was time. Ignoring the flutter of butterflies in her stomach, she picked up her briefcase and left her room. Her first meeting with her new charges was scheduled in less than an hour.</p><p>Devlin Bane, a legend in their world, hadn\u2019t been happy when she\u2019d refused his request to meet with him one-on-one ahead of time. He\u2019d raised some valid points in their brief flurry of e-mails, but she didn\u2019t want anything to color her first impressions of the Paladins stationed in the Seattle area. Besides, it was pretty much a sure thing that they\u2019d close ranks to shut her out. Fine. They had good reason not to trust the Regents anymore. She expected to have to work long and hard to break through their firmly ingrained \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality.</p><p>If she could reestablish a positive working relationship, though, she\u2019d guide them back into compliance with the regulations established by the Regents for the good of all. The Paladins were the best at what they did, but somehow this bunch had gone way off track\u2014to the point of harboring the enemy among their ranks.</p> <p>Her father and some of his associates were all for shipping the ringleaders out, scattering them over the globe. She\u2019d managed to convince the Board as a whole that to do so would only spread the contagion.</p><p>No, containment was the appropriate goal and her first in a long list. As the elevator whisked her down to the ground floor, a surge of pure adrenaline hit her veins. The battle for control was about to begin.</p><p>It was time to report to the conference room. Larem had reluctantly agreed to attend the meeting as the sole Kalith representative in the crowd. Barak and Lusahn had offered to come, too, but Devlin had advised against it. At least he\u2019d agreed that one of them should be there to hear what the representative had to say. Larem had no idea why the Paladin leader had picked him and hadn\u2019t bothered to ask.</p><p>Larem joined the long line of Paladins making their way toward the meeting place. A fair number simply ignored him, tolerating his presence only because they\u2019d been ordered to. Inside the room, he paused to locate his friends, who had promised to save him a place. Lonzo and Hunter stood along the back wall near one of the exits. Lonzo was on duty and needed to be the first one out the door if the barrier crashed.</p><p>\u201cHey, roomie, thought maybe you\u2019d changed your mind.\u201d Lonzo scooted to the side to make space for Larem between himself and Hunter.</p><p>D.J. joined them in the back, his eyes flitting around the room. \u201cRumor has it the new administrator has been ducking Devlin. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p> <p>Lonzo shrugged. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s afraid of the big man.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed, his ruined voice holding little humor. \u201cIf so, maybe the guy is smarter than we gave him credit for. Think if one Regent rep went missing, they\u2019d get the message and leave us the hell alone?\u201d</p><p>Larem ignored the banter, focusing instead on a sudden stir at the front of the room. Devlin had walked in, but for once he wasn\u2019t the one leading the parade. Whoever had entered just ahead of him was too short to be seen over the assembled Paladins and guards.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Few in the crowd had even noticed that the party was about to begin. Devlin looked back to bark something at Trahern, who had followed him into the room. The other Paladin nodded and immediately stuck two fingers in his mouth and blew hard. The shrill whistle brought all conversation to a screeching halt.</p><p>Devlin walked up to the podium and glared around the room, his eyes locking up with Larem\u2019s briefly. He gave a slight nod before moving on, maybe expressing his approval that Larem had dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt to better blend in with his companions. He\u2019d also tied his hair back with a leather thong, although Larem wasn\u2019t the only male in the room sporting hair down past his shoulders. Devlin himself wore his dark hair long although it lacked the sprinkling of gray that gave the Kalith people their distinctive look.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everybody, listen up. I\u2019d like to introduce our new administrator, who\u2019s here on behalf of the Board of Regents.\u201d</p><p>Before he could complete the introduction, the crowd turned restless as several Paladins shouted out comments and questions. Larem didn\u2019t bother to join the chorus of angry voices, figuring it wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything. Still, there was part of him that was glad the Paladins weren\u2019t going to make it easy for the Regents\u2019 representative to impose his will over them.</p> <p>Devlin obviously had a different take on the situation. When the rumbling continued, he shouted, \u201cWill you guys shut the fuck up!\u201d</p><p>Then he flushed red as he turned to face his unpopular companion. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo looked like he\u2019d swallowed a worm. \u201cDid Dev just apologize to a Regent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d D.J. rose up on his toes to see better. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you will,\u201d Hunter muttered, \u201cbut can you see the guy?\u201d</p><p>D.J. shook his head, as if to clear it, before answering, \u201cHe\u2019s a she.\u201d</p><p>That had all of them stretching their necks, hoping to see over the crush of oversized men that filled the room. Finally, the new administrator made it easier on everybody by climbing up on a chair. As the woman waited for her unwilling audience to fall silent, she did her own fair share of staring back at them.</p><p>Larem\u2019s heart lurched in his chest. Not only was he a she, but she was striking. Or at least she would be if she didn\u2019t wear her flaming red hair yanked back from her face in that unruly wad at the nape of her neck. He couldn\u2019t see what color her eyes were from across the room, but they looked dark and intelligent. Her clothing was plain yet showed off her compact feminine curves rather nicely.</p><p>If she was nervous facing a boisterous crowd of angry men, it didn\u2019t show. He respected that about her, but then he\u2019d served with a female Sworn Guardian long enough to know that courage wasn\u2019t determined by gender. The woman\u2019s gaze swept past Larem without pausing, which would ease Devlin\u2019s concerns but left Larem feeling oddly disappointed.</p><p>When she cleared her throat and prepared to speak, he crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the wall. When she was done, he\u2019d report back to Barak and Lusahn before deciding what to do next. His first choice was to stay right where he was because he had commitments he didn\u2019t want to renege on. Too many were depending on him and his particular skill set. If forced, he\u2019d hide out at Hunter\u2019s place for a while, but that reeked of cowardice. No, if he and this woman were to be enemies, it suited his nature to face her directly.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, my name is Sasha Willis.\u201d Her voice had an appealing huskiness to it as her words rang out over the room, carrying to the far corners with a surprising amount of confidence. Larem wasn\u2019t the only one who straightened up to get a better look at her. There was a lot of power crammed into that petite package.</p><p>\u201cMy last name may sound familiar as my father is a member of the Board of Regents. I have been serving in Ordnance for the past five years, reporting directly to the Board.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she panned the room, as if assessing each man individually before continuing. \u201cYou have absolutely no reason to trust me at this point, and I certainly don\u2019t blame you for feeling that way. Too many times the organization has failed you. But I\u2019d like to change that. Rest assured that I have the utmost respect for the Paladins and the amazing job you all do.\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath. \u201cFor starters, I plan to meet with the Handlers to reestablish a set schedule for all types of testing, including scans.\u201d</p><p>Once again, murmurs of discontent started building. She ignored them and waited for silence to settle over the room before speaking again.</p><p>\u201cI am well aware that Colonel Kincade used scans as a punitive measure. I\u2019ve already issued orders to ensure that practice will cease immediately. Diagnostic procedures are to be done on a regular schedule only, unless the Handlers feel a particular case warrants more frequent monitoring.\u201d</p><p>Larem bet that his eyes weren\u2019t the only ones that immediately sought out Trahern. It was common knowledge that his test results had been getting steadily closer to the edge for years. They all knew that the only reason the Paladin still lived and breathed was because Brenna and Laurel had been too stubborn to give up on the man the last time he\u2019d died. By all reports, it had been a close call. Too close.</p><p>\u201cIn that same vein, I\u2019m happy to announce that I will be authorizing additional staff and funding to enable Dr. Young to continue her studies in that area. She and I will be discussing the matter in greater detail in the near future.\u201d</p><p>Trahern looked happier, but not by much. Devlin had left the administrator\u2019s side to stand next to his longtime friend in a show of support. From the look the Willis woman gave him, she hadn\u2019t missed the gesture or mistaken its meaning.</p><p>\u201cI will be studying all of your files, hoping to familiarize myself with everyone who is stationed here in Seattle, starting with the Paladins. As time allows, I\u2019ll move on to the guards and other support personnel. I understand that we also have special guests living and working here in Seattle. I will be dealing with them, too.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so that definitely sounded like a threat to him. At least she hadn\u2019t come right out and demanded that the local Kalith population be rounded up for immediate disposal. That didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t at some point. He doubted his friends would appreciate the dark turn of his thoughts, but then they had nothing to fear from the Regents. Paladins were too short in supply for their masters to risk alienating them completely.</p><p>The meeting was evidently winding down as Sasha Willis continued. \u201cI know you all have questions, ones I hope to answer in time. For now, I want to extend my personal gratitude for the work you\u2019ve done, and continue to do, here in Seattle. Thank you for your attention, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Then she hopped down off the chair and made a beeline for the door. Once again, Devlin headed for the podium. His men fell silent, waiting to hear what their leader had to say.</p><p>\u201cLike the lady said. We have questions and she has no answers\u2014yet. I\u2019m asking that you give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fucking choice do we have?\u201d</p><p>The comment came from somewhere in the middle of the pack, but Larem didn\u2019t recognize the voice. Devlin must have, though, because he shot the guy a sharp look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe long and the short of it is, none at all, but let\u2019s not assume the worst until we have to. I\u2019ll say it again: give the lady a chance. She can\u2019t be any worse than Kincade. Who knows, she might even surprise us. Now, get your asses back to work.\u201d</p><p>The grumbling this time sounded more like the usual kind. Lonzo made his escape, heading for the tunnels. D.J. muttered something about having an e-mail to check into and then plowed through the crowd with his usual disregard for those in his way.</p><p>Larem had almost reached the door when the warning blast of the Klaxons went off. He ducked back out of the way, clearing the path for the Paladins behind him as they all rushed to answer the call of duty. Part of him envied them their clear purpose in life, but at the same time he hated the necessity for it. How many of his own people would die before the barrier was restored? How many of his Paladin friends would bleed?</p><p>He watched as Hunter and D.J. followed Lonzo into the elevator that plunged down to the tunnels below the city, their game faces on.</p> <p>\u201cLarem!\u201d</p><p>Devlin came charging up, his favorite sword clutched in his hand. Larem instinctively retreated a few steps before common sense took over and reminded him that they were friends, or at least not enemies.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Devlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind Sasha Willis and make sure she made it out safely before all hell broke loose.\u201d</p><p>Both men looked around, but if she was in the area, Larem didn\u2019t see her. That came as no great surprise. The milling crowd of Paladins pretty much all topped six feet, making spotting one small human woman almost impossible.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Not that he wanted to. But for Devlin\u2019s sake, he\u2019d make sure the woman stayed out of the way of those who had work to do. Pencil pushers, as D.J. called those in administration, played no role in the daily grind of a Paladin\u2019s life. If the Willis woman managed to get herself in the path of the fighting, she\u2019d learn the hard way why she had no business trying to tell the Paladins how to do their jobs.</p><p>Larem ducked back into the conference room in case the representative had sought refuge there, only to find it completely empty. Where could she have disappeared to so quickly?</p><p>Her office was located a few blocks away in the admin building, while this one housed the Paladins themselves. It also contained some of the research facilities, including the geology department where Barak and his mate both worked. If he didn\u2019t find Sasha Willis soon, he\u2019d ask his friends to join the search.</p><p>The closest exit was down the hallway, past Devlin\u2019s and some of the others\u2019 offices. He headed that direction first.</p><p>Sure enough, he spotted her hovering outside Devlin\u2019s door. She looked up as Larem drew near. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do. After all, he was only charged with ensuring she hadn\u2019t been caught in the crush of bodies rushing down to the tunnels.</p> <p>Mission accomplished. Job done. He could get back to his own business with a clear conscience, at least after he reported to Barak what had been said in the meeting. He kept his eyes straight ahead, intending to walk right by the woman without making any contact. Unfortunately, she had other plans.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but did you happen to see where Devlin Bane went?\u201d</p><p>Larem slowed his steps just long enough to answer, \u201cHe headed down to the tunnels when the alarm went off.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, as if puzzled by his answer, but maybe it was his Kalith accent that surprised her. Humans often mistook it for German or eastern European. With luck, she would as well.</p><p>Finally, she slowly nodded, as if he\u2019d confirmed her suspicions. \u201cI\u2019d ask when he\u2019ll be back, but I know that depends on how long the barrier stays down and how many Others are waiting to charge across.\u201d</p><p>What could he say to that? He settled for saying nothing. Before he could walk away, though, she stopped him again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m kind of turned around. Can you point me toward the exit? I\u2019ll head back to my office until Bane returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door to the alley is back this way.\u201d</p> <p>He waited while she jotted Devlin a quick note. As she stuck it on the small corkboard the Paladin leader kept on his door, Cullen walked into sight, offering Larem the perfect opportunity to make his escape. After all, Devlin had thought it best if all the Kalith kept a low profile for a while. How could he do that and act as escort for the woman they were all supposed to avoid?</p><p>\u201cHey, Cullen, I\u2019m late for an appointment. Could you show Miss Willis how to get back to her office?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for his friend to respond, Larem walked away. Maybe he should feel guilty for forcing Cullen to take over, but Sasha Willis had already picked up on his accent. If she recognized him for what he was, who knew where that would lead?</p><p>He doubted anyone connected with the Board of Regents would appreciate Kalith warriors wandering around unescorted. In fact, no one would be surprised if orders didn\u2019t come down to do a lot more than restrict their access to Paladin facilities.</p><p>Just before the turn at the end of the hall, Larem risked one last look back. Cullen was showing Miss Willis something on his computer screen, giving Larem the perfect opportunity to study the woman without her knowing it.</p><p>She was listening intently to Cullen and nodding occasionally. Cullen, one of the resident computer geniuses, looked impressed when she said something and pointed toward the screen.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just the woman\u2019s intelligence that held Larem\u2019s attention. While almost all Kalith had dark hair and pale gray eyes, Sasha Willis was the opposite. Her hair was a deep red, the warm color of embers burning brightly, and her eyes were dark as night.</p><p>A couple of curls had escaped from her attempt to subdue them. His hands itched to pull those pins from her hair and set it all free. Such fiery beauty shouldn\u2019t be restrained. He bet she hated the halo of curls that would surround her face, softening the strong angles of her high cheekbones and full mouth. How would she taste? Tart? Sweet?</p><p>He had no business wondering about such things, and just his luck, he\u2019d been caught staring. Rather than run, he nodded in her direction and then calmly walked away. Perhaps she\u2019d think he\u2019d only been assuring himself that she was receiving the help she needed. Rather than worry about it anymore, he headed for the geology lab to consult with Barak and Lacey.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Sasha did her best to follow Cullen\u2019s detailed explanation about the network he and D.J. had designed for the Paladins. So far, she\u2019d understood most of what he was saying, at least until she\u2019d sensed someone staring at the two of them. Straightening up, she took a slow, casual look around.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to spot who was watching them\u2014the guy who\u2019d initially helped her was still lurking nearby. The question was why he felt compelled to hang around, especially when he\u2019d jumped on the first opportunity to hand her off to someone else.</p><p>Interesting man, though. He moved with such quiet dignity and spoke English with an odd cadence, as if it wasn\u2019t his native language. No surprise there. Paladins lived and worked all over the world. He might have been transferred into the area from almost anywhere.</p><p>As he nodded and then turned away, she forced her attention back to the computer screen. Who was he? She could ask Cullen but found herself oddly reluctant to do so. Besides, all the local Paladin personnel files were waiting on her desk back in the admin building. She could always shuffle through them to find out his name later.</p><p>The only thing that bothered her was why she found him so oddly compelling after such a brief encounter. Sure he was handsome, but all the Paladins she\u2019d met so far had that inborn charisma so characteristic of alpha males. Most likely this particular guy stood out from the crowd only because she\u2019d encountered him one-on-one, rather than as part of that angry mob she\u2019d faced earlier.</p><p>She realized that Cullen had stopped talking several seconds ago. \u201cSorry. I guess I\u2019m still trying to take all this in.\u201d</p><p>He shot a quick look down the hall where the mystery man had gone. \u201cWant me to show you the way out now, Ms. Willis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Cullen logged off his computer and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s down this way. The door leads out into an alley where we keep a guard posted all the time. Since you\u2019re new, I\u2019ll walk you out to make sure there\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d</p><p>They walked in companionable silence. She noticed another hall branching off to the left just before they reached the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s down that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some labs,\u201d Cullen said, shrugging as he opened the door to the alley.</p><p>As she followed him outside, she wondered why his reaction had seemed a little too casual, as if he were trying to deflect any interest in those labs. Maybe she was reading too much into it, but she strongly suspected that he was relieved when she didn\u2019t ask any more questions.</p><p>That was all right\u2014for now. Eventually, though, she\u2019d learn far more about the entire organization than any of them were going to be comfortable with.</p><p>Larem watched as Lacey Sebastian studied the array of monitors and seismographs that ran the length of her lab. Lines of tension bracketed her mouth as she made notes on her clipboard.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She checked the numbers one more time before answering, \u201cBad enough. Although based on these readings, the barrier should stabilize in the next few seconds.\u201d</p><p>Barak was holding on to the edge of the counter, his knuckles white, his face gray and stony. All Kalith had some affinity for the barrier, but he felt it the strongest. Lacey watched her mate with sympathy as they waited.</p><p>Finally, the dials did one last jump before settling down to normal levels.</p><p>Barak\u2019s shoulders sagged as he released his death grip on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s back up and holding strong.\u201d</p><p>All three of them breathed a deep sigh of relief knowing the fighting far below in the tunnels would end shortly. Lacey recorded the last of her data before setting her clipboard aside. Then she poured a cup of tea and set it down in front of Larem along with one of her famous chocolate chip cookies. Done with her hostess duties, she pulled up a stool and sat down between him and Barak.</p><p>\u201cSo, this new administrator, what did you think of him?\u201d</p><p>He considered how best to respond. \u201cFirst of all, her name is Sasha Willis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused to let that little surprise sink in before continuing. \u201cShe showed great courage by confronting all the Paladins at once. Her first action was to authorize more funding and personnel to assist Dr. Young with her studies. She also said the scans would only be used as a diagnostic tool. That seemed to relieve some of the Paladins, especially Trahern.\u201d</p><p>Barak q\u2019Young nodded. \u201cHis readings have been a matter of concern for some time. I was in Missouri when they almost ended Trahern\u2019s life permanently. It was a tough call, one that no one wanted to make. However, thanks to Brenna\u2019s faith in her mate and Laurel\u2019s willingness to give him every possible chance, they saved him.\u201d</p><p>Barak sipped his tea. \u201cBut that\u2019s no guarantee that they\u2019ll be able to help him if he were to die again.\u201d</p><p>Larem cringed. As a healer himself, even if only an amateur when compared to the talented and dedicated Dr. Laurel Young, he shuddered at the thought of having to put down a Paladin warrior who had burned up all his chances. Few people would have the courage to make that kind of decision even if it was necessary and the kindest thing to do.</p> <p>As if sensing Larem\u2019s distress, Lacey laid her hand on his shoulder briefly. She had better reasons than most to understand the situation, because her brother Penn was a Paladin. No one knew how many times a Paladin could survive the cycle of living and dying without losing the last hold on his humanity. Devlin Bane had been beating the odds for years, but it was highly doubtful his friend Trahern would be so lucky.</p><p>\u201cMaybe with the extra support, Laurel will be able to find some answers.\u201d Lacey rubbed her temples, as if she\u2019d suddenly developed a headache.</p><p>Should he try to help her? His newly discovered ability to heal was a poorly kept secret, even if no one talked about it much. Larem set his tea aside and angled his stool around to face Lacey.</p><p>\u201cShut your eyes for a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t question his order. Larem gently spread his fingertips along her forehead and temples, chanting under his breath. Then he closed his own eyes and drew upon the pool of healing light stored deep inside his mind and soul. A small stream of warmth flowed along the hidden pathways written in his flesh and bones. Almost immediately Lacey sighed, letting go of her tension and pain.</p> <p>He added another small burst for good measure. \u201cHow does that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous! Nothing I\u2019d tried touched my headache, but now it\u2019s completely gone.\u201d Lacey\u2019s face lit up with a broad smile. \u201cYou, sir, may hang out in my lab anytime. I\u2019ll even make sure to keep a steady supply of cookies and your favorite tea around as bribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have any say in this?\u201d Barak asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Larem answered, laughing when Lacey said it at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThat is what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Barak didn\u2019t look at all worried, though. He had no reason to be, because the Kalith warrior and the human woman loved each other deeply. Larem wasn\u2019t the only one who was a little jealous of the happiness the two had found together.</p> <p>For some reason, the image of Sasha Willis popped into his mind. Granted, he hadn\u2019t spent much time in the company of human women other than the mates of his friends. While he liked them all, they were strictly out of bounds for him. So were the few he\u2019d met outside the organization, because of the need to hide his true identity. It was safer for all concerned if he kept everyone at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>So what was there about Sasha that tempted him to cross that line, especially after such a short meeting? Part of the answer was obvious\u2014he was drawn to her exotic red hair and simple beauty. But there was also something about her that reminded him of Lacey, Laurel, and even Brenna, Trahern\u2019s woman. All of them were strong, independent females, and he suspected Sasha was much the same.</p><p>Not that he had any business to be thinking of her except to wonder what effect her presence would have on his life here in Seattle.</p><p>Barak interrupted his thoughts. \u201cDid the new administrator say anything else we should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plans to review all the files on the Paladins, then the guards will come next, followed by other support personnel. She didn\u2019t mention us by name but said she would be dealing with the \u2018special guests\u2019 that were living among the Paladins.\u201d</p><p>Barak winced. \u201cInteresting. You\u2019d have to wonder what exactly she meant by that. How did the Paladins react?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much as you\u2019d expect. Her remarks about the scans caused a stir, but she refused to take questions, saying she wanted time to review the situation here in Seattle first.\u201d</p><p>Barak looked impressed. \u201cThat may have been the smartest approach. No one would take it well if she came in announcing a bunch of changes without first learning the lay of the land. It had to come as a relief to all the Paladins not to have to deal with having another scan done just because someone was in a bad mood.\u201d</p> <p>Larem had been part of the group who had brought down the former administrator in the Seattle area, Colonel Kincade. The bastard had abused his power to torment those who served the Regents, all for his own greedy purposes. No wonder the local Paladins had such distrust of anyone outside their own tightly knit circle.</p><p>Barak passed Larem another cookie. \u201cHunter mentioned he invited you to stay at his place for a while. Are you going to accept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. I prefer to face a problem, not run from it. If this Willis woman is going to come after us, I want to be here to defend my new life.\u201d</p><p>Barak glanced over at Lacey. \u201cI told you he wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>Lacey smiled in approval. \u201cI\u2019m glad, Larem. There\u2019s strength in numbers.\u201d</p><p>He met his friends\u2019 worried looks head-on. \u201cI agree. We all have a lot to lose if the Regents decide that our presence is detrimental to the organization. I\u2019d rather we stand our ground than hide like cowards.\u201d</p><p>Lacey walked over to her mate. \u201cNo one could possibly think Kalith are cowards. Not when all of you have proved your worth over and over again.\u201d</p><p>He hoped she was right, but he had a bad feeling about the whole situation. Even if Sasha Willis had good intentions, that didn\u2019t mean those above her in the organization would support any of her decisions. That made it all the more important that he find a way to exist in this world without depending on the Paladins for anything.</p><p>Barak was frowning big-time. \u201cHow sure are you that she didn\u2019t immediately recognize you as Kalith?\u201d</p><p>Where was Barak going with this? \u201cI think she would\u2019ve said something if she had. Why?\u201d</p><p>His friend stared at his mate briefly until she nodded. He drew a deep breath before speaking. \u201cCullen and Lusahn stopped by earlier. We were thinking that if the opportunity presented itself, one of us should try to get to know her, maybe offer to show the Regents\u2019 new representative around a bit. The only question was how to do that without raising suspicions.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Larem really wished he hadn\u2019t mentioned his brief encounter with her after the meeting.</p><p>Barak kept right on talking, his words coming in a rush as if he couldn\u2019t spit them out fast enough. \u201cOf course, we\u2019d assumed the new representative would be a man, but the fact that she\u2019s female could actually make it easier for you to gain her confidence. You might gain better insight into how she plans to handle our situation, with the added benefit of her getting to know you as a person before she realizes you are the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d he asked, even though he knew. He still wanted to hear Barak say it out loud.</p><p>His friend\u2019s eyes shifted back to Lacey. \u201cYou are the only one of us who doesn\u2019t have a mate. If she discovers your identity, you could easily move into the apartment over Hunter\u2019s garage until the dust settles.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Larem was expendable. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cWhat about Devlin\u2019s specific orders that we stay out of sight?\u201d</p><p>Lacey joined in. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Miss Willis would have her own reasons for wanting to keep any such relationship under the radar, especially since she thinks you\u2019re one of the Seattle contingent. She\u2019s here to oversee the Paladins and wouldn\u2019t want to give the appearance of playing favorites.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to take Larem\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cWe know this is asking a lot of you, Larem. But Cullen and Lusahn have finally got Shiri and Bavi feeling secure in their new lives in this world. The last thing they want to risk is having to uproot them again.\u201d</p><p>Not to mention that Cullen himself had to remain near the barrier; the need for that proximity was hardwired into his Paladin nature. Lacey, too, had strong ties to Seattle. Because of her brother, she\u2019d focused her life\u2019s work as a geologist on making the world safer for all the Paladins. It wasn\u2019t likely she\u2019d be able to continue those same studies outside of the Regents\u2019 organization. Barak wasn\u2019t just her mate but also her research partner.</p><p>By process of elimination, that left Larem. His powerful sense of honor warred with his loyalty to his friends over the idea of deliberately misleading a woman he\u2019d barely met. It wasn\u2019t a decision he could make on the spur of the moment.</p><p>He set his cup back down on the counter, barely refraining from heaving it against the wall in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the tea and cookies, Lacey. You\u2019ve both given me much to think about. I\u2019ll let you know what I decide.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned his back on his friends and walked out.</p><p>Half an hour later, Larem reached his destination. As soon as he stepped inside, he was hit by a cacophony of barks, yips, and growls. The musky smell of damp concrete and medicine clogged his head, but he breathed it in without regret. Here, no one knew his DNA wasn\u2019t human or would\u2019ve cared if they did.</p><p>All that mattered was that he had a good touch with frightened animals and cared enough to show up when he said he would. The pay was lousy\u2014mostly tentative licks accompanied by a few wags of a tail\u2014but that was enough. He reached for his lab jacket, filled his pockets with some treats, and headed in to see which patients the vet had lined up for him to work with today.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the clinic, Dr. Isaac looked up and smiled. \u201cLarem, my boy, come on in. Your buddy has been watching for you, not that he\u2019d ever admit it.\u201d</p><p>The old vet nodded toward a pen at the far end of the room where a wary pair of brown eyes watched them both with a great deal of suspicion. Larem didn\u2019t blame the dog for his caution; he had good reason to mistrust humans in general. Of course, there was no way to tell the animal that Larem wasn\u2019t human, and he wasn\u2019t sure it would matter in the least. Trust once lost was slow to return.</p><p>Since Larem had some experience with that himself, he didn\u2019t take it personally. Still, he thought he was finally making some real progress with the dog.</p><p>He approached the cage slowly, letting the mixed breed catch his scent before speaking. \u201cHey there, fellow. How are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>Not that he expected an answer, but he was mastering the trick of communicating soothing energy with his voice. The dog stubbornly resisted any friendly overtures. But with each approach, it was taking Larem less time to slip past his defenses.</p><p>He knelt down and held out a couple of treats, once again letting the patient set the pace. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019d like these, and then we\u2019ll go for a walk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time, the dog\u2019s ears perked up. He might not trust humans in general, but he did seem to enjoy the time he spent outside in the run. The last time Larem had coaxed him into accepting a leash, he\u2019d taken the dog for a long walk as a reward.</p><p>Judging by the slow tail thumping going on, it was time to try it again. That pleased him every bit as much as it did the dog.</p><p>\u201cSon, I don\u2019t know where you got your magical touch with skittish animals, but it\u2019s been a real godsend around here. I wouldn\u2019t have given that fellow any chance of ever making his peace with people, not after the way he\u2019d been abused. He still doesn\u2019t like the rest of us much, but at least he\u2019s willing to take a chance on you. That\u2019s something. By the way, that\u2019s the name we\u2019ve been using for him\u2014Chance.\u201d</p><p>Larem didn\u2019t know what to say to that, but the vet\u2019s validation of his worth meant a lot to him. It had been a long time since he\u2019d felt appreciated for more than just his strong sword arm.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a while. Once he\u2019s had a good run, I\u2019ll try to convince him to let you give his injuries a quick check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d The vet turned his attention back to the small dog he\u2019d been examining when Larem walked in.</p><p>Larem tried out the dog\u2019s new name. \u201cAll right, Chance, let\u2019s get you out of there for a while.\u201d</p><p>Chance lurched to his feet, favoring his right back leg. The bones were healing up fine, but it was clear that it still hurt. Larem opened the cage door and set more treats down within easy reach. Eventually, he hoped the dog would accept the offerings directly from his hand, but there was no need to rush things.</p><p>The two pieces of freeze-dried liver quickly disappeared, and then the dog walked right up to Larem and rubbed against his legs. Larem reached down to pat Chance on the head and got his fingers snapped at for his efforts. Still, the attempt had been only halfhearted, a reminder that they weren\u2019t yet BFF.</p> <p>He smiled at the dog. \u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll watch my step. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Outside in the run, he let Chance off his leash and sat down on a bench to watch the dog explore his surroundings. That in itself was a huge improvement. The first time Larem had lured Chance outdoors to one of the runs, the dog had huddled in one corner and growled anytime Larem made a move in his direction.</p><p>Larem took it as a compliment that right now Chance was totally ignoring him, meaning the dog sensed Larem posed no threat. After sniffing his way around the pen, Chance slowly walked toward Larem. He stopped a few feet away, his head cocked to one side as he considered his next action. Finally, having made his decision, Chance closed that last bit of distance and rested his head on Larem\u2019s knee.</p><p>This time when Larem raised his hand to pet Chance\u2019s head, the dog sighed softly and accepted the offer of friendship. Larem lifted his face to the sun, offering himself up as a conduit of its healing warmth. Slowly, the bright, healing light poured through him to soothe the dog\u2019s pain and encourage his leg bones to knit. After a minute or two, Larem eased back on the flow.</p><p>His gift was still too new for him to know how much was enough without overwhelming an animal\u2019s ability to cope with the accelerated healing, especially in Chance\u2019s weakened condition. Most of the time Larem settled for easing pain and soothing traumatized spirits. Convincing an injured animal to accept care was half the battle.</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t sure what it was about this particular dog that was so special. It certainly wasn\u2019t his appearance, although the dog looked a whole lot better now than when he\u2019d first arrived at the shelter. That first day, the dog had been all bones and dried blood. He\u2019d already put on considerable weight but needed to gain a few more pounds. Standing about thirty inches high at the shoulder with an intelligent face, Chance bore a striking resemblance to a white wolf.</p> <p>When Larem had asked Dr. Isaac what breed Chance was, the old vet just laughed. \u201cAll I can say is that his ancestors weren\u2019t very particular who they mated with. From his build and size, I suspect he\u2019s got some Great Pyrenees in him and maybe some shepherd, but there\u2019s no telling for sure. He\u2019s his own man and a loner by nature, I would say.\u201d</p><p>Now that Larem thought about it, that assessment might just account for why he and Chance had hit it off. Both of them had been hurt by those who mattered to them the most and were struggling to find some peace in their lives.</p><p>\u201cHow about we take that walk now?\u201d</p><p>Chance agreed, whining softly as Larem snapped the lead back on his collar. Larem often walked the streets of Seattle, trying to outdistance the restlessness that plagued him more and more lately. At least with Chance trotting along at his side, he didn\u2019t feel quite so alone.</p><p>Sasha was about half a second from going stir-crazy. What the heck had happened here in Seattle? She\u2019d spent the past few days reviewing the budget and meeting with various department heads, and so far, it was unanimous: no one was happy. Everyone had their hands out wanting more money, more staff, and more supplies. God, if she granted even half the requests, the Regents would fire her for incompetence.</p><p>However, even at first glance it was obvious that some of the complaints were legitimate. Right off the bat, she\u2019d ordered all departments to inventory their supplies, figuring there was no way to tell what was needed until she knew what they had.</p><p>But it was definitely worrisome that she\u2019d heard the same complaints from all corners. Promises had been made but not kept. Less important items had been stockpiled while orders for others, especially those crucial to the well-being of the Paladins, had been either delayed or out-and-out denied. From what she could tell, jealousy and competition had been encouraged between the various factions. No wonder the resulting work atmosphere had become so toxic.</p><p>It was as if someone had set out to torment the entire Seattle contingent, making it all but impossible for the group to function. Only the dedication and loyalty of the support personnel, not to mention the Paladins themselves, had kept the organization performing at all and the city from being overrun with crazies.</p> <p>Throwing a temper tantrum would do little to alleviate the situation, no matter how appealing the thought might be. The real problem was that she had no idea if this had all been part of Kincade\u2019s determined efforts to screw with the Paladins or just a series of unrelated events that had come together to make a total mess of things. Clearly the entire sector had suffered from the lack of a responsible Regent overseeing the day-to-day management.</p><p>Right now, she didn\u2019t have time to investigate the history of individual problems in any depth, not if she wanted to get things back on track as quickly as possible. Once she made some progress in restoring basic services, then she\u2019d start digging.</p><p>At least the Regents had authorized a certain amount of discretionary funds for her to draw upon as she saw fit. Although substantial, it wouldn\u2019t even come close to covering all the gaps.</p><p>She walked over to the window, needing a few minutes to collect her thoughts. \u201cPrioritize, Sasha, prioritize.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. Great idea, but every department head she\u2019d spoken to had pointed out how crucial the missing items were. The real difficulty was in determining which requests were more urgent than others, and who could be counted on for sound advice on the subject.</p><p>All things considered, Devlin Bane was the obvious choice. After all, he knew firsthand what directly impacted his men\u2019s ability to fight and survive the devastating injuries they were subject to. She would\u2019ve talked to him before now, but so far he\u2019d avoided setting a time and date for their first one-on-one meeting.</p><p>Granted, she couldn\u2019t blame him for the instability of the barrier, but her gut feeling was that he was determined to duck her as long as possible. Okay, she got that he had no reason to love the Regents interfering in his business, but the situation wouldn\u2019t improve if he didn\u2019t even give her a chance.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to come down too hard on him, though, not if she could avoid it. After weighing and discarding several possible approaches, she\u2019d finally decided it would be best if she invited him and Dr. Young to her suite for drinks, safe from the prying eyes that followed her every move here at the office.</p><p>Rather than extend the invitation by e-mail or by phone, she\u2019d deliver the invitation in person. Maybe she was being a bit paranoid, but everyone knew there were several world-class hackers among the Paladins. With the current atmosphere of mistrust, she wouldn\u2019t really blame them for illegally monitoring her e-mails and phone calls. There\u2019d been no sign of that happening, but she sure wouldn\u2019t put it past them.</p><p>She\u2019d grab some lunch along the way and then go knock on Devlin Bane\u2019s door. The Paladin might not appreciate her showing up unannounced, but he\u2019d get over it once she made it clear that she needed his input on how to further improve things for his men.</p><p>So far, she\u2019d barely spoken to Devlin, but he and Jarvis, his Missouri counterpart, both had reputations of fighting long and hard for those who served under them. If anyone knew what the Paladins needed, he was the man. The fact that Bane\u2019s wife, Dr. Young, was one of the more forward-thinking physicians among the Paladins\u2019 Handlers was a definite bonus. If Sasha couldn\u2019t trust their judgment when it came to the Paladins, they were all screwed.</p><p>She grabbed her jacket and headed for the door.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Larem leaned against the wall, honing his boot knife and listening to the ongoing discussion. So far no one had said anything of much use. Finally, Devlin held up his hand, signaling it was time for everyone to shut up and pay attention.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s how I see it. I\u2019ve been ducking Ms. Willis, but eventually I\u2019ll have to meet with her. By all reports, she\u2019s spent her time doing exactly what she said she\u2019d do: reviewing personnel files, meeting with department heads, and scheduling more of the same. It\u2019s too soon to tell where all this is going\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish that thought, his phone rang. Grabbing the receiver, he barked, \u201cBane here, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He listened briefly before responding, \u201cThanks, I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil. Damn it, just what I needed.\u201d Devlin slammed the phone down and looked around at the men gathered in his office. \u201cSorry to break up the party, but we have seconds at best to clear out before Sasha Willis gets here. That was the guard calling to say that he just let her in through the alley door.\u201d</p><p>Devlin immediately shoved a stack of paperwork out of sight into a file drawer. Then he glared at everyone, making it clear they weren\u2019t moving fast enough.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, make yourselves scarce. I\u2019d just as soon she not see all of you here. Don\u2019t want anyone to get the impression we\u2019re plotting against the establishment.\u201d</p><p>Although they had been. Devlin had called them together to discuss emergency plans in case the Regents decided to come down hard on anything, especially on the subject of the Kalith living among the Seattle Paladins. Trahern led the parade out the door, followed by Cullen and Lonzo, leaving Barak and Larem bringing up the rear.</p><p>By the time Sasha Willis was due to appear, the Paladins were all back at their desks and looking busy. Larem, on the other hand, had some time to kill before heading to the shelter. He followed Barak across the office.</p><p>Barak picked up on his situation. \u201cIf you need a place to hide, you can join Lacey and me in the lab.\u201d</p><p>Larem shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. Cullen set me up with a desk where I can hang out until I need to leave for the shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but the offer is always good.\u201d Barak quickly disappeared, going the opposite direction from the lab, probably taking the long way around to avoid passing Sasha Willis in the hall.</p><p>Larem poured himself a cup of tea before settling in at his desk with one of the medical texts that Sworn Guardian Berk had been slipping across the barrier from Kalithia to him. Hunter had brought him the latest stack when he\u2019d driven down to Seattle for the first meeting with their new administrator.</p><p>Normally, Larem found the writings of other Kalith who shared his rare healing abilities fascinating, but right now, he could hardly force his eyes to stay focused on the page. Instead, his attention kept wandering toward the other side of the office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would\u2019ve been torn over the idea of cultivating the administrator\u2019s friendship under false pretenses no matter what, but he was especially so with Sasha Willis. He hadn\u2019t seen her again since that first day and so avoided making a decision one way or the other. He suspected his time had about run out unless he took the coward\u2019s way out and hid. But the others were depending on him, so given the opportunity, he\u2019d have to act.</p><p>Damn it, why did she have to show up while he was still there? More importantly, why hadn\u2019t he left while he had the chance? The answer was simple: he wanted to see her again, to see if his memory of her held up to the reality.</p><p>That she\u2019d want to meet with the head Paladin wasn\u2019t a surprise, but it was clear that Devlin hadn\u2019t been expecting her. Glancing around the office, Larem realized he wasn\u2019t the only one staring down the hallway. Several of the Paladins, even those whose desks weren\u2019t in this particular area, were hanging around and pretending to be busy.</p><p>As soon as the woman came into sight, all pretense of getting any work done ended. Larem had to give her credit. Once again, having all those male eyes focused solely on her didn\u2019t faze her in the least. She calmly headed straight for Devlin\u2019s office door and knocked. While she waited for him to answer, she did a little staring of her own.</p> <p>Her gaze swept across the room. Her mouth briefly softened into a smile when she spotted Cullen, one of the few who\u2019d actually spoken to the woman. When the Paladin jerked his head in a sharp nod of acknowledgment, she smiled more broadly before her eyes continued scanning the men.</p><p>When she spotted Larem, there was a brief flare of recognition, and he could\u2019ve sworn he felt a brief surge of warmth from all the way across the room. Once again, he was struck by her beauty. The deep green of her blouse set off not only the red in her hair but also her creamy complexion. Was her skin as soft as it looked?</p><p>After a second, her expression settled into a puzzled frown. Had he stared too long, or had she suddenly figured out who\u2014or rather what\u2014he was?</p><p>Either way, it wasn\u2019t his problem. He deliberately broke off the silent exchange and forced his focus back to the book he was reading. Far better that he spend his time satisfying his curiosity about his gift of healing than worrying about the opinions of one human female, even if she was a beautiful one.</p><p>And if he tried hard enough, he might just convince himself that was true.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand out there pounding on the door. Come in.\u201d</p><p>At Devlin\u2019s bellow, Sasha tore her attention away from the men scattered about the office and back to the one she\u2019d come to see. Even so, she found herself reluctant to look away from that guy seated in the back corner. He was one of the two men who\u2019d helped her find her way out of the building on that first day.</p><p>Now that she was working her way through the Paladin files, she readily recognized Cullen. From what she\u2019d read, his nickname of \u201cThe Professor\u201d certainly fit with the first impression she\u2019d had of him. He\u2019d been quietly helpful when he\u2019d shown her the exit, making sure to introduce her to the guard stationed out in the alley.</p><p>But it was the other man who aroused her curiosity. There was just something different about him. Even from a distance, he stood out from the crowd. She didn\u2019t know why, but he did. Eventually she\u2019d run across his file and perhaps find some answers.</p><p>Rather than get caught staring, she opened Devlin\u2019s door and poked her head in. He glanced up from the pile of papers spread out on his desk and tried to look surprised to see her. Cute.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t missed seeing the guard hitting a number on speed dial as soon as he let her into the building, although she didn\u2019t fault him for making the call. It was his job to monitor who came and went. Her only concern was what Devlin had been up to when the guard called to warn him of her approach.</p> <p>Now wasn\u2019t the time for inquisitions, so she\u2019d let it pass\u2014this once.</p><p>\u201cMs. Willis, come in and have a seat.\u201d He rose to his feet. \u201cCan I get you a cup of coffee or tea? Or maybe a bottle of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater sounds good. I\u2019ve already had way too much caffeine today.\u201d</p><p>While he got two bottles out of the small fridge in the corner, she sat down, choosing the chair that offered a clear view of the door. Odd that it seemed important, but it did. Safer somehow, although she didn\u2019t sense any kind of threat coming from Devlin himself.</p><p>He handed her the water and then returned to his own side of the desk. After popping the top on his own bottle, he asked, \u201cSo what brings you to our neck of the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to discuss something with you, but not over the phone.\u201d She took a long drink of water, giving him time to consider the unspoken message behind her comment.</p><p>His dark eyebrows shot up in surprise. \u201cYou think someone has bugged your line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that they haven\u2019t either. What I need to talk to you about is a bit sensitive, so I didn\u2019t want to take any risks. Besides, it was a good excuse to get out of the office and away from the stacks of financial reports on my desk for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Devlin grinned. \u201cGod knows, I understand that. Despite all the hours I spend on the computer, I\u2019m drowning in paperwork. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pondered various approaches on the way over without really coming up with anything that felt right. Judging from what she knew about Devlin, she decided to be blunt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meeting with department heads for the past few days. It won\u2019t come as a shock that I keep hearing different verses of the same song over and over again. The bottom line is that things have been badly mismanaged for some time. I plan to fix that, but I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p><p>She paused, waiting to see if Devlin wanted to join in the chorus of discontent. It didn\u2019t surprise her when he kept his thoughts to himself and waited for her to continue, maybe to see if she\u2019d hang herself.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s my thought on the subject. It\u2019s going to take time to sort through all the accounts before I can effectively deal with all the finger pointing that\u2019s going on. However, I will tell you the same thing I\u2019ve told all the other department heads: I fully intend to get to the bottom of the problem.\u201d</p><p>Thinking back to an earlier confrontation, she sighed. \u201cAs I told two angry supervisors this morning, I\u2019ll eventually figure out why one department got a lifetime supply of paper clips and the other can\u2019t get any. But honest to God, neither of them grasped that, while I understand their frustration, their problem is small potatoes when compared to the big picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Paper clips?\u201d Devlin\u2019s mouth twitched as he reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a couple of boxes. \u201cHere, maybe these will help.\u201d</p><p>He might be teasing, but she took them anyway. \u201cThanks, that\u2019s one fire out. Now, if only everything else was as easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to be of help.\u201d</p><p>Devlin leaned back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk, definitely looking more at ease than when she\u2019d first arrived. Time to get down to the business at hand.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Ms. Willis. The worst I can say is no.\u201d</p><p>Not that he had the right to refuse any reasonable request, but reasonable was in the eye of the beholder. Feeling she was about to step over a precipice, she took a deep breath and went for it. \u201cOkay, here it is. My focus has to be on whatever makes it possible for the Paladins to function.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, she continued, \u201cYou have a reputation of putting your men first, a policy I agree with. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ll be reviewing your budget and expenditures to make sure they\u2019re in accordance with the guidelines established by the Regents.\u201d</p><p>She made direct eye contact, telling him without words that she meant it. \u201cI figure it\u2019s in your best interest to work with me. So, insofar as I\u2019m trusting anyone around here, I\u2019m going to trust you because your men will suffer if we don\u2019t get things under control. To that end, I\u2019d like to invite you and Dr. Young to join me at my hotel suite for drinks.\u201d</p><p>His bright green eyes saw too much. \u201cI\u2019m guessing the occasion won\u2019t be purely social, that what we discuss will be off the record and in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I have some concerns about the security measures in place. Shall we say tomorrow night at seven? If that conflicts with Dr. Young\u2019s schedule or if the barrier decides to act up, please let me know and we\u2019ll reschedule.\u201d</p><p>As she stood up, Devlin did the same. To her surprise, he held out his hand. \u201cThank you for coming, Ms. Willis. I\u2019ll check with Laurel and let you know one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d Then she gave him a pointed look. \u201cBefore I go, do you need time to call ahead to warn anyone else I\u2019m on the loose?\u201d</p><p>Then she smiled and walked out without waiting for his response.</p><p>Still restless, Sasha had no interest in immediately returning to her office. She\u2019d meant to ask Devlin about a tour of the place but decided to see what she could learn if she wandered around by herself for a little while.</p><p>As she walked through the cluster of desks outside Devlin\u2019s office, she could feel the weight of all those suspicious eyes following her every move. No doubt someone was already warning Devlin that she hadn\u2019t headed straight back to her office.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take it personally, but neither would she let their suspicious natures impede her progress. She glanced down a narrow hallway and noticed a bank of monitors mounted on the wall, just at her eye level. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that what she was seeing was various views of the famous Seattle Underground.</p><p>Although she\u2019d read that the Paladin headquarters were built into the hillside adjacent to the sunken sidewalks and buildings, she hadn\u2019t expected to be able to watch sightseers wandering by on a tour.</p><p>What would those people think if they were to learn that the subterranean world they believed long deserted was actually occupied by a secret group of warriors? Probably that they\u2019d stumbled into a science fiction movie set.</p><p>The thought made her smile. The movies had nothing on the reality of the Paladins\u2019 world. When the last tourist was out of sight, she moved on, although still not ready to get back to her office and that stack of work.</p><p>A short distance later, she realized she could hear the faint sound of voices. She paused to listen. They were coming from down the hall on the right. The sign on the door indicated that it was part of the geology department, probably one of those labs that Cullen had mentioned the other day. Curiosity had her heading for the lab door. Rather than barge in uninvited, she knocked and waited to see who answered.</p><p>Larem stopped talking at the same instant Barak turned to face the door. For Lacey\u2019s benefit, Larem explained, \u201cSomeone\u2019s out in the hall. By the sound of the footsteps, it\u2019s most likely a woman.\u201d</p><p>Lacey looked at both males in disgust. \u201cI hate it when you two go all spooky Kalith on me.\u201d</p><p>She set down her clipboard just as the mystery woman rapped on the lab door. \u201cNo one around here ever knocks.\u201d</p><p>Larem rose to his feet, his internal alarms going off\u2014he knew exactly who it was. \u201cLacey, it\u2019s probably Sasha Willis, although I thought she would\u2019ve left the building by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could she want? I heard she\u2019s talking to the department heads, not lowly employees.\u201d Lacey started for the door. \u201cNot that it matters. I\u2019ll go let her in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Larem quickly blocked her way. \u201cLet me handle this. Maybe she\u2019s gotten lost. I\u2019ll act as if I were just leaving and guide her back toward the exit.\u201d</p><p>Barak stopped him. \u201cSo you\u2019re going ahead with our plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on whether she\u2019s learned that I\u2019m Kalith. If not, I\u2019ll see what I can do. One thing, though, if she sees the two of us together, she\u2019s more likely to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Lacey agreed. \u201cBut if she insists on seeing my lab, let her in. We have orders to cooperate within reason.\u201d</p> <p>Larem braced himself and opened the door only far enough to look out. Just as he suspected, it was Sasha Willis. When she recognized him, she took a step backward and then another, which irritated him no end. He\u2019d made no threatening moves. Why was she acting as if he had?</p><p>\u201cMs. Willis, are you lost?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her to answer, he closed the door behind him and headed off in the direction of the exit. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, I can show you the way out.\u201d</p><p>She looked past him at the door briefly before falling in step beside him. He automatically adjusted his strides to make it easier for her to keep pace with him. Fortunately the geology lab was only a short distance from the exit. At the end of the hall, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cThe door to the outside is in that direction,\u201d he said, pointing to the left. \u201cDevlin Bane\u2019s office is back the other way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I was just doing some exploring and heard voices.\u201d</p><p>Looking up at Larem, she finally smiled. \u201cHowever, this is the second time you\u2019ve offered to come to my rescue, Mr.\u2014um, I\u2019m sorry, I guess we haven\u2019t actually been introduced. I\u2019ve been trying to put faces with names, but I haven\u2019t figured everyone out yet. After all, there\u2019s only one of me and a whole lot of you guys.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d been right. She\u2019d assumed he was a Paladin. \u201cMy name is Larem q\u2019Jones.\u201d</p><p>He deliberately softened the beginning of his last name, hoping she wouldn\u2019t pick up on the prefix that would label him as Kalith. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of his heritage, but neither would he flaunt it right now.</p><p>Rather than continue the conversation, he stepped past her to lead the way the last little distance to the exit. He pushed the heavy door open and stood back to let her walk out ahead of him as he debated whether to pursue the unexpected opportunity to spend more time in her company. For the sake of Bavi and Shiri, Lusahn\u2019s children, he\u2019d make the effort and see where it led him.</p><p>That he\u2019d like to get to know her for his own selfish reasons was beside the point.</p> <p>His decision was further solidified as soon as he spotted the guard on duty. Duke had made it abundantly clear that he had little use for any of the Kalith. The man turned at the sound of the door opening and frowned when he spotted Larem standing with the new administrator.</p><p>If Larem relinquished his escort duties now, leaving Sasha Willis on her own, Duke wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give her an earful about the Kalith in general and him in particular. That was the last thing Larem needed, especially under the circumstances.</p><p>He was reasonably sure Duke wouldn\u2019t say anything right in front of him. All of the guards had a healthy respect for Larem\u2019s ability to wield a sword. If the man shot his mouth off now, he had to know he\u2019d pay for it the next time they faced each other in weapons practice.</p><p>She interrupted his thoughts. \u201cThank you, Mr. Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Larem, and actually I was about to leave when you knocked on the door. I have to be somewhere soon anyway.\u201d</p><p>As they passed Duke\u2019s position, he sensed the hatred coming off the guard in waves. The man probably felt justified in feeling the way he did, but Larem had never done anything to warrant such hostility. Luckily, it appeared that his companion was unaware of the situation.</p><p>Or maybe not. When the two of them had turned the corner, she looked back and frowned. \u201cWeird. That\u2019s the same guard who was on duty when I arrived, but he seemed much friendlier then.\u201d</p><p>What could Larem say to that? The answer was simple. On the way in, she hadn\u2019t been in the company of the enemy. If Duke and the others like him thought the new administrator was soft on the issue of the Kalith, they wouldn\u2019t take it well. Their previous boss, Colonel Kincade, had done his best to instill a great deal of animosity between the guards and both the Paladins and their Kalith allies.</p> <p>Sasha continued speaking. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the only one who wasn\u2019t happy to have me underfoot around here. I know my presence makes a lot of the people uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Larem glanced back at Duke, resisting the urge to smirk. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just having a bad day.\u201d</p><p>And Larem\u2019s presence had surely made it worse.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She sounded doubtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could be having a bad day when the weather is so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at the sky as they walked along. \u201cI\u2019d heard that Seattle was always gray and gloomy, but it\u2019s been sunny every day since I arrived. I\u2019m hoping I can squeeze in some of the tourist things while I\u2019m here. What would you recommend, Larem?\u201d</p><p>Larem smiled to himself. When was the last time he\u2019d had the opportunity to spend even a few minutes enjoying the company of a beautiful woman, simply soaking up the warmth of a late summer afternoon? Especially a woman who wasn\u2019t the mate of one of his friends? Never in this world and only rarely in his own.</p><p>He considered her question. \u201cI enjoy the water more than the mountains myself. Recently some friends and I went whale watching on the Sound up north of here. Orcas can be amazingly playful.\u201d</p><p>He and Hunter had spent the day out on one of the excursion boats with Hunter\u2019s mate, Tate Justice, and three of Tate\u2019s elderly neighbors. It had been an incredible experience for all of them.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d Sasha said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely keep that in mind. I also want to go to the zoo. All through college, I used to volunteer in the nursery of the St. Louis Zoo. When things settle down a bit, I might look into doing something like that again.\u201d</p><p>As they strolled along the sidewalk, it occurred to him that they might actually have a few things in common, starting with a shared love of the sun and working with needy animals. And even if she didn\u2019t know it, like her, he was mistrusted or even hated by a good portion of the people he came into contact with on a daily basis. Not that he could tell her that without revealing his true origins.</p><p>That small connection had him really hating the idea of using her, even to protect the Kalith children. Not to mention how much worse it would be when she figured out that she\u2019d been spending time with an Other. No doubt that friendliness in her dark eyes would quickly be replaced by revulsion.</p><p>The words slipped out of his mouth before he chickened out altogether. \u201cDo you have time for a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>She checked her watch. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>Even fearing it was a mistake of major proportions, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to regret the invitation. After all, one latte didn\u2019t translate into a long-term commitment; he was just testing the waters. They headed into one of the coffee shops that dotted the Seattle landscape. After placing their orders, they found a table next to the window.</p><p>Sasha sighed as she sat down. \u201cThis was a great idea. It\u2019s been a long day already, and I still have a lot left on my to-do list. Thanks for suggesting we stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He wrapped his hands around his venti coffee and absorbed its warmth.</p><p>She sipped her vanilla steamer. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll settle into a routine, but there\u2019s a lot for me to figure out. And it\u2019s not just the job. You know what it\u2019s like when you move to a new city. Everything is so different.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how different it had been for him, but now wasn\u2019t the time for that particular conversation. \u201cTrue. I\u2019ve only been here a few months myself, but there is a lot I like about this area.\u201d</p><p>Sasha tilted her head to one side as if to study him. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to place your accent, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>How best to answer that one? He settled for a version of the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve served near the barrier in several different locations over the years. How about you? I hear you moved here from St. Louis, but is it where you\u2019re from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice dodge there, mister,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI won\u2019t press for details. I know how Paladins like to keep their secrets.\u201d</p><p>As did Kalith warriors, but he didn\u2019t correct her assumption. \u201cIt comes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd understandably so. But to answer your question, my father has served as a Regent in the Midwest most of my life. I grew up and went to school in the St. Louis area, so this is my first big move.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes looked a bit sad as she toyed with a paper napkin. Could she be as lonely as he was even though surrounded by a crush of people? Almost of its own volition his hand settled over hers, taking as much comfort from the brief touch as it was meant to give.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot to deal with right now, but soon things won\u2019t seem so strange. At least that\u2019s been true for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his, her smile a bit shy. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice man, Larem Jones. At least now I feel like I have one friend here.\u201d</p><p>He slowly withdrew his hand, knowing he had no business trying to be her friend, much less touching her. When she found out that he was Kalith, she\u2019d probably scrub that hand raw to remove any trace of his. But right now all he could think about was how soft her skin was and how kissable her mouth looked.</p><p>It was definitely time to put some distance between himself and temptation. \u201cI should be going or I\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stood up. \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p><p>They walked out the door together. He stopped at the next corner. \u201cThis is where I leave you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile warmed his day. \u201cThank you again for the coffee break. I definitely needed it. Next time will be my treat.\u201d</p><p>He just knew he was going to regret this, but for the sake of Lusahn\u2019s kids, he had to try. \u201cActually, I come by here most days about this time. You know, if you happen to be in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. I can\u2019t tomorrow, but the day after would work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a date.\u201d Not really.</p><p>She held out her hand for him to shake. His hand dwarfed her much more delicate one, but there was unexpected strength in her grasp. He should let go, but she didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to break their small connection either. The heat of the sun had nothing on the intense awareness he was feeling at the moment. It was all he could do to maintain even a small distance between them, when what he really wanted was to find out what would happen if they did more than shake hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she finally tugged on her hand, he smiled and let go. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your day, Miss Willis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d gotten beyond the formal stage, Larem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha, then. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of days.\u201d Then he bowed his head slightly before walking away.</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>Duke\u2019s day had truly sucked big-time. He hated patrolling the alley outside the Paladins\u2019 headquarters. It was hard enough to be polite to every Paladin who strolled by, but it really burned his ass to put up with those damned Kaliths acting as if they owned the place.</p><p>Things had been changing over the past few months and not for the better. Colonel Kincade had had his faults, but at least he\u2019d known the guards were the real heroes around the place. The Paladins fought like madmen, but they could afford to be reckless with their lives. They weren\u2019t playing for keeps, because even if the fuckers were killed they didn\u2019t stay that way. Freaks.</p><p>The guards, though, were pure human stock, guaranteed to bleed and die if their wounds were bad enough. That was why the Paladins usually bore the brunt of the fighting, but not always. Sometimes the barrier went down too often or stayed that way too long for the Paladins to handle it all on their own. That was when the guards were thrown into the battle as sword-fodder.</p><p>Duke punched out, picked up his gear, and left the building. Home next or a quick stop at the local watering hole for a cold one? No contest.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to reach the bar where the guards hung out. He spotted a few of his buddies at a big table on the far side of the room. He signaled the waitress to bring him a microbrew and a burger before weaving his way through the clutter of tables and chairs.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Duke, come park your ass over here,\u201d one of them yelled.</p><p>He tossed his bag in the corner and pulled up a chair. He knew most of the guys at the table, but the one on his immediate right wasn\u2019t familiar.</p><p>He stuck out his hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Duke. You must be new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be,\u201d the guy said after giving Duke\u2019s hand a firm shake. \u201cMy name\u2019s Rusty. I just transferred in from California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you up here? From what I\u2019ve heard, the California office is a pretty cushy assignment.\u201d</p><p>The guy shrugged, his gaze sliding past Duke as if to see who might be listening before answering. \u201cSeems lately all the action is up here.\u201d</p> <p>What the hell was that supposed to mean? \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Rusty seemed to hesitate. \u201cI heard rumors about the stuff the Paladins have been pulling up here. Like hanging out with the enemy, arresting the local administrator\u2014you know, stuff. That last one was a shocker for sure. I\u2019d always heard good things about Colonel Kincade.\u201d</p><p>He quit talking long enough to stop a passing waitress. He held out a twenty-dollar bill. \u201cMiss, would you bring me and my friend each another beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Duke protested.</p><p>\u201cYou can buy the next round.\u201d Rusty munched on a handful of pretzels. \u201cSo what did you think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Duke asked, although he could guess.</p><p>\u201cKincade.\u201d</p><p>Duke wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled with the direction of this conversation. Still, there was no reason not to answer. \u201cThe man always gave the guards a fair shake, but he had problems with the Paladins and their pet Others. A couple of months back, they arrested him and shipped his ass back east for the Regents to deal with. No idea what they had on him. Some folks think they faked the charges because he didn\u2019t put up with their crap.\u201d</p> <p>Duke was one of those folks, but he kept that to himself.</p><p>Rusty sneered. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d heard that, too. I could hardly believe it when I saw a pair of those Others wandering through headquarters all alone. Maybe Kincade had the right of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Rusty took a long pull off his beer. \u201cI hear Kincade\u2019s replacement is a woman. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Duke nodded. \u201cSasha Willis. She seemed nice enough at first.\u201d</p><p>Rusty\u2019s eyes lit up with interest. \u201cSomething happen to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe Duke should shut up now before he said something he shouldn\u2019t. \u201cNothing. She\u2019s been real friendly. I just get twitchy when people start poking their noses in our business.\u201d</p><p>That much was true, but it was watching her act so friendly to that bastard Larem that had Duke seeing red. Time to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Rusty, are you a baseball fan?\u201d</p><p>Sasha stared at the door, waiting for a knock that seemed destined never to come. Not that her guests were late, but a lot rested on the success of this meeting. She had so many questions and suspected that if anyone had the answers, it would be Devlin Bane and Dr. Laurel Young.</p><p>There was one major problem with the plan. Earlier in the day, she\u2019d discovered some substantial irregularities in the Paladin financial records. Someone had authorized salaries for three additional Paladins, only these particular individuals were apparently phantoms. Their names didn\u2019t appear on any duty rosters, nor had she been able to find any personal information on them.</p><p>She clenched her hands until they hurt. Without a doubt they weren\u2019t phantoms at all. No, they had crossed from another world, one that bred crazed killers. Everyone knew the Seattle Paladins were sheltering the bastards, but it had come as a shock that they were using Regent funds.</p><p>The whole idea made her furious. How many Paladins had died because of them? Eventually she\u2019d have to confront Devlin with the evidence, but unfortunately, right now she needed his support, as well as that of his wife. Devlin Bane was crucial to maintaining stability in the region. She couldn\u2019t risk exposing the problem\u2014not yet anyway.</p><p>The Regents thought the Seattle crowd was unruly now. She could only imagine how bad it would be if she toppled their leader and brought him up on charges of treason and theft. Not that he\u2019d spend a single minute in a civilian jail or courtroom. The only option when it came to a Paladin who was out of control was a lethal injection. The thought made her physically ill.</p><p>The long-awaited knock finally came. She drew a calming breath and pasted a smile on her face, hoping it looked more sincere than it felt. Nervous now that the moment was upon her, she wiped her sweaty palms on her slacks and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cDevlin, Laurel, please come in.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the room, Laurel made no effort to be discreet as she checked out Sasha\u2019s suite. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s still a hotel room, though. I\u2019m looking forward to finding a place of my own.\u201d</p><p>Sasha led the way toward the living area. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look yet, but I hope to squeeze in some time this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re planning on staying in Seattle for a while?\u201d Devlin asked the question as he settled into the corner of the sofa. \u201cI\u2019d gotten the impression you were the scouting expedition and that the Board of Regents would assign someone permanently after you reported back.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he had contacts back in the Midwest that she hadn\u2019t known about. The Regents\u2019 plans for the area were supposed to be a secret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll consider assigning me permanently. After all, by the time I\u2019ve finished my assessment, I will know the inner workings of this sector better than any current member of the Regents would. Any other person would have to start over at square one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense to me, especially if you find you like it here,\u201d Laurel said, frowning. \u201cYou know, maybe I could help with your apartment hunt. I own a condo here in town that\u2019s just been cleaned and painted top to bottom. We\u2019d planned to put it up for sale, but I\u2019m in no hurry, especially with the market as poor as it is. It\u2019s even mostly furnished.\u201d</p><p>Sasha considered the offer. That would so simplify her life. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure, I\u2019d love to see the place.\u201d</p><p>Laurel pulled a key ring from her purse and laid it on the coffee table. \u201cWhen you get a chance, check it out and let me know what you think. We can work out rent and stuff if you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Another knock at the door signaled it was time to play hostess. \u201cI had the hotel prepare some hors d\u2019oeuvres for us and bring up some of my new favorite wine from a local vineyard.\u201d</p><p>On her way to the door, Sasha glanced at Devlin. \u201cUnless you\u2019d prefer I sent down for some beer?\u201d</p><p>Laurel laughed. \u201cOh, does she have your number, mister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Laurel.\u201d Devlin looked mildly insulted. \u201cSeriously, wine will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>For the next half hour, the three of them made small talk. Laurel and Devlin gave Sasha recommendations about restaurants and told her the sights worth seeing around town. Sasha told them about her first visit to the famous Pike Place Market.</p><p>\u201cYou know, until they started slinging salmon over the counter, I didn\u2019t believe they really threw fish around. I was just glad I wasn\u2019t in the line of fire.\u201d Sasha laughed at the memory and mentioned other shops she\u2019d checked out.</p><p>She looked at Devlin. \u201cOne of your men was nice enough to suggest whale watching while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin looked puzzled. \u201cWho was that? I don\u2019t recall any of them mentioning they\u2019d gone. Not that I\u2019d mind if they did. They all deserve more time off than they get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarem Jones. I ran into him after I left your office the other day. Since he was headed in the same general direction, we stopped for coffee.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself another half glass of wine, but that didn\u2019t keep her from noticing the concerned looks exchanged between her guests.</p><p>\u201cOops, did I let the cat out of the bag? If he was AWOL for a day, please don\u2019t let my big mouth cause him problems,\u201d Sasha said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Larem\u2019s relatively new to the area. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been enjoying some of the sights on his days off.\u201d Devlin tossed back the last of his wine and set the glass down on the table with a shade too much force.</p><p>Interesting. The time she\u2019d spent in Larem\u2019s company had definitely been one of the highlights in her stay so far. But rather than press the matter\u2014or admit that she and Larem had met again since then to wander along the waterfront and to visit the aquarium\u2014it was time to get back to business.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve both had a long day, so I\u2019ll get to the point. I won\u2019t lie to you about my purpose in being here. Yes, I want to make things better for the Paladins in any way I can. I assure you that I have the utmost respect for both their service and their sacrifices.\u201d</p><p>She paused to let that sink in before she dropped the hammer. \u201cBut quite frankly, the Board of Regents has some serious concerns over the events that have transpired here in Seattle the past couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Devlin leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, all pretense at casual conversation gone. \u201cWhich events would those be? The one where a Regent went rogue back in Missouri and killed Judge Nichols, all right under the Board\u2019s nose? Or when Colonel Kincade, one of their favorite lapdogs, was trafficking in stolen goods and illegal immigration?\u201d</p><p>Laurel jumped in. \u201cNot to mention that he went out of his way to make life a living hell for the Paladins here. I know you\u2019ve promised additional funding, but what if it\u2019s too little, too late? Without naming names, I can personally testify that Kincade\u2019s brutality caused permanent damage to some of my patients.\u201d</p><p>Sasha watched as the doctor struggled for control. Although Kincade had hidden his tracks well for a long time, she had no doubt that Dr. Young was telling the truth.</p><p>Laurel entwined her fingers with Devlin\u2019s and stared at their joined hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sasha. I know Kincade\u2019s actions were not your fault. However, no one on the Board of Regents would listen when I repeatedly reported what was going on. The additional funding is wonderful, but it\u2019s a little difficult to be grateful for what should\u2019ve been forthcoming all along. I also resent the Board sitting in judgment on decisions that were made under very difficult circumstances.\u201d</p><p>How horrific were the scenes playing out in Laurel\u2019s mind to fill her dark eyes with such utter grief? Now wasn\u2019t the time to ask.</p> <p>\u201cLook, all I can tell you is that the Regents will be taking a more active approach to governing the whole organization worldwide. Like it or not, they realize that they\u2019ve contributed to the situation by giving individual administrators like Kincade far too much autonomy. They feel\u2014and I agree\u2014that we must step back and assess what is working now and what has worked in the past. Once we have a clearer picture of the situation, then we can all move forward together.\u201d</p><p>Devlin looked thoroughly disgusted. \u201cSasha, do you have any idea how many times I\u2019ve heard that same bullshit over the years? Yes, there have to be some rules in place, but I have a hard time with a bunch of paper pushers and number crunchers sitting in a boardroom making decisions without consulting those who actually get their hands bloody day after day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut without rules . . .\u201d Sasha started to protest but stopped. \u201cOkay, I get what you\u2019re saying and even agree, to a certain extent. One reason I volunteered to come is that I want to hear your side of the discussion. I\u2019d like to think that ultimately we share the same goals.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that I learn everything I can from the ground up, without restriction or interference. I\u2019ve been involved in similar situations before this, although not on the same scale, and I can tell you one thing that doesn\u2019t work is anything less than total transparency from both parties.\u201d</p><p>Devlin clearly wasn\u2019t buying it, not completely anyway. \u201cSo where does that leave us? What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Sasha considered her words carefully. \u201cI have some discretionary budget I can use any way I see fit. Part of that is already earmarked for Laurel\u2019s department, but I\u2019d like your take on how the remaining money can best be put to good use. I want it to have a direct, positive impact on the quality of life for the Paladins.</p> <p>\u201cTo that end, I\u2019d like a report from you by the end of next week with any suggestions you might have. It would help if you could prioritize them, but we can discuss that in more detail once I\u2019ve had a chance to review the report.\u201d</p><p>There. She\u2019d laid her cards on the table. It was up to them to play theirs next.</p><p>Devlin slowly leaned back, still holding his wife\u2019s hand as if it helped keep him grounded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work on the report, but not alone.\u201d</p><p>Sasha nodded. \u201cI was hoping that you and Laurel would put your heads together on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will, but I\u2019ll want to bring a few of my men in on it, too.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly what she had wanted to hear, but neither did she want to shoot him down right out of the gate. \u201cWho do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Devlin\u2019s mouth quirked up in a small smile. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p> <p>They both knew she hadn\u2019t had time to get to know the locals well enough to judge who would have useful input and who wouldn\u2019t. Even so, she needed to maintain some control over the situation.</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not. I\u2019d appreciate it if you limited it to no more than five of your men, ones who can keep a secret. I don\u2019t want the other department heads demanding their \u2018fair share\u2019 of the budget. Depending on your suggestions, they may end up getting some of the pie, but only if it has the impact we want.\u201d</p><p>Devlin looked decidedly happier. \u201cOkay, then it\u2019s a deal. For what it\u2019s worth, the guys I have in mind are Blake Trahern, Cullen Finley, D.J. Clayborne, and Lonzo Jones.\u201d</p><p>He repeated the names more slowly when Sasha reached for a pad and paper.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all good men and know how to keep their mouths shut. When your whole life has been one big secret, you learn early how to fly under the radar. They also hang out in my office a lot, so no one will think anything of it if they\u2019re in there more than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>She studied the names, noting Lonzo\u2019s last name was the same as Larem\u2019s. Were they brothers? And why wasn\u2019t Larem on Devlin\u2019s list? Hmm.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank both of you for coming tonight. We\u2019ve made a solid start on fixing what\u2019s been broken for way too long. I\u2019m hoping these changes will help us all get back on track.\u201d</p><p>She really did. Men\u2019s lives depended on it. Too many had died already because of bad management and simple carelessness.</p><p>\u201cI will be seeing a lot of both of you as we move forward. As you\u2019ve probably already guessed, I believe in hands-on management. I\u2019m well aware that will ruffle some feathers, but I\u2019m convinced the problem has been the lack of direct contact between those who control the purse strings and those who do the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Devlin shook his head. \u201cLook, I know you mean well, but there are areas that are off-limits to civilians, and for good reason.\u201d</p><p>Time to make her position clear. If she blinked now, she\u2019d lose all chance of maintaining control. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t have the authority to restrict my movements, Devlin. I can\u2014and will\u2014go wherever I need to. The Board of Regents has granted me full access.\u201d</p><p>Then she offered what she hoped was a conciliatory smile. \u201cJust tell me where I need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have the right to see anything and everything, Ms. Willis, but I\u2019m the one responsible for the safety of all who enter Paladin headquarters. I will not allow you to wander the tunnels unescorted. And before you think we\u2019re trying to hide something, Lacey Sebastian works for the organization as a geologist and is under the same restrictions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d And she did. \u201cI promise to use common sense, but I can\u2019t let you dictate how I do my job.\u201d</p><p>Neither of her guests looked convinced, but they couldn\u2019t say they hadn\u2019t been warned. \u201cAgain, all I\u2019m asking is that you give me a chance. And if you have a problem with something I\u2019ve done or said, I\u2019d appreciate your coming straight to me with it. My door will always be open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you mean that.\u201d Devlin stood and helped Laurel up off the sofa.</p><p>Sasha followed them to the door. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>Once they were gone, Sasha got ready for bed. A few minutes later, she crawled between the sheets and turned out the bedside light.</p><p>God, it had been a long day\u2014too long. She had no doubt that tomorrow would be just like it, but right now she was too tired to think that far ahead.</p><p>Instead, her mind filled with the image of Larem Jones smiling as he walked away from her. She really hoped she hadn\u2019t gotten him in trouble with Devlin. Maybe she should warn him. No, bad idea. Her working relationship with Devlin was too fragile to risk getting between him and one of his men.</p><p>As she drifted off to sleep, her last thought was that she\u2019d just have to find some other excuse to see Larem Jones again.</p><p>Larem stared at the flyer on the shelter bulletin board and cursed. It had been two days since he\u2019d last seen Sasha after spending an afternoon with her down at the piers. Forty-eight hours of spinning his wheels and getting nowhere on his assigned mission of further befriending her. Torn between wanting to spend more time with her for his own selfish reasons and his guilt over the whole idea of spying on her, he\u2019d considered and rejected several ideas.</p><p>He pulled the paper down off the board to study it further. There was going to be an outdoor concert at the zoo to raise money for various animal-related causes. It was exactly the kind of event that would appeal to Sasha, not to mention himself. Dr. Isaac even had tickets for sale right there on the premises\u2014so it couldn\u2019t be simpler. Just buy the tickets and make the call.</p><p>But were the gods smiling upon him or out to drive him crazy? Only one way to find out. He reached for his phone and started dialing.</p><p>Larem waited at the edge of the rose garden by the zoo entrance, trying to find Sasha in the milling crowd. The early evening air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers. He slowly filled his lungs, enjoying the calming combination of their scent and incredible beauty. As always, it seemed as if everything in this world was more intense, more vivid, than back home in Kalithia. His world had its own beauty, but it was definitely different.</p><p>\u201cHi, Larem. I hope you weren\u2019t waiting long.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and smiled down at Sasha. \u201cNot at all. We have plenty of time before the concert. I thought you might enjoy a stroll here in the rose garden before we go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>As they walked along, neither of them said much, but the silence felt comfortable rather than awkward. After a bit, she stopped to admire a particularly spectacular blossom. He had no idea what it was called, but it was the color of fire\u2014a burnished gold center deepening to a dark red along the edges of the petals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It reminded him of Sasha\u2019s hair, set off to perfection by the dark purple shirt she wore with a long white skirt that swirled around her ankles as she walked. Once again she\u2019d twisted her hair up on top of her head. He pictured himself kissing the elegant curve of her neck just before he removed the wooden sticks to set her hair free.</p><p>He\u2019d dearly love to see it down loose around her shoulders\u2014or better yet, spread out on his pillow as he kissed that sprinkling of freckles on her nose. Something of what he was thinking must have shown in his expression, because when Sasha glanced in his direction, she blushed and immediately hurried on toward the next bed of roses.</p><p>But she did take his hand and tug him along in her wake. That small gesture vanquished the knot of nerves in his chest. For the moment, it was enough to pretend they were just an ordinary couple out to enjoy an evening of music and each other\u2019s company.</p><p>The concert was winding down, the musicians putting one last burst of high energy into their encore. Sasha couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d enjoyed a night out more. Larem had produced a blanket from his pack for them to sit on. After they\u2019d staked out their spot, he\u2019d gotten each of them a lemonade and a piece of strawberry shortcake.</p> <p>Watching him savor the sinful berries heaped high with whipped cream had been an amazingly sensual experience. It was almost as if he were tasting the decadent dessert for the first time.</p><p>She barely knew the man, but there was just something about him that stirred emotions in her that had lain dormant for a long, long time. First college and then her heavy work schedule had left little time for a social life. Or at least that had been her excuse. The truth was, when she\u2019d met David Booker, she\u2019d fallen fast and hard for him. Although she\u2019d known the risks of getting involved with a Paladin, she\u2019d hadn\u2019t been able to help herself. And when he\u2019d died, it had almost destroyed her.</p><p>Yet here she was, risking the same kind of pain all over again. At twenty-eight, she should be old enough to know better, but obviously not. The more time she spent in Larem\u2019s company, the more reckless she felt. How would it feel to kiss that stern mouth? What kind of lover would he be? Maybe she should just toss the dice and see where the night led them.</p><p>Despite its being late summer, there was a chill in the air as the sun went down. Larem noticed when she shivered and leaned toward her. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit. I\u2019m not used to the way the temperature drops here at night.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, then wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her in close, sharing the warmth of his body.</p><p>\u201cIs that better?\u201d His voice was a deep rumble near her ear, sending a whole different kind of shiver through her.</p><p>Oh, mama, yes!</p><p>But she kept that comment to herself and just nodded. Too bad the concert was about to end. She could\u2019ve happily spent hours sitting right there, enjoying the night with Larem.</p><p>When the song ended, the crowd surged to their feet, applauding loudly. She reluctantly joined them, immediately missing Larem\u2019s touch.</p><p>He folded up the blanket and stowed it back in his pack. \u201cThe zoo is open for another hour. Want to wander around a bit before we call it a night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>It seemed only natural for him to take her hand, especially with the jostle of the people surrounding them. In just a few seconds, the crowd thinned out, leaving the two of them wandering down a path with only a handful of others nearby.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the music?\u201d</p><p>Larem nodded. \u201cVery much. We should do this again sometime. I think they do a whole series of concerts here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d A lot.</p><p>When a smaller path branched off to the left, Larem took it. The sign said it led toward the animals of the African savanna. As dark as it was, they\u2019d not likely be able to see much, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care. She was really hoping Larem was more interested in finding them a bit of privacy than seeing what the zebras were up to.</p><p>Sure enough, when they were alone, he dropped his bag on the ground and turned to face her in the faint glow of a distant lamppost. His big hands gently came to rest on her shoulders. She responded by sliding her palms up the hard planes of his chest. His pale eyes stared down into hers for the longest time.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019ve been wanting to do this all evening.\u201d</p> <p>Before she knew what he was going to do, he tugged the chopsticks out of the knot on top of her head. The heat in his smile climbed several degrees as he finger-combed her hair, sending the unruly waves spilling down around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would feel like silk. You should wear it down all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets in the way when I work.\u201d</p><p>His accent thickened considerably when he murmured, \u201cThen wear it this way just for me.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her\u2014finally. His lips settled over hers, gently at first but then with considerably more fire. He tasted hot and male and potent. Grabbing on to the soft cotton of his shirt, Sasha held on with all the strength she could muster. The feel of his hands as they touched and tempted warmed her from the inside out. The man sure knew how to heat up a cool Seattle night.</p><p>She liked that about him. Before she could tell him so, he lifted her off the ground and carried her backward several steps.</p><p>\u201cUh, Larem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bench,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then he sat down and settled her across his lap. Oh, yeah, he was just full of good ideas. She kissed him hard and deep, the tip of her tongue inviting his to play.</p><p>Sasha didn\u2019t know about Larem, but she was about to go up in flames as his fingertips brushed across the curve of her breasts. She arched into his touch, asking for more. He didn\u2019t hesitate, cupping her breast in his palm with a gentle squeeze and coaxing her nipple into a hard peak with his finger and thumb. Immediately a need for so much more pooled deep inside her, making her wish they were somewhere more private.</p><p>Then his hand settled on her ankle before stroking upward, slipping under the hem of her skirt. He hesitated just below her knee.</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d</p><p>Her name became both a caress and a question on his lips. Her breath caught in her chest as she read the intent in his eyes. She should stop him. It was too much. Too fast. Too soon. But she couldn\u2019t find the words or the will to hold back. Instead, she buried her face against his neck, drawing in the scent of his skin.</p><p>Larem took that as a yes. Smiling against her hair, he pressed a soft kiss on her forehead as his hand resumed its journey. She sighed and closed her eyes as he took his time to learn the soft curve of her knee.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he demanded as he stroked the top of her smooth thigh.</p><p>Her lips found his, opening for him like roses in the bright light of the sun. Oh, yeah, this moment was so perfect, her response to his touch beyond anything he\u2019d hoped for. He eased his hand between her legs, going slowly to give her a chance to protest. She didn\u2019t, not even when he sought out the center of her heat.</p><p>One stroke had her moaning, two had her arching up, her legs squeezing tight against his wrist and locking his hand in place. He continued the gentle assault, stroking and pressing, wanting nothing more than to lay Sasha down and make love to her.</p><p>For now, he\u2019d settle for having her come apart in his arms. He eased past her flimsy panties, stroking deeper, faster, harder.</p><p>\u201cLarem! Please, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wanted to give this to her. \u201cYes, you can. I\u2019ve got you. Just let go.\u201d</p><p>Then she shuddered, her head falling against his shoulder as the storm broke within her. He held her close as they rode it out together. When he finally remembered how to breathe, he tugged her skirt back down, struggling to find the words to describe what the moment had meant to him.</p><p>But then he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. They ended abruptly with an embarrassed, \u201cWhoops! Excuse us!\u201d</p><p>They both froze until the intruders retreated. Sasha suspected she was blushing big-time, but then Larem laughed quietly and pressed one more kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhoops, indeed,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>She reluctantly joined in the laughter. What had she been thinking, to let things get so far out of control? Not that she could bring herself to really regret it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I haven\u2019t gotten caught making out like that since I was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while for me, too,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut they\u2019re still good memories.\u201d</p><p>Then he set her back on her feet and stood up. After picking up his pack, he said, \u201cI guess we should be moving on.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again before they headed back toward the main path. She laced her fingers with his as they made their way to the exit, where she called for a cab. As they waited, Larem\u2019s cell phone rang. His expression went from happy to grim in the space of a heartbeat as he listened to the person on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Just go.\u201d</p><p>He listened another few seconds, holding the phone in a white-knuckled grip. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure. And, Lonzo, watch your back. I don\u2019t want to break in a new roommate. I\u2019ve barely got you trained.\u201d He hung up and loosed a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. A knot of pure fear settled in her chest.</p><p>\u201cThat was Lonzo. He\u2019s been called out again. The barrier near St. Helens is still down. They\u2019re sending in a second wave to support the guys who\u2019ve been fighting since noon. It sounds pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the sky the whole time he was talking, the vein on the side of his neck visibly pulsing. Clearly knowing his friend was headed into combat was hitting Larem hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you being sent in, too?\u201d she asked, mentally crossing her fingers that he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He simply shook his head, offering no explanation. She didn\u2019t miss the fact that he was flexing his sword hand as he stood there. Obviously he wished he were being ordered into the fray.</p><p>Suddenly images of David\u2019s memorial came rushing back to Sasha, only this time it was Larem\u2019s picture being displayed, surrounded by flowers. Even if it didn\u2019t happen tonight, it would someday. A crippling pain lanced her heart. There was no way she could endure that again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What had she been thinking, getting involved with another Paladin?</p><p>Luckily, her cab pulled up, forestalling the need to say anything more. The ride back to her hotel was blessedly short. Larem\u2019s thoughts were obviously elsewhere, which left her alone with her own. Despite how much she\u2019d enjoyed the evening\u2014especially the part after the concert\u2014Lonzo\u2019s phone call had been a splash of ice-cold water, forcing her to face the risk she was taking.</p><p>Larem slid out of the backseat and offered his hand to help her out. After he paid the cabdriver, she led the way over to the shadows at the side of the entrance.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even begin to smile. \u201cLarem, listen, I have something to say. I hope you\u2019ll understand that it\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d</p> <p>But it was. It had everything to do with what he was and what he did for a living. He knew it, too.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time tonight. I can\u2019t remember the last time I enjoyed myself more, but . . .\u201d She paused, finding it nearly impossible to talk around the lump in her throat. David was her secret, and she didn\u2019t know Larem well enough to share. She settled for the easy lie.</p><p>\u201cBut as the new administrator, I have too much on my plate right now to get involved with anyone, especially a Paladin who technically works for me. I\u2019m truly sorry, but I hope you can understand.\u201d</p><p>His reaction struck her as odd. Rather than getting angry, he actually laughed, although it had nothing to do with humor. She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p> <p>Once again, he ran a strand of her hair through his fingers. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not funny. I believe the correct word is \u2018ironic,\u2019 but I do understand all too well. Good-bye, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips across hers one last time and walked away, disappearing into the night.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Sasha had spent the days since her date with Larem wading through paperwork until she thought her eyes would bleed. Anything was better than second-guessing her decision not to see him again. Still, trying to clean up the mess left by her predecessor hadn\u2019t helped her mood at all, leaving her wanting to take a baseball bat to the man. Kincade, not Larem.</p><p>She had to give him credit, though. The bastard had done a bang-up job hiding his tracks. Finally, she\u2019d borrowed D. J. Clayborne\u2019s services from Devlin to work on the computer files. She\u2019d left him back in her office to do his magic on Kincade\u2019s personal computer. Hopefully, he\u2019d have better luck.</p><p>But right now, she had a date with adventure.</p> <p>The last time she\u2019d spoken to Devlin, he\u2019d reluctantly agreed to give her a brief tour of the tunnels under the Paladin headquarters. She was excited about the prospect of finally seeing the barrier for herself. Then, in his last e-mail, Devlin told her that he\u2019d been called away because Mount St. Helens was once again causing problems. Luckily, he\u2019d arranged for Lonzo Jones to meet her at the elevator at two thirty that afternoon.</p><p>She\u2019d almost canceled, not sure she wanted to spend time with Larem\u2019s roommate, but decided that was silly. The man could hardly hold it against her that her last date with his friend hadn\u2019t ended well. That is, if Larem had even told Lonzo about it.</p><p>Either way, she was about to find out. The shortest route to their meeting place led her past Devlin\u2019s office and the cluster of desks that surrounded it. The entire area was empty and silent. The hallway leading to the elevator was equally deserted.</p><p>\u201cLonzo, I hope you didn\u2019t forget about me. I was really looking forward to this,\u201d she whispered to herself, looking at her watch.</p><p>Maybe he was simply running late. Just in case, she needed to call her assistant to clear her calendar for the remainder of the day. When she tried her cell, though, she had no reception, probably because she was right over the barrier.</p><p>She did an abrupt about-face and went back to use one of the landlines. For good measure, she\u2019d leave Devlin a message, too, thanking him again for arranging the tour. If Lonzo came while she was gone, surely he\u2019d wait a few minutes.</p><p>He watched the big boss disappear back down the hall, hating the way the bitch strolled through the place like she owned it. It was bad enough the Regents had sided with the Paladins against the one man who\u2019d ever backed the guards over those prima donnas. But instead of someone to kick ass and take names, they\u2019d sent that woman, all because her daddy was a Regent. Did she really think she was capable of handling all the shit that went on around here?</p><p>Well, maybe a little scare was in order. The barrier readings down below had been stable for several days. Perhaps getting trapped below ground would be enough to send her running home to papa. It was worth a shot.</p> <p>It sounded like the Paladin assigned to escort her had been delayed for some reason, too. With luck, the guy wouldn\u2019t show up until she was already in the elevator and on her way down to the tunnels. After scribbling a few words on a sticky note, he stuck it on the elevator door and took off down the hall.</p><p>Sasha spotted a note on the elevator and sighed. She\u2019d missed Lonzo by a matter of minutes. Hopefully he hadn\u2019t bailed on her.</p><p>She peeled the note off the door and read it. Good, only the meeting place had changed. She keyed in her security code on the touchpad to summon the elevator up from below. It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>After one last look up and down the hall, she stepped inside. The doors whooshed shut and the elevator dropped, making her feel as if the floor had fallen out beneath her feet. Her stomach churned as she held on to the handrail with a death grip. The pounding of her heart was the only sound as she plummeted toward the barrier.</p><p>Seconds later, the elevator hit the ground with a jarring thump. She swallowed hard as the doors slid open. Outside, the air smelled of damp rock as she poked her head out to look around. The elevator was tucked in behind a stone outcropping, severely limiting her view. Other than a distant buzz that sounded like the hum of high-power wires, the heavy silence made her wonder exactly where her escort was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cLonzo?\u201d No answer. She tried again, louder this time, but still with no success.</p><p>What the heck was going on? Darn it, she\u2019d been really excited about the chance to see the barrier firsthand after all these years of hearing people struggle to describe it. She read Lonzo\u2019s note again. It clearly said he\u2019d be waiting by the barrier for her, but she couldn\u2019t see it from where she stood. She moved tentatively forward, reluctant to wander very far from the elevator.</p><p>Surely it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a quick peek around the corner to look for Lonzo before she returned upstairs. She crept forward, straining to hear even the slightest hint that anyone else was in the tunnels. The motion-activated lights flickered on as she moved forward, illuminating the tunnel for some distance in each direction. The place was empty as far as she could see.</p><p>Her intention to stage an immediate retreat was put on hold as soon as she saw the dazzling, solid sheet of energy. Words couldn\u2019t describe the swirling colors that changed and shifted and then changed again. It might be deadly to the touch, but why had no one ever told her the barrier was beyond beautiful?</p><p>She had to get back but hated to look away for fear she\u2019d miss a wisp of color that might never be seen again. It wasn\u2019t lost on her that she stood mere inches away from another world, one unlike anything she could possibly imagine. All she knew for certain was that it bred cold-blooded killers who destroyed lives, leaving more than just their intended victims bleeding and hurt.</p><p>She closed her eyes to block out the mesmerizing murmur of power and beauty, wishing she could slam the door on her memories as easily. But some things\u2014and some people\u2014deserved to be remembered despite the pain that never faded. David\u2019s dark chocolate eyes and broad smile were burned into her brain, their image as bright now as when she first met him. Eight years wasn\u2019t all that long, but it seemed like forever since she\u2019d last touched his face or tasted his kiss.</p><p>He was her first love. He\u2019d sworn her to secrecy before confessing he was a Paladin. Two days after he\u2019d proposed to her, he\u2019d died, first from a sword wielded by an Other, and then a second time from a syringe full of poison administered by his Handler.</p><p>She shivered, but not entirely because of the chill in the subterranean tunnels. Time to get back topside. She\u2019d check in with Devlin later to reschedule the tour and demand an explanation from Lonzo about why he\u2019d ditched her. She headed for the elevator, but the steady buzz from the barrier increased in volume.</p><p>Looking back, she frowned. What the heck? The barrier was no longer opaque. The colors were still bright, but she could see shadows moving through the translucent curtain. Okay, this was bad. Maybe really, really bad. One of the two most common signs that the barrier was about to go down was that it thinned out, revealing hints of the world that lay beyond.</p><p>The other sign was sudden streaks of sickly colors replacing the vibrant, healthy ones. Sure enough, gangrenous yellows and greens started to appear at the top near the ceiling of the tunnel and spread rapidly across the entire expanse.</p><p>She took off running for the elevator. She had to get it open\u2014now. Her fingers shook as she keyed in the code. No response. Why hadn\u2019t she at least thought to hold the elevator on the lower level for the few minutes she\u2019d been looking around?</p><p>Devlin had been right\u2014this was no place for a civilian to be wandering alone. As she waited for the elevator to return, she hoped she lived long enough for him to say he\u2019d told her so.</p><p>His spur-of-the-moment plan appeared to be working. He quickly keyed in the high-level security code that would recall the elevator and keep it topside. His clearance didn\u2019t warrant that kind of authority, but it helped to have friends in high places.</p><p>He grinned as he felt the small blast of air that signaled the approach of the elevator. Then he wiped his fingerprints off the keypad and headed down the hall, this time to leave the building. It wouldn\u2019t do to be seen lurking in the area once Sasha Willis managed to find her way back up topside.</p><p>\u201cCome in and sit down.\u201d Devlin led the way into his office and dropped into his own chair. \u201cI just got back from an all-nighter down at St. Helens, but I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Larem asked, although he could probably guess.</p><p>\u201cLast Friday Laurel and I had drinks with Sasha Willis. Imagine my surprise when your name came up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already knew we\u2019d met. I couldn\u2019t very well ignore her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Larem, I thought you had more sense. What the hell were you thinking? The last thing I wanted to hear out of Sasha Willis\u2019s mouth was that the two of you have been hanging out.\u201d</p><p>From past experience, Larem knew the best course of action was to let Devlin rant until he ran out of temper or breath, whichever came first. Trying to reason with the man before that happened would be a wasted effort. It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cWell? Care to explain?\u201d</p><p>Larem shifted in his chair, trying to come up with an answer that was close to the truth but wouldn\u2019t set Devlin off again. He sure couldn\u2019t admit that he\u2019d first sought her out because the Kalith and their closest allies didn\u2019t exactly trust Devlin\u2019s ability to ensure their safety. Worse yet, he\u2019d also spent time with her because he wanted to.</p><p>If Devlin was upset about him and Sasha sharing a cup of coffee, the man would go ballistic if he found out they\u2019d actually gone out more than once, especially if he knew about their last date. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was over. To avoid running into her again, Larem had made a trip up north to visit Hunter and his mate for a few days. Upon his return, Lonzo had warned him that Devlin was hot on his trail.</p><p>\u201cLast Tuesday, Ms. Willis was nosing around in the building after leaving your office and ended up by the geology lab. I was the one who answered the door because she\u2019d already met me but hadn\u2019t yet figured out that I am Kalith. I assumed that could change quickly if she saw Barak and me at the same time. Rather than risk inviting her in to meet him and Lacey, I chose to escort her out of the building. We parted a few blocks later after having a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>Devlin ran his fingers through his hair in obvious frustration. \u201cFine. I get why you intercepted her at the door, but the exit to the alley is right down the hall from where you were. The smart thing to do would\u2019ve been to tell her to go straight and then turn left. Why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Telling Devlin that it was because he wanted more time in her company would not be an acceptable answer. \u201cI pretended to be on my way out so that she wouldn\u2019t feel as if she were interrupting anything in the lab. However, Duke was on duty and saw me. Since he hates me, and I figured he\u2019d waste no time in telling her who and what I was, I stayed with her so he\u2019d keep his mouth shut. Once we were safely past him, I left Ms. Willis as soon as I could without being rude.\u201d</p> <p>Larem leaned back in his chair and watched as Devlin processed the information. Finally, the big man slowly nodded. \u201cSo you lingered over coffee just to be polite, knowing each minute she spends with you makes it more difficult for you to blend into the crowd around here?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so much for fooling Devlin. \u201cThe last thing I want\u2014or either of us needs\u2014is for her to get too curious about me, which is why I left town for a while. She hasn\u2019t seen me in days, so hopefully her attention is focused elsewhere by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it is. Unfortunately, it\u2019s on me. She\u2019s got me jumping through so many fucking hoops, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door kept Devlin from finishing that thought. \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>Lonzo poked his head in. \u201cHey, boss, sorry to interrupt, but I think we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Devlin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be giving Sasha Willis the grand tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I was, but I had a flat tire and just now got here. I tried her number and then yours. When neither of you answered, I called D.J. to stall her, but he\u2019s over in the admin building working on Kincade\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>He stopped to take a breath. \u201cThe rest of the crew just got back with you, so I ran the last few blocks to get here. There\u2019s no sign of the woman anywhere. Even worse, the elevator is on lockdown. It won\u2019t accept my access code. Honest, boss, I wasn\u2019t more than ten minutes late.\u201d</p><p>Larem had a bad, bad feeling about where all this was headed. He rose to his feet, ready to . . . what? Charge to her rescue? Yeah, like that was going to happen. Besides, there was no actual proof Sasha was in trouble.</p><p>Still, he knew for a fact that she\u2019d been exploring different areas in the building lately, because the guys had been talking about all the odd places she\u2019d been seen. Would she even hesitate to go exploring if her assigned guide didn\u2019t show up?</p><p>Devlin looked even more worried. \u201cI\u2019m the only one around here who has the authority to shut the elevators down completely, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Then he checked his cell and cursed; the battery was dead. He dug out his charger and plugged it in to listen to his messages. \u201cSon of a bitch! I don\u2019t know where that woman is now, but she was definitely here a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the Klaxons started blasting. Devlin immediately grabbed the sword he\u2019d yet to put away after his long night of fighting.</p><p>He glared at Larem again. \u201cKeep your fingers crossed that she\u2019s either back in her office or already on her way up from the tunnels, because if she\u2019s not . . .\u201d Devlin shook his head, not wanting to follow that thought to its obvious conclusion. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>Larem stayed where he was, frozen by the spectre of what would happen to Sasha if the Others got their hands on her. The light-sickness made them little better than animals, out of their heads and raging out of control. If Devlin and his men didn\u2019t get to Sasha first, Larem could only hope that she died quickly.</p><p>He stared at the weapons displayed on Devlin\u2019s wall and at one sword in particular. Then he was on his feet and reaching for the Kalith blade. The Paladin leader had no doubt captured it from an Other who\u2019d had the great misfortune to cross Devlin\u2019s path.</p><p>Devlin had never ordered Larem to stay out of the tunnels, but then he hadn\u2019t really needed to. The last thing Larem wanted was to face his own people in battle. This was different, though. Who knew what kind of hell Devlin and his men were walking into? They could be wading through puddles of blood with no time to spare to hunt for Sasha. Maybe they\u2019d be able to shove her back into the elevator and send her up to safety, but maybe not.</p><p>Larem headed for the elevator at a dead run, doing his best to steer clear of the Paladins and guards still pouring in. With battle fever running high, not all of them would immediately recognize Larem as an ally. There were also those among the guards who hated anyone with Kalith blood even more than the Paladins did and might use the situation to rid their world of one more enemy.</p><p>The elevator was still in use, warriors milling around and waiting for their chance to wade into the fray far below. No sign of Sasha.</p> <p>D.J. came running up, stuttering to a full stop when he spotted Larem. \u201cAre you fucking nuts or suicidal? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevlin thinks Sasha Willis might be trapped down below. Someone has to hunt for her while you guys fight.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin looked sick. \u201cSon of a bitch! Just what we need.\u201d</p><p>D.J. studied the massing warriors. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>The two of them ran back the way they\u2019d come, not stopping until they reached another elevator at the far end of the building. \u201cThis one will bring you out on the right level, but not immediately by the barrier.\u201d</p><p>D.J. keyed in his code and then repeated it to Larem. \u201cUse it to haul your ass back topside as soon as you find her. Be careful if you get near the fight. If things are as bad down there as they were last night at the mountain, it\u2019ll be hard to tell friend from crazy. Wouldn\u2019t want you to get skewered because some paper-pushing twit can\u2019t stay where she belongs. Your buddy Hunter would kick my ass off a cliff if I let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Then the Paladin was gone, leaving Larem to his own mission. As the elevator carried him down into the darkness, he prayed he got to Sasha in time.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Sasha whispered, peeking around the corner at the barrier.</p><p>As the seconds ticked by, its energy continued to weaken, leaving no doubt that the Others were poised to pour across en masse as soon as the barrier crashed. She retreated to the dubious safety near the elevator, which still hadn\u2019t returned. After keying in her code, she pressed her ear to the cool metal, hoping to hear it coming.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Then the scream of the alarms echoed through the tunnels, calling the Paladins to defend their world. That the cavalry was on its way was the good news. The bad news was that no civilian\u2019s security code worked on the elevators when there was fighting going on, not even hers. She\u2019d have to wait for the first load of Paladins to disembark before she could ride the elevator back up to safety.</p><p>But only if it got to her before those . . . those animals did. Had the barrier failed completely? She inched her way to the edge of the outcropping. Mustering her courage, Sasha peeked around the corner only long enough to confirm her worst nightmares stood but a few feet away. The center of the barrier was ripping apart, leaving enough room for the Others to pour through.</p><p>Except for their clothing, they looked human, at least at first. But on closer inspection, that pasty gray skin and those freaky pale eyes set them apart. Some hollered at the top of their lungs as they charged across, the guttural sounds pure gibberish to her ear. But there was no mistaking the hatred in their voices. They gradually spread out, curved blades clenched in their fists, looking for a fight.</p><p>So far, none had turned in her direction, but it was only a matter of time before some of them came looking for the fastest way to the surface. She slipped off her high heels and gripped one in each hand, knowing they would provide little protection against anyone armed with a sword. But if she pegged someone in the head, it might distract a pursuer long enough to give her time to get away.</p><p>She had no idea where she\u2019d end up, but standing there by the elevator was sure suicide. As soon as one of the Others came any closer, she\u2019d be trapped. Hoping the blare of the alarms would hide the sound of her footsteps, she started moving away from the barrier, first slowly and then faster and faster.</p><p>Where were the Paladins and the guards? Surely they should\u2019ve been there by now, but then maybe it was her fear that made it feel as if she\u2019d been trapped down there for hours already.</p><p>She slowed as she reached an intersecting tunnel. Which way to go? Right or left? Did it really matter when she didn\u2019t know where she was to begin with? Okay, right it was. The motion lights immediately flickered on to guide her. Clever technology, but they also served as a beacon to anyone who wanted to follow her trail.</p><p>Stopping to catch her breath, she waited for the lights to go back off, leaving her shrouded in darkness. As her pulse slowed, she could gradually hear more than the sound of her own heart pounding. Footsteps. Lots of them. Screams echoed down the passage and the clash of metal against metal. Obviously the troops had arrived. She prayed for the safety of the men she\u2019d gotten to know. Larem\u2019s face flashed in her mind.</p><p>The shuffle of footsteps was louder this time, but with all the noise it was hard to know how close they were or whether any Others had gotten past the Paladins. All she knew for sure was that the footsteps were headed her way. The darkness wouldn\u2019t protect her for long. As soon as any of them drew close enough to trigger the lights, she\u2019d be exposed.</p><p>No sooner did that thought cross her mind than the lights behind her flared. A band of four male Others shielded their eyes from the glare, but that didn\u2019t keep them from seeing her. The one in front bellowed something as they all charged forward. She didn\u2019t need to speak their language to understand what they had planned for her.</p><p>She screamed, threw her shoes as hard as she could, and took off running. As she ran for the corner ahead, the lights from that direction came on, too. Trapped! She had no idea who was coming toward her, but she knew full well that to stop where she was would be certain death.</p><p>She charged forward, hoping against hope that Devlin had gotten her message and sent someone to look for her. Please, God, please. Please let it be someone I know.</p><p>Her steps faltered as a curved blade appeared from around the corner. It was an unwritten rule that no Paladin carried a blade of that shape. She was running straight into a trap. With nowhere to go and no hope of survival, she stopped where she was and began to pray.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The battle at the barrier was in full swing. Larem chanted the prayers for the dead and dying under his breath as he made his way through the tunnels. How many of the Kalith were men he\u2019d known when they were sane, when he still served their people as one of Lusahn q\u2019Arc\u2019s Blademates? Not that it mattered. Neither he nor they were the same people they used to be.</p><p>Larem flexed his fingers on the pommel of his borrowed weapon, his mind flashing back to a time when he would\u2019ve joined the battle to protect his own kind. Now he had friends among the Paladins, and his people considered him a traitor. As always, he was a man caught between two worlds, neither of which much wanted him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least for the moment, he had a definite purpose. He backed away from the battle, needing to find another way around. Before he\u2019d gone two steps, he saw D.J. in the middle of the fight, wielding his double-headed ax with deadly purpose.</p><p>What D.J. didn\u2019t see was the Other coming up behind him with his sword swinging right at the Paladin\u2019s neck. Before Larem could shout out a warning, Trahern burst free of the melee long enough to remove the threat with one blow from his broadsword. Larem prayed for the soul of the dead warrior and walked away.</p><p>A narrow branch of tunnel cut back in the direction he needed to go. The profound relief he\u2019d felt that D.J. had been spared disturbed him on a gut level. The dead Other had been someone\u2019s son, brother, friend. Now he was nothing but a pile of bloody meat to be disposed of and forgotten. Larem understood the Paladins\u2019 reluctance to view their enemy as anything but rabid animals, but as a healer, he ached for all those who suffered a sickness for which there was no cure.</p><p>The never-ending cycle of death made him furious, and seeing it firsthand left him freezing cold inside. He trudged on, concentrating on the task at hand and doing his best to block out the screams of agony that bounced through the tunnels and echoed in his soul.</p> <p>Larem quickly learned to keep his focus on the floor and away from the sudden bursts of light that nearly blinded his sensitive Kalith eyes. When he reached a long stretch of clear passage, he broke into a run, slowing only when he reached the other end. Cocking his head to the side, he listened hard.</p><p>Heartbeats just ahead. Four had the staccato beat of Kaliths lost in the frenzy, but one was purely human. Either it was Sasha being hunted by his kind or else the four Others had managed to corner a Paladin alone. Either way, Larem had to intervene.</p><p>Bracing himself for battle, he rounded the last corner and came face-to-face with his worst nightmare come true. Four Kalith males were fanning out, closely stalking Sasha. They were enjoying the hunt, laughing maniacally as she retreated.</p><p>The one in the lead spoke to her, his English rough but his meaning all too clear. \u201cFemale, stop running. We don\u2019t want you to be too tired to be of use to us.\u201d He looked toward his companions. \u201cIf you please myself and my friends, perhaps we\u2019ll let you live.\u201d</p><p>Sasha stopped moving and threw her shoulders back. \u201cI\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p> <p>The Kalith pushed his long hair back from his face, his smile turning nasty. \u201cThat won\u2019t be as fun for us, but if you insist . . .\u201d</p><p>Larem didn\u2019t want to kill his own kind, but he wouldn\u2019t let them hurt Sasha, not when she was his to protect. So far they hadn\u2019t noticed him; he wasn\u2019t sure about Sasha.</p><p>He paused long enough to jerk the tie out of his hair, letting it hang free down around his shoulders. Raising his sword, he started forward, calling out a traditional greeting among Kalith warriors in their own language. \u201cMy brothers, how fare thee?\u201d</p><p>The leader jerked his attention away from Sasha long enough to answer, \u201cMy brother, we are about to fare very well.\u201d</p><p>Then his eyes flared wide as he took in the human attire Larem wore, and his smile turned feral. \u201cYou speak our language, but you carry the stench of Paladins.\u201d</p><p>Sasha finally recognized him. \u201cLarem? Thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored her as the three Others sniffed the air, growling low in their chests. One of them reached out toward Sasha, laughing when she shrank against the wall to avoid his touch.</p><p>This was going to end badly. Larem knew that and so did they. Still, for the sake of the oath he\u2019d sworn to serve his people, he had to try. \u201cMy brothers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not your brothers, not if you live in the light, traitor!\u201d The leader sidled closer to Sasha, his sword sliding back and forth in a promise of the fight to come. He switched to heavily accented English. \u201cTell us how to escape these tunnels and maybe we\u2019ll let the woman live.\u201d</p><p>Larem lowered his blade slightly, hoping to reduce the growing tension. \u201cI am no traitor, but I will not let you harm the woman. She has done nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is human. That is enough.\u201d</p><p>Time to try another tactic. \u201cThe light in this world has strengthened my gift of healing. Let me help you become the honorable warriors you were before the sickness took you.\u201d</p><p>For a second, the Other hesitated, but then his eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cYou lie! The healers of light and their skills are lost to the darkening. You want to steal our prize and bed the woman yourself. Why else would you be prowling these tunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Blademate to Lusahn q\u2019Arc and sworn to protect those who cannot defend themselves, human or Kalith.\u201d Larem brought his sword back up in full challenge. \u201cRetreat now or die.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman for the Others looked back to his three friends. \u201cSilence this fool while I enjoy the woman. Once he has bled out, we will all have her\u2014often.\u201d</p><p>The closest Other charged forward with violence in his eyes. Larem\u2019s scream mixed with Sasha\u2019s as he answered the Kalith\u2019s attack, cursing the gods for forcing him to kill those of his homeland. His opponent was an experienced swordsman but nowhere near the caliber of a Blademate. Larem left him bleeding on the ground and took the fight to the next one.</p><p>The leader was now holding Sasha by her hair, drawing in deep breaths of her scent. She kicked at him, but her bare foot did little damage. She had more success clawing at his face, even drawing blood. He immediately shoved her against the wall and pinned her there with the full press of his body against hers. Larem shouted out a warning in Kalith, telling the bastard in great detail what Larem would do to him if he took his assault on Sasha any further.</p><p>The other two took advantage of the distraction and charged him. It would be nothing less than a miracle if Larem managed to eliminate both bumbling crazies quickly enough to prevent the remaining one from hurting Sasha. With a quick spin, he slashed one across the neck. The male dropped to his knees, his sword clattering to the ground as he tried to stop the blood gushing from his throat.</p><p>Two down, two to go. There was no sign of sanity left in either of them. The kindest thing Larem could do was to end their lives quickly and cleanly. Stepping around the two bodies at his feet, he held out his free hand and dared them to join in the deadly dance.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Others,\u201d he said, sneering as he called them by that hated name. \u201cI grow bored with this. Give me the woman or give me your blood. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d</p><p>Sasha gasped in horror or outrage, but he was more intent on drawing the two killers toward him than protecting her delicate sensibilities. \u201cAt least your friends had the honor to die in combat. Know that if you run, you will be cut down like so many weeds by Paladins.\u201d</p><p>To show his disdain, he turned his back to walk away, although each step that put more distance between him and Sasha was torture. The ruse worked to draw the third fighter out again. Larem took two more steps forward before stepping to the side, rightly guessing the Other\u2019s charge would carry him past Larem\u2019s position. Now he was between the two remaining Kalith, which would prevent them from ganging up on Sasha.</p><p>After bringing his headlong rush to a stop, the Other circled back to challenge Larem. The light disease was in full force now, making the Other\u2019s movements jerky and out of control. The sick feeling in Larem\u2019s veins was the same one he felt when they put down an animal at the shelter that was too far gone to save. It was much too simple to slip past the warrior\u2019s guard and end his life.</p><p>By now, Larem drew little comfort from chanting the prayers for the dead, but he went through the motions because his duty and his honor demanded it. Weary to the soul, he wanted nothing more than to end this slaughter.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>This time, the final Other didn\u2019t hesitate. He pressed a sloppy kiss on Sasha\u2019s mouth while he hugged her close with his free hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to finish what we\u2019ve started.\u201d</p><p>She immediately wiped her lips with the back of her hand and spit on the ground. \u201cNever, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>Larem admired her courage, but if she provoked the male, he might just kill her before Larem could stop him.</p><p>\u201cSasha, back away and shut up!\u201d he barked, barely lifting his sword in time to block his enemy\u2019s blade.</p><p>The Others had saved their best swordsman for last. Despite the illness burning brightly in the male\u2019s eyes, he retained enough of his natural-born ability to put up a good fight. Larem was better, but only just. Sweat dripped down his face, stinging his eyes as the battle dragged on. The longer it lasted, the greater the chance his opponent would get in a lucky blow.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen, no matter how much he admired the fighter\u2019s skill with the blade. Had he been someone\u2019s Blademate as well?</p><p>No time for such thoughts.</p><p>Finally, Larem feigned a misstep. His opponent fell for the ruse, leaving himself wide open for attack as he lunged forward, swinging his blade with all the strength he had. Instead of killing Larem, he found himself impaled on Larem\u2019s borrowed sword, the curved blade cutting deep and wide through his chest.</p><p>The Other slowly sank to his knees, sanity briefly returning to his gaze as he looked up at Larem in confusion.</p><p>\u201cMy brother?\u201d he whispered, the light in his eyes fading quickly.</p><p>Larem dropped to the ground and gathered the dying Kalith into his arms. Perhaps he could save at least this one. Chanting under his breath, he pulled out his medicine knife and held it up toward the ceiling as he asked the gods to share their healing strength.</p><p>As he prepared to plunge the ceremonial knife down into the Other\u2019s heart, the warrior shuddered and breathed his last. Larem cursed and flung the knife down the tunnel. Once again, his magic had failed him, and his people. He held the body close for a few seconds longer as he whispered the death prayers for each of the fallen Kalith.</p><p>He grieved for their loss, even knowing that their lives had really ended when the sickness first whispered in their minds. If they hadn\u2019t died by his sword, they would\u2019ve faced the same brutal end at the hands of the Paladins.</p><p>At least with him there, someone mourned their passing.</p><p>\u201cLarem? Are you all right?\u201d Sasha asked.</p><p>He ignored her question because the answer was obvious. Hell no, he wasn\u2019t all right; he wasn\u2019t sure he ever would be. Her recklessness had cost these four their lives and Larem another large chunk of his soul.</p><p>He shoved the body off his lap and pushed himself to his feet. There was nothing more to be said. The Paladins would dispose of the bodies; he didn\u2019t know how and didn\u2019t care. No matter what they did, it was an abomination. Only the knowledge that they were caught up in the same horrible cycle of death and disease as the Others kept him from charging off to join the battle he could still hear raging back at the barrier. The only question was whose side he\u2019d take, knowing it wouldn\u2019t really matter as long as he died fighting.</p><p>But his duty wasn\u2019t done. He\u2019d vowed to get Sasha to safety. That much he could do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d He held his hand out to brush her hair away from her face, but jerked it back when she flinched at his touch.</p><p>Fine. Her response pissed him off royally, to quote his roommate, even if he understood why she felt that way. The sooner he got her topside the better. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Sasha shrank away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re one of them, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored how much her reaction hurt. He\u2019d always known she\u2019d hate him when she finally saw him for what he really was. \u201cRight now what I am is your way out of here.\u201d</p> <p>She retreated another step. \u201cBut where are we going? The elevators are back that way.\u201d</p><p>He snagged her arm before she gave in to panic and glared down at her. \u201cSo is the fighting, Sasha. Too many from both worlds are already bleeding, so you\u2019ll understand if I\u2019d rather not kill any more of my people. Now, follow me or not. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her, hating the fear in her eyes when she looked at him and hating himself for his part in putting it there. Then he walked away, stopping long enough to retrieve his blade before moving on. Surely she\u2019d show the good sense to stay with him. If not, he\u2019d force the issue, but he hoped she\u2019d at least trust him enough to get her to safety.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Sasha stared at the four broken bodies fallen on the ground. So much blood. Its bitter copper scent filled her head and overloaded her senses. Her stomach churned, foul acid burning the back of her throat. God, would this nightmare never end? It had been hours since she\u2019d last eaten, so it was nothing but dry heaves as she leaned against the wall and retched.</p> <p>Please, let it stop. She needed to follow Larem even if he was one of them\u2014Kalith, Other, the name didn\u2019t matter. If she lost sight of him, her life might very well end right there in the bloody passageway. She tried to straighten up between heaves, but that only made the pain worse. After stumbling forward a few steps, she had to stop and close her eyes to ward off the dizziness.</p><p>As she did, she felt someone beside her and panicked. \u201cNo, please no! Get away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha, calm down. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She sagged in relief at the sound of Larem\u2019s deep voice. Despite everything, he hadn\u2019t abandoned her.</p><p>\u201cHold still and don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>His accent was deeper than usual, but his voice was far more gentle than it had been only seconds before. His hand, cool and soothing, rested lightly on her forehead, and his arm slid around her waist, supporting her weight.</p> <p>He murmured something. The words were unclear, perhaps in his native tongue, but their effect was miraculous. The nausea disappeared almost immediately, as did the cramping. When he removed his hand, she looked up into his pale gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMuch.\u201d</p><p>The chill came flooding back into his gaze as he stepped away and retrieved his sword. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back toward the other end of the passage, careful to avoid looking at the bodies along the way, and then followed Larem around the corner. He was moving fast enough that she almost had to run to keep up with him.</p><p>She had so many questions for him\u2014now that her brain was starting to function again\u2014but she suspected she wouldn\u2019t like his answers. Like, why had he let her think he was human? She\u2019d known there were Kalith living among the Paladins, but no one had even hinted that they had the run of the place. Was he even supposed to be down here?</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about it, not when her life depended on him. Her eyes strayed to the bloody blade he\u2019d wielded with such skill and terrible grace. Would she ever get over the horror of seeing four lives ended right in front of her? Or the knowledge that she\u2019d come so close to being\u2014no, don\u2019t go there. What might have happened didn\u2019t matter right now.</p><p>Larem came to an abrupt halt. \u201cQuiet now. We don\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves. Wait until I make sure the way is clear.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha froze, her ears ringing with her ragged breath and pounding heart. Gradually, other sounds began to make sense. Horrible sense. Swords banging and clanging. Screams of pain and whimpers of agony. Larem progressed a few feet, holding his sword out to the side as if expecting to be attacked.</p><p>Finally, he motioned her forward. \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>But of course she did.</p><p>The ground was littered with bodies. She watched as a line of Paladins formed up. They slowly pushed forward, forcing the ragged band of Others to retreat back across the barrier. Men in guard uniforms were busy dragging the dead and wounded Paladins back out of the way, leaving the Others where they\u2019d fallen.</p><p>Larem drew back beside her. \u201cSasha, snap out of it! We\u2019ve got to get the hell out of here. Those guards might not hurt you, but they\u2019ll come after me given half a chance. I do not want to die because of your stupidity.\u201d</p><p>Okay, enough was enough. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my stupidity. Lonzo left me a note telling me to meet him down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell he did. He had car trouble and didn\u2019t get back until just before the barrier failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><p>Larem all but dragged her along until finally he stopped outside an elevator. As soon as she saw the number pad next to it, her heart sank.</p><p>\u201cLarem, my code won\u2019t work. We\u2019re trapped down here until Devlin sounds the all clear.\u201d Her voice went up an octave as she spoke; the thought of spending another minute trapped in this hell was unbearable.</p><p>Larem was already punching numbers into the security system. \u201cThis one will work.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, she heard the low rumble that signaled the elevator was on its way. She leaned against the wall, relieved beyond words. As fried as she was feeling, she still wondered why an Other would\u2019ve been trusted with a high-level security code.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the more obvious the answer. It wasn\u2019t his code at all. Someone had broken protocols by giving it to him, most likely one of the Paladins. Under the circumstances, she wasn\u2019t about to complain.</p><p>She stepped to the back corner of the elevator and considered how best to handle the situation. \u201cThank whoever gave you the code. Tell him there will be no repercussions for the security breach.\u201d</p><p>Her good intentions seemed to only make Larem madder. \u201cThat\u2019s awfully generous of you, considering he broke your precious rules to save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I understand why he gave the number to a . . .\u201d She stopped. She would do better to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>But it was too late. \u201cA what, Sasha? An alien? An Other? An animal? How about a monster?\u201d</p><p>Each question was an arrow-sharp accusation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Larem. I was trying to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her, his eyes burning with fury. \u201cThe right thing would\u2019ve been to stay the hell out of places you don\u2019t belong. Because of you, my friend delayed his arrival below in order to share that number and the location of this elevator with me. As it is, there aren\u2019t enough Paladins to hold back the invasion. How many were placed at extra risk because he was late to the fight or because they were concerned for your safety and not totally focused on the battle?\u201d</p><p>Dear God, she hadn\u2019t thought about that. Even though it wasn\u2019t her fault, she\u2019d inadvertently put others at risk. \u201cRegardless of what you think, I didn\u2019t go down there uninvited. I\u2019m telling you, Lonzo left me a note.\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her, dropping his bloody sword to the floor as he cornered her. \u201cThen let\u2019s see it.\u201d</p><p>She held out her empty hands. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. I must have dropped it. God, Larem, none of this was supposed to happen. All I can say is that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that doesn\u2019t mean I have to forgive you. Because of you, I betrayed my vow to protect my people. Those Kalith died at my hand, and I have to find some way to live with that. As you now realize, I am Kalith, just as they were.\u201d</p><p>He was standing so close that she could feel the tension thrumming through his body. This was no time to notice how long his eyelashes were or how they framed his intense eyes. The memory of what they shared that night at the zoo flashed through her mind.</p><p>Her hand lifted to touch his cheek. \u201cBut you\u2019re not like them.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not, but only because they were sick with the need for light. That\u2019s the only difference.\u201d</p><p>At her touch, he tangled his fingers in her hair, tilting her face up toward his. \u201cBut one thing you would do well to remember, Sasha Willis\u2014I might not be human, but I am a man. You enjoyed my kiss once. Think you will enjoy it this time, knowing what I am?\u201d</p><p>Then his arms snapped around her and his angry mouth crushed down on hers. When she gasped in shock, his tongue swept past her lips. She\u2019d never tasted pure fury before, but she had no doubt that\u2019s what was flavoring Larem\u2019s kiss. She should push back, should fight to wrest control from him, but rather than feeling threatened, she felt safe. Rather than this being a claiming, Larem\u2019s kiss was a cleansing, washing away some of the fear and horror of the past half hour. A small voice in the back of her mind told her this was crazy, that she should be revolted by the prospect of kissing this . . . what?</p><p>Before she could figure out the answer to that question, Larem ripped his mouth away from hers and lurched back to the other side of the elevator. He was breathing hard. His mouth that had felt so soft and forgiving against hers was now a straight slash of anger.</p><p>To add insult to injury, he scrubbed at his lips with the back of his hand as if to wipe away her taste. The soft ping of the elevator finally reaching its destination echoed in the heavy silence between them.</p><p>As the two of them stalked out, she stopped to say, \u201cThis didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>He smirked down at her. \u201cDo you really think Devlin Bane won\u2019t find out that you were down there? Or that you almost managed to get not just yourself, but me, killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d She jerked her hand between the two of them. \u201cI mean this\u2014us. This didn\u2019t happen and it won\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Afraid what it will do to your precious plans if it gets out that you\u2019ve been sullied by an Other?\u201d</p><p>Okay, that did it. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She marched away, her shoulders squared, her heart aching. Darn that man anyway! How did all this go spinning so far out of control? No matter how hateful Larem had been, he\u2019d still risked his life to save hers.</p><p>Her father might think all Others were a subhuman life-form, but she now knew better. Clearly Larem was a man of honor, one who was suffering because of what that honor had just demanded of him. All because of her.</p><p>Okay, so she\u2019d try one last time. But when she looked back, he was already walking away.</p><p>\u201cLarem? About what you did\u2014thank you.\u201d</p> <p>For a second she thought he might have slowed down, but he never glanced back. It was surprising how much that hurt. She ignored the renewed pain and moved on down the hall herself.</p><p>After everything that had happened, it was tempting to call it quits for the day. But she couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t. No, she\u2019d return to her office until she knew the situation was under control. If things were bad enough, as the Regents\u2019 representative she might need to put in a call for assistance from another sector, either in the form of supplies or even for reinforcements until the Seattle Paladins were back at full strength.</p><p>A certain Kalith warrior wasn\u2019t the only one who understood the meaning of duty.</p><p>Larem walked laps around the halls of the Paladin headquarters. How many times had he passed by Devlin\u2019s office? Did it matter? No. It did occur to him that the circular route was symbolic of what his life had become\u2014an endless struggle to get nowhere.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t he just the perfect example of a pity party? That was another useful expression he\u2019d learned from his roommate. He closed his eyes, praying that Lonzo was not among the dead. Granted, as a Paladin, he wouldn\u2019t stay that way for long, but there was no guarantee he\u2019d awaken the same man he\u2019d been.</p> <p>Larem managed a small smile while he thought about Lonzo Jones. The two of them had been thrown together by forces beyond their control. Larem had been dragged into this world because Lusahn q\u2019Arc, the Sworn Guardian he\u2019d served, had chosen a human lover\u2014a Paladin at that\u2014over any worthy male of their world. Not for the first time Larem wondered how different things would\u2019ve been if he had gathered up the courage to speak for her himself, before her life had become entangled with Cullen Finley\u2019s.</p><p>Instead, both she and Larem had been condemned to be executed as traitors. Lonzo had been part of the rescue party led by Cullen and Lusahn\u2019s brother Barak. But as the group had fought its way back across the barrier, Lonzo had been badly injured, and Larem had saved the Paladin\u2019s life. In payment of that debt, Lonzo had offered Larem a home and the use of his family name on the forged paperwork that made it possible for him to function in this world. Larem didn\u2019t know which of them was more surprised by the fact they\u2019d become fast friends.</p><p>What would his roomie think of Larem\u2019s earlier stupidity? Not the part where he fought to save Sasha from those four Others\u2014Lonzo would respect that. No, the part when he\u2019d given in to the urge to kiss her again, not that Lonzo knew about the first time.</p><p>What had Larem been thinking? When he\u2019d found her, she\u2019d been only seconds from being raped and killed. Then what had he done? He cornered the woman in the elevator and forced himself on her. Shame made his skin run hot and then cold.</p><p>Although, as he thought back, at first she seemed startled, but within the space of a heartbeat or two, her mouth had softened, her tongue tangling with his. What had he hoped to accomplish by such foolishness? He\u2019d be damned lucky if she didn\u2019t issue orders to toss his carcass back across the barrier\u2014or through it. Being fried would be just punishment for his twin sins of betraying his people and taking advantage of a woman in such a fragile state.</p><p>As he started yet another lap, the all clear finally sounded. For the first time in hours, the band of pressure across his chest relaxed enough for him to draw a full breath. He circled back to the elevators and waited. Once he knew how the Paladins had fared, he\u2019d report in to Devlin and then go home.</p> <p>He found a spot tucked out of the way of the emergency med techs waiting for the first batch of wounded to arrive. Only after the living were treated and stable would Laurel Young and the other Handlers start caring for the dead, hoping to ease their journey back to the living.</p><p>Larem might be able to help with that. His magic had certainly worked to bring Hunter Fitzsimon back from the dead. Somehow, though, he doubted Laurel or her boss would stand by and let Larem stab any of their patients through the heart on the off chance his magic would work again. Even so, his hand strayed to his Kalith knife and held on tight as the elevator doors slid open, bringing the scent of fresh blood.</p><p>Devlin walked out all but carrying a young Paladin who was new to Seattle. After surrendering his burden to the capable hands of the waiting techs, he patted the kid on the shoulder and murmured something that had the young recruit smiling through his pain.</p><p>Leave it to Devlin to know just the right thing to say. Then for a few seconds, the look of confidence on Devlin\u2019s face slipped and his own exhaustion and pain showed through. Larem pushed his way past the growing crowd to the weary leader\u2019s side.</p><p>Devlin\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cWhat do you want? You shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near here right now.\u201d</p><p>Larem latched on to Devlin\u2019s thick arm and held on tight. \u201cStand still,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>He quickly chanted one of the new spells he\u2019d learned, pulling energy from the electric lights overhead. For a second their glow actually dimmed as he felt the healing power pour through him and into the Paladin.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Devlin whispered as he jerked his arm free of Larem\u2019s grasp.</p> <p>For the first time in hours, Larem smiled. \u201cThat was me giving you enough energy to chew out my ass. What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>Devlin rested the point of his sword on the floor and leaned on the pommel for support. \u201cAnd I want to do that why?\u201d</p><p>Before Larem could reply, a voice in the back of the crowd yelled, \u201cOne of the Others escaped! Kill him!\u201d</p><p>Devlin brought his sword back up into fighting position as they all looked around for the enemy. A guard unfamiliar to Larem stood pointing right at him from across the crowd. Then there was a bloodcurdling scream as a sword came slashing through the air straight at Larem. He blocked one blow with his own blade while Devlin wrestled the guard to the floor with the help of Trahern, who had just stepped off the elevator. The whole time, the guy kept screaming.</p><p>Larem backed away, hoping the guard would calm down if he got out of the line of sight. Instead of calming down, though, the guard continued to thrash, almost succeeding in bucking off his captors. \u201cHe\u2019s getting away! He\u2019s getting away! Kill him before he kills us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch! Will somebody please tranq this guy?\u201d Devlin bellowed.</p><p>One of the medics quickly filled a syringe and jabbed it into the guard\u2019s arm. Larem had no idea what drug it was, but it was fast acting. The guard\u2019s eyes rolled up in his head and his body went slack.</p><p>Devlin and Trahern stood aside to let the medics take over. When it seemed order had been restored, Devlin turned back to Larem. As soon as he did, he blinked twice and snagged the arm of one of the medics, pointing in Larem\u2019s direction.</p><p>What were they looking at? Then he felt the warm drip, drip, drip along his leg. He glanced down to see the right side of his jeans was already soaked with blood\u2014his blood. How had he missed noticing that the guard had actually landed a blow?</p><p>But now that he knew, the pain started, followed by waves of dizziness. He dimly heard someone shouting his name as the floor came rushing up to meet him. When the darkness threatened to overwhelm him, he fought against it, knowing it was a losing battle.</p><p>Devlin was cursing, but Larem was pretty sure that it was Trahern who\u2019d drawn his sword and stood over him. Protecting him? Really? It was too much to assimilate, his thoughts too slippery to hold on to. Finally, it was just easier to embrace oblivion and let the world fade away.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The numbers all blurred together and nothing added up. Sasha rubbed her eyes, hoping that it would help her make sense out of the data. But no, it was all still gibberish. There had to be a pattern lost somewhere in all those columns of numbers, and she was determined to find it. Just not now.</p><p>Yesterday had been a total disaster. Despite Lonzo\u2019s note, she\u2019d acted so stupidly, venturing down into the tunnels. And if in fact he hadn\u2019t written the note, who had? And why? At this point, would anyone even believe her that the note actually existed?</p><p>No matter what, she definitely owed apologies to more than just Larem. Considering everything, she was surprised that Devlin hadn\u2019t yet called to rip into her over what had happened.</p><p>No sooner had the thought crossed her mind than her phone rang. Ignoring it would be the coward\u2019s way out, so she reached for the receiver and braced herself for the worst. But instead of a mighty roar, she was relieved to hear a different man\u2019s voice\u2014her father\u2019s.</p><p>She punched the button to put him on speakerphone. \u201cHey, Dad, how are you?\u201d</p><p>His familiar voice filled her office. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m more worried about how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Guilt had her wincing. \u201cWhy? What have you heard?\u201d</p><p>She regretted the words as soon as they slipped out.</p><p>\u201cNothing, but it sounds as if maybe I should have. What\u2019s going on out there, Sasha?\u201d His tone made it clear he\u2019d tolerate no evasions.</p><p>She settled for a half-truth. \u201cThe barrier has been unstable in the region for a few days. You know how it is. That always makes things tense for everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>Especially for her this time, not that she was going to tell her father about that. If he found out, the Regents would likely order her to catch the first plane back to St. Louis, and she\u2019d spend the rest of her career counting paper clips to make sure everyone got their fair share.</p><p>Luckily, her father knew exactly how bad things could get whenever the barrier decided to yo-yo for days at a time. \u201cHow many casualties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting on the final report.\u201d Or actually, any report at all, something she\u2019d have to check into as soon as she got off the phone.</p><p>\u201cIf it keeps up, inform the Board in case we need to send in some temporary reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>She really hoped it didn\u2019t come to that. They both knew that if they pulled Paladins to help one area, that left someone else shorthanded. \u201cI\u2019ll let Devlin know when I talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, she could hear him tapping his pen on his desk, a sure sign he had something on his mind, most likely something she wouldn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t long in coming.</p><p>\u201cSo otherwise, how are you doing, Sasha? Got anything to report yet on the mess Kincade left behind?\u201d</p><p>She so didn\u2019t need the great inquisition every time they talked. \u201cAre you asking as a Regent or as my father?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her relief, he actually laughed. \u201cOkay, maybe a little of both. How about I take off my Regent hat and settle for just being your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case, I\u2019m doing fine. There\u2019s a lot to learn, not to mention a whole new cast of characters for me to get to know. The good news is that I think I may have a lead on a place to live. I\u2019ll know more by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>Not that her father would be happy to hear that little tidbit. He\u2019d made it perfectly clear that once she had done a full review of the current state of affairs in the Seattle region, she was to come straight home. That last part wasn\u2019t going to happen, not if she could help it.</p><p>There was a long pause followed by a heavy sigh. When he spoke again, resignation mixed with a dash of humor in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cTime out for a nag from your parental unit: make sure the place has a security system and is in a good neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI will, Dad. Besides, it was Dr. Young who offered to rent me her condo. I figured I could trust her judgment, considering how well respected she is within the organization.\u201d</p><p>That was true, at least in certain quarters. There were also those who thought her efforts to drag Paladins back from the edge of insanity were too radical to be trusted. However, Sasha was determined to funnel every last dime she could into helping Laurel pursue her studies.</p><p>Even if she managed to save only one Paladin, it would be worth it. No one deserved to suffer the way David had.</p><p>Despite his warrior nature, he\u2019d been nothing but gentle with her. They\u2019d had so much fun together; the man had sure known how to have a good time. She\u2019d been naive enough to think their time together would be measured in decades, not months.</p> <p>Sasha suddenly realized her father had started talking again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite catch that,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing important. You\u2019re obviously distracted, so I should let you go.\u201d He sounded hurt.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad, I\u2019ve got a meeting coming up, and I\u2019m still getting ready for it.\u201d She laughed softly as she added, \u201cThe one thing I learned from you is to always be better prepared than everyone else at the table.\u201d</p><p>He sounded a little happier when he responded. \u201cToo late to butter up the old man, Sasha. I know you\u2019ve got a big job on your hands cleaning up Kincade\u2019s mistakes. Let me know if I can help. I\u2019d certainly be glad to vet your reports before you send them to the Board and make suggestions if you\u2019d like me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. I appreciate the offer.\u201d Although she wouldn\u2019t take him up on it. She needed the Regents to see her as an individual, not merely an extension of her father.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, then. Don\u2019t be so long between phone calls, young lady. I worry. So does your Uncle George, although he won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to give him a call. Take care, Dad.\u201d</p><p>After hanging up, Sasha rubbed her temples, trying to ease her headache. She kept trying to tell herself that she\u2019d put the events of yesterday behind her but knew it for the lie it was\u2014she\u2019d been jumpy and tense all day.</p><p>And not just because she kept expecting Devlin Bane to show up in her doorway demanding answers or even her resignation. How bad had things been after the dust settled?</p><p>She shut down her computer. It was time to go find some answers. Rather than confront the Paladin in his office, she\u2019d do an end run and check in with Laurel instead. Besides, the Handler was closer, since the medical labs were also located in the admin building just two floors down from Sasha\u2019s own office.</p><p>The two guards on duty snapped to attention when she stepped out of the elevator. As soon as they recognized her, they abruptly turned back to the security monitors in front of them. Neither one even so much as smiled, which struck her as odd. Up until today, they\u2019d both been friendly enough. Obviously the fighting had cast a pall over everyone\u2019s mood.</p><p>She headed across the lobby to the medical labs where Laurel and the other Handlers worked. Given what Sasha knew about Paladin physiology, most of the warriors should\u2019ve been treated and released by now, leaving only the most seriously injured\u2014and the dead\u2014as patients.</p><p>The doors to the lab swung open with a soft whoosh; the air was chilly and scented with chemicals and stale blood. Sasha paused just inside and shivered.</p> <p>One look around had her considering a quick exit. The near side of the lab was crowded with stainless steel tables that served as patient beds. They were all full. On the far side, a single table stood alone, curtained off from view. She wasn\u2019t sure she really wanted to know who was sequestered over there or why.</p><p>One of the techs was busy taking vitals, but when he spotted her, he went over and tapped Laurel on the shoulder. The Handler immediately motioned for Sasha to join her, patting the chair beside her. Sasha tiptoed around the edge of the room, skirting the hodgepodge of tables and trying not to disturb any of the sleeping patients.</p><p>As Sasha sat down, Laurel yawned loudly enough that her jaw cracked and popped.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. What brings you to our little piece of paradise?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to see the woman was operating on willpower and caffeine. \u201cLaurel, when\u2019s the last time you had any sleep?\u201d</p><p>The Handler managed a small smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ve caught a few winks here and there, and Dr. Neal is due to relieve me in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Laurel looked around the room. \u201cMost of the guys are past the critical stage now and resting easy. There\u2019s just one that I\u2019m still worried about. The usual onslaught of wounds is bad enough, especially when the barrier is going up and down.\u201d</p><p>Laurel paused, her eyes straying back toward the curtained area. \u201cBut his injuries shouldn\u2019t have happened at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it some kind of accident?\u201d</p><p>Laurel held her clipboard tightly. \u201cNo, it was deliberate, and that makes me absolutely furious. He didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>Before Sasha could ask who was lying on that shrouded table, Devlin Bane stepped out from behind the curtain. His gaze zeroed in on her, and he made a beeline straight across the room.</p><p>\u201cLaurel, his IV is running out,\u201d he said, his eyes boring a hole straight through Sasha. \u201cBefore you go, though, can Sasha and I borrow your office for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Laurel stood up. \u201cSure, but if you can\u2019t keep your voice down to a dull roar, take the discussion somewhere else. My patients need their rest. Especially him.\u201d</p><p>Who was it behind that curtain?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll use the scan room. It\u2019s soundproof.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting to see if Sasha followed him, he cut back across the room toward a door in the far corner. Laurel rolled her eyes and then patted Sasha on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not nearly as scary as he likes to think he is.\u201d Her broad grin invited Sasha to share the fun of yanking her husband\u2019s chain a bit. \u201cOn the other hand, he is loud. You might want these for your ears. I find they help.\u201d</p><p>Sasha smiled and reluctantly accepted the pair of cotton balls. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll go see what\u2019s on his mind.\u201d</p><p>Laurel walked with her. \u201cJust remember he gets like this when his buddies are hurting.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin on the nearest table joined the conversation. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s one big teddy bear. I can\u2019t tell you how much it meant to me when he threatened to kick my ass up and down the hall if I didn\u2019t get better damned quick.\u201d He feigned wiping a tear from his eye. \u201cI get all choked up just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Laurel stopped long enough to fluff the Paladin\u2019s pillow for him. \u201cYeah, I know, Lonzo. It\u2019s embarrassing when the big guy gets all mushy.\u201d</p><p>Her patient laughed and then winced. \u201cOuch. That sucks. I always forget how much a gut wound hurts when I laugh.\u201d</p><p>Then his expression turned serious as he gestured toward the nearby curtain. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing? Any change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no worse, so that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d Lonzo settled back against his pillow and closed his eyes with a sigh. \u201cWhen he wakes up, tell him this isn\u2019t going to get him out of working.\u201d</p><p>Sasha smiled at the typical guy way of showing concern. The man must have been badly hurt if his injury was worse than Lonzo\u2019s. She wished she could think of something to say that would express her appreciation for his sacrifice, as well as his friend\u2019s. She also wanted to ask him about the note, but now wasn\u2019t the time. Instead, she braced herself and hurried over to where Devlin stood waiting.</p><p>She stepped into the scan room, feeling more than a little claustrophobic when he shut the door. Devlin was a big man, broad-shouldered and well over six feet. She found herself mentally comparing him to Larem, who was nearly as tall but built along much leaner lines. She bet Devlin fought with brute strength, whereas Larem\u2019s style was graceful but deadly.</p><p>Devlin motioned for her to sit down on the patient bed while he took the desk chair. It creaked in protest when he leaned back and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?\u201d His green eyes burned through her, as if he could read the truth even before she spoke.</p><p>She gave it to him, short and sweet. \u201cI assumed a note I found was from Lonzo, but evidently it wasn\u2019t. To make matters worse, I lost it down in the tunnels, so I can\u2019t even prove the thing actually existed. Saying I\u2019m sorry for what happened after that won\u2019t fix a damn thing, but I am. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that things went to hell, and not just for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d Devlin leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cBut I need details so I can do damage control.\u201d</p><p>She could see the same signs of near exhaustion etched on his face as those that marked his wife\u2019s. Somehow that made him seem more approachable.</p><p>She\u2019d been staring at her hands, then she looked up. \u201cGod, Devlin, in all these years no one ever told me the barrier was so unbelievably beautiful. All those impossible colors, the power of it humming all around you, drawing you in.\u201d</p><p>There was a bit of sympathy in Devlin\u2019s world-weary eyes even though his voice had turned cold. \u201cBeautiful, yeah, but also damn deadly. You can get lost in all that wonder and forget that if the barrier doesn\u2019t fry you, the bastards waiting on the other side will slice and dice you and then dance in your blood.\u201d</p><p>His angry words lashed out at her, but she could hardly blame him when he\u2019d lived so many years watching that happen.</p><p>She gave him a quick summary of the day\u2019s events. As she finished, tears burned down her cheeks, but she ignored them. \u201cThank goodness Larem found me. He tried to talk those Others into letting me go. They wouldn\u2019t listen, so then they fought.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed her eyes as if that could block out the memory. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have been down there at all if she hadn\u2019t insisted on seeing the tunnels for herself. That truth hung heavy between them.</p><p>She forced the rest of the story out, lancing the wound in her mind. \u201cUntil yesterday, I hadn\u2019t realized Larem was . . . is one of the Kalith you\u2019ve been sheltering. He hadn\u2019t told me, either, but I guess I can\u2019t blame him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. But now you know they\u2019re not that different from us, Sasha. Hell, we Paladins even share some of their gene pool.\u201d</p> <p>That fact had rocked their world when it had come out a few years earlier. She replied, \u201cI knew about the common DNA, but all I\u2019ve ever heard about the people from Kalithia is that they were out of their heads, monsters out to kill anybody and anything that crosses their path. Larem\u2019s certainly not like that.\u201d</p><p>Devlin nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the Kalith warriors and those crazy bastards we call Others. Larem, Barak, and Lusahn are all three highly trained warriors. I\u2019d trust any of them at my back anytime. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you want to hear, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that, Devlin.\u201d She finally wiped at the tears still streaming down her face. \u201cIt hurt Larem so much to kill his own kind\u2014and he did it because of me. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever forgive me for putting him in that position, even though it was unintentional. Heck, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Devlin tossed her a box of tissues. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it. Just give him time. Besides, once he found out you were down there, there would\u2019ve been no stopping him.</p><p>\u201cBack in Kalithia they have Sworn Guardians, an elite militia made up of highly trained warriors. Both Barak and his sister Lusahn were Guardians, and Larem served as one of Lusahn\u2019s Blademates. Their job was to protect their people, and they take that calling very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did Larem end up living here?\u201d She was certain he wouldn\u2019t have walked away from his duty to his people lightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his story to tell, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so they both had secrets about Larem to protect. She went on, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him since.\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about him or that kiss.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, I was pretty much a wreck after what happened. Now that I\u2019ve had a chance to calm down, I\u2019d like to thank him. Do you know how I can get in touch with him?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Devlin didn\u2019t meet her gaze directly. \u201cThat might have to wait awhile.\u201d</p> <p>She froze, unable to move, as all the jagged pieces started to fall into place. Lonzo\u2019s worry about his friend. The curtained-off area. Devlin\u2019s questions.</p><p>\u201cDevlin, what happened to Larem after I left?\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cHe came looking for me in the triage area outside the elevator, where we bring all the wounded and the dead. He wanted to fill me in on things, but his timing wasn\u2019t the best. We lost a couple of guards yesterday, which is always extra hard on everyone. Paladins mostly come back from fatal wounds, but for guards, dead is dead.</p><p>\u201cOne of their buddies took the news badly, and when he saw Larem standing there, he lost it. We subdued the guy and shoved a tranq in his arm, but not before he severed Larem\u2019s femoral artery. We almost didn\u2019t get him to Laurel in time.\u201d</p><p>Sasha couldn\u2019t catch her breath, couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t scream no matter how badly she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t, woman!\u201d Devlin rolled to his feet and shoved her head down between her knees. \u201cCome on, Sasha, don\u2019t faint on me!\u201d</p><p>He reached back to hit a button on the console behind him. \u201cLaurel, get me a wet rag and smelling salts or some such shit.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, the door banged open and Devlin\u2019s wife charged in. \u201cDarn it, Devlin, I don\u2019t have time for this. What did you do to her? You can\u2019t yell at Sasha like you do your men.\u201d</p> <p>Poor Devlin. Sasha managed to draw in enough air to defend him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Laurel pressed a cool cloth against the back of Sasha\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cHe told me about Larem.\u201d</p><p>By then, Sasha had straightened up enough to see the look exchanged between Laurel and Devlin. What were they thinking?</p><p>\u201cJust tell me he\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Laurel answered, \u201cIt\u2019s been touch and go, but he\u2019s stable now. We have him sequestered because it bothers some of the Paladins when they regain consciousness and sense a Kalith nearby.\u201d</p><p>Then she sat down beside Sasha. \u201cTheir blood is different enough from ours that we didn\u2019t want to transfuse him with either human or Paladin blood. Barak donated a pint for him, but it wasn\u2019t enough. We had to make do with plasma and IV fluids, and then let nature take its course. Luckily, Larem has some of the same ability to heal as the Paladins do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d</p><p>Again the looks flew between Laurel and Devlin. He arched a brow and she frowned. Finally, Laurel slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but here\u2019s the deal. If he\u2019s awake, I\u2019ll ask him if he wants to see you, and whatever he says goes. If he\u2019s asleep, you can take a quick peek, but then you\u2019re out of there. Right now, Larem needs rest more than he needs company.\u201d</p><p>She softened that last remark with a small smile, but it still hurt more than it should have. There was no way Sasha would do anything that would adversely affect Larem\u2019s recuperation. Still, she couldn\u2019t fault the Handler for her caution. It was her job to protect her patients, no matter which side of the barrier they\u2019d been born on.</p><p>Trying to appear calmer than she felt, Sasha nodded. \u201cWhatever is best for Larem.\u201d</p><p>While she waited, she turned back to Devlin and brought up another subject. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t had much time to work on your list of suggestions for me. With your men still on the mend, you\u2019re shorthanded right now, so screw the report. It can wait.\u201d</p><p>Devlin gave her a weary smile. \u201cThanks, I appreciate the attitude. Shouldn\u2019t be more than a day or two before we\u2019re back up to full strength\u2014as long as the barrier decides to behave.\u201d</p><p>Then the Paladin patted her on the back. \u201cThis thing with Larem was not your fault. When I find the bastard who was playing games with you, I\u2019ll skewer him myself.\u201d</p><p>She appreciated the sentiment, but it sure felt as if she was partly to blame. \u201cLarem wouldn\u2019t have been there if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the guard who attacked him has a reputation of hating our Kalith friends. If the guy was bent on revenge, he could\u2019ve just as easily attacked Larem some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Sasha could say more Laurel stuck her head back into the room. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Sasha started for the door, then stopped to look back at Devlin. \u201cThanks for everything you and your men do for us all, Devlin. I figure that doesn\u2019t get said nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>He actually grinned. \u201cOr at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll add that to my list of things that should be changed around here. If there\u2019s anything you need, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>As she walked away, Devlin stretched out on the cot in the scan room, probably to stay close to his men. She closed the door softly and headed straight toward the curtain that separated Larem from the rest of the wounded.</p><p>\u201cI think Devlin is conking out in the scan room,\u201d she whispered to Laurel.</p><p>\u201cI figured he might. He hates to go far when there are this many of his men down. Mine isn\u2019t the only lab that\u2019s full right now.\u201d</p><p>Laurel motioned for Sasha to follow her. \u201cIt\u2019s better that you don\u2019t stay long. And speaking as a doctor, you should take it easy for a day or two yourself. Physically you might be fine, but emotionally is a whole different matter. Try to get away from the office this weekend and do something relaxing. If you need to talk, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Laurel.\u201d She gestured toward the wounded men resting across the room. \u201cAll things considered, I don\u2019t have much to complain about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like Devlin. He bleeds for his men even when he isn\u2019t one of the wounded himself. Go check on your friend. I\u2019ve got a few things to finish up before my boss relieves me.\u201d</p><p>If Sasha wasn\u2019t mistaken, that was approval she saw in Laurel\u2019s eyes. \u201cI promise to keep the visit short.\u201d</p><p>Now that the moment was upon her, she found herself reluctant to step beyond the curtain that sheltered Larem from the rest of the world. Talk about cowardly. Shaking her head in disgust, she moved the thin fabric out of her way.</p><p>Once again the tears started. His complexion, always pale, now had a bluish undertone that couldn\u2019t be good. She cataloged his condition, noting that they had him hooked up to drains and IVs, and machines to monitor his recovery. Gone was the intensely vital warrior who had fought for her life. And in his place, there was this . . . this bruised and battered man who looked all too fragile. Was it really less than twenty-four hours ago?</p><p>She gently brushed a soft lock of his long hair back from his forehead. Coal black shot through with silver was such an odd color to frame such a young face. She doubted he was more than a year or two older than she was.</p><p>Her father would probably freak out big-time if she were to admit that she found a Kalith handsome. Heck, it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that she would\u2019ve laughed at the idea herself.</p><p>But not now.</p><p>She whispered a small prayer for his quick recovery. It was time to leave, although she did so reluctantly. Somebody should stay close by in case Larem needed anything, but she\u2019d promised to keep her visit short. Maybe Laurel would allow her to return tomorrow if she kept her word and left quickly.</p><p>\u201cSleep tight, Larem. Get well fast.\u201d She gave the sleeping man\u2019s hand a gentle squeeze before bolting for the exit. The last thing she needed was for him to wake up and find her crying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>Larem hoped she was gone. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could fake being asleep. Not with Sasha\u2019s hand on his, her soft voice whispering near his ear. At first he\u2019d thought it was a dream, just another in a long line that he\u2019d had since first meeting her. But no, he was hurting too much for this to be anything other than reality.</p><p>He slowly inhaled and immediately recognized the blood and chemical stench of Laurel Young\u2019s medical lab. For a few seconds he was confused about how he came to be stretched out on one of her stainless steel tables before it all came trickling back. Talking to Devlin about what had happened down in the tunnels. Someone swinging a sword\u2014a guard maybe. Trahern protecting Larem from further attack.</p><p>Then periods of total oblivion mixed with the occasional vague awareness of pain. Voices\u2014some familiar, some not. He hated knowing he\u2019d been at the mercy of strangers. Granted, he trusted Laurel Young, but he didn\u2019t know how her coworkers felt about having a wounded Kalith for a patient.</p> <p>The whole idea left him feeling vulnerable. With that in mind, he moved his arm enough to realize he wasn\u2019t chained down as the Paladins usually were. Good. Not that he could muster much of a defense if he was attacked.</p><p>He heard footsteps. Someone was coming, but not Sasha. He quickly closed his eyes just in case. A draft of cool air washed over him as his visitor pulled the curtain back.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now, Larem. She left.\u201d</p><p>Relieved that it was Laurel Young, he did as she said. He had questions for her but found it hurt too much to talk. He managed a hoarse whisper. \u201cWater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Evidently his request pleased her, because she was smiling when she held a straw to his lips. \u201cTake little sips.\u201d</p> <p>The chill of the water slid down his throat, soothing away the dry pain. The effort it took to swallow pretty much sapped what little energy he had. He closed his eyes briefly and tried again. \u201cStatus?\u201d</p><p>Laurel set the glass aside and checked his breathing and pulse with her usual efficiency. Her fingers felt strong and impersonal against his skin, unlike the warmth of Sasha\u2019s brief touch. The comparison bothered him. He shouldn\u2019t be thinking about Sasha at all. Not after the events of . . . when?</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Laurel finished her cursory examination and looped her stethoscope around her neck. \u201cSince yesterday afternoon. We had to surgically repair your femoral artery. At least your Kalith healing ability has finally kicked in, so you\u2019re well on your way to making a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted the flow of the plastic bag of fluids that hung on a pole at the head of his table. \u201cWe gave you a unit of Barak\u2019s blood to make up for the puddle you left behind on the floor. I\u2019ll check your blood count later, but it\u2019s been climbing steadily.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he felt as if he\u2019d been run over and left for dead. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p> <p>Laurel bit her lower lip before answering. \u201cWell, you know how the Paladins like a good party. Once one of them gets to come hang out with me, they all want to come. Lonzo is still here. Which reminds me, he said to tell you this wouldn\u2019t get you out of doing chores. If you want to argue the point, I\u2019ll wheel him over to see you as soon as he feels up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my week to do the laundry.\u201d But then fear for his friend sent a shard of new pain ripping through Larem\u2019s chest. \u201cIs he badly hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. He\u2019s better, just like every other Paladin who managed to get himself cut up the past couple of days.\u201d She reached to offer Larem water again.</p><p>\u201cWe also lost a couple of the guards. Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be such a downer.\u201d</p><p>She held the straw to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m going off duty for a few hours as soon as I\u2019m done here with you, but my boss will be around to check on you while I\u2019m gone. If you need anything, press the button there on the side rail. If Dr. Neal is busy, my technician Kenny will come running.\u201d</p><p>Larem took a long drink. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The Handler seemed reluctant to leave. She insisted on fluffing his pillow and then adjusted the light overhead. What was she trying not to say?</p><p>\u201cLaurel, spit it out, even if you think I won\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t put up much of a fight right now even if it does make me mad. Later maybe, though.\u201d He held up a shaky fist to demonstrate.</p> <p>She stopped fiddling with the dials on the monitors and turned to face him. \u201cOkay, hard-ass. Here it is.\u201d</p><p>Laurel bent down to whisper in his ear, reminding him that the curtain only gave the illusion of privacy. They weren\u2019t alone, and any Paladins who were awake could hear every word if they weren\u2019t careful. Laurel knew that better than most, so he\u2019d have to trust her judgment on the matter.</p><p>\u201cSasha Willis stopped by to see me and ended up telling Devlin everything about what happened between the two of you yesterday. That\u2019s how she found out you\u2019d been hurt. I don\u2019t mean to be telling tales out of school, but she took it hard.\u201d</p><p>Sasha told Devlin everything? Somehow Larem doubted that. She\u2019d never want anyone to find out she\u2019d knowingly let a Kalith touch her\u2014or that she\u2019d liked it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d What else could he say?</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I think she\u2019ll be back. You know, to check on your progress.\u201d There was a great deal of curiosity in Laurel\u2019s dark eyes, but she was too tactful to press for details.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see her, I can tell her that I\u2019ve restricted visitations until you\u2019re fully recovered.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he wanted to see Sasha all right. Too much, in fact. But considering he\u2019d been attacked by a guard, feelings were already running high against him right now. The last thing she needed was to be seen favoring the enemy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just feeling obligated because of what happened.\u201d And he didn\u2019t need her gratitude, especially because of what had happened.</p><p>Laurel\u2019s eyes narrowed in obvious doubt. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how you feel about it tomorrow. We don\u2019t get a lot of visitors anyway, so I can honestly say that we\u2019re not really set up for it. I need my patients to get all the rest they can while they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Laurel stood back up and laid the back of her hand on his forehead. \u201cNo fever. You\u2019re definitely on the mend. I\u2019m glad, Larem. Very glad. Now get some sleep. You\u2019ll need all the energy you can get to duke it out with Lonzo over the whole laundry thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to bring it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Right now, though, a feather could knock both of you over. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a contest, so I won\u2019t be starting a betting pool anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame you.\u201d He was a healer himself and recognized when someone else was running on empty. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Laurel. Go get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody should.\u201d</p><p>He managed to hold on to consciousness until her footsteps faded into the distance, leaving behind only the soft chorus of beeping machines to lull him to sleep. And if the last thought he had was of Sasha, well, no one had to know.</p><p>Contrary to Dr. Young\u2019s advice, Sasha was back in the office bright and early Saturday morning. She\u2019d already lost too many hours over the past couple of days to take the whole weekend off as well. At least she had the place to herself for the moment.</p><p>Where to start? E-mail first and then she\u2019d follow up with D.J. to see if he\u2019d made any progress. Later, maybe she\u2019d take a short break and go back downstairs to the lab and check on the status of Laurel\u2019s patients, one in particular.</p><p>As she logged in to her account, she sipped her white chocolate latte with cinnamon and whip, postponing having to wade through the unending barrage of e-mails. Back home, her local barista had laughingly called the combination a \u201cSasha special.\u201d Hopefully she\u2019d be living in Seattle long enough to become a regular at the coffee shop here, too. That would be nice.</p><p>A knock on the door startled her out of her reverie. \u201cCome in!\u201d she called.</p><p>D. J. Clayborne stuck his head inside the door. \u201cHi. I thought I\u2019d let you know I\u2019m back working on the bastard\u2019s records this morning. Didn\u2019t want to freak you out if you heard me banging around next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the warning, D.J.\u201d She picked up her coffee. \u201cCan I see what you\u2019re working on? I promise not to hover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Give me a few minutes to get started first.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin took off for Kincade\u2019s old office at just short of a run, which seemed to be his only speed. Even when he was sitting at the computer, he was always in motion\u2014foot tapping, his hand pounding the desk with a rhythm only he could hear, anything to burn off some of his endless supply of energy.</p><p>A few minutes later, she heard D.J. start cursing a blue streak. She hurried into the adjacent office to find him staring at the computer screen with the strangest look on his face.</p><p>\u201cD.J., what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately answer, she moved closer, careful not to startle him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>D.J. finally looked up and blinked. Then he shook his head as if to clear it and shrugged. \u201cSorry, Sasha, it\u2019s nothing to do with you. Just a strange e-mail. I\u2019ve gotten a couple lately I haven\u2019t been able to figure out. I suspect it\u2019s a Paladin friend yanking my chain.\u201d</p><p>His smile turned wicked as he rubbed his hands together. \u201cOnce I manage to track them back to him, there will be hell to pay. I\u2019ll fry more than just his damn hard drive.\u201d</p><p>Then he looked chagrined. \u201cOops, probably shouldn\u2019t have said that in front of you. Don\u2019t suppose you could forget you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>All she could do was laugh at the incorrigible hacker. \u201cHeard what? I\u2019m just standing here enjoying my coffee and watching you working hard to decipher Kincade\u2019s files.\u201d</p><p>D.J.\u2019s eyes twinkled with good humor as his fingers flew over the keyboard. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. I expect to make some solid progress, too, because I\u2019m all about staying on task. Just ask Devlin.\u201d</p><p>D.J. went from playful to predator, leaning forward to study the screen. \u201cGotcha, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone. \u201cCullen, get your worthless ass over to the admin building now. I\u2019m in Kincade\u2019s old office, and I\u2019m going to need your help with this.\u201d</p><p>Cullen was the other computer whiz among the local Paladins. Rumor had it that between him and D.J., there wasn\u2019t a server in the world that would be safe if they decided to go on the prowl.</p><p>Sasha moved closer. \u201cDid you find something interesting?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He actually looked surprised to see she was still there. \u201cYep, I\u2019ve found Kincade\u2019s offshore bank accounts. Cullen\u2019s actually better with tracking that kind of thing than I am, although not by much. We might just be able to strip those accounts and get back some of our own. But if I\u2019m reading this right, Kincade had some playmates.\u201d</p><p>D.J. studied the screen again. \u201cWe\u2019ll also see where these transfers lead us. It\u2019s too early to start pointing fingers, but a couple originated in the Regents\u2019 server in . . .\u201d</p><p>He paused as if trying to choose his words carefully. Sasha waited for a second and then prodded him. \u201cOriginated where?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard and answered. \u201cAdmin in St. Louis. But, hey, that could be misleading. Kincade was damn good at hiding his tracks, so this might be a false trail.\u201d</p> <p>A shiver of dread washed over her, as if someone had just tromped on her grave. The last thing they all needed was for this mess to lead back to another Regent, not to mention there were only a handful stationed in the St. Louis sector. Fewer still when she eliminated the two she trusted implicitly\u2014her father and her Uncle George. She wasn\u2019t about to start pointing fingers at any of their close associates without having hard evidence to back up the accusation.</p><p>But neither was she here to protect the guilty. \u201cD.J., we need to nail these guys whoever they are. If you do get any of the money back or the names of Kincade\u2019s accomplices, the steak dinner\u2019s on me. Your choice of restaurants. Cullen, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>He went on keyboarding, muttering under his breath as he did so.</p><p>Time to get back to her own work. Once she made some headway, she\u2019d take a brief break and check in with Laurel. By now, most of the Paladins should be up and about. According to the morning reports, the barrier had finally stabilized long enough for everyone to have a peaceful night.</p> <p>Well, except for her. Her dreams had been full of nightmarish images of Others chasing her through the darkness, blood dripping from their swords, their pale eyes flaring with the need to kill. The strange part was that she hadn\u2019t just been running from them but toward someone else. She\u2019d awakened with her heart pounding right before turning that final corner to safety. Rather than be relieved the nightmare had ended, she\u2019d been disappointed because she hadn\u2019t gotten even a glimpse of who had been waiting for her.</p><p>Although she could guess.</p><p>As soon as she sat back down at her desk, her cell phone rang. She almost let it go to voice mail now that she\u2019d finally gotten into a productive rhythm. Unfortunately her conscience wouldn\u2019t let her ignore it for long. As the representative for the Regents, she needed to be available twenty-four/seven. Lives could depend on it.</p><p>A glance at the caller ID eliminated that possibility, not when her godfather was calling. Hopefully he and her father wouldn\u2019t make a habit of checking up on her every day or two. She gave up and answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Uncle George, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Evidently her lack of enthusiasm showed in her voice. George laughed and said, \u201cGee, why don\u2019t you try to contain your excitement, Sasha? You wouldn\u2019t want me to think you\u2019re happy to hear from me or anything.\u201d</p> <p>She winced. \u201cOkay, my bad. I\u2019m trying to wade through an unbelievable number of e-mails, most of which say nothing and accomplish even less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the world of upper management, my dear. I take it you\u2019re in the office and not out enjoying the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI originally planned to stop by the office for just a few minutes but decided to put in a couple of hours to clear a few things off my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least try to get out in the sun for a while. That is, if it ever actually shines in Seattle. Any truth to the rumor that people there don\u2019t tan, they rust?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s a rumor the people out here started to discourage others from moving here. It\u2019s been sunny and warm since I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you say so. But speaking as your favorite honorary uncle, I\u2019m hoping you don\u2019t like it too much.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her to respond, he went on. \u201cAt least I see the barrier has stabilized, so that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. I was going to stop by the labs on my way out to see how the wounded are doing.\u201d She paused. \u201cWe lost two guards, so that\u2019s been tough on everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRumor has it that another problem almost got solved.\u201d George\u2019s voice turned chilly. \u201cToo bad that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat problem was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that one of the guards almost eliminated one of Seattle\u2019s pet Others. I suppose they\u2019ve even wasted our limited resources patching up the bastard. Far better for all concerned if they\u2019d let him bleed out and die. Good riddance all around.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe her ears. How could anyone even begin to think Larem\u2019s death would be beneficial? George\u2019s disappointment was beyond disgusting.</p><p>As tempting as it was to rip into him for his callous attitude, she had to learn how he\u2019d found out about the attack so quickly. She sure hadn\u2019t said anything and seriously doubted that either Devlin or Laurel would\u2019ve reported the incident. The last thing any of the locals wanted to do was draw attention to the Kalith living among them.</p><p>\u201cWow, the grapevine must be in full swing. How did you hear about that so quickly? I just learned about it myself late yesterday.\u201d She kept her voice neutral, aiming for mildly curious rather than outraged.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been in one of the reports that came in this morning\u2014maybe from the medical team.\u201d George rustled a bunch of papers in the background. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to put my finger on it at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. She knew him better than that. The man had a mind like a filing cabinet with every bit of information sorted, categorized, and easily retrievable. He obviously had no intention of telling her how he\u2019d found out. Fine, but at least she now knew there was a spy here who reported back to Uncle George and most likely her father, too.</p><p>She\u2019d drop the matter for now. George wouldn\u2019t tell her anything he didn\u2019t want her to know, and there was no use in antagonizing him. Even so, she was furious. She\u2019d like to think she\u2019d feel the same way no matter who\u2019d been attacked, but that would be a lie.</p><p>Did her father agree with her godfather\u2019s sentiment? Would he feel different if he knew that Larem had fought long and hard to save her life? She couldn\u2019t share that information with George, though, without admitting she\u2019d managed to get herself trapped in the tunnels. If the spy hadn\u2019t told him, neither would she. Odd, though, that the guy had reported the incident involving Larem but obviously hadn\u2019t mentioned her part in it.</p><p>Better to change subjects. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better go if I want to get out of here anytime soon. By the way, did Dad tell you I might have found a condo to rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my feelings on that subject are on a par with your father\u2019s, but we both know you\u2019ll make your own decisions. Even so, it seems like a lot of effort when you have no idea how long you\u2019ll actually have to be there.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she did know how they felt. She really didn\u2019t want to be reminded that her assignment might only be temporary, but at least she\u2019d diverted his focus from the attack on Larem.</p><p>\u201cTake care and don\u2019t spend the whole day in the office reading reports either. Go play golf or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be here much longer.\u201d George was back to shuffling the papers again. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to keep me posted on your progress in deciphering Kincade\u2019s accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care and don\u2019t spend the whole day in the office reading reports either. Go play golf or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be here much longer.\u201d George was back to shuffling the papers again. \u201cRemember to keep me posted on your progress in deciphering Kincade\u2019s files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to report.\u201d Yet. Nothing concrete, anyway. No use in stirring up a hornets\u2019 nest until she knew more.</p><p>After they exchanged good-byes, she hung up. The conversation had left her unsettled. Rather than delve back into her e-mail, she decided to see if Cullen Finley and D.J. had made any strides.</p><p>Sasha shut down her laptop and packed it up to take with her. After turning off the lights, she headed down the hall.</p><p>She paused to listen to the rumble of two male voices, laughing when D.J. suddenly whooped loudly and shouted, \u201cWhy you sneaky SOB!\u201d Cullen\u2019s response was quieter but clearly just as excited.</p><p>Both of them looked up as soon as she stepped through the door. Cullen smiled at her. \u201cHey, Sasha, look what we found!\u201d</p><p>They made room so she had a clear view of the computer screen. \u201cKincade wasn\u2019t just ripping off the Kalith by letting them buy their way into our world. The greedy SOB was also stealing directly from the Regents.\u201d</p><p>Cullen pointed at a line of numbers. \u201cNot only that but D.J. was right about Kincade making deposits into accounts that lead straight back to St. Louis. Now we know for sure he wasn\u2019t alone in this. If we can follow the money trail, we might just find out who else is involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you can do that?\u201d</p><p>D.J. acted insulted. \u201cHey, you\u2019re not dealing with amateurs here. As long as you\u2019re sure you want us to see where this leads us, given enough time, we\u2019ll nail them.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. \u201cKeep me posted. For now, I\u2019d like to keep this between the three of us. Well, make that four since I figure I\u2019m second on your list of people to call, right after Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Cullen\u2019s eyes had a teasing glint in them. \u201cAnd who knows, we might even call you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, like that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Lock the office when you leave.\u201d</p><p>Before she reached the door, two cell phones rang, neither of them hers. Both Paladins answered at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOn our way!\u201d</p><p>Her pulse sped up as both men shed their good humor, revealing the deadly warriors beneath the fa\u00e7ade. Cullen quickly shut down the computer.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLacey called Devlin from the geology lab to warn him that she\u2019s seeing fluctuations in the energy levels down near St. Helens. We\u2019re heading there to beef up the coverage just in case.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, the memory of the battle she\u2019d witnessed all too clear in her mind. \u201cDo you need a ride back to your headquarters? My car is parked in the garage next door.\u201d</p><p>Cullen stood up. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I\u2019ve got my car here, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d D.J. picked up a duffel she hadn\u2019t noticed earlier. It clunked when he slung the strap over his shoulder. No doubt his portable weapons stash.</p><p>She had a powerful urge to hug the two men. It would probably only embarrass them, and she really didn\u2019t know either of them well enough to presume.</p><p>She settled for saying, \u201cBe careful out there, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always are,\u201d D.J. said, winking at her on his way out the door.</p> <p>Somehow she doubted the truth of that statement, but she didn\u2019t call him on it. Instead, she headed downstairs to Laurel\u2019s lab. She caught herself pausing to check her hair in the gleaming stainless steel door. God, how dumb was that? She was here to check on the status of the injured, not to make an impression on anyone.</p><p>But, even so, her hands shook as she pushed open the door.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate.\u201d</p><p>Larem tried not to smirk at his roommate\u2019s defeat, but it was hard. Lonzo leaned forward to study the board, obviously still trying to figure how Larem had managed to corner his king.</p><p>\u201cListen, you alien jerk, you must have cheated. Did you move the pieces around when I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d Lonzo started resetting the board. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll keep my eyes on you the whole time. Try anything again, and I\u2019ll get someone to sneak in my sword past the guards.\u201d</p> <p>Larem sipped his glass of ice water. \u201cIs it my fault you left your queen vulnerable? Perhaps you should ask Cullen for some tips, or even D.J.\u201d</p><p>Normally Lonzo would\u2019ve taken offense at the suggestion that anyone\u2014especially D.J.\u2014could show him up in chess. However, right now his roommate was too busy staring at something across the room to respond.</p><p>\u201cLonzo? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Sasha Willis just walked in, and it looks like our favorite Handler is not so happy to see her. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>Larem wasn\u2019t about to tell Lonzo that Laurel knew he was reluctant to see Sasha again. His roommate already knew that Larem had broken protocol by going down into the tunnels to save her. It was what happened afterward that he had no intentions of confessing.</p><p>Time to redirect Lonzo\u2019s attention. Tapping the game board with his finger, Larem asked, \u201cAre we going to play or not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we are.\u201d Lonzo moved his pawn and then looked past Larem again. \u201cOr maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Someone was coming toward them\u2014Dr. Young, not Sasha. Larem knew it without even looking. \u201cCan we finish this game later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m still here.\u201d Lonzo grinned at him. \u201cLaurel is threatening to kick me out this afternoon. Said she wants the space for someone who really needs it.\u201d</p><p>Larem countered Lonzo\u2019s move, mostly to postpone dealing with the problem over by the door. \u201cGuess that means you\u2019ll have to do the laundry this week. She already said I should stay here until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo shoved another pawn off its square. \u201cFat chance. The dirty clothes can wait until you get home.\u201d</p><p>Laurel stepped around the table so that she was facing Larem. \u201cSorry to interrupt the game, guys. Lonzo, I need to check you over before I sign off on your discharge. I might need the bed space.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin went cold. \u201cSon of a bitch, what happened this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so far. Lacey sent out a notice that the energy levels are fluctuating again south of here.\u201d Laurel looked grim. \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m ready. You know, just in case.\u201d</p> <p>Lonzo swept the chess pieces back into a beat-up box, added the board, and then jammed the lid back on. \u201cSorry, Larem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>When Lonzo was gone, Larem turned his attention to Dr. Young, still all too aware of the woman who was hovering just out of sight behind him. \u201cDoc, make sure Lonzo knows you\u2019re not releasing him to join the fight. He was still wincing in pain and rubbing his side when he thought I wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>Laurel\u2019s eyes narrowed as she watched Lonzo make his way back to his bed. \u201cThat sneaky jerk! And he\u2019s been complaining nonstop about me keeping him so long. I should\u2019ve known better than to trust him. You two might get to finish that chess game after all.\u201d</p><p>Then she dropped her voice. \u201cSasha Willis wants to make sure you\u2019re on the mend. Okay if I send her over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He wanted to know how she was doing, too.</p><p>Before walking away, Laurel motioned for the other woman to come forward, pulling the curtain partly closed. \u201cThis is the first time Larem\u2019s been up for any length of time. I don\u2019t want him to overdo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay long. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Sasha stood in front of him. As she stared into his eyes, her hand fluttered down to gently rest on his arm. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop by to see if you needed anything.\u201d</p><p>He savored the small contact and slowly moved to cover her hand with his own, afraid she\u2019d step back out of reach. Yes, there was something he needed. Before Sasha came into his life, it had been a long, long time since anyone had actually held him, touched him, kissed him.</p><p>Two days ago he\u2019d been out of control and out of his mind. What had he been thinking when he\u2019d latched on to this woman and poured everything he had into that kiss? More importantly, though, what had she been thinking when she kissed him back?</p><p>Not that it mattered, not if he\u2019d become a target for the guards. The last one who\u2019d gone rogue had tried to kill Laurel. It had taken the unlikely alliance of Barak q\u2019Young and Devlin Bane to save her. Larem wouldn\u2019t put Sasha in the same kind of danger. He had to drive a wedge between them and make a clean break of things.</p><p>He gave her the only answer he could. \u201cI have everything I need.\u201d</p><p>She actually looked disappointed as she peeked out at the remaining Paladin patients.</p><p>Finally, she looked back at him. \u201cLaurel says everyone is on the mend, including you. You definitely look better than when I stopped by yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d mentioned that you\u2019d been in to check on the wounded.\u201d</p><p>Although he bet he was the only one she\u2019d actually touched, even cried over. His skin tingled with the remembered feeling of her gentle fingers against his when she\u2019d thought he was asleep.</p><p>Sasha stepped back and shoved her hands in the pockets of her jacket. \u201cYes, well, it\u2019s my job to make sure everyone was all right\u2014the guards, the Paladins, and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther?\u201d he offered when she hesitated. He knew she didn\u2019t see him that way, but he couldn\u2019t let them get any closer.</p><p>\u201cDarn it, Larem, don\u2019t put words in my mouth. You\u2019re not one of them. You forget, I\u2019ve seen the difference up close and personal.\u201d</p><p>Despite the anger blazing in Sasha\u2019s eyes, she\u2019d dropped her voice to a whisper. He did the same.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell yourself that if you want. Does it make it easier for you to stomach the fact that you let yourself be kissed by one? Touched by one? Remember that night at the zoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten a single moment of our time together.\u201d</p><p>Neither had he, but that changed nothing. He eased his feet down onto the floor, determined to finish this conversation standing up.</p><p>Still conscious of the fact they weren\u2019t exactly alone, he leaned in close and whispered near her ear, \u201cSorry if it bothers you so much, Sasha, but it\u2019s nothing less than the truth. Kalith, Other\u2014the words don\u2019t matter because they don\u2019t change what I am. Maybe it makes me sick to think that I kissed a human. Ever think of that?\u201d</p><p>She jerked back as if his words had been a physical blow. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I did. Sorry I\u2019ve burdened you with my human cooties. I didn\u2019t realize you aliens found us so repugnant.\u201d</p><p>He watched in grim silence as she stalked away, her back rigid, anger obvious in each step she took. She picked up the computer case and purse she\u2019d left by the exit and slammed her way through the swinging door. He wanted to charge after her, to admit he hadn\u2019t meant what he\u2019d said, but he wouldn\u2019t. For her sake, it was the right thing to do.</p><p>At least his wounded leg held up until she was out of sight before it gave out on him. He grabbed on to the side of the bed, barely managing to save himself the indignity of hitting the floor. After a few seconds, the room quit spinning enough that he could crawl back up on the cold steel without asking for help.</p><p>He stretched out and concentrated on taking long, slow breaths, seeking to center himself, to block out the world and the jagged edges of pain shooting through him. A few seconds later, Laurel appeared at his side with a syringe in her hand.</p><p>\u201cThis will help you rest.\u201d</p><p>She made no move, allowing him to make the final decision; taking human drugs was iffy because of his Kalith physiology. This time, though, he\u2019d risk it. A little oblivion sounded damned good right then. He held out his arm so she could inject it through his IV.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Laurel. Maybe it will help.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t, not really. But for the next couple of hours he wouldn\u2019t have to care.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Chaz Willis stared at his reflection in the window, on the whole pleased with what he saw. He prided himself on how far he\u2019d come from his humble roots. It had been an uphill battle to shake the dirt of poverty off his shoes, but he\u2019d done it and never looked back.</p><p>Of course, few people had any idea how much power he actually wielded, because the world of the Regents and Paladins was a secret one. He liked that. It meant that there were fewer rules he had to play by, which only made the game that much more fun. After all, the government couldn\u2019t regulate what couldn\u2019t be openly acknowledged as existing in the first place. Only a handful of highly placed men in each country that housed Paladins knew of their existence\u2014and for good reason.</p><p>The clock on the wall tolled the hour, reminding him that his fellow Regents were due to arrive soon. Footsteps approached, their sound muted by the thick Persian rug on the floor. Chaz turned around to acknowledge the Paladin\u2019s presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me, sir, but I thought you\u2019d like to know I\u2019ve finished sweeping the house. Everything\u2019s clear. If you don\u2019t need me for anything else, I\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming on short notice, Jake. I\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Chaz headed toward the foyer with one of the few men they all trusted to make sure no one had bugged their homes. After all, if the Regents who gathered together couldn\u2019t speak freely, then what was the point?</p><p>When they reached the front door he said, \u201cTell Jarvis I appreciate him letting me borrow your services again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p> <p>With the few minutes Chaz had left before the others arrived, he studied the agenda for the night\u2019s meeting. Most was routine, but his fellow Regents were starting to press hard for details about Kincade\u2019s escapades and their far-reaching effects on the Seattle sector and beyond.</p><p>Unfortunately, Sasha had remained remarkably close-mouthed about her findings so far. After all, she was her father\u2019s daughter. She wouldn\u2019t tell them a damn thing until she was good and ready. He couldn\u2019t fault her for that, even if it was inconvenient for him and his plans.</p><p>Luckily, he had his own source busy gathering intelligence out there. Rusty had reported the fighting up and down the I-5 corridor had been incredibly bloody and vicious, although it had finally settled down some. Additionally, a guard had damn near killed one of the pet Kalith. Too bad he\u2019d failed.</p><p>A car pulled into his driveway, the first of his guests arriving right on time. Tonight\u2019s agenda also included discussion about what to do about Colonel Kincade himself. It really was a damn shame Devlin Bane had let the bastard live. Yes, the Paladin had shown admirable restraint and all that, but he\u2019d left it up to the Regents to decide the traitor\u2019s fate.</p><p>Unfortunately Kincade knew where a lot of skeletons were buried. Who knew what would happen if he started naming names? They all stood to suffer if that happened. God knows who would be tainted when Kincade was finished. Maybe it would be better for everyone if the bastard were to die in custody. It had happened before.</p> <p>The doorbell chimed softly. Time to put his game face on.</p><p>Duke pounded the heavy bag, his hands aching from the punishment, but he kept going. In his head, he wasn\u2019t hitting heavy canvas patched with duct tape at all. No, he was beating the enemy to a bloody pulp.</p><p>He stopped the swinging bag with his hands, needing a moment to let his lungs catch up. Thanks to the past few days of fighting, he was tired and sore, but he\u2019d been unable to unwind enough to sleep.</p><p>With good reason, too. Every time he closed his eyes, he heard the dying screams of his two friends. There would be no coming back for them, not like the Paladins. God, even after years of fighting beside them, he still couldn\u2019t get used to seeing them dead one day and back up walking around the next. It was creepy. Unnatural.</p><p>He used to think they were okay, even considered them heroes. But that ended the day Devlin Bane let his prick start making his decisions for him. When that softhearted Handler he\u2019d married told him to let that first Kalith live, things had gone to hell and stayed that way.</p><p>Duke unleashed his pent-up rage on the bag, pretending it was that bastard Larem. It didn\u2019t help.</p> <p>Another day at the most and Larem would be back on his feet. Duke hadn\u2019t been the only one who\u2019d hoped the Kalith\u2019s wound would be fatal. But no, just like the Paladins, his ability to heal had kicked in and dragged him back from oblivion. What a fucking damn shame.</p><p>One of his fellow guards had tried to do the right thing by ridding the world of the pale-eyed killer and failed. Maybe the next attempt would succeed. With another punch, he imagined the sweet slide of a metal blade through Larem\u2019s gut. A bullet would work, too, but where was the fun in that? He wanted that Kalith to die slowly and screaming for mercy, just like the guards had down in the tunnels. And Larem would only be the first.</p><p>Right jab, left. Right jab, left.</p><p>As he counted down the last of his routine, he thought about the other rumor he\u2019d heard. Something about Sasha Willis. He didn\u2019t want to believe it and wasn\u2019t sure he did. But, God knows, there was certainly precedent for it.</p><p>Yesterday she had stopped by to visit Laurel Young\u2019s lab and check on those injured in the fighting. That much was all right. Hell, he\u2019d even applaud her efforts to bolster the morale. It had been too damn long since any of the upper management paid much attention to the grunts in the trenches.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the disturbing part. She\u2019d had a long talk with Devlin Bane behind closed doors. Again, okay. But then she\u2019d made a beeline to the curtained-off area where they\u2019d stashed the wounded Kalith. What was up with that? Surely with a Regent for a father she knew better than to mistake the guy for anything but craziness waiting to happen.</p><p>But then Lacey Sebastian was shacked up with Barak despite her own brother being a Paladin. Cullen Finley was living with a Kalith woman and her two brats. It was like some kind of disease.</p><p>Last two reps\u2014right, left, repeat. Finished. Maybe now he was tired enough to sleep. Picking up his gear, he headed for the showers.</p> <p>Odd. There was something stuck in the door of his locker\u2014a folded-up piece of paper. He listened hard to see if he was alone. On the way in, he\u2019d passed that new guy, Rusty, but no one else. For sure, the paper hadn\u2019t been there earlier.</p><p>It creeped him out big-time. What if he\u2019d been cursing the Kalith\u2019s name out loud without realizing it? If someone, anyone, had heard him, it could be disastrous. He needed this job no matter how bad things had gotten lately.</p><p>If this was some kind of prank, he\u2019d beat the culprit to a bloody pulp. That\u2019s what it had to be. Right? Only one way to find out: read the note.</p><p>The message was written in block letters: YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN HOW YOU FEEL. WE\u2019LL BE IN TOUCH SOON.</p><p>What the hell? Duke spun around, looking for any sign that someone had been watching him. His skin crawled at the possibility. He was still alone in the locker room, but all of a sudden the thought of using the facility\u2019s shower lost its appeal. He\u2019d wait until he got home to clean up, then order in a pizza and watch whatever game was on television.</p><p>Tomorrow would be soon enough to think about the message and what it might mean. Either way, maybe it was time to look for a new job. Trouble was, he wasn\u2019t qualified to do anything but security work, and no one else paid like the Regents did. If he hung in there for just a few more years, he\u2019d walk away with a generous retirement package. That was the carrot at the end of the stick that convinced most of the guards to find some way to cope with all the weirdness connected with their job.</p><p>But days like these past few made him seriously wonder if the money was actually worth it. Right now, he\u2019d have to say probably not. With that happy thought, he walked out into the Seattle night.</p><p>Sasha paced the length of her hotel room. She\u2019d only wanted to know that Larem was on the mend. That\u2019s all. Under the circumstances, she\u2019d felt she owed him that much.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d acted like the biggest jackass ever. What was wrong with him? Sure, he was hurting and justifiably upset about being stabbed by a guard. Did that mean he had to take it out on her? She had no intentions of being a handy target for his anger ever again. Nope, next time their paths crossed\u2014if they crossed\u2014she\u2019d freeze him out.</p><p>Yeah, she knew just how that would play out. His pale eyes would look so sad as she brushed past him with only the barest of nods. He\u2019d turn to stare longingly after her, wishing he hadn\u2019t acted like such a jerk. She could just see it.</p><p>Like that was going to happen. She flopped down on the couch and hugged a pillow. Working up a nice case of righteous indignation was fun and all, but it didn\u2019t change the facts. Regardless of Larem\u2019s bad behavior, she\u2019d been the one in the wrong. Her actions had put the man\u2014no, the Kalith\u2014in mortal danger not just once but twice.</p><p>He knew it, and so did she.</p><p>Worrying about him was bad enough, but she also hadn\u2019t heard how things were going for the Paladins Devlin had sent south to Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams. Maybe her father had been right to maintain a careful distance from the men who fought and died for the Regents. Knowing they were fighting for their lives was bad enough in the abstract, but knowing them personally took it to a whole new level.</p><p>She reached for her laptop, and shot Devlin a quick request for an update. She wrote another message to Lacey Sebastian, hoping the geologist would have good news for her.</p><p>Now all she could do was wait. Luckily, she was saved by a knock at the door. She wasn\u2019t expecting company, and a quick peek through the peephole wasn\u2019t any help. She opened the door only as far as the chain allowed.</p><p>\u201cHi, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>The woman looked a bit chagrined. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m betting Laurel didn\u2019t get around to calling you. She was supposed to let you know I\u2019d be stopping by. I\u2019m Brenna Nichols. You might have known my father, Judge Nichols.\u201d</p><p>That was a name Sasha recognized for sure. \u201cYes, of course. I knew him from my father\u2019s poker nights. His death rocked the whole organization.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s smile drooped a bit. \u201cSo I eventually found out.\u201d</p><p>Sasha could\u2019ve kicked herself. Judge Nichols had been one of her father\u2019s good friends, but he had chosen to keep Brenna ignorant of his secret connection to the Paladins.</p><p>Sasha closed the door long enough to unfasten the chain. \u201cCome on in. Can I get you something to drink? Water? Pop? Or I could make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater sounds good. I try to avoid caffeine when Blake\u2019s on duty.\u201d Brenna sank down in the closest chair with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I have a hard time relaxing when the guys are on call.\u201d</p><p>Sasha pulled two bottled waters from the mini fridge and handed one to Brenna. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean. Back in St. Louis, I didn\u2019t actually come into contact with many of the Paladins and never visited their headquarters, so the actual fighting was definitely more abstract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe grateful. Their headquarters down in those caves can be a pretty scary place. Been there, done that, don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p><p>Sasha had heard the stories and grinned. \u201cYou do have a certain reputation back in Missouri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>Sasha smiled. \u201cYeah, the general opinion is that no one should ever risk getting between you and Trahern\u2014and he wasn\u2019t the one they said people should be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned, looking pretty proud of herself. \u201cBlake\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>Sasha thought back to her brief time with David and had to agree with Brenna\u2019s assessment. Could Sasha have saved him if she\u2019d been there at his side? She\u2019d never know, but it hurt to think it might have been possible.</p><p>She realized that Brenna was watching her. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to space out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say maybe you\u2019ve had some firsthand experience yourself.\u201d</p><p>But she also seemed to realize that it wasn\u2019t a topic Sasha was ready to talk about, because Brenna immediately changed the subject. Sort of. \u201cI thought you might need to talk about what happened with Larem down in the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>Sasha winced and sat down on the sofa. \u201cI\u2019d really hoped the whole incident would stay a secret, but that was probably naive. I guess everyone thinks it\u2019s my fault he ended up getting hurt so badly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no. No one blames you for that.\u201d Brenna moved forward on her chair. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t hear about it through the rumor mill. Laurel told me because she thought you might like to have another woman to talk to, and she couldn\u2019t leave the lab.\u201d</p><p>That was a relief, though Sasha knew it would get out eventually. \u201cThat was nice of her. I\u2019m not used to being able to talk about my job.\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until recently that Laurel had any women friends who she could really be honest with for that very reason. Slowly, though, we\u2019re building up a nice support group. Besides her and me, there\u2019s Lacey, Lusahn, and now Tate Justice. Thank goodness for e-mail. Since all of our men have a tendency to want to smother us, we occasionally rebel and go out on the town together.\u201d</p><p>Of course, they were all drawn together by their love for the men in their lives. Sasha\u2019s situation was different. Then Larem\u2019s handsome face flashed through her mind. She shook it away. He had nothing to do with this. It would be nice if they would include her in some of their girls\u2019 nights out, and she said so.</p> <p>Brenna finished the last of her water. \u201cThe more the merrier, especially when it makes the guys nervous about what we\u2019re actually up to. I did have another reason for dropping in on you. Laurel asked me to take you by to see her condo.\u201d</p><p>Sasha didn\u2019t hesitate. It was the perfect excuse to get out for a while. \u201cThat would be great. Let me get my purse.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, they let themselves out of Laurel\u2019s condo and locked the dead bolt. Sasha wanted to boogie right there on the sidewalk. The place was perfect. Absolutely perfect. It was big enough if she ever decided to get a roommate, but cozy enough that she wouldn\u2019t rattle around inside it by herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give Laurel a call later and work out the details. I had my stuff put in one of those storage pods, so I can have it shipped out here with just a phone call.\u201d</p><p>Brenna led the way back to her car. \u201cThat was smart of you. I know Laurel will be glad you want to rent the place.\u201d</p> <p>As the two women headed back to the hotel, they passed a man walking along the other side of the street. Something about him caught Sasha\u2019s eye. In fact, if she didn\u2019t know that Larem was still a patient in Laurel\u2019s lab, she would\u2019ve sworn it was him. She twisted in her seat to look back one last time, but he\u2019d already turned the corner.</p><p>Brenna glanced over. \u201cSomeone you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so for a minute, but I guess not.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she wanted to do was admit that she was imagining the Kalith warrior stalking the streets of Seattle. Time to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, how is your research into the history of the Paladins coming?\u201d</p><p>Larem\u2019s leg was killing him as he limped his way down the street and cursed the gods\u2019 sense of humor. Couldn\u2019t they have made it so that his erratic gift as a healer would at least work better on himself? Yes, his body was repairing itself far faster than a human\u2019s would, but it still hurt like hell.</p> <p>Earlier, he\u2019d waited until Laurel was ripping into Lonzo for lying, to sneak out of the lab. His poor roommate should\u2019ve known better than to try to put something over on the Handler. Laurel had too much experience with Paladins to let him get by with his ruse.</p><p>On the other hand, she had no reason to think Larem would be in any great hurry to vacate the place, especially after his near collapse right after Sasha left. Because of his Kalith metabolism, the pain medication she\u2019d given him hadn\u2019t lasted nearly long enough. Once it had worn off, all he could think about was getting the hell out of the lab and back to his duties at the shelter.</p><p>The animals he worked with always soothed his restless spirit. All they needed to make them happy was a gentle touch and acceptance. His hand twitched as he remembered how good it had felt to have Sasha squeeze his hand when she thought he was asleep. Maybe that\u2019s why he and the dogs got along. They had that much in common.</p><p>He walked through the back door of the clinic, doing his best to shrug off the pain and frustration of the past few days. His furry friends had enough problems of their own without having to pick up on his tension. As soon as he started across the room, several heads turned his way. Most weren\u2019t human, but one was. Dr. Isaac smiled and headed straight for him.</p><p>He clapped Larem on the shoulder. \u201cHey, I was getting pretty concerned about you. Usually if you\u2019re going to miss a shift, you call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have worried you, Doctor.\u201d Larem opened his locker and slipped on his lab coat. \u201cI hope my absence didn\u2019t cause any problems.\u201d</p><p>The vet was frowning when Larem turned back toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re limping. What happened? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI injured my leg. It just needed a few stitches.\u201d Major surgery, actually, but confessing that would only worry the man. \u201cIt happened right before my shift yesterday. I\u2019m sore, but otherwise fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Then Dr. Isaac jerked his head toward the cages on the far side of the room. \u201cBetter check in with Chance over there first thing. He\u2019s been staring at the door nonstop. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that he\u2019s been missing you. If you can convince him to forgive your transgressions, I\u2019d like to check him over.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the dog, Larem planned on making a cautious approach. \u201cHe\u2019ll no doubt make me pay for keeping him waiting.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d have to make up for lost ground with the temperamental dog. At least that would give Larem something else to focus on other than Sasha\u2019s dark eyes and halo of fiery hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chance, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>A quick snarl made it perfectly clear how the dog felt about that. He\u2019d been lying down but immediately lurched to his feet as Larem approached his cage, a growl rumbling deep in his chest. At least he wasn\u2019t repeatedly charging against the door of the cage the way he had in the beginning.</p><p>Larem dragged a low bench over to the cage and gingerly lowered himself to sit. The position was far from comfortable for his leg, but it beat sitting on the floor. He closed his eyes and turned his focus inward, seeking the warmth and light. His supplies were low, but he was able to pull additional energy from the sunlight streaming in from a skylight.</p><p>When he\u2019d amassed enough to share, he turned his gaze on the dog, keeping his attitude neutral. Slowly, he let the healing warmth trickle toward the animal, concentrating on the damaged leg to ease any residual pain. The growling slowed and then disappeared. The trickle became a stream until finally Chance lay back down, his big head resting on his front paws, and his body relaxed.</p><p>The two wounded souls sat in peaceful companionship for quite some time. When Larem thought the dog would accept his approach, he stood up and reached for one of the leashes hanging on a peg on the wall. Chance\u2019s ears quirked forward as he followed Larem\u2019s every movement with interest.</p><p>He remained calm when Larem attached the leash and led the way over to the examination table. \u201cChance, behave yourself, and I\u2019ll take you for a long walk.\u201d</p><p>The dog immediately sat down as if understanding the terms of the deal. Dr. Isaac kept his movements slow and deliberate as he came toward Chance.</p><p>\u201cGood boy, this won\u2019t take long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Larem had been prepared to intervene if the dog decided to act up. But Chance remained still while Dr. Isaac ran expert hands over his fur, only whining a little when the vet pressed and poked his bad leg. Then to everyone\u2019s surprise, Chance accepted a couple of treats directly from the doctor\u2019s hand as soon as the exam was over.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing great, Larem. I swear you work magic with my patients. Go ahead, you two. Take your walk, but don\u2019t overdo it. It\u2019s a nice day and someone should get to soak up some of that sunshine out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. And Larem,\u201d Dr. Isaac said, his faded blue eyes twinkling, \u201cone of these days, maybe you\u2019ll trust me enough to explain how that secret mojo of yours actually works. In case you\u2019re wondering, I do know how to keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked into his office and shut the door, leaving Larem staring after him, both stunned and speechless. At least Dr. Isaac hadn\u2019t sounded angry. Would he ever figure these humans out? Probably not.</p><p>Finally, Chance whined and tugged on the leash. Larem smiled as he patted the dog on the head. \u201cAll right, my friend. Let\u2019s take that walk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Back in her hotel room, Sasha couldn\u2019t get the image of the man she\u2019d seen on the street out of her head. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but she was convinced it had been Larem. Laurel hadn\u2019t said anything about him when Sasha had called her about the condo, but then again, she was the man\u2019s doctor. Maybe that whole patient confidentiality thing applied.</p><p>The good news was that the barrier had finally stabilized, so the Paladins could stand down. Devlin had e-mailed Sasha to say he\u2019d set up a rotating schedule to give everyone a little extra time off. She just hoped the barrier cooperated long enough to give them a chance to catch up on their rest.</p><p>Still, neither Devlin nor his wife said a word about Larem. If it had been him, where was he going? He\u2019d been heading in the same direction he\u2019d gone after they\u2019d stopped for coffee.</p><p>Maybe she should take a short walk herself. Work could wait. While the sun was still up, she\u2019d get out and enjoy the fresh air. She pocketed her keys and enough cash for a latte. Outside, the day had grown a little cooler. She could come to really love living here in Seattle. Although she was aware of her father\u2019s doubts the Regents would appoint her to the job permanently, that didn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t do her best to prove him wrong.</p><p>Of course, any more \u201cincidents\u201d would crush any chance she had. On some level she didn\u2019t regret what had happened despite how horrific it had been. Instead, it only solidified her determination to make things better for the Paladins and their guards. How many of the existing Regents had firsthand experience in what it was like for such brave men?</p><p>Very few, she would guess, and that needed to change. Sometimes she thought the Regents were almost petrified. Anything new, any change in how things were done, and they responded by digging in their heels. They hated that Devlin had married a Handler, but five minutes in the couple\u2019s company and Sasha had known for certain it was a love match.</p><p>Yes, she understood the Regents\u2019 concern about the Seattle Paladins allowing Kalith to live in their midst, but again they didn\u2019t know any. Granted, she\u2019d only met one, but if Larem was typical of his kind, then she couldn\u2019t see how the world was worse off because of his presence.</p><p>Now if she could only keep him out of her thoughts for a while. Hoping coffee would help, she hung a right and headed for the nearest coffee shop. Thanks to a short line, she was heading back out the door sipping her favorite combo in just a few minutes.</p><p>What next? Certainly, she wouldn\u2019t go hunting for the elusive Kalith male who had already made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with her. Maybe Larem was right to feel that way, considering what he had gone through because of her. And there was still the question of who had tricked her into going down into the tunnels alone and why.</p><p>The sun had gone behind the clouds, darkening her mood. She did her best to shake off the shadows. Far better that she savor her drink and the sunshine as she walked back to her hotel. No doubt that would be the smart thing to do.</p><p>Before she reached the end of the block, though, an enormous white dog came barreling around the corner dragging its owner along by its leash. She had no idea what breeds had donated their DNA to produce this particular dog, but the results were definitely intimidating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of the people around her scattered to get out of the dog\u2019s way, understandably leery of an animal with teeth that would give the average alligator a run for its money. Not to mention the fact that he probably tipped the scales pretty close to where Sasha herself weighed in.</p><p>She\u2019d been so intrigued by the dog, she hadn\u2019t yet noticed the owner. The dog came to an abrupt stop right in front of her. When she looked up, she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes, and her heart lurched in her chest. Larem. Despite their earlier encounter, she badly wanted to touch him, if only to make sure he was all right.</p><p>\u201cLarem? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be resting?\u201d</p><p>His reaction to seeing her was interesting. If she had to guess, she would\u2019ve said he looked embarrassed or maybe guilty. \u201cI had things to do.\u201d</p> <p>She held her fingers out to the dog to sniff. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Sasha. Chance isn\u2019t particularly fond of people.\u201d</p><p>But in direct contradiction to Larem\u2019s warning, Chance gave Sasha\u2019s fingers a quick lick and then plopped his backside down on the sidewalk, clearly in no hurry to get away from her. Moving cautiously, Sasha reached out to scratch the dog\u2019s chin, laughing when he groaned and leaned into her hand.</p><p>His easy acceptance made her smile. \u201cSee, you\u2019re not so tough, are you, big guy?\u201d</p><p>Then speaking to his two-legged companion, she added, \u201cWould you like me to watch him while you get a cup of coffee?\u201d</p> <p>It was clear that Larem was hesitant, but finally he handed her the leash. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. We\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>Larem really hadn\u2019t wanted coffee, but it gave him an excuse to get away from Sasha for a couple of minutes. For sure, he shouldn\u2019t have left her alone with Chance. The dog was too unpredictable even if he had been on his best behavior since they had left the clinic.</p><p>While waiting for his order, Larem kept a wary eye on the pair outside on the sidewalk. The sunshine brought out the gold highlights in Sasha\u2019s hair as she talked to the dog. Chance had his head cocked to the side, looking as if he understood every word she said. With his tail doing a slow sweep back and forth on the sidewalk, Chance was happily soaking up every bit of attention she was offering.</p><p>Larem should be pleased the dog was capable of bonding with a human after all he\u2019d suffered at his former owner\u2019s hand. But in fact, what he was really feeling was jealous. He should be ashamed of resenting the badly abused animal\u2019s ability to charm Sasha, but he wished like hell he was the one she couldn\u2019t keep her hands off of.</p><p>But he also recognized lonely when he saw it. After all, he lived with it on a daily basis himself. He appreciated the friendship so freely given by Hunter and Lonzo, but that didn\u2019t mean he really fit into their world. Sasha had much the same problem. No matter how good her intentions, those she most wanted to help viewed her as an outsider. Trust and friendship might be slow in coming.</p> <p>\u201cSir, your coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His respite was over.</p><p>After dropping a couple of dollars in the tip jar, he headed for the door. As soon as he walked outside, Chance stood, his wagging tail picking up speed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice dog.\u201d Sasha handed the leash back to Larem. \u201cWould you mind if I walked with you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he would, but not for the reasons she might think. But he\u2019d always preferred to face his problems head-on, and she was definitely a problem for him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going far. Chance needs exercise, but I don\u2019t want him to overdo it.\u201d Not to mention Larem\u2019s own leg wasn\u2019t back to full strength.</p><p>\u201cI noticed he favors one leg. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis former owner used him in dog fights for money.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s awful! The bastard should be gutted for that!\u201d</p><p>Larem agreed with her bloodthirsty reaction. \u201cThe police and Animal Control got a tip and were able to break up the ring. Unfortunately, some of the dogs were too far gone to save. Chance was almost one of them. The vet was able to repair the damage, but the dog\u2019s lack of trust for anyone on two legs made it difficult to treat him after the anesthesia wore off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe obviously trusts you.\u201d She hurried her steps long enough to be able to pet the dog\u2019s head. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine mistreating an animal like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of hard-fought battles for me to get him this far. You\u2019ve gotten closer to him in the past fifteen minutes than I did in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you laid the groundwork.\u201d</p><p>Even so, Sasha seemed pleased by his assessment as they continued down the street. At the end of the block, she stopped. \u201cI\u2019d better go. The past few days have put me behind on a few things. But D.J. and Cullen have managed to make progress on Colonel Kincade\u2019s files. He sure left things in total chaos.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. \u201cThat man was a monster.\u201d</p><p>One who had played games with lives on both sides of the barrier. His involvement in the theft of the blue stones from Kalithia had led directly to the series of events that destroyed Larem\u2019s old life and forced him into this one. Instead of serving his world as an honored warrior, here he was walking a dog. He drew great satisfaction from being able to soothe the wounded spirits of Dr. Isaac\u2019s patients. But life in this world wasn\u2019t the same and never would be.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue that. Unfortunately, Kincade managed to hide his activities so well that no one even suspected what he was up to.\u201d</p><p>Larem disagreed. \u201cThe Paladins certainly knew, but either no one wanted to hear what they had to say on the matter or someone was covering for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Sasha came to an abrupt halt. \u201cDo you know something specific or are you just guessing? My father and the other Regents would\u2019ve done something if they\u2019d known.\u201d</p><p>All right, either she was gullible or too innocent to see the darkness in others. He suspected it was the latter.</p><p>\u201cSasha, the man got away with robbing my world for years. He had to have left a trail, especially when it\u2019s obvious that he wasn\u2019t working alone. There was the guard who tried to kill Laurel, and that Regent in Missouri who shot Trahern. Not to mention whoever killed that very same Regent before Jarvis and the Paladins were able to interrogate him.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s pale skin took on an ashen hue. He reached out to steady her, but she jerked back out of his reach. \u201cYou\u2019re not privy to the inner workings of the Regents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d He stepped closer, deliberately crowding her. \u201cBut I have personal experience in dealing with what happens when someone decides the rules don\u2019t apply to him. If it weren\u2019t for Kincade\u2019s unbridled greed, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck here with you.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s eyes briefly widened in obvious shock, then narrowed in anger. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry for burdening you with my presence.\u201d</p><p>Chance whined, clearly confused by the sudden change in the atmosphere. He looked from Larem and then back to Sasha. Larem hadn\u2019t meant his comment to be an attack on her, but he didn\u2019t regret the blunt truth he\u2019d spoken.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the Regents, Sasha.\u201d But she was their representative, and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I hope to be one, and I respect the work they\u2019ve done and what they stand for.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his hands, trying to control his temper. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to cheer them on when their successes are written in the blood of my people.\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer, getting right in his face. \u201cIf your people would stay where they belong, there\u2019d be no need for the Regents at all. And what about the Paladins? You seem to have no problem with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. They are honorable warriors.\u201d</p><p>In fact his problem at the moment was how much he wanted to wrap this woman in his arms to protect her from everything dark and ugly in this world. She was both strong enough and resilient enough to handle anything that might be thrown at her, but he hated to see her idealism get battered and bruised.</p><p>He busied his hands petting Chance\u2019s soft fur. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sasha. I didn\u2019t mean to pick another fight.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious her own temper was running hot, too, but finally she sighed and retreated a step. \u201cYes, well, like I said, I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>He stayed where he was, watching her walk away and wondering how things had spun out of control so quickly. It didn\u2019t help that Chance tried to follow her, fighting to break free of the firm grip Larem had on his leash.</p><p>\u201cDown, boy.\u201d He tugged Chance back by his side. \u201cWe have to let her go.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Chance whined and gave up, his head down and his tail drooping. Larem knew exactly how the big dog felt\u2014it was as if the sun had dimmed and its warmth faded. Both males stood and watched Sasha until she disappeared around the corner. Frustrated and weary, they made their way back to the shelter.</p><p>God, Sasha so didn\u2019t want to be having this meeting right now, but neither did she have a good reason to postpone it any longer. Devlin would\u2019ve come to her, she supposed, but she\u2019d decided that he might appreciate her meeting him on his own turf. It would be interesting to see how this played out. Right now, she\u2019d be grateful if they just got through the next hour without any bloodshed.</p><p>Okay, that was an exaggeration, but she\u2019d had a crappy weekend, thanks in part to the fight she\u2019d had with one Larem Jones and his buddy Chance. She wasn\u2019t mad at the dog, but she certainly had to question his taste in humans. No, make that his taste in humanoids. Chance probably didn\u2019t care about the distinction, but right now it was an important one to her.</p><p>If she were being honest about it, she forgot about that distinction herself whenever she and Larem were together, at least right up until he shoved the truth in her face again. Like yesterday when they\u2019d been having such a nice time and then their conversation totally derailed.</p><p>Well, now she got it. He hated everything that was important to her. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t be so defensive about the Regents, but Larem shouldn\u2019t lump them all in with criminals like Kincade.</p><p>Granted, he had made a couple of good points. Obviously Kincade hadn\u2019t been functioning in a total vacuum. Someone else had to have known he\u2019d been up to something, and the memories of the rogue Regent operating in Missouri and his subsequent murder didn\u2019t do much to reassure her.</p><p>But right now she had more immediate problems to deal with. She slowed as she reached the alley, smiling at the guard on duty, who was unfamiliar to her. His hand strayed to his weapon, leaving it there even when she flashed her identification badge. After a quick glance at it, he jerked his head toward the door before turning his attention back to the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She thought he even muttered something rude under his breath as she passed by, but she wasn\u2019t sure enough to call him on it. There was definitely something off about his reaction though. Certainly it was a far chillier welcome than the guards had given her when she first arrived in Seattle. She added it to her mental list of problems to be dealt with as time allowed.</p><p>She punched in her authorization code on the keypad and yanked the door open. As she started down the hallway, a familiar figure stepped out of the hall on the right. He turned to walk in the same direction she was heading. Great. Larem was the last person she wanted to see right now.</p><p>She dropped back, hoping to avoid any contact. Her ruse didn\u2019t work; the man stopped to look back at her. Except it wasn\u2019t Larem after all. Given that there was only one other male Kalith who might be roaming these halls, he had to be Barak q\u2019Young.</p><p>He waited for her to catch up with him. \u201cYou must be Sasha.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, and you must be Barak.\u201d She smiled, mostly from relief.</p><p>Barak glanced at the briefcase she held in a tight grip. He gave her an odd look before asking, \u201cAre you heading toward Devlin\u2019s office? If so, I\u2019m walking in that direction myself.\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he fell into step beside her. \u201cSo how are you finding life here in Seattle? How does it compare to your home in Missouri?\u201d</p><p>At least one of them was capable of carrying on a conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s really lovely here, and definitely different from Missouri. Not better, just different. You visited with Devlin, didn\u2019t you? So you\u2019ve at least seen some of the area.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy trip was quite brief, but I did get to see part of the Ozarks. Very different from the mountains here. What I remember the most was the heat.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYes, it does get pretty steamy in the summer. Thank goodness for air-conditioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He slowed to a stop. \u201cWell, here we are. It was a pleasure to finally meet you. Perhaps you\u2019d like to join Lacey Sebastian and me for dinner one evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said, finding that she really meant it. \u201cJust let me know when.\u201d</p><p>He continued on, cutting through the cluster of desks to where Blake Trahern was talking with Cullen Finley. Both men nodded in her direction as she made her way over to where Devlin was leaning in his doorway obviously waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cAm I late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, right on time. Come on in.\u201d He straightened up and led the way into his office. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her chair around to the side of Devlin\u2019s desk, hating to have the huge expanse of scarred wood between them while they talked. Somehow sharing the corner of his desk seemed friendlier than sitting on opposite sides.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a chance to go over the list I e-mailed you?\u201d Devlin said as he sat, his chair creaking in protest. \u201cJust so you know, I did ask some of the guys for their input.\u201d</p><p>There was a twinkle in his eyes that made her wonder how much editing he\u2019d had to do before sending along their suggestions.</p><p>Knowing D.J., she bet there\u2019d been some doozies. \u201cI take it that a few of the ideas were more interesting than appropriate. Care to share?\u201d</p><p>Devlin laughed. \u201c\u2018Interesting\u2019 is a tactful way to put it. But, yeah, a couple were quite creative and possibly illegal in some states.\u201d</p><p>While he spoke, she set her laptop on the edge of the desk and booted it up. \u201cOkay, now you\u2019ve got my imagination running wild. Tell me your favorite, and I promise not to repeat it, or even ask who came up with it.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin leader shoved his long hair back out of his way as he gave the matter some thought. \u201cBeer on tap in the barracks down in the tunnels almost made the list.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned at him. \u201cWhile I can understand the appeal, the thought of unlimited alcohol mixed with swords sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I had to say no.\u201d Clearly he regretted that being the case. \u201cBut otherwise, I tried to make sure that anything that made the final cut would offer the greatest bang for the buck and have the most impact on the Paladins themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverall, you did a great job coming up with some pretty creative ideas. We can\u2019t afford to do all of them, at least not immediately, but I\u2019d still like to send all of the suggestions back to the Board. I think they\u2019d benefit from hearing what\u2019s really needed from the actual boots on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d But Devlin seemed skeptical.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Sasha, I know you mean well, but I have asked for almost everything on that list at one time or another, and I\u2019ve always been shot down. There\u2019s never enough money or personnel or some other lame-ass excuse.\u201d</p><p>Just that quickly his good mood was gone, along with her own. She was getting tired of having to defend the Regents and everything they did for the Paladins. Rather than try that tactic again, she steered the conversation back to the list.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for decisions made in the past, but here\u2019s what I can do now.\u201d She turned the screen so he could see it. \u201cOf your top five items, I thought these two should be given the most priority.\u201d</p><p>She highlighted the ones she meant. \u201cIf you agree, first thing tomorrow I\u2019ll submit the request to purchase more physical therapy equipment for the gym and to hire three more trained medics to work in the labs. I like the idea of recruiting candidates with military backgrounds. It only makes sense.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat was one of Laurel\u2019s suggestions, but the guys agreed. With more medics doing triage and treating the more superficial stuff, the Handlers can get started on the serious wounds and the dead faster.\u201d</p><p>Sasha couldn\u2019t help but shudder at the images that came flooding back. The blood, the screams, the dead and dying.</p><p>Devlin cocked his head to the side and stared at her for several seconds. \u201cFlashback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s getting better, but every so often it takes me by surprise.\u201d She mustered up a small smile. \u201cIf you want to yell at me some more for what happened, go ahead. You won\u2019t be saying anything I haven\u2019t already told myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, don\u2019t take this wrong, but all things considered I\u2019m almost glad it happened.\u201d</p><p>Although she wouldn\u2019t have wished it on her worst enemy, she\u2019d had the same thought herself.</p><p>Devlin continued, \u201cI know it was tough on you, and you probably still feel guilty about what happened to Larem. But now you have a lot better understanding of what it\u2019s like for us down in the trenches. It will make you a better Regent than most.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that surprised her. How did he know that was her dream? She sat back and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI never said I wanted to be appointed as this area\u2019s Regent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to paste your ambitions on the nearest billboard, Sasha. If all you were here to do was assess the situation, you would\u2019ve shown up, reviewed a few files, and then headed back to St. Louis. Besides, if your stay was going to be temporary, you wouldn\u2019t be moving into Laurel\u2019s condo. Not to mention the way you keep poking your nose into places where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she was tired of hearing that last part, too. \u201cOther than the tunnels, as administrator I should have free access to all facilities. How else am I supposed to know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to piss you off, but I\u2019ve seen my share of do-gooders come through here over the years. I\u2019m smart enough to take whatever you\u2019re willing to give me to make things better for my men. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m naive enough to think that this new enlightened attitude will last. It never does.\u201d</p><p>She fought to control her temper. \u201cOnce again, I can\u2019t change what was or wasn\u2019t done in the past. I\u2019ve already said I\u2019ll order the equipment and hire the medics. That still leaves some money in the budget. We can talk about other options later if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>Devlin pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI think we got off track here. I really do appreciate what you\u2019re doing. I even believe you\u2019d like to see some changes in how things are done. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t be surprised if these funds suddenly dry up when you try to use them.\u201d</p><p>He obviously believed every word he said. A sense of dread settled in the pit of her stomach. What if he was right? Would the Board backtrack on their promise when she sent through the authorizations to utilize the funds? She\u2019d already processed the request for additional funding for Laurel\u2019s studies. If approval didn\u2019t come through in the next couple of days, Sasha would start pushing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over the rest of the list. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all anyone can do. At least you\u2019re trying, which is more than Kincade did in all the years he was here.\u201d</p><p>As praise went, it wasn\u2019t much. But then she was here to do a job, not to win any popularity contests.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how about item number three?\u201d</p><p>Chaz looked around for something to kick. According to Rusty\u2019s latest report, his daughter had come within a hair\u2019s breadth of getting herself killed. What the hell had she been thinking? Civilians weren\u2019t allowed in the tunnels for good reason.</p><p>He\u2019d talked to her since the attack, so she\u2019d obviously survived the experience. But why hadn\u2019t she reported the incident? He was her father, damn it! This was exactly the kind of thing that made him wish she\u2019d chosen another career path. One that wouldn\u2019t get her killed by crazies.</p><p>To make matters worse, she\u2019d been saved not by the Paladins but by one of their fucking pet Others. The last thing Chaz wanted was for Sasha to come into contact with those freaks. God knows, the Paladins were unstable in their own right, but no one knew for certain what caused the Kalith to turn into Others. The bastard could\u2019ve turned on her as easily as not.</p><p>The thought of a phone call telling him his little girl had been butchered was the stuff of nightmares. He had half a mind to hop the next flight to Seattle and drag Sasha right back to St. Louis where she belonged. The only thing stopping him was the knowledge that he might not succeed and that she\u2019d never forgive him for even trying.</p><p>He also wanted to know where Rusty had been when all this was going down. George had made it clear to the guard that his primary duty was to make sure Sasha was safe. Yes, he had to pull enough shifts to make his transfer to Seattle seem legit, but screw that if it meant he couldn\u2019t manage the job he was really sent there to do.</p><p>At least for now Sasha was safe and had hopefully learned her lesson. He\u2019d only seen the aftermath of the battles Paladins fought and that was horrible enough. He\u2019d had nightmares for days after seeing a dead Paladin come back to life. Talk about a freak show! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe seeing the carnage Others caused would be enough to ensure that she would figure out a way to rid Seattle of its Kalith residents. The Board of Regents had considered issuing direct orders to dispose of them, but he\u2019d reluctantly argued against that idea. If they ever managed to piss off the Paladins enough that they walked away from the job, the whole world would be screwed, not to mention overrun with Others out for blood.</p><p>He picked up the authorization requests Sasha had submitted and skimmed them. After stopping to read them more carefully, he considered the implications and had to smile. His daughter sure was hell bent on making her presence known, and not just in Seattle. Once her proposed expenditures were approved, the Regents would be hearing from every Paladin installation in the world wanting some of the same, most likely starting with the ones right here in Missouri.</p><p>Maybe it was time to roll the dice and see what happened. He reached for his pen and scrawled his name on the requests.</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>Duke glared at the e-mail on his laptop. The sender\u2019s address was unfamiliar, the kind he normally deleted without opening. But the subject line on this one was clearly meant for him.</p><p>He read it out loud: \u201cDuke, the bastards must die.\u201d</p><p>The body of the e-mail said more of the same, but again there was no signature to identify the sender. Okay, he was down with the idea if this guy was talking about killing those fucking Others who\u2019d managed to worm their way into living on this side of the barrier. The adults should\u2019ve been gutted the minute they crossed over and the two kids shoved back into their own world. Neither of those things was going to happen, not with a bunch of the Paladins ready to go down fighting to protect them.</p><p>So, yeah, he was ready to sign on to any feasible plan for getting things back to the way they were before that creepy Barak crossed paths with Devlin Bane. The e-mail said to simply send a blank reply if he wanted to know more. He\u2019d do it in a heartbeat if he knew for sure it wasn\u2019t a trap.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he asked, wishing he could expect an answer.</p> <p>His hand hovered over the mouse, his left forefinger itching to click the button. If he chickened out, he\u2019d have to go on watching his friends fight and die, and for what? Not a damned thing if the Regents and the Paladins started treating the enemy with more respect than they did the guards.</p><p>He knew for a fact that part of the Seattle budget had been diverted to pay the three adult Kalith\u2019s salaries. Barak was paid to work with his woman. No doubt about how he earned his money. Hell, Duke would\u2019ve applied for that job himself, but Lacey Sebastian had never given him a second glance.</p><p>The other two were \u201cinstructors.\u201d Sure, they could teach everyone how to counter the style of fighting the Others used. But in return, the Kalith now knew everything about the human weapons and how they were used.</p><p>The question he had was whether the Kalith could duplicate the technology used to produce firearms or stun guns. Who knew what kind of intelligence Barak and Larem had been sent across the barrier to gather?</p><p>As Duke considered his options, he wiped his sweaty palms on his pants. On the one hand, he could ignore the e-mail and go on just as he had been: reporting for duty, doing his job, and eating antacids by the handful. Or, he could click the button and see what happened.</p><p>He clicked the mouse before he could convince himself otherwise.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he was well into his six-pack two hours later that he remembered to check his mail. Sure enough, his mysterious contact had responded. Before opening the e-mail, Duke snagged another beer.</p><p>Okay, it was now or never. He opened the e-mail and scanned its contents.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t sit still, so he walked a couple of laps around the room before sitting back down at the computer to read the message again:</p><p>Friend, from now on we won\u2019t use names or at least real ones. This Sunday, take the ferry across to Whidbey Island and drive down to the state park on the south end. Be there at noon and carry a newspaper opened to the sports page so we can recognize each other. I can\u2019t tell you how many of us to expect and wouldn\u2019t if I could. You have one last chance to back out of the deal by replying with \u201ccancel my subscription\u201d typed in the subject line. Otherwise, you\u2019re in this for the long haul. The fight for our world begins now!</p><p>The words burned themselves into Duke\u2019s brain. After deleting the e-mail, he purged the trash file and then emptied the recycle bin, hoping to destroy all records of the correspondence except a hard copy. Sunday was his day off. Had the mysterious sender known that? It was pretty damned spooky how much the guy seemed to know.</p><p>Duke would know more come this weekend. Until then, tomorrow was another workday, and it was time for bed. But as he lay staring up at the ceiling in the darkness, he had to wonder whether he\u2019d just signed his own death warrant.</p><p>The money had been approved. Sasha danced around her office whooping it up, grinning from ear to ear and toasting her reflection in the window. Her little celebration didn\u2019t last long though. It was no fun when she was the only one tapping her toes.</p> <p>She dialed Laurel\u2019s number but decided against leaving a message when it went to voice mail. She also struck out when she tried Devlin. That was okay. In an hour she was due at Lacey Sebastian\u2019s house for a Saturday night barbecue. It would be a whole lot more fun to tell Devlin and Laurel in person.</p><p>The geologist had called with the invitation right after Sasha had finished up her meeting with Devlin. Lacey had warned Sasha that there was likely to be a mob, but that was okay. It would be nice to get to know the locals in a more informal setting.</p><p>Her father had made it a policy not to socialize much with the hired help, as he called anyone other than the Regents themselves. His theory was that maintaining an emotional distance made it easier to make the hard decisions. Maybe that worked for him, but not for her. The choices the Regents made had a direct impact on everyone in the organization. She wanted people to feel that she was approachable and open to their suggestions.</p><p>She ducked into the ladies\u2019 room to see how she looked. This time of year the weather could change in a matter of minutes, so she\u2019d picked black jeans with a dark gold tank top and matching black jacket. Right now the sun was shining, but clouds were gathering out over the Sound.</p><p>Lacey had said they\u2019d move the party inside if necessary. Since she didn\u2019t seem bothered by that possibility, Sasha wouldn\u2019t worry either. After retrieving the dessert she\u2019d bought as her contribution for the evening, she flagged down a cab and gave the driver Lacey\u2019s address.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to find the right house on the block. The driveway was overflowing with cars, with a few even parked on the lawn. She\u2019d heard the Paladins had drawn straws; those with short ones remained on duty so the rest could party. Sasha paid the fare and climbed out of the cab feeling a bit intimidated by the number of people who\u2019d shown up.</p><p>Even from the street she could hear the murmur of voices coming from the backyard\u2014most of them male. She braced herself and headed for the front door. Someone must have been watching for arrivals, because the door swung open before she had a chance to ring the bell.</p><p>Her smile faded a bit when she saw who it was. \u201cLarem, I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Although she should have. It only made sense that Barak and Lacey would invite all the Kalith in the area. Larem didn\u2019t look any happier to see her.</p><p>\u201cGo on through the kitchen. Lacey is expecting a few more people, so I offered to man the door until they all arrive.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much she could say to that, but she wasn\u2019t about to let his presence ruin the party for her. Luckily, Laurel spotted Sasha as soon as she stepped out on the deck. The Handler made a beeline for her.</p><p>Sasha smiled at the doctor. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see a familiar face, Laurel, especially because I\u2019ve got good news!\u201d</p><p>After Sasha told her about the funding, the two of them stood together, looking down on the backyard from the deck. There were only a few women mixed in the crowd. Sasha recognized Brenna standing with Trahern. The woman she was talking to had to be Lusahn q\u2019Arc, her pale eyes and dark hair with silver streaks clearly marking her as Kalith.</p><p>But it was the men milling around the yard who drew Sasha\u2019s attention. Despite having met a fair number of them already, she found seeing them all together was overwhelming. Paladins varied in coloring and build, but each was a prime specimen in his own right. Maybe it was something about the way they moved with such power and confidence. Her companion picked up on the direction Sasha\u2019s thoughts had taken.</p><p>Laurel leaned her elbows on the railing beside her. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the whole secrecy thing, I\u2019ve always thought if we could get these guys to pose for a calendar, we could all retire rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have something there. I\u2019d volunteer to organize it in a heartbeat. We could even use part of the money to fund some special projects here.\u201d She shot Laurel a teasing look. \u201cThink Devlin would pose shirtless? I\u2019m betting D.J. would for sure.\u201d</p><p>The words were no sooner out of her mouth than she realized they were no longer alone. Please tell her that Larem hadn\u2019t heard that last part. One glance at his face told the story. He\u2019d heard all right and wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><p>\u201cHere. I thought you two might be thirsty.\u201d He shoved a soft drink at each of them and then stalked away.</p><p>Laurel grimaced. \u201cWhoops. Something tells me Larem disapproves of the whole calendar idea.\u201d</p><p>Then she winked at Sasha. \u201cOr maybe he hated the idea of you wanting to see D.J. and Devlin half naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. And here I was going to ask him and Barak to pose for June and July.\u201d</p><p>Sasha took a long sip of her cola and watched Larem make his way across the yard to stand with a couple. The guy looked vaguely familiar, but not the woman. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter Fitzsimon and his fianc\u00e9e, Tate. They live about seventy miles north of here where he keeps an eye on another stretch of the barrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I recognized him. He\u2019s originally from Missouri, right? That\u2019s probably where I\u2019ve seen him. I\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d been transferred out here.\u201d</p><p>Larem looked much more relaxed now that he was with them. \u201cIs he good friends with Larem?\u201d</p><p>Laurel nodded. \u201cYeah. Larem was part of the crew that brought down Kincade. He and Hunter struck up a friendship right after Hunter moved up north. Everyone was a bit surprised considering what happened to Hunter back in Missouri, but they\u2019ve been good for each other.\u201d</p><p>The Handler was obviously referring to when Hunter had been tortured to death by Others. Sasha didn\u2019t know all the details, but she\u2019d heard enough to make her skin crawl. It was easy to understand why the friendship between Larem and Hunter would have come as a surprise.</p><p>Laurel popped the top on her drink. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t be standing here gossiping. Want to go mingle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Sasha followed her down the steps to the patio. \u201cCan you introduce me to Lacey? We\u2019ve talked on the phone but haven\u2019t actually met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. She\u2019s over there with her brother Penn and Barak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Larem kept his eyes focused on Hunter and Tate, but he was all too aware of Sasha\u2019s movements as she drifted from group to group. Right now she was laughing at something D.J. had said. The jerk! He should\u2014</p><p>Hunter\u2019s gravelly voice interrupted his thoughts. \u201cIs something wrong, Larem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d he asked, aiming for calm and failing miserably.</p><p>His friend smiled and pointed at Larem\u2019s hands. One was curled into a tight fist while the other clutched his drink hard enough to dent the sides of the can. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a bit tense there. Who\u2019s pissed you off this time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not buying that.\u201d Tate angled her head to look past him. \u201cWho\u2019s the redhead?\u201d</p><p>Hunter answered for him. \u201cThat\u2019s Sasha Willis, the new administrator assigned here. Rumor has it she\u2019s hoping to be promoted to Regent status and stay permanently.\u201d</p><p>Great, and here Larem had been hoping she\u2019d go back to where she came from any day now. Of course, she probably wanted the same for him.</p><p>\u201cThe one who got herself trapped down in the tunnels?\u201d Tate looked to Larem for confirmation. \u201cThe one you rescued?\u201d</p> <p>And killed his own people in the process, but he kept that to himself as he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d Then he steered the conversation in a safer direction. \u201cSo how is your book coming along?\u201d</p><p>Tate blushed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. I\u2019m doing the final polish before I start querying agents to see if they\u2019d like to represent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, too!\u201d Hunter bragged. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m still trying to decide if I was the inspiration for the lawman or the gunslinger in the story.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cThe sheriff doesn\u2019t get the woman, but then the gunslinger gets shot.\u201d</p><p>Tate looked outraged as she punched Hunter. \u201cHunter Fitzsimon, you promised you wouldn\u2019t read it until I was completely finished!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I lied,\u201d Hunter said, rubbing his arm. \u201cI wanted to know what it was about those two guys that made your eyes go all dreamy. Besides, you let Mabel read it.\u201d</p> <p>Mabel was one of Tate\u2019s neighbors and a close friend. Larem was fond of the elderly woman and her two sisters. He asked, \u201cSo what did Mabel say about the book?\u201d</p><p>Hunter snickered. \u201cShe said it needed more hot sex, but otherwise she liked it.\u201d</p><p>Tate\u2019s face turned rosy. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Hunter. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>Larem smiled at the exchange. It sounded exactly like something Mabel would\u2019ve said. She might be old, but she was definitely feisty. He also enjoyed seeing Hunter so happy. It hadn\u2019t been that long ago that he had raged out of control and tried to kill Larem with his bare hands just for being Kalith. The Paladin might still have his demons, but their hold on him had faded considerably since Tate had entered his life.</p><p>A man could face almost anything with the right woman by his side. Larem automatically sought out the corner of the yard where Lusahn q\u2019Arc stood beside Cullen Finley, his arm draped across her shoulders. For once, the sight of her looking so happy with her human lover didn\u2019t send a shaft of pain twisting deep inside Larem\u2019s chest. In fact, he was glad for her. She\u2019d created a nice family for herself with the Paladin and the two Kalith orphans she\u2019d adopted.</p><p>At that moment, she happened to look in his direction. He smiled at her and nodded. Yes, she\u2019d made decisions that had ripped his life apart. But looking back, he knew she\u2019d done the best she could under difficult circumstances. The next time he caught her alone, he\u2019d tell her that he was pleased that she\u2019d moved on and built a new life in this world.</p><p>Which meant it was time for him to do the same.</p><p>Before he could pursue that thought or wonder why he\u2019d been keeping track of Sasha\u2019s movements ever since she\u2019d arrived, Lacey announced that dinner was ready. Everyone converged on the tables of food in one big rush, with the usual good-natured pushing and shoving among a few of the Paladins.</p> <p>A couple of the idiots bounced into Sasha, sending her stumbling backward. Larem stepped out of line and caught her by the arm just in time to keep her from hitting the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhoops, sorry, pretty lady,\u201d the closest Paladin said as he shoved his friend back out of the way, almost hitting her again. \u201cJerk, see what you made me do?\u201d</p><p>Larem planted himself in front of Sasha and glared at the two fools. \u201cMust you act like children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I said I was sorry.\u201d The young Paladin took a step forward, his buddy moving up beside him. \u201cMind your own damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my business, so back off.\u201d Larem ignored Sasha\u2019s gasp of surprise\u2014or maybe it was outrage\u2014at his outlandish claim. Before he could deal with her, he had to do something about the two punks.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t want to back off, Other, what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Larem sensed more Paladins approaching, but they were allies, not enemies. Lonzo stood to his right, Hunter to his left. Lacey would not soon forgive him for turning her barbecue into a brawl, but it wasn\u2019t in his nature to run from a fight. If anyone gave ground, it wasn\u2019t going to be him. His two friends would happily provide backup, but he wouldn\u2019t need their help with these two.</p><p>Devlin Bane shouldered his way through the crowd. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Larem kept his eyes focused on his opponents. \u201cThese two children almost knocked Ms. Willis down\u2014twice. I was about to teach them some manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you freaky-eyed alien, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before the youngster could finish, Devlin had him by the throat. \u201cNot one more word, Craig. You hear me? Not one more word.\u201d</p><p>When the kid managed to nod, Devlin shoved him backward. \u201cI don\u2019t know what started this and don\u2019t care, but it stops now.\u201d</p><p>Devlin shot a quick glance in Larem\u2019s direction. \u201cYou free Monday afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He reached over to brush a fleck of dust off the young Paladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMonday at one, you and your buddy here will report to the gym for some quality practice time with Larem. Just to keep things interesting, if there\u2019s anything left of you when your lesson\u2019s over, you can each log some additional training with me.\u201d</p><p>Trahern had joined the group. \u201cNot fair, Dev. How come you and Larem get to have all the fun?\u201d</p><p>Devlin\u2019s smile was a scary thing indeed. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll take turns.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo and Hunter both chimed in. \u201cSounds like a good time. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen Larem in action. Who knows, maybe Barak will join us.\u201d</p><p>By now the two young Paladins were wide-eyed and pale. \u201cBut, sir, he\u2019s just a . . .\u201d</p><p>Devlin got right back in his face. \u201cJust how damned stupid are you, Craig? Larem is a close friend of half the men here\u2014a friend they trust to have their backs. Do you have any idea how rare that kind of friendship is? Shut your mouth and leave now, both of you, while you still can. And on your way out, stop and apologize to Lacey and Barak for screwing up their party. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d they both managed to stammer.</p><p>\u201cGood, now get out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Devlin waited until they were gone before he walked away, shaking his head in disgust. Larem bit back the urge to tell the Paladin that he could handle his own problems, but he was all too aware of Sasha listening to every word of the heated exchange.</p><p>If she\u2019d thought the Kalith were universally accepted by the people stationed in Seattle, she now knew the truth. But for every punk like Craig, there were two like Lonzo and Hunter, men who\u2019d fought and bled beside him.</p><p>Gradually, the other guests turned their attention back to the food. Larem braced himself to face Sasha, expecting to see nothing but anger reflected in those big eyes of hers.</p><p>\u201cSasha, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she cut him off. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. Jerks are jerks wherever they are. Luckily, those two are still young, so maybe there\u2019s hope for them. I am sorry, though, that they were so rude to you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he hadn\u2019t seen that one coming. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, although suddenly I\u2019m starving.\u201d She looked past him toward the people working their way along the buffet. \u201cI think we\u2019d better get in line before the food is all gone.\u201d</p><p>Not sure if he was supposed to stick right with her or not, he hung back long enough to let a couple of other people go ahead of him. If Sasha missed him, she gave no indication. Pretending that it didn\u2019t bother him, he picked up a plate and started piling on the salads.</p><p>When his plate was full to overflowing, he grabbed a plastic fork and looked around for a place to sit. Hunter had evidently been watching for him, because he stood up and waved Larem over. Relieved to have a place where he knew he\u2019d be welcome, Larem threaded his way through the throng toward his friend.</p><p>To his surprise, Hunter and Tate weren\u2019t alone at their end of the long table. Lonzo and D.J. sat flanking Sasha, leaving the only open spot directly across from her. There was no way to avoid sitting there without drawing even more attention to himself.</p><p>D.J. took a swig of his beer and set it aside. \u201cHey, Larem, I\u2019ve got a question for you.\u201d</p><p>Larem braced himself. When it came to D.J., there was no telling what he\u2019d ask. More than once he\u2019d heard one of the other Paladins say that sometimes there was a complete disconnect between D.J.\u2019s mouth and his brain.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and ask, but no promises that I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed. \u201cPerfect response, Larem.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo leaned forward to look around Sasha at D.J. \u201cAnd remember there are ladies present.\u201d</p><p>The man in question gave them all a disgusted look. \u201cGet off my back, Lonzo. I know how to behave in public. I just want to know if he dances.\u201d</p><p>What could Larem say to that? \u201cNot with you. No offense, you\u2019re good looking, at least by human standards, but I don\u2019t make a habit of partnering with men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When D.J. choked on his beer, Hunter pounded on his back. That didn\u2019t keep him and Lonzo from cracking up at the look on D.J.\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat is not what I meant, jerk.\u201d</p><p>Larem grinned at the flustered Paladin. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you explain what you did mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we clean up the food, Lacey said we could crank up the music and use the deck and patio for dancing. It occurred to me that I\u2019ve never seen you or Barak dance. I just wondered if you both have two left feet or if Kalith just don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p> <p>Larem\u2019s grasp of the nuances of English was far better than it used to be, but occasionally an expression threw him. It took him a moment to decide that \u201ctwo left feet\u201d meant clumsy.</p><p>\u201cWe can dance just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d D.J. nudged Sasha. \u201cThe guys outnumber the women here tonight by about six to one. If Barak and Larem were out of the running, it would even the odds a bit.\u201d</p><p>With a perfectly straight face, Sasha shook her head. \u201cSorry to disappoint you, D.J., but it\u2019s me who doesn\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin immediately wilted, his disappointment obvious and complete. \u201cOh, well, we\u2019ll just watch then.\u201d</p> <p>Larem suspected Sasha was teasing the Paladin, but he didn\u2019t know for sure until she looked across the table and winked at him. Tate saw it and snickered. Finally, D.J. realized that he\u2019d been had.</p><p>\u201cOkay, lady, just for that, I claim the first dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but I have to warn you that I like to lead.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo, not to be outdone, said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay with me as long as I get the second dance.\u201d</p><p>Tate turned to Hunter with an expectant look. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cOne dance. You know how much I hate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour.\u201d Tate crossed her arms over her chest, clearly determined to win this negotiation.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cThree plus two slow dances. Even you can manage to slow-dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He tugged her closer for a quick kiss. \u201cBut you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Larem observed the interchange with mixed feelings. It was hard to see their obvious love for each other and not want some of that for himself.</p><p>Once again, he found himself watching Sasha talk to D.J. and Lonzo. There was no way he was going to sit on the sidelines and watch her dance with a series of Paladins. He\u2019d seen people dancing on television. It couldn\u2019t be that hard, especially when the music slowed down. Most of the time, the couples swayed together, their movements looking a lot like foreplay.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lacey began passing out trash bags and the group made quick work of the mess. Food was packed up and the coolers restocked with pop and beer. The sun had gone down, so the only light came from the twinkling lights that Lacey and Barak had strung in the low branches of the trees and along the deck.</p> <p>When the music started, D.J. grabbed Sasha by the hand and dashed for the makeshift dance floor. Hunter let Tate drag him along in their wake. He grumbled each step of the way, but Larem could tell he was really bluffing. As soon as they reached the patio, Hunter spun Tate and led her through a rather amazing display of dance steps.</p><p>For a man who swore he hated dancing, he looked pretty proficient at it. Devlin and Laurel were the next couple to join in, followed by Trahern and Brenna. Pretty soon all the mated pairs were dancing while the other males looked on in envy. But after the first song, all the women abandoned their partners and chose new ones.</p><p>Lonzo, not to be outdone by D.J., was showing off to a salsa number with Sasha, her pretty face flushed and happy as she did her best to follow his lead. Whoever was manning the stereo switched over to a slower pace after the salsa ended to give everyone the chance to catch their breath.</p><p>Larem had been waiting for that exact moment to make his move. He held out his hand to Sasha, giving her the final decision.</p><p>Sasha didn\u2019t hesitate, letting Larem pull her close as the gentle rhythms surrounded them. They fit together better than she would\u2019ve thought considering the difference in their heights. Cocooned in the darkness of the crowded patio, she gave in to temptation and laid her head against Larem\u2019s chest. A heartbeat later, he nestled his head against the top of hers, his breath softly tickling her cheek.</p><p>Dancing with Lonzo and D.J. had been fun, but this was different. Ever since that instant when Larem had grabbed her in the elevator, she\u2019d wanted to feel his arms around her again. It was insane, and she knew it.</p><p>That didn\u2019t make it any less true.</p><p>Unfortunately, songs never lasted more than a few minutes. As the final strains died away, she forced herself to step back. Larem resisted letting her go only briefly, but it was long enough to let her know that she wasn\u2019t the only one with regrets.</p><p>She held on to his hand, tugging him down so she could be heard over the heavy metal that started blasting from the closest speakers. \u201cI\u2019d like a cold drink before I get whisked away again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and plowed a path through the crowd, towing her along behind him. When they broke through to freedom, he finally let go of her hand. It was for the best, but for the first time she felt the chill of the evening air.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>Larem had leaned down close to her ear to ask. She turned toward him, toward that mouth that she very much wanted to taste again. For a second she thought he\u2019d read her thoughts because he swayed toward her a fraction of an inch before abruptly standing back.</p><p>She blinked, wondering if she\u2019d only imagined that small connection, but then she sensed another presence. They weren\u2019t alone. Lonzo was standing right behind them, popping the top on a beer. She realized she\u2019d never answered Larem, but accepted the pop he held out to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She hoped he realized she meant for more than just the drink. It was hard not to be disappointed by the missed opportunity, but it was definitely for the best. She didn\u2019t know what to do about the attraction she felt for Larem. Rather than stand there next to temptation, she set her drink aside and went looking for D.J.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Lonzo nudged Larem with his elbow. \u201cYou gotta quit looking at her like that. She\u2019s cute and all, but Sasha\u2019s the boss, not to mention her old man is a Regent.\u201d</p><p>Larem was tempted to tell his roommate to fuck off and mind his own business, but Lonzo was right. Larem was playing with fire, and they both knew who\u2019d end up getting burned if her father found out a Kalith warrior was itching to get naked with his daughter.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Lonzo nodded toward the dance floor where Sasha was dancing with D.J. \u201cI doubt anyone but me and Hunter know for sure that you\u2019re seriously interested in her, but you need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had one dance with her, and so did you.\u201d He glared in D.J.\u2019s direction. \u201cGo talk to him. He\u2019s on his second.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo snorted. \u201cYeah, he is, but she isn\u2019t cuddling with him like she did with you. I\u2019ve got to tell you, bro, those were some serious moves you put on her out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was lucky enough to get a song with a slow beat instead of whatever you want to call that racket.\u201d His words came out as more of a growl than intended.</p><p>Lonzo understood him well enough to know that when Larem\u2019s accent grew thicker, his temper was on the verge of exploding. That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d back off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to piss you off, man, but you need to tread carefully. You already made waves when you went all heroic and saved her life, not to mention how you got all territorial when you faced down those two punks earlier. Toss in holding her close like that on the dance floor, and you might as well paint a sign on her back marking her as yours.\u201d</p><p>Anger slid through Larem\u2019s veins. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear her complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were both too wrapped up in each other to notice anything else. But I wasn\u2019t the only one watching, and there was definitely some speculation about what was going on. Maybe you could deflect some of that if you\u2019d go dance with someone else. Better yet, a couple of someone elses.\u201d</p><p>That was the last thing Larem wanted to do, but he had to admit Lonzo was right. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go dance, but the first person who laughs gets his ass kicked, especially if it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo grinned. \u201cFair enough. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to steal Sasha before someone else does.\u201d</p><p>He laughed when Larem glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m just looking out for your interests, roomie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell am.\u201d Lonzo turned serious. \u201cI don\u2019t poach.\u201d</p><p>The party slowly wound down. With everyone pitching in, the final cleanup didn\u2019t take long. One by one, the cars and trucks disappeared from sight. Larem was catching a lift to the apartment he shared with Lonzo, but he wanted to make sure Sasha had a way back to her hotel. Yeah, she was a big girl and could find her own ride, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself.</p><p>Lonzo, always the mind reader, leaned close and murmured, \u201cWant me to ask her if she needs a ride?\u201d</p><p>Larem\u2019s first instinct was to say no, but he gave in to the temptation. \u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>He watched as his roommate stopped to talk to a couple of friends, taking an indirect route to where Sasha stood chatting with Lacey. Smart thinking. That would lessen the likelihood that anyone would think anything of his casual offer to give Sasha a ride.</p><p>To reinforce the idea that Lonzo was operating on his own, Larem left the house to stand outside by the truck. Either Sasha would be with Lonzo or she wouldn\u2019t; all he could do was wait to see.</p><p>A minute later, the front door opened again. Larem had been leaning against the fender of the truck but immediately straightened up as soon as Sasha stepped out into the night air. He ignored the surge of excitement at seeing her coming toward him. Both the Kalith and the Paladins had superior night vision, so he carefully schooled his features to express only mild interest in her approach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ached to explore those feminine curves again, to crush her body against his somewhere a hell of a lot more private than a crowded patio. He closed his eyes and imagined how it would feel to dance with her, only stretched out on a big bed, her satin skin sliding against his. Damn, he couldn\u2019t let himself think that way.</p><p>She walked directly toward him, Lonzo tagging along slightly behind her. Larem waited until they were little more than a car length away from where he stood to open the passenger door for her.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys sure the hotel\u2019s not out of your way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d Lonzo said, jangling his keys as he walked around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s not very far from our apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She paused to eye the high step up into Lonzo\u2019s truck with obvious misgivings. Larem glanced around and decided no one was watching. He quickly swept her up in his arms and lifted her up to the seat, startling a gasp from Sasha and a laugh from Lonzo.</p><p>\u201cNext time warn me!\u201d she said, sounding more flustered than furious.</p><p>She immediately scooted over toward the middle to make room for him. Even as tiny as she was, the cab felt crowded, but maybe that was because every sense Larem possessed was running hot with her next to him. Pressed together, shoulder to hip, hip to thigh, her warmth soaked through the thin layers of fabric that separated them, the sensation guaranteed to drive him crazy.</p><p>He shifted his position, angling his back toward the door, hoping to give both of them a little breathing room. It didn\u2019t help, not with the scent of her perfume filling in the small space that he opened up between them. Right now, it felt as if both time and Lonzo\u2019s truck were crawling along, intent on straining Larem\u2019s selfcontrol to the limit.</p> <p>Finally, they were back downtown and pulling up in front of Sasha\u2019s hotel. As Lonzo drove under the overhang, his cell phone chimed. He checked the text message and cursed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, folks, but I\u2019ve gotta rock-and-roll. Devlin\u2019s calling in the troops.\u201d</p><p>Larem climbed out of the truck and then lifted Sasha down to the ground. \u201cDrop me here. I can get back home on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I could use a long walk.\u201d</p><p>A really long walk, like right off one of the piers. Maybe the chilly water of Puget Sound would cool his almost painful awareness of the woman standing beside him.</p> <p>\u201cSo, did he say what was going on?\u201d Sasha asked Lonzo</p><p>\u201cNope, but if it was really bad, he would\u2019ve called rather than texting. Oh, well, never a dull moment.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin smiled down at her. \u201cThanks for the dances, Sasha.\u201d Then he grinned at Larem. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>Larem laughed. \u201cBe careful, Ricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Larem shut the door and the two of them watched Lonzo drive off. Sasha shivered as she stared after the truck, turning toward Larem only after the taillights disappeared down the street. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know how they stay sane and do what they do.\u201d</p><p>Larem stripped off his jacket and hung it around her shoulders. \u201cCome on, Sasha. D.J.? Sane?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cOkay, you got me there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut to answer your question, they are warriors, born and bred to serve their people. They can\u2019t imagine living any other life. If you took it away from them, they wouldn\u2019t know what to do with themselves. Perhaps join your military, although some would have a difficult time concealing their special abilities.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s dark eyes studied Larem, seeing far more than he was comfortable with. He didn\u2019t want to hear whatever she was thinking.</p><p>When she did speak, she surprised him. \u201cWould you like to come up for a drink?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d love to follow her up to her room, but to share far more than a beverage. \u201cSasha, I\u2019ve already been warned that people think I\u2019m interested in you. Do you really think that would be wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but I\u2019m inviting you anyway.\u201d She looked past him. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about going upstairs with me, we could walk down to that cafe and just get coffee.\u201d</p><p>Larem hesitated for all of two seconds before rejecting that idea. Out in public, there was no telling who might see them, but for the two of them to be together up in her room definitely wasn\u2019t smart either. Far better that he start the long walk home\u2014alone. He led her around the corner, out of the bright lights and into the shadows against the concrete wall.</p><p>\u201cIt might be smarter if I just go, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She held out his jacket. \u201cBut why? I\u2019d like to think we could at least be friends.\u201d</p><p>Friends? Like hell.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why? Because two seconds after we shut the door to your room, Sasha, I\u2019m going to want a whole lot more than a drink with you. And afterward, you\u2019ll want me to fade back into these shadows, acting like nothing ever went on between us, but that\u2019s not going to happen. If you\u2019re ready for that possibility, then by all means let\u2019s go up to your room and see where the night takes us.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the side of her face with his hand, brushing the pad of his thumb across her lips. \u201cIf not, let me go now before this goes any further. Before I hurt any more.\u201d</p><p>She answered him with a kiss, her sweet mouth softening his frustration. He pulled her into his arms, the perfect fit of her body against his reminding him of the melody that had played while they danced. Perhaps she heard it, too, because suddenly they were swaying in a rhythm meant only for the two of them.</p><p>He leaned into her, loving the feel of her soft breasts pressed against his chest. Her hands latched on to his wrists and then made their way up his arms, finally coming to rest on his shoulders. Their tongues slipped and slid and tempted, hinting at what was to come next if they were to continue down this path together.</p><p>Gods, when was the last time a female held him, wanted him, and made him feel needed like this? Maybe never.</p><p>He became lost in this moment, lost in this woman, and then almost lost his life when he heard a popping sound and something hit the wall above his head, sending chips of concrete raining down on them both. Grabbing Sasha, he pulled her to the ground behind a nearby parked car.</p><p>Sasha clung to his hand. \u201cLarem! Was that a gunshot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Stay down while I look around.\u201d</p><p>He crawled toward the back of the car to peer up over the trunk. Nothing at first, but then the sound of tires squealing as someone ripped down the street and around the corner out of sight. Something wet dripped down his cheek. Had he been hit? He touched his finger to the liquid and studied it in the faint light.</p><p>\u201cLarem?\u201d</p><p>He retreated to where Sasha waited and helped her up. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. Let\u2019s get you inside.\u201d</p><p>She huddled by his side, her rapid breathing a clear sign of how badly shaken she was. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing they\u2019ll be able to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone shot at us!\u201d Anger replaced the fear in her voice.</p><p>Larem led her back to where they\u2019d been standing to point at a splash of dark color on the wall. \u201cYes, they did, but apparently with a paint ball.\u201d</p><p>He fingered a lock of her hair, feeling the sticky residue there. \u201cWe both have it on our clothes and hair. Maybe it was just a teenage prank. I\u2019ll call the police if you\u2019d like, but we have no description, no license plate, and no evidence other than a splash of paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little jerks! A little lower and they might have hit the back of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her concern for him was sweet, but it was time to get her off the street and in to safety. Maybe it really had been kids playing around, but he wouldn\u2019t discard the possibility that the attack had been something more\u2014a warning of some kind. If it was, Devlin would kick his ass for dragging the local police into Paladin business.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you inside before that paint dries in your hair.\u201d</p><p>He took one more look up and down the street, unable to shake the feeling that someone was out there watching their every move. Devlin was busy right now, so he\u2019d have to e-mail this to the Paladin to see what he thought.</p><p>Inside, he was grateful that the staff on duty was too busy with other customers to take much notice as the two of them hurried across the lobby. Luck was with them, because the elevator opened as soon as he pressed the button. He\u2019d see Sasha safely to her room and then go back out to do some prowling. He didn\u2019t mind making a target of himself, but he wasn\u2019t about to risk Sasha being harmed.</p><p>Not that he wanted to leave her. He was all too aware that the two of them were only a moment away from enough privacy to finish what they\u2019d started out side on the sidewalk. Better make his stay short and sweet before temptation beat out good sense.</p><p>Sasha was cold and seriously buzzed. It was a relief that it had been a paint ball and not a bullet, but even so, the adrenaline still pounded in her veins, combined with the aftershock of kissing Larem. She wanted nothing more right now than to get lost in his embrace.</p><p>Was that crazy? Probably.</p><p>She\u2019d had her share of boyfriends, but other than with David, the heat had quickly faded, and the relationships had fallen apart. None of them\u2014not one\u2014rocked her world with a simple kiss the way Larem q\u2019Jones did.</p><p>Maybe it was the attraction of forbidden fruit, but she\u2019d outgrown her taste for bad boys years ago when David died. No, there was something about Larem\u2019s solemn demeanor and warrior heart that made her want more every time they touched.</p><p>Should she still invite him in? She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, but for her the question hung in the air, heavy and demanding. She slid the magnetic key in the slot and watched the light change to green. The handle turned easily as one by one, the excuses to linger disappeared.</p><p>That\u2019s when she remembered that she wasn\u2019t the only one splattered with paint. Larem\u2019s dark clothing didn\u2019t show it as much, but there was no missing the dried splotches on the side of his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come in and wash up.\u201d</p><p>His pale eyes narrowed as he considered her offer. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind. It would be better if I didn\u2019t wander the streets with a blue face.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cWho knows, someone might mistake me for an alien or something.\u201d</p><p>She forced a laugh. \u201cYeah, can\u2019t have that happening.\u201d</p><p>Sasha pointed toward the bathroom. \u201cThere are clean towels and washcloths on the rack.\u201d</p> <p>Larem stood back. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>Inside the bathroom, she studied her face in the mirror. Larem had shielded her from most of the paint, leaving only a few droplets clinging to her hair and sprinkled across her right cheek. She made quick work of washing the paint out of her hair in the sink and then scrubbed her face clean.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she said as she walked back out into the suite, toweling her hair dry.</p><p>She had to admit that it felt strangely intimate to hear Larem moving around in her bathroom. As if his presence meant more than a friend stopping in for a visit. When the water shut off, she hurried across the room to look out the window rather than get caught staring at the bathroom door when he came out.</p><p>She felt Larem\u2019s presence as if he caressed her with only the heat in his eyes. He stood outside the bathroom in that silent way of his. She turned to face him, tossing the damp towel aside.</p> <p>\u201cIs there something else you want?\u201d</p><p>He took one step toward her before he stopped himself. \u201cDon\u2019t play games, Sasha. We\u2019ve had this discussion. Yes, there is something else I want, but not at the price of living in secrecy. I\u2019m only starting to build a life here, and I can\u2019t risk the possible backlash. Besides, we both know you stand to lose everything you\u2019ve been working for if you get involved openly with me.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was right, and so did she. That didn\u2019t make the ache any easier to bear. The Board would never appoint her Seattle\u2019s permanent Regent if she took Larem as her lover. All her hard work would be for nothing. If Devlin was to be believed, another Regent appointee might not do a damn thing to fix what was wrong. Then there was the fact her father would be devastated by her decision.</p><p>Larem\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cRight, that\u2019s what I thought. Good night.\u201d</p><p>His words rang out like another gunshot, only this one struck her in the heart. He\u2019d almost reached the door before she remembered how to move, how to run. She latched on to his arm to stop him. With his strength, Larem could\u2019ve shaken off her hold with little effort. Instead, he froze, staring down at her in silence as they both waited to see what she was going to do.</p><p>Darned if she knew. While her mind listed all the reasons she should let him go, her heart kept screaming that she\u2019d regret it for the rest of her life.</p> <p>\u201cLarem, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d he demanded when she didn\u2019t go on.</p><p>Sasha drew a breath and rolled the dice. \u201cPlease me and let me please you.\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere in the suite thickened, much the way the air did right before a storm broke with a crack of lightning and a rumble of thunder. Then the rain would come, washing the world clean and making it new again. That was exactly how it would be when the two of them came together\u2014explosive and powerful. She just knew it.</p><p>Larem\u2019s arm trembled under her touch, as if he were fighting some powerful battle within himself. \u201cTonight only, or tonight and beyond?\u201d</p><p>Okay, she was a coward for wanting to hedge her bets. But how could she promise the future when right now she was blind to everything beyond this one moment? He deserved honesty from her at the very least.</p><p>\u201cTonight. I know it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s all I can offer.\u201d</p><p>He was tempted; she could see the hunger in his eyes. Then he was shaking his head and stepping away. The gap that opened up between them was far wider than the few inches he\u2019d moved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do this, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>When his hand reached out toward her, he stared at it as if it belonged to someone else. His touch was gentle but hurt her with the knowledge that it wouldn\u2019t last more than a heartbeat. She was the one who broke it off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she whispered and backed away, her eyes filling with unwanted tears. \u201cYou said it yourself. I can\u2019t jeopardize my mission here. The Paladins need what I can do for them.\u201d</p><p>Larem jerked as if she\u2019d slapped him, and maybe she had. He\u2019d already lost so much since the day his life had become entangled with the Paladins. When he moved, she thought he was headed out the door, but instead he started right for her. She backpedaled only to find herself trapped between the wall and one extremely pissed-off Kalith warrior.</p><p>A wiser woman might have been frightened to have all that strength and temper focused solely on her, but she wasn\u2019t. Thrilled was more like it. Hungry. Aching. Oh, yeah, she ached.</p><p>\u201cSasha Willis, for this one night you are mine. Before morning, I\u2019ll walk out that door and not look back.\u201d His voice was little more than a growl, his accent thick and rough. \u201cBut know this, if you let me go, you\u2019ll regret it forever, because sometimes the gods run out of patience with fools and take back the gifts they\u2019ve offered.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask what gift the gods had stolen from Larem, and she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know. Right then it was all she could do to simply breathe as Larem began his seduction. The man\u2019s hands were everywhere, showing her things about her body that she\u2019d never known.</p><p>After peeling her shirt off over her head, he slowly slid down the zipper of her jeans as his mouth hovered over her lips. His hand flattened against the slight curve of her belly and then slowly, so very slowly, eased between the heavy denim of her jeans and the thin cotton of her panties. Finally, his lips brushed against hers in a smile as his wicked fingers slowly worked against her core. They\u2019d gotten that far once before. This time, though, it was just the beginning.</p><p>His touch soothed and tormented at the same time. When she closed her eyes and moaned, his tongue plunged in and out of her mouth, a promise of what lay ahead when they made it to the bed. If they made it to the bed. She needed him to strip off all his clothes and let her at that warm skin and taut muscle.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for more?\u201d</p><p>She pried her eyes open and smiled, trailing her fingers down his chest, down and down until they found and tested the promise lurking beneath his jeans. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cI have been ready since the first day when you swaggered into the meeting with Devlin Bane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t swagger.\u201d But she flushed with pleasure that he\u2019d remembered the moment so clearly. She remembered it too. \u201cYou stood in the back row between Hunter and Lonzo.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he rocked against her hand. \u201cWe need to get rid of these clothes.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he slid her jeans down to her ankles, taking her panties with them. She braced her hands on his powerful shoulders as she stepped out of them. While he removed his shirt, she unhooked the front clasp of her bra, loving it when he froze midmotion as she let it fall to the floor.</p><p>Then he went into hyperdrive, his clothes scattering to the wind. She\u2019d always felt petite around him, but clearly his clothes had somehow disguised how much of him there was. All over. Definitely impressive, even a bit intimidating. Before she could develop a full-blown case of nerves, Larem lifted her into his arms, pressing her against his chest with such care.</p><p>He settled her in the center of the bed and then backed away. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back . . . protection.\u201d</p><p>He was gone and then he was back, his powerful frame stretched out beside her, his gaze lingering as if she were the dessert table at a buffet. When his mouth once again found hers, she gave up and gave in.</p><p>Gods, he loved the spicy flavor of Sasha\u2019s mouth. He couldn\u2019t wait to taste all of her. His anger and frustration had changed into something much more powerful. This might be his only night in her bed, but he was going to do his best to brand it in her memory. Maybe some other lucky bastard would eventually become her lover, but no way would he give her what Larem had. By morning, there wouldn\u2019t be an inch of her body that wouldn\u2019t burn with the knowledge of what they shared.</p><p>With that in mind, he turned his attention to her breasts. Their rosy beauty had struck him dumb at first glance. Would they taste as sweet as they looked? A flick of his tongue answered that question. Yes, they did. He feasted on one and then the other, loving the way they pebbled up against his tongue. Sasha loved it, too, judging from the way she thrust her fingers into his hair and held him close.</p><p>\u201cLarem, that\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>She rolled toward him, lifting her leg high over his hip, opening herself up to his touch. He was more than happy to give in to her demands, gently caressing her slick folds before testing her readiness for more as he suckled her breast with the same pulsing rhythm.</p><p>Sasha reciprocated by grasping his shaft with a sliding squeeze that had his eyes rolling back in his head. If he\u2019d intended this to be a claiming, it was clear that road ran both ways. When she started to guide him right where he most wanted to be, he pulled back, even though the effort almost broke him.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and reached for the packets he\u2019d dropped on the bedside table and ripped one open. Clumsy with desperation, he took far too long to sheath himself, but the extra time gave him back some of the control he\u2019d lost. Throughout the process, Sasha knelt behind him, pressing her body along the length of his back. Her hands stroked his chest as she nibbled and kissed her way along his shoulders and neck.</p><p>He captured one of her hands and placed a damp kiss on her palm. \u201cStill want this?\u201d</p><p>If she had hesitated at all, he would\u2019ve walked away. Maybe. He\u2019d like to think he could\u2019ve found the strength somehow. Luckily he didn\u2019t have to put it to the test.</p><p>\u201cI want everything you have to give, Larem.\u201d</p><p>She moved back and lay down, holding her arms out to him. He didn\u2019t need to be asked twice. Not that he was going to rush things. These moments, above all else, were meant to be savored.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s breath came in shallow pants as Larem insisted on taking his sweet time making love to her. Her skin flushed hot and cold as he turned his intense attention to this spot and that. Finally, when he had her whimpering with need, he made his move.</p><p>His long hair had come loose, flowing in a dark wave down past his shoulders. She loved the silky feel of it brushing against her skin. He positioned himself over her, spreading her legs wide as they prepared to join their bodies at long last. She smiled and reached between them to guide him home.</p><p>He pressed forward, slowly, his eyes staring into hers with burning desire. When his cock was seated deep within her body, they both let out the breath they\u2019d been holding, startling a small laugh from Larem. That pleased her, sensing that he rarely found much to laugh about in his new life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rocked her hips upward just as he withdrew, only to thrust forward again. He rewarded her efforts with more of the same, picking up speed and strength with each surge, until she no longer knew anything except the slide of his skin against hers, his body in hers. Trying to anchor herself in the swirling vortex of pleasure, she dug her fingers into his hips and held on, loving the flex and play of his muscles.</p><p>Then she arched up off the bed, calling her lover\u2019s name as she reached the breaking point. In response, Larem growled something in his native language as their bodies crashed together in a final explosion of pulsing heat.</p><p>She cried out at the beauty of it all as Larem buried his face against her neck. Then abruptly, he withdrew from more than just her body.</p><p>As he disappeared into the bathroom, she had to wonder if the chill in the air had anything at all to do with the air-conditioning.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>Duke sipped his third cup of coffee, needing the jolt of caffeine to stay awake. He\u2019d been parked outside of Sasha Willis\u2019s hotel for over an hour now, and it looked as if he had a long night ahead of him.</p><p>He\u2019d received more orders by e-mail, asking him to keep a closer eye on what the new administrator was up to so he could report to the others at their meeting tomorrow. He glanced at his watch. Make that today, since it was now after midnight.</p><p>Earlier, he\u2019d followed her to a barbecue at Lacey Sebastian\u2019s place. Most of the local Paladins had shown up for the festivities along with their pet Others. No surprise there since one of the Sebastians\u2014Lacey\u2014was shacked up with one of those freaks.</p><p>The Willis woman had taken a cab to the party, so he\u2019d expected her to call another one to take her back to the hotel. Instead, she\u2019d walked out with Lonzo Jones and his Other roommate, Larem. Yeah, that crazy Kalith had even lifted her up into the truck cab. She hadn\u2019t looked happy about having him touch her\u2014it spoke well of her.</p> <p>Afterward, Duke had hung back to make sure there wasn\u2019t any more to it than the two guys saving her cab fare. But that wasn\u2019t how it played out. Once they reached the hotel, Larem had once again put his hands around her waist and set her back down on the pavement. This time she\u2019d smiled and leaned on his shoulders, where they\u2019d lingered a little too long.</p><p>Lonzo had taken off right after that, leaving the two of them standing outside the hotel. Rather than see Sasha heading inside, though, Larem had tugged her around the corner into a pool of shadows. Duke had actually spilled part of his coffee in his lap out of shock at what happened next.</p><p>Sasha had not only let the Other kiss her, but Duke wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she\u2019d let the Kalith fuck her right there up against the wall. How sick was that? He used his cell phone to snap a couple of pictures to forward to his contact.</p><p>How could yet another human woman allow herself to be used by one of those crazies? She had to know what he was. Furious, he\u2019d driven by and taken a potshot at Larem with his paint gun, the only weapon he\u2019d had with him. He\u2019d aimed at the back of Larem\u2019s head, but he\u2019d been off by a couple of inches. Still, it was fun watching the lovebirds go diving for the ground.</p><p>Knowing the Kalith\u2019s uncanny night vision, Duke had taken off right after to avoid being recognized. He\u2019d driven to the rear of the hotel to park and then slipped into a back corner of the lobby just in time to see Sasha and Larem duck into an elevator.</p><p>After hanging around for fifteen minutes with no sign of Larem, Duke had bought a cup of coffee and headed back out into the night. He\u2019d circled the block until a parking spot opened up that would give him an unobstructed view of the hotel\u2019s front entrance. Sure, Larem could go slinking out the back, but that would be the wrong direction if he was heading home.</p> <p>Duke\u2019s orders had been to watch, and that was what he was doing. Once he knew how long Larem spent in Sasha\u2019s room, he\u2019d go home and report in tomorrow. Although he had little info about the group that had contacted him, he knew enough to know that they\u2019d be outraged by this development. He set his coffee aside and picked up his paint gun, staring down the sights at the bright light pouring out of the hotel entrance.</p><p>Too bad it wasn\u2019t a real gun instead of a wannabe weapon. He imagined the satisfaction of watching a bullet hitting the center of Larem\u2019s chest, exploding in a spray of red blood instead of blue paint. Yeah, that would feel damn good. Maybe next time.</p><p>Then, as if his imagination had conjured up the alien, Larem walked out of the hotel, stopping long enough to zip his jacket before shoving his hands in his pockets and walking off into the darkness. It was damn well about time the freak left. Duke checked his watch. The bastard had been inside for close to two hours. Plenty of time to get it on with the Willis woman.</p><p>Duke turned the key in the ignition. If he hurried, he\u2019d have enough time to get a few hours\u2019 sleep before heading to Whidbey Island in the morning. Maybe he\u2019d come home from the meeting with a new set of orders to follow, ones that involved settling the problem of the Kalith permanently.</p><p>Larem skirted the dim light of the sidewalk, preferring to keep to the shadows. It definitely fit his mood better than the warm glow cast by the streetlights overhead. He could\u2019ve flagged down a cab, but he figured he stood a better chance of outdistancing the demons nipping at his heels if he walked home.</p><p>What kind of fool leaves the warmth of a willing woman\u2019s bed to hike his ass home through the damp mist of a Seattle night? His kind, evidently. Even now, it was all he could do not to go back and beg Sasha to forgive him for taking off as soon as . . .</p><p>As what? As soon as he\u2019d poured everything he had, everything he was, into her? He\u2019d planned to show her how good it could be between them and ended up learning something far more important about himself: he was a fool. And not just an ordinary fool. No, he was the kind who managed to destroy his own honor and hurt the woman he cared about, all at the same time.</p><p>He\u2019d promised himself to make it so good for Sasha that she\u2019d never forget him. Fine. He\u2019d accomplished that, because the sex had certainly been spectacular. What he hadn\u2019t counted on was the emotional connection that had been forged between them.</p> <p>From the instant they got skin-to-skin, he\u2019d been able to sense what pleased her and then what pleased her even more. How she liked to be touched and tasted, how hard and fast she liked to be taken, and how she\u2019d clung to him as they\u2019d both found sweet release.</p><p>But he\u2019d also known how much she\u2019d hurt when he\u2019d turned away from her, unable to face what he\u2019d done. Oh, she\u2019d hidden it well, agreeing that it was best he leave so they could both get some rest. She had reports to write, and Larem needed to prepare for that big match Devlin had scheduled on Monday against those young Paladins. Besides, Lonzo might return home and worry about where his roommate was.</p><p>Yet none of their reasons would stand up to the light of day, because they were nothing but cowardly excuses. Larem held his face up to the falling mist. What other lies could he tell himself? How this night hadn\u2019t mattered when they both knew it had?</p><p>The worst part was that the farther away he got from Sasha, the more he wanted to turn around and go slinking back to her door. He had few illusions that she\u2019d let him in, but the least he could do was apologize.</p><p>A vehicle drove past him, going slow despite the lack of traffic. For the first time since leaving the hotel, Larem took notice of his surroundings. Had that car driven by before? He hadn\u2019t really been paying attention, but something about it was familiar. Of course, he wasn\u2019t particularly knowledgeable about such things. Trucks were easy. Cars, too. But the one that had disappeared around the corner ahead was somewhere in between. What were they called? Letters, not a name. \u201cS\u201d something.</p><p>He kept walking and waited for the right description to come to mind. Oh, yes, an SUV. Black and shiny. If it went by again, he\u2019d memorize the license plate number. Either D.J. or Cullen could use those mysterious computer skills of theirs to find the owner. If someone was paying too much attention to Larem\u2019s movements, he needed to know who it was.</p><p>Rather than take the direct route to the apartment, he backtracked a block, circled up the hill, and went back down a couple of streets over. If the SUV passed him again, he could be pretty certain the driver was taking more than a casual interest in Larem\u2019s business.</p><p>He was about to give up and go on home when sure enough, the car rolled into view. He must have done something to alert the driver to his interest because the SUV stopped abruptly. After a second, the driver turned in to an alley. Larem took off running, hoping to get a look at the license plate, but the driver gunned the engine and drove out of sight before Larem got close enough.</p><p>Great. First that paintball shot and now this. What was going on? He\u2019d talk to Lonzo about it first chance he got. Alone now, he took the most direct route to the apartment, glad to get out of the danger that lurked on the dark Seattle streets.</p><p>The ferry ride across to Whidbey Island did little to calm Duke\u2019s nerves. He was too busy second-guessing his decision to attend the secret meeting at the state park to relax. God, what had he gotten himself into?</p><p>He still didn\u2019t know if he was going to be greeted by kindred spirits who were sick of how things were going or if he\u2019d be facing the business end of a Paladin\u2019s sword. Up until last night he\u2019d been on the fence about whether to make the long trek to the park or skip it altogether.</p><p>Then he\u2019d seen what he\u2019d seen. How could Sasha Willis have hooked up with an Other? The very idea made Duke sick, not to mention seriously pissed. Maybe he\u2019d feel differently if she was unaware of what Larem was, but she knew full well what she\u2019d invited into her bed.</p><p>His fury had carried him through the night and all the way onto the ferry. But once the boat left the dock, near panic set in. Halfway between the mainland and the island, he was safe from the repercussions of his decision. But once he drove off the ferry, there would be no turning back. Hell, there could even be someone watching him now. That idea had his head swiveling like a weather vane in high winds. As far as he could tell, no one was paying any overt attention to him, but it wasn\u2019t much comfort.</p><p>The captain blew the horn, warning the passengers it was time to return to their cars on the lower deck. He\u2019d come this far; he\u2019d go the rest of the way.</p><p>Duke followed the signs to the park, slowing at the entrance to decide which way to go. Finally, he chose a parking spot at random, picked up the newspaper he\u2019d been instructed to bring, and started toward a cluster of picnic tables. Maybe the guy wouldn\u2019t show at all, and Duke could relax in the sun for a while before heading back.</p><p>No such luck, though. As soon as he perched on a table a familiar figure appeared at the edge of the woods. It was that Rusty guy he\u2019d met at the bar. Somehow he wasn\u2019t surprised, but Duke stayed seated, letting the man come to him.</p><p>Rusty hovered a few feet away. \u201cGlad you made it. You came alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, as requested.\u201d He aimed for casual but wasn\u2019t sure he succeeded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Rusty cocked his head to one side and stared at him. \u201cI have to tell you, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did.\u201d Duke glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019s everybody else?\u201d</p><p>The other man finally joined him at the table. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s just us. The fewer people you know are involved, the fewer you can betray.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that had Duke seeing red. \u201cListen, asshole, I didn\u2019t come all the way here to be insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works both ways, Duke. Those who don\u2019t know you\u2019re involved can\u2019t offer up your name to buy a little forgiveness if they get caught either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True enough. Maybe he\u2019d listen some more. \u201cSo why am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re as sick as I am of seeing the organization going to hell. We both know Kincade was on our side. Yeah, he had his faults, but he always gave the guards a square deal. Now he\u2019s in custody and the Paladins and their pets are acting like they own the whole fucking place.\u201d</p><p>Fairness had Duke saying, \u201cThey do most of the fighting.\u201d</p><p>Rusty sneered. \u201cYeah, but what else are they good for? If they didn\u2019t get to kill all the Others they want, who else would they be killing\u2014us? You know they\u2019re all hardwired to swing those swords.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you don\u2019t already do. Keep an eye on things. When you see something that shouldn\u2019t be happening, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Rusty stared up at one of the towering firs that surrounded them. \u201cI was sent here by one of the higher-ups who is concerned about the dark turn this sector has taken. If we can build a case against the Paladins, maybe we can force the Board of Regents to clean house and assign a new Regent, one who will get things back on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already sent Sasha Willis to do that job.\u201d</p><p>Duke threw that out to see how Rusty would react. Did anyone else know about her association with Larem?</p> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be here long. Her daddy won\u2019t let her stay. The last thing a Regent would risk is having his daughter take up with a Paladin.\u201d</p><p>Duke sneered. \u201cYou mean like the judge\u2019s daughter shacking up with Trahern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Rusty cleared his throat and spat. \u201cHow she can stand living with that crazy bastard I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>Duke gazed at the clouds scuttling across the bright blue sky, wishing he knew for sure if he could trust Rusty. It would be different if he knew who was really pulling the strings, but he understood the need for secrecy.</p><p>His companion stood up. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t hang out here too long. So unless you\u2019ve got something to report right now, I\u2019m out of here. Wait fifteen minutes and then leave, too. I\u2019ll keep in touch. You do the same.\u201d</p><p>Duke almost let him leave, but in the end the rage he\u2019d been fighting since the night before forced its way out.</p> <p>\u201cBefore you go, there is this one thing, Rusty.\u201d</p><p>Monday afternoon, Sasha had no legitimate reason to be lurking in the hallway outside the gym where the Paladins honed their already lethal skills with bladed weapons of all kinds. She\u2019d never had a chance to see any of them in action. Well, not before the other day in the tunnels, but that memory was blessedly a blur to her now.</p><p>The gym was two stories high, with open windows at the back that allowed spectators to watch from above. At the moment, she had the hall to herself. Every so often, she peeked in to see if anyone had arrived. Okay, so not just anyone\u2014Larem. She was still a mass of unresolved confusion over what they\u2019d done Saturday night.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d fed her a good line about why he needed to leave. One minute they\u2019d been in perfect accord and the next he was running for the hills. It couldn\u2019t have been something she\u2019d said, because he\u2019d never even given her a chance to speak.</p><p>The jerk. She had spent most of yesterday working up a good case for being mad at him. That anger was definitely part of what she was feeling right now, but that wasn\u2019t why she was hanging around. No, the blame for that could be laid right at the feet of an overwhelming curiosity about what was going to go down once all the players arrived.</p><p>Devlin had clearly sided with Larem in that near dustup between him and those young Paladins. Even Trahern had waded in on Larem\u2019s side. If she hadn\u2019t missed her guess, the older Paladins were really looking forward to watching those youngsters face off against a highly trained Kalith warrior. She\u2019d seen Larem in action and actually pitied them if he decided to unleash on them.</p><p>The sound of voices drifted up from the floor below. She edged closer to the opening and looked down. Paladins were pouring in from all directions. Most headed toward the row of benches that lined the walls, shoving their equipment bags underneath and out of the way.</p><p>She recognized Craig and his two buddies standing over in the corner whispering among themselves and watching the door with understandable trepidation. Their big mouths had gotten them into trouble. It remained to be seen how much they learned from the experience.</p> <p>A sudden hush fell over the gym as Devlin walked in with Trahern at his side. Barak q\u2019Young was right behind them, along with Hunter Fitzsimon, Lonzo, Cullen, D.J., and Penn. Obviously, Larem\u2019s supporters were out in number.</p><p>Her heart did an odd little leap when the man himself appeared. His dark hair was down, and he wore what had to be traditional Kalith clothing: close-fitting black pants and tunic with soft boots. She ignored the little surge of heat that flooded her veins at the sight.</p><p>Larem paused in the doorway to take a long, slow look around, then his eyes suddenly turned upward in her direction. She\u2019d thought she was tucked far enough out of sight that no one would notice her, but she\u2019d obviously been mistaken. Larem stared right at her.</p><p>She froze, unsure whether to wave or to take off running. She settled for holding her ground. Finally, he tore his gaze from hers and focused on the men grouped around the gym. It didn\u2019t surprise her that the reaction to his presence was mixed outside his immediate circle of friends. Of course, with Devlin and Trahern on his side, the rest of the Paladin contingent couldn\u2019t say much.</p><p>Larem stripped off his shirt, tossed it on the bench, and then did a series of stretches. God, she had it bad. All she could do was think about how amazing those supple muscles and that sleek skin had felt as he\u2019d surged over her, in her. She\u2019d like to think he was showing off a bit because she was watching, but for all she knew, this was his normal warm-up routine.</p><p>Finally Devlin stuck two fingers between his lips and let loose a shrill whistle. Silence settled over the room. He looked around, nodding at a few of the men as he did.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got a little something extra planned for today\u2019s practice. Larem q\u2019Jones is here to give some special training to Craig and company.\u201d</p><p>Devlin took a minute to look around again. \u201cIt seems every so often I have to remind some of you that the Kalith warriors who live among us do so because they\u2019ve earned that right with their courage, their loyalty, and their blood. I will not tolerate anyone treating them with anything less than the respect they deserve.\u201d</p><p>Trahern and the rest of Larem\u2019s friends spread out around the room, their stances relaxed. But even from up above she could tell there was nothing relaxed about the way they watched the others in the gym.</p><p>When Larem was ready, he picked up his sword. Was it the same one he\u2019d carried in the tunnels the other day? The shape was similar, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. There was no way to miss how comfortable he looked with the weapon in his hand, as if it were an extension of his arm.</p><p>When he walked to the center of the floor, Barak came with him, his own sword in hand. The two Kalith warriors faced each other, smiling briefly before putting on their game faces.</p><p>Devlin spoke up again. \u201cBarak and Larem have agreed to give us a demonstration of the Kalith style of fighting before they work with a few chosen Paladins.\u201d</p><p>He shot a dark look to the corner where Craig and his friends looked a bit sick. Devlin obviously took pleasure in their discomfort. In some ways, she felt bad for the kids and wondered at Devlin\u2019s reasons for insisting on humiliating them in front of their peers. Obviously he had a point to make.</p><p>At some invisible signal, Barak and Larem charged at each other, shouting their challenge in their native language. When their swords clashed together, she grabbed the edge of the windowsill and held on for dear life. Their blades were a blur of motion, the two swordsmen moving with terrifying grace.</p><p>As the bout continued, the Paladins gradually gathered closer, no doubt as entranced by the amazing display as Sasha was herself. How could the human body move that way? Of course, they weren\u2019t really human, but any differences were negligible. She had firsthand knowledge on the subject.</p><p>Gradually, the two men slowed down and then separated. With another nod and wider smiles, the bout was over. Applause broke out as Devlin tossed Barak a towel. Lonzo held one out to Larem along with a bottle of water. He took a long drink before handing it back. A quick swipe with the towel and then he headed back out onto the gym floor.</p><p>This time Hunter joined him, sword in hand. Once again, the two men saluted each other before the weapons came up and the action started. Their styles were markedly different but equally lethal. Hunter favored one leg as the match wore on, but he didn\u2019t back off at all. When he lunged forward at the wrong time, though, Larem hooked the Paladin\u2019s sword and yanked it out of his hand, sending the blade clattering across the gym floor.</p><p>Hunter froze, staring down at the curve of Larem\u2019s sword poised just shy of his carotid artery. His smile was slow in coming but no less genuine for the delay.</p><p>He backed away, laughing and shaking his head. \u201cDamn it, man, that\u2019s the third time I\u2019ve fallen for that maneuver.\u201d</p><p>Larem switched his sword to his left hand and held his right out to Hunter. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep working on it until you learn to block it.\u201d</p><p>The two men shook hands, and Hunter clapped Larem on the shoulder before retiring from the floor. \u201cI keep telling myself one of these days I\u2019ll actually win one against you, but thanks for not embarrassing me completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Larem stayed where he was. He ran a finger along the edge of his sword, perhaps checking it for damage. As he lowered it back to his side, he looked to where Craig stood watching, holding his own sword in a tight-fisted grip. Larem motioned for the young Paladin to come forward.</p><p>Sasha could feel the tension ramping up in the gym as the two men faced each other. The situation had the potential for turning ugly fast. She crossed her fingers and hoped for the best.</p><p>Larem studied his new opponent. They were about the same height, but Craig carried more muscle than he did. Without having seen the young Paladin in action, he figured his fighting style would be similar to Trahern\u2019s\u2014more strength than finesse\u2014although he could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>There was a certain determined grimness in Craig\u2019s expression as he nodded and brought his sword up into fighting position. Larem had to give the kid credit for facing him without flinching.</p><p>With a quick flick of his blade, Larem signaled that the dance was on. Within seconds he was impressed. Craig\u2019s technique was rough around the edges, but he definitely had the potential to be one of the best. He\u2019d never be fast enough to master the style that Barak and Larem used, but that didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t be just as lethal.</p><p>Larem flashed back to when he used to train recruits back in his own world, loving the challenge of tailoring the lessons to best suit each individual. Craig was a quick learner, countering when Larem deliberately left him an opening. The second time, though, Larem hooked the kid\u2019s sword and came close to striking it out of his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He danced back out of the way and held his hand up to signal a stop. Craig retreated, his attitude clearly suspicious when Larem moved to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get yourself killed if you make that mistake in battle. Watch me.\u201d Then he went through the correct maneuver in slow motion, repeating it several times.</p><p>\u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>Craig mimicked his technique, flinching only slightly when Larem took hold of the kid\u2019s thick wrist and corrected the angle just a bit. \u201cGood. Go through that several times slowly so that you do it right. Rushing only reinforces bad habits.\u201d</p> <p>At least the kid listened. After a few more repetitions, Larem faced off against him again. \u201cOkay, bring it on.\u201d</p><p>This time the young Paladin grinned, clearly loving the challenge. They both went at it full tilt, laughing when one or the other managed to score. Larem finally called a halt when he could tell the younger man was tiring. There was no use in risking injury to either of them by continuing.</p><p>Maybe next time their paths crossed, the encounter would be a peaceful one. To his surprise, Craig held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my behavior the other night, sir. I\u2019d heard that you and Barak were handy with a sword, but you\u2019re flat-out amazing. I appreciate the lesson.\u201d</p><p>Larem accepted the peace offering. \u201cAnytime. And I mean that. You have great potential. If you and your friends would like me to work with you, don\u2019t hesitate to call me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will, sir.\u201d Craig looked past Larem. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better go let Devlin pound on me some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo easy on him, Craig. No use embarrassing him in front of everybody.\u201d</p><p>Larem was fully aware that Devlin and Trahern had walked up behind him. His new friend tried unsuccessfully to hide a grin, a mistake he\u2019d no doubt pay for with a few bruises. Luckily, his Paladin DNA meant he\u2019d heal quickly.</p><p>Devlin gave them both a narrow-eyed look. \u201cCraig, go guzzle some water and collect your buddy. I\u2019ll be ready for you in a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>Craig gave Devlin a sloppy salute. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>But before walking away, he turned back to Larem. \u201cIf you meant what you said, I will be calling you.\u201d</p> <p>Larem nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>When he was gone, Devlin smiled at Larem. \u201cThat was well played. Looks like you\u2019ve gained a friend\u2014and a student. You down with that?\u201d</p><p>Devlin was well aware of Larem\u2019s conflicted feelings on the subject of helping the Paladins in a way that would be used against his own people. However, this was his world now, and he needed to feel useful.</p><p>\u201cYes, oddly enough, I am. Especially because with a little help, in a couple of months he\u2019ll rival you and Trahern on your best day.\u201d He wiped down his sword, checking for any nicks to be smoothed out.</p><p>Trahern looked skeptical and a little insulted. \u201cCare to put some money on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Say ten dollars? In two months, he\u2019ll face one of you in a match and win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA measly ten bucks?\u201d Trahern snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You don\u2019t think he can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, make it a hundred.\u201d A bet Larem was sure he was going to win. \u201cUnless you\u2019re afraid Brenna will kick your ass when you lose the grocery money.\u201d</p> <p>Trahern didn\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cA hundred it is. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to show these kids how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>And he would, too, Larem had no doubt. The man was a legend among the Paladins as a killing machine with his broadsword. He tried not to think about what that meant for those Kalith who sought the light of this world, out of their heads with sickness and screaming for blood.</p><p>It was what it was.</p><p>Larem toweled off some of the sweat before putting his shirt back on. The whole time he forced himself to keep his eyes focused on his immediate surroundings instead of straying back up to Sasha. What was she doing there? Watching, obviously, but the real question was why? Was she worried or merely curious?</p><p>After putting his sword back in its scabbard, he sought out Hunter in the crowd. He spotted his friend standing off to one side with Penn and Lonzo, watching Trahern and Devlin square off against Craig and several others. Larem paused long enough to study the trainees, assessing both their strengths and weaknesses. Not bad, not bad at all. Working with them would be satisfying.</p><p>He walked up to Hunter. \u201cYou want to come to our place and chill for a while? Maybe get some carryout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve got time to kill while Tate hits the mall with Brenna and Laurel. I\u2019ll get my things. And, by the way, you\u2019re buying after making me look bad in front of my peeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Larem agreed. \u201cBut how is it my fault that you left yourself wide open to attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point, but give me a minute and I\u2019ll figure out some way to blame you.\u201d Hunter headed back over to the bench to pick up his workout bag.</p><p>While he waited, Larem at last gave in to the need to see Sasha again, even if only from a distance. As soon as he looked up, she stepped back from the window, her attention now focused on something\u2014or someone\u2014on her own level. Why had her expression abruptly changed from curious to puzzled, even worried?</p><p>He checked the other windows along the balcony to see what had caught her attention, but all he could see were a couple of shadowy figures at the far end. They were standing at the wrong angle for him to see them clearly. But then it didn\u2019t matter who they were, not if they were bothering Sasha.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Larem?\u201d Lonzo followed his line of sight. \u201cWho is that up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha\u2019s standing by the far right window, but I can\u2019t see who\u2019s on the other end. But whoever it is, Sasha\u2019s not looking happy about it.\u201d He drew his sword again. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo blocked his way briefly. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, Larem. I\u2019ll snag Hunter and we\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d hesitate one second to skewer anyone who threatened Sasha. Lonzo and Hunter could provide backup if he needed it, but guarding that woman\u2014his woman\u2014was his job.</p><p>He rounded the corner and ran past the first staircase to the second one even though it cost him a few extra seconds. This route would bring him up on Sasha\u2019s end of the hall rather than risking her being trapped on the far side of a potential enemy.</p><p>The soft soles of his Kalith boots made only the slightest noise as he took the steps two at a time. He slowed his pace as he neared the top, not wanting to frighten Sasha by charging in, sword drawn. The stairs brought him up to the second floor just around the corner from where he could hear Sasha\u2019s voice along with the deeper ones of three human males. He didn\u2019t recognize the first two, but the third one was that bastard Duke.</p><p>Larem brought his sword down to his side and slightly behind him in case he\u2019d totally misread the situation. He paused for a few seconds, hoping to determine what was going on. Clearly Sasha\u2019s temper was running high, but he had no way of knowing why.</p><p>He listened for footsteps coming up behind him. Lonzo appeared at the top of the steps armed with an automatic along with his sword. Hunter must have decided to come up the other staircase, flanking the enemy. Not for the first time, Larem thanked the gods for the privilege of having such fine warriors ready to fight beside him.</p><p>\u201cGuards,\u201d he whispered and held up three fingers.</p><p>Maybe he should let Lonzo take the lead as they rounded the corner, figuring the guards would be less likely to immediately go on the offensive against him. But when he motioned for Lonzo to go first, the Paladin shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your party.\u201d</p><p>All right, then. He started forward with his friend only a few steps behind. Sure enough, two of the guards had Sasha cornered, her back against the wall.</p><p>When she tried to shove Duke away, he caught her hands and pinned them over her head. He leaned in closer. \u201cNo need to get violent, Sasha. We just want a few of the fringe benefits you\u2019ve been offering the Paladins\u2014or at least their pets. Surely our needs should come before that alien scum.\u201d</p><p>Before Larem could rush to her rescue, Sasha jerked her leg up and kneed the bastard. Duke howled in pain and raised his hand to retaliate. The guard standing watch caught Duke\u2019s hand on the downward swing and signaled to his friends they were no longer alone. The three men immediately turned in Larem\u2019s direction. Their facial expressions changed from smirks to frowns, then looks of fury, but at least they put some distance between themselves and Sasha.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Larem demanded, aiming the question at Sasha. It was Duke who answered.</p><p>\u201cWe were just discussing some special requests we guards have for the new administrator.\u201d His laugh was ugly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing from the way she handed you your balls on a platter that the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say we tabled the discussion.\u201d The guard puffed out his chest and spat on the floor. \u201cBy the way, that was some freak show you put on down there, Other. It\u2019s a shame your buddy Hunter is too crippled to kill you while he had the chance.\u201d</p><p>Before Larem could respond, Sasha stepped right between him and the trio of assholes. \u201cThat does it! You\u2019ve attacked me and insulted my friends. You three are suspended without pay pending an official hearing.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so much for keeping the situation from escalating out of control. Sasha wouldn\u2019t cower, but he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d at least use some common sense and stay out of the way. Now wasn\u2019t the time to tell these three that she\u2019d back Larem over them, even if it did warm that spot in his chest that had grown cold since he\u2019d left her bed.</p><p>While she was talking, Hunter appeared behind them. He\u2019d obviously heard Duke\u2019s comment about his injured leg. Knowing the Paladin, there would be hell to pay for that crack. The guard would be lucky if Hunter didn\u2019t carve him up and leave him standing there holding his guts in with his hands.</p><p>The irate Paladin stopped just short of where the guards stood. \u201cGee, Duke, I\u2019m sorry you were so disappointed in my performance. Why don\u2019t we head back down to the gym right now so you can see if you do better against Larem than I did? Or maybe you\u2019d rather face me?\u201d</p><p>Duke\u2019s face went pale. He was in a no-win situation. If he refused the challenge, he\u2019d look like a coward. If he accepted the challenge, he\u2019d bleed. Duke knew it, his friends knew it, and so did Larem and the Paladins.</p><p>As entertaining as it was to watch the fool squirm, Larem\u2019s priority was to get Sasha out of the line of fire. When she started to speak again, he caught her hand in his and squeezed, hoping she\u2019d take the hint. She did, but she clearly didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, gentlemen,\u201d Larem said, keeping his tone reasonable. \u201cIf you apologize to the lady now you can at least walk away in one piece.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they didn\u2019t immediately respond, he gave them one last chance. \u201cThe clock is ticking. In ten more seconds, either you\u2019re on your way home or we\u2019ll teach you some manners. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Duke made his decision. \u201cFuck you, Other. I\u2019m not apologizing to any bitch stupid enough to spread her legs for the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Sasha flinched as if the bastard had actually slapped her. She shot a look at Larem, a hurt question in her glance. Was she asking how the guard had found out or if Larem had been the one who\u2019d talked?</p> <p>All things considered, he didn\u2019t blame her for wondering; but damn, she should at least know him better than that. He pushed the pain deep down inside to deal with later. He had far more pressing matters at the moment.</p><p>Starting with the fact that Duke was dead. The guard might not realize it yet, but he was already drawing his last few breaths. In the next few seconds, he would be nothing but a bloodstain soaking into cheap carpet. His two friends, too, if they got in the way.</p><p>Larem grabbed Sasha by the arm and shoved her back toward Lonzo. \u201cGet her out of here. She doesn\u2019t need to see this,\u201d he ordered, knowing he could depend on his roommate to make sure she was safe.</p><p>Hunter already had his gun aimed at the guard closest to him. His leg might not be back to full strength, but that wouldn\u2019t interfere with his aim. Two shots would eliminate any problems Duke\u2019s buddies might cause.</p><p>\u201cLarem, here. You\u2019ll need this.\u201d</p> <p>Lonzo had the good sense to wait until Larem nodded before sliding his sword pommel first across the floor. Larem knelt down to pick it up while keeping an eye on the guards. He risked a quick peek back to see how Lonzo managed the maneuver without letting go of Sasha: the Paladin held her back with one arm around her waist.</p><p>When she spotted him looking at her, she renewed her struggles to break free. \u201cLonzo, let go of me! What are you three up to now? I won\u2019t have it, whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha, go with Lonzo, please.\u201d</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to be holding her, soothing her, apologizing for her name being linked with his. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll let you rip into me all you want later, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Duke obviously wasn\u2019t done shooting off his mouth. \u201cJust wait until your father finds out what\u2019s going on. Do you think he and the other Regents will be happy when they find out what you\u2019ve done? Hell, most of them know the Paladins are barely a step up from those animals themselves. I\u2019ve always thought our job description should be zookeepers instead of guards.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely time to end this. \u201cLonzo, get her the hell out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Larem waited until his friend dragged Sasha around the corner and out of sight. Despite the difference in her size and Lonzo\u2019s, she was putting up a good fight. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, his friend would have a nice collection of bruises on his shins from where she\u2019d tried to kick herself free. His woman had a strong warrior\u2019s spirit.</p><p>When the sounds faded, he picked up Lonzo\u2019s sword and held it out to Duke pommel first. The human looked around in growing panic, evidently only now realizing the trouble he\u2019d stirred up may have turned lethal.</p><p>He stared at the blade Larem held out as if it were a snake. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so when I explain your death to Devlin Bane, I can tell him that I gave you a chance to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>When Duke made no effort to accept the weapon, Larem knelt down and slid it across the floor anyway. A human stood little chance against a Kalith warrior at the best of times, but they both knew Duke stood no chance at all if he didn\u2019t at least pick up the sword.</p><p>God, what had he gotten himself into? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill an unarmed man.\u201d</p><p>He could hear his two buddies backing away, clearly thinking he was wrong about that. Any second now they\u2019d break and run for cover. He didn\u2019t blame them. He\u2019d be leading the charge himself if he thought he had a chance of getting away. But even if his friends forgot that Larem still had another friend with him, the Paladin stood ready to remind them.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you two dumb fucks think you\u2019re going?\u201d Hunter Fitzsimon\u2019s words dripped with the brutal chill of death. \u201cYou started this, but we\u2019ll decide when it\u2019s finished.\u201d</p> <p>God, Duke never meant for this to go so far. Yeah, he resented the Kaliths strolling around like they owned the place, playing sword games with the Paladins and showing them up. That didn\u2019t mean he wanted to challenge a swordsman of Larem\u2019s caliber to a fight to the death.</p><p>He bent down to pick up the sword, hating the way the blade shook in his hand. Even more, he hated the cold amusement in the freak\u2019s pale eyes when he saw the shimmer of quivering steel.</p><p>\u201cI will convey your apologies to Ms. Willis.\u201d The Kalith bastard ran his finger along the curved edge of his sword. \u201cI know you regret what you said to her, but unfortunately you won\u2019t be in a position to tell her yourself.\u201d</p><p>Duke flexed his fingers on the sword, trying to adjust his grip on the unfamiliar pommel. He prayed for his life, prayed for forgiveness, and prayed for a quick and merciful death. As pissed off as Larem was right now, he would likely drag this out until Duke choked on his own blood and begged the freak bastard for release.</p><p>Larem switched his sword to his left hand. \u201cThere, Duke, to even things up I\u2019ll fight with my weaker hand.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s laughter rang out. \u201cOooh, nice touch, Larem. I like it.\u201d</p><p>Duke glanced back at his two friends. Oh, yeah, he was all alone in this. Even if they\u2019d been interested in offering him a helping hand, Fitzsimon stood ready to stop them dead in their tracks. Literally.</p><p>Okay, Duke could die fighting or he could just die. A weird sense of calm settled over him. \u201cYou\u2019ll bleed, too, Other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>In a flurry of sword strokes that took less time than it took Duke to blink twice, he\u2019d lost his weapon and found himself pressed up against the wall with the tip of Larem\u2019s sword staring him in the eye. The crazy fucker stood there smiling as if it were an everyday occurrence to gut someone for the hell of it.</p><p>\u201cDuke, it would appear we\u2019ve reached a crossroads in our relationship.\u201d Larem reached out to pat Duke on the cheek, smiling when he flinched.</p><p>\u201cHunter, why don\u2019t you let those two go? We wouldn\u2019t want their last memory of Duke here to be . . . tragic, would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist, although it will certainly spoil some of my fun.\u201d</p><p>Hunter motioned for them to pass. \u201cBut just so you know, I will catch up with both you boys later.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin\u2019s comment was accompanied by the sound of two pairs of feet pounding down the hall and fading away in the distance. Duke knew every step they took diminished his chances of survival. No matter how cold-blooded the Other and his buddy were, they\u2019d be less likely to slaughter him in front of witnesses.</p><p>Larem leaned in close enough for Duke to feel his breath. A vein pulsed heavily in Larem\u2019s neck, as if he were battling some damn strong emotions.</p><p>\u201cThere, now we can talk in private, Duke, starting with why you were watching me and Ms. Willis Saturday night. That was you who took a shot at us with the paint-ball gun, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Duke managed a quick nod. \u201cI was told to. Watch her, that is.\u201d</p><p>Larem\u2019s nostrils flared, as if scenting the air for a lie. \u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe e-mail was anonymous.\u201d That much was true. He wasn\u2019t about to drag Rusty\u2019s name into this.</p><p>Hunter moved into sight. \u201cAnd you do whatever stupid thing some unknown person tells you to do? God, I would\u2019ve thought even a guard would be smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he might be about to die, but that kind of crack was exactly what had Duke pissed off at the whole organization. He glared at the Paladin staring at him from behind Larem\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, Fitzsimon. Act all superior if you want to, but we\u2019re the ones who actually die when his kind decide it\u2019s time to party on our side of the barrier. We don\u2019t get second chances.\u201d</p><p>The sword point pressed closer, making it difficult for Duke to swallow without getting cut. How could he breathe, much less think, with that pale, ice-cold gaze on him? He closed his eyes and waited, frantically praying for deliverance.</p><p>When nothing happened, he pried one eye open to find Larem looking back at Hunter, his sword down at his side. What was going on?</p><p>\u201cCall Devlin and tell him we have a present for him.\u201d</p><p>When Hunter stepped away and pulled out his cell phone, Larem turned back to Duke. \u201cThis is your lucky day, Duke. You can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t get a second chance now, can you? The good news is that I don\u2019t kill cowards. The bad news is that you will be spending some quality time with Devlin Bane. You should know that he hates people sneaking around behind his back, and that\u2019s what you and your buddies have been doing. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Duke felt like one of those damn bobble-head dolls as he nodded. God, Devlin Bane was going to kick his ass from one end of Seattle to the other, but that was still better than facing Larem any longer.</p><p>\u201cEven more, he hates men who bully women, but not as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>Then with a move too fast to track, the sword was back at Duke\u2019s throat, this time cutting into his skin deep enough to hurt like hell. Warm blood trickled down Duke\u2019s neck; he ignored it, not wanting to provoke Larem any further.</p><p>\u201cAgain, you owe Ms. Willis an apology, but I\u2019ll tell her for you. Because, Duke, if you ever\u2014ever\u2014go near her again, I will finish what we\u2019ve started here today. You can pass the message along to your anonymous friend for me, too. Got that?\u201d</p><p>Duke bobble-headed it again. The last thing he saw was Larem\u2019s fist flying straight for his jaw. It connected before he could duck, and then all he knew was darkness and pain.</p><p>Larem stood over the pathetic lump of humanity, feeling just as disgusted with himself as he was with Duke. The world would be far better off without such scum in it, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to end the bastard\u2019s life. One reason was that Devlin would not be happy to learn there was some kind of conspiracy going on, only to find out that Larem had permanently silenced their only lead.</p><p>Another reason Duke still breathed was that Larem\u2019s own sense of honor didn\u2019t allow him to prey on the weak and helpless. And Duke certainly fit that description. Larem had to give the fool credit for at least picking up the sword and trying to defend himself.</p><p>But finally, Larem had spared Duke because of Sasha. She would not easily forgive him if he had avenged her honor by killing the obnoxious fool. Larem figured there was a fifty-fifty chance he\u2019d come to regret showing mercy, but he\u2019d deal with that when the time came.</p><p>Hunter hovered nearby. \u201cYou did the right thing, but I would\u2019ve backed your play either way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gods had truly blessed Larem by guiding his footsteps to cross paths with the Paladin. Hunter and Lonzo had both offered him unconditional friendship, a gift he cherished.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling down at Duke\u2019s side, he held his hand out over the cut that was still bleeding, although more sluggishly than before. Closing his eyes, he shut out the world and withdrew into the center of his mind and softly chanted the words of healing. The power surged as the magic chose to do its work on the first try.</p><p>Finally, the last few words faded into the silence as Larem stood back up. His friend reached out to steady him, well aware that the magic took its toll, especially when Larem was already tired to begin with.</p> <p>He immediately sensed they were no longer alone. Lonzo had returned with reinforcements.</p><p>\u201cDevlin.\u201d</p><p>A faint hint of a familiar perfume told him that Devlin hadn\u2019t come alone. \u201cSasha.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he turned to face the pair. \u201cHe\u2019s all yours, Devlin. Hunter can fill you in on the details.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin leader studied the body slumped against the wall. \u201cHell, from what Lonzo told me, I expected to be burying the bastard.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter and Lonzo laughed, but Sasha didn\u2019t look at all amused. In fact, she looked ready to explode. She stepped past Larem as if he weren\u2019t even there to stand over Duke\u2019s body.</p><p>When she spotted the blood, her face turned ashen. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Larem, what did you do? Someone call for a medical team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelay that order.\u201d Devlin squatted down to check Duke\u2019s injuries. \u201cHe\u2019s not badly hurt. Nothing an ice pack and a couple of aspirin won\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><p>After using the hem of the man\u2019s own shirt to wipe away some of the blood, Devlin shot Larem a questioning look. He shrugged, not wanting to discuss his reasons for undoing some of the damage he\u2019d caused the guard.</p><p>\u201cLonzo, you and Hunter drag Duke downstairs to first aid. Laurel can check him over when she gets here.\u201d</p><p>The two warriors strong-armed Duke up off the floor and wrapped his arms across their broad shoulders. They half-carried, half-dragged the unconscious guard down the hall and out of sight. They weren\u2019t being particularly careful with how they handled him, an unspoken show of support for Larem that he appreciated. When they were gone, Larem picked up Lonzo\u2019s sword and waited for the storm to break. It didn\u2019t take long.</p> <p>Devlin spread his feet and crossed his arms over his chest. It seemed that they were about to get a demonstration of his famous hot temper. Fine, he could unleash his wrath on Larem if he wanted to, but he\u2019d better watch his mouth around Sasha.</p><p>\u201cOkay, which one of you two want to explain to me what the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s mouth was a straight slash as she threw back her shoulders, ready to do battle. Obviously she\u2019d thought she\u2019d be the one demanding answers rather than giving them.</p><p>\u201cYour questions can wait, Devlin. Right now, I want to hear what Larem thought he was accomplishing by attacking a guard. I had already told them they were suspended and, pending review, possibly fired.\u201d</p><p>This was definitely not the time to be laughing. However, it was pretty damn funny watching a mountain of a man face off against a wisp of a woman and come out on the losing end of a glaring contest.</p><p>Right now, Larem would put his money on Sasha, but it would be better for all concerned if he drew their attention back to himself. He addressed his remarks directly to Devlin, hoping it would help him suppress the powerful emotions threatening to resurface as he recalled the events that had led him to this point in time.</p><p>\u201cAfter I finished my bouts down below, I happened to look up and spotted Sasha watching from that window on the far end. When she turned to look at someone standing near her, I noticed her expression go from curious to worried, which led me to think that she was in danger.\u201d</p><p>She just had to contradict him. \u201cI was handling it. And I was angry, not scared. You overreacted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would dispute that, but if you say you were just angry, fine. Human emotions are not always clear to us poor aliens. Hunter and Lonzo accompanied me to offer their support if needed.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring how she flinched at the reminder of his heritage, he picked up where he\u2019d left off. \u201cThree of the guards had her cornered and were insulting her. Then Duke pushed her too far, and Sasha kneed the bastard. He shoved her against the wall and was preparing to hit her when we arrived.\u201d</p><p>Devlin was nodding. \u201cSounds like you handled this about right, although I\u2019m also guessing there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d</p><p>Larem reluctantly continued. If he went much further with the explanation, Devlin would figure out there was more to Larem and Sasha\u2019s relationship than either of them wanted him to know. All Larem could do was tread carefully.</p><p>\u201cDuke had been spying on Sasha for an anonymous party. Seems he\u2019s not happy with things around here.\u201d</p><p>It would be too much to ask that Devlin stop there. But no, the man was like one of those hounds Dr. Isaac had told Larem about, the kind that stuck to a trail no matter what.</p><p>\u201cAnd if Duke was spying on you, Sasha, care to share what he might have seen?\u201d</p><p>Then he shot a suspicious look in Larem\u2019s direction when he added, \u201cOr who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there, Devlin.\u201d Larem stepped between Sasha and the Paladin. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for you to know that Lonzo and I offered to give her a ride back after the barbecue Saturday night. When Lonzo got your call to report in, he dropped the two of us off outside her hotel. While we were standing on the sidewalk, Duke shot at us with a paint ball, although we didn\u2019t know it was him at the time. I\u2019m also sure that he followed me as I walked home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what time was that?\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s cheeks turned pink, answering Devlin\u2019s real question even as she tried to deflect it. \u201cHow is that pertinent? I\u2019d suggest you concentrate on finding out what Duke was up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll play it your way.\u201d Devlin poked his finger toward Larem. \u201cYou and I will talk later. For now, go home and lie low. I know where to find you if I need you.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked off, leaving Larem alone with Sasha, perhaps not the best of ideas. As tired as he was, the last thing he wanted right now was another confrontation, especially with her.</p><p>As soon as Devlin was out of sight, Sasha turned her attention to Larem. But before she could say a word, he held up a hand to forestall her.</p><p>\u201cSasha, can we not do this now? Hunter and Lonzo are waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>She was already shaking her head as she mimicked Devlin\u2019s earlier stance, arms crossed, feet firmly planted. \u201cTough. They can wait.\u201d</p><p>If she wanted to do this now, fine. He crossed to the window and yelled down, \u201cLonzo! Hunter! Go on without me. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d</p><p>Then he set down both swords and leaned his back against the wall, his arms crossed just like hers.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to talk about?\u201d he asked, careful not to laugh when she stomped her foot in frustration.</p><p>She flung her hands out to the sides. \u201cDarn it, Larem, don\u2019t be a fool. I know you better than that. What were you thinking, confronting three guards like that?\u201d</p><p>After seeing him fight, did she really think he couldn\u2019t handle three humans by himself? He pushed away from the wall and glared at her. \u201cI was never in any danger. On his best day, not one of those guards could outfight a Kalith warrior.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? But what if they\u2019d pulled a gun? No matter how fast you are with that sword, you can\u2019t outsmart a bullet.\u201d</p><p>That she was worried about his safety pleased him. \u201cSo then what\u2019s the problem? Those men were clearly out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough that they\u2019ll be suspended and maybe even fired, but you had to resort to violence. Don\u2019t you think that was a bit extreme?\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t. It was bad enough what they\u2019d said about Hunter, but Duke\u2019s behavior toward Sasha was unforgivable. \u201cDuke had to be punished for what he said about you, about us. I am a Blademate to a Sworn Guardian, Sasha. It is my life\u2019s purpose to protect those I care about. I would not be worthy of the title if I were to let scum like Duke insult the woman I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whoa, going too far with that. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t challenged him, Hunter or Lonzo would have. It was my duty and my honor to do so. Duke should count his blessings that he still breathes. And if you think Devlin or Trahern would\u2019ve handled the situation any differently had their females been involved, you don\u2019t know them very well.\u201d</p><p>Sasha was so out of her depth right now. This man had already killed once to protect her and almost did so again. How was she supposed to deal with something like that? Part of her wanted nothing to do with a man capable of such violence, but she also felt grateful. That he was equally capable of amazing tenderness and passion only served to confuse her even more.</p><p>She made the only choice that made sense. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. We\u2019ve already made that decision. If Duke hadn\u2019t stuck his nose in our business, we wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation, especially if you\u2019d stayed away from here in the first place. I don\u2019t remember anyone inviting you to join today\u2019s festivities.\u201d</p><p>Larem leaned in closer, crowding her physically now as well as emotionally. She could\u2019ve told him not to bother. After spending her whole life surrounded by dominant men, she\u2019d learned to stand her ground or be trampled in the process.</p><p>Drawing on all the authority she could muster, she let him have it. \u201cI\u2019m in charge around here, or hadn\u2019t you noticed? I have every right to observe anything that goes on, even if it\u2019s a bunch of boneheaded men playing games.\u201d</p><p>Larem laughed, but it had nothing to do with humor. \u201cYou may pay the bills, Sasha, but that\u2019s not the same as running the place. Devlin is the one whose word is law. Without his support, you would get nowhere with all the changes you seem so hot on making. And those games you refer to help ensure your Paladins have the necessary skills to survive.\u201d</p><p>His words slammed into her. \u201cThis conversation is going nowhere. You go hang out with your friends. I\u2019ll go do my job. It\u2019s been nice.\u201d She started to walk away but didn\u2019t get far.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you nice.\u201d</p><p>One powerful arm lifted her up off her feet while Larem\u2019s free hand drew her leg up around his waist. Somehow, her other one needed no encouragement from him to follow suit. Her skirt rode high around her thighs, leaving only the thin silk of her panties between her and Larem\u2019s trousers. The full contact with his body burned straight through her, making her all too aware of the emptiness inside her. An emptiness that only this man could fill.</p><p>She tangled her fingers in the black and silver silk of his hair and planted her mouth on his, demanding entry and offering no quarter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carried her to the corner that offered at least partial privacy from the windows that opened over the silent gym below. She applauded Larem\u2019s clear thinking, because at the moment all of her own thoughts were focused on getting as close to him as possible.</p><p>Her back bumped up against the wall, momentarily jarring her out of her passion-induced fog. What were they doing? What a stupid thing to ask when the answer was so obvious. The real questions were why they\u2019d ended up in each other\u2019s arms again and how far was she willing to let this go.</p><p>Larem felt her hesitation and his hand froze, hovering at the elastic band of her panties. Once again he was offering her a last chance of refusal. They both knew this had to stop. This shouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d she whispered, before she regained her sanity.</p> <p>He set her back down on her feet, fumbled with the buttons on his fly, and then tore off her panties. Then she was right back against that same wall, with nowhere left to go but on the wild ride of hunger that drove them both.</p><p>When he slid into her, it was one of the most perfect moments in her life. And when she walked away from him a few minutes later, it was one of the worst.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Three weeks passed, each day dragging by slower than the one before. After Larem\u2019s last talk with Devlin, he\u2019d avoided spending much time around headquarters. The leader was seriously pissed about Larem\u2019s involvement with Sasha in defiance of his previous order to stay away from her. Well, at least Devlin was finally getting what he wanted.</p><p>Duke\u2019s future with the organization was still up in the air. He was restricted to limited duty, and his activities were being closely monitored\u2014not to mention his e-mails and phone calls. From all reports, he was abiding by the rules, but Larem suspected he was just waiting for the uproar to die down before trying something again.</p> <p>Lonzo had promised to keep his ear to the ground for any rumors linking Sasha to Larem. So far, Duke and his two buddies were keeping their mouths shut on the subject. He was glad for her sake.</p><p>One good thing had come from that day, though. Craig had actually called, asking if Larem was still interested in giving him lessons. The young Paladin was on temporary assignment down near Mount St. Helens, but they were scheduled to start upon his return. Until then, Larem was back to trying to find some meaning in his life. Lonzo had gone on the same mission and was due back any day. While he\u2019d been gone, Larem had spent the long nights walking the streets of Seattle between sessions of studying Kalith healing.</p><p>The only bright spots were the hours he spent in the undemanding company of his four-legged friends at the animal clinic. He\u2019d had several successes healing both the physical and emotional wounds suffered by Dr. Isaac\u2019s patients, but he knew his greatest victory was Chance.</p><p>The big dog was now trusted to wander free around the clinic for hours at a time, returning to his pen only to sleep or when there was another dog in the clinic who might go on the attack. His enthusiastic greeting every time Larem walked in the door helped hold the loneliness at bay.</p><p>On this particular morning Larem knelt down on one knee in front of Chance and gave the dog a good ear scratch. \u201cReady for your walk, boy?\u201d</p><p>His happy whine and thumping tail were answer enough.</p> <p>\u201cSilly question, Larem. That dog has been watching the door for the past half hour.\u201d The vet looked at Chance over the top of his glasses. \u201cI hate to say it, but it\u2019s time we start looking for a home for him.\u201d</p><p>Larem\u2019s stomach plummeted. He\u2019d known the moment would come when Chance would move on and that it was a good thing. The big fellow deserved a whole lot of happiness in his life. That didn\u2019t mean it would be easy to let him go.</p><p>\u201cHave you had anyone interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne couple looked at him but then decided he was too big for their yard.\u201d Dr. Isaac reached over to pet Chance\u2019s head. \u201cI know you\u2019ll miss him, but some lucky person is going to offer him a home. We\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s an extra good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working toward.\u201d Which was true, but that didn\u2019t mean Larem was happy about it. \u201cCome on, boy, let\u2019s get going before the rain starts.\u201d</p><p>Outside, he let Chance choose their route. They\u2019d spent so much time exploring together that the dog knew the streets around the clinic as well as Larem did. He even seemed to sense that it was important to cruise by a certain coffee shop on each trip. Sometimes Larem stopped to buy a cup of tea or coffee; sometimes he didn\u2019t, but every time, the two males paused to look inside just in case Sasha happened to be there.</p><p>So far, they\u2019d had no luck, but that could change. Larem needed to know how she was doing. Their last encounter had left too many things unspoken between them. After they\u2019d found release in each other\u2019s arms, she\u2019d calmly walked away without looking back.</p><p>And fool that he was, he\u2019d let her go.</p> <p>In the days since, he\u2019d kept telling himself it had been the right thing to do, even with his soul screaming out that he was making the mistake of a lifetime. He\u2019d already let one possible mate slip away. But that hadn\u2019t hurt nearly as badly as watching Sasha disappear down the hall and out of his life.</p><p>Later that night, after Hunter left and Lonzo turned in for the night, Larem had stood out on the patio and stared up at the stars, recalling each sensation as he\u2019d taken Sasha up against that wall. Had he been too rough with her? He\u2019d wanted to leave his mark on her soul, not on her creamy, soft skin.</p><p>He\u2019d never experienced anything as sweet as the welcoming heat of her body when he\u2019d come deep inside her while Sasha\u2019s own climax washed over them both. It was then that he realized they\u2019d been so caught up in the moment that they hadn\u2019t used protection.</p><p>The thought hadn\u2019t been far from his mind ever since. Perhaps she was taking that pill humans used, but Sasha hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Even if that was the case, would it even be effective with his alien DNA?</p><p>So, yes, he needed to see her, needed to know. If he didn\u2019t run into her soon, he\u2019d have to seek her out. For days his dreams had been filled with images of her, her belly round and ripe with their child\u2014and mostly they\u2019d been good dreams. Would she think him crazy for feeling that way? Would she cherish the child even if she rejected the father?</p><p>Too many questions with no answers.</p><p>Chance pulled at the leash, his tail a blur, yanking Larem back into the present. He whined in excitement and looked back at Larem with a big doggy grin. There was only one explanation: the dog had spotted Sasha.</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d just been heading into the coffee shop, but right now she stood frozen in the doorway. Larem signaled Chance to stop and sit. The dog did as ordered but clearly wasn\u2019t happy about it. Larem understood his feelings on the subject, but he didn\u2019t want to crowd Sasha.</p><p>Instead, the two males stayed right where they were and prayed their female would come to them.</p><p>Okay, at least the dog was happy to see her. Maybe Larem was, too, but right now it was hard to interpret his stoic expression.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Sasha jumped at the sound of the voice coming from behind and then realized she was blocking the doorway. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>After pasting a bright smile on her face, she crossed the few feet to where Larem and Chance were standing. After all, she\u2019d walked all the way to this particular coffee shop on the off chance she\u2019d accidentally run into Larem. She had a decision to make and needed to see him before she made up her mind.</p><p>Perhaps a walk around the block with Larem and Chance was exactly what she needed to clear her head and let her think things through. Still procrastinating, she leaned down to let Chance give her a big lick before dealing with the other half of the pair. She found it interesting how everyone else passing by gave the two such a wide berth, as if sensing they were every bit as dangerous as they looked.</p><p>It was hard not to get lost in the intensity of Larem\u2019s gaze when their eyes finally met. Sometimes she wondered if his Kalith DNA gave him the ability to see far more about a person than she could. For sure, he seemed to look straight into the heart of her. Fearing what he might see there, she turned her attention back to Chance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see you and your buddy here are still wearing out the sidewalks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have enjoyed our walks.\u201d The light in his eyes dimmed a bit.</p><p>She asked, \u201cMind some company? D.J. and Cullen managed to recoup an impressive amount of the money Kincade had stolen, and I\u2019ve been holed up in my office dealing with it. Today I think I\u2019ve earned some time out here in the sunshine before I go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good news, but weren\u2019t you going to get some coffee?\u201d He gave her the ghost of a smile. \u201cWe can wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d Before she\u2019d gone two steps, Chance blocked her way. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, boy, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>When the dog wouldn\u2019t move, Larem held out the leash. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I get it for you. Do you want the same as last time?\u201d</p><p>He remembered? Smiling, she nodded but then had second thoughts. \u201cBetter make it decaf this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid you won\u2019t be able to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Once again she nodded. Better to let him assume that was the reason. She reached for her wallet.</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cMy treat.\u201d</p><p>While she waited for him to get through the line, she tugged Chance over to a low concrete wall nearby where she could sit down and pet him. She hugged the dog close, taking comfort in his solid warmth. God, what was she going to do? She thought she could stay away from Larem; Lord knows she\u2019d tried. But even without the latest complication, the temptation to seek him out, to make sure he was all right, had been unbearable.</p><p>The door of the shop opened again. He was back, carrying two coffees and a bottled water. Larem handed her the coffees and then pulled a shallow bowl out of his jacket pocket and filled it for Chance. She liked that about him, that he cared so much about his furry friend.</p><p>After the dog slurped his fill of water, the three of them moved on down the sidewalk. For the first couple of blocks, they concentrated on sipping their coffee and avoiding conversation.</p><p>The forced peace couldn\u2019t last. Nothing had changed. She was who she was\u2014a woman with her future all planned out. There was so much she could accomplish here in Seattle given the time and opportunity. Ever since David\u2019s death, she\u2019d hated everything connected to the Others and their secret reign of terror. It still made her sick to think about how many good men like her first love had burned out their lives trying to stanch the flow of crazies across the barrier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that idea never far from her thoughts, she\u2019d worked long and hard with her goals in mind: to improve conditions for the Paladins, to make their lives better, to find a way to stop the mental deterioration that ended their lives far too soon. And yet, here she was with her heart aching for a man who should be her enemy.</p><p>Sasha had watched Larem talking to the barista inside the coffee shop with his usual quiet dignity. The woman had handed him his change with a smile that was a few degrees too warm to make Sasha happy, not that she could blame her. He was certainly handsome enough, but there was so much more to him than that.</p><p>The other problem was that Larem was a man without real ties to this world. Yes, he had friends, but it was obvious that he missed his home. Given the opportunity, she suspected he\u2019d bolt back across the barrier. What had held him here this long? He\u2019d yet to share his story with her.</p><p>Which left them where?</p> <p>Now, walking along beside Larem, she was acutely aware of his every movement. It was as if something inside her was hardwired to respond to him differently than she had to any other man she\u2019d ever met. He moved with a warrior\u2019s grace and wore the same easy self-assurance that Paladins did, as if he were the toughest thing on the block, ready and able to handle whatever life threw at him.</p><p>She hoped that was true. She really did.</p><p>Larem smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking awfully hard about something, Sasha. Is everything all right? Devlin\u2019s not driving you crazy, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Devlin and I\u2019ve actually made real progress on a few things this week. I don\u2019t know where he got such a reputation for being uncooperative.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOf course, it probably helps that I\u2019m the one with the checkbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be part of it, but maybe not. Devlin swears he\u2019s always dealing with idiots and fools. I suspect you confuse him since you don\u2019t often fit in either of those categories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She shot him a sideways look. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his eyes crinkled, confirming he was teasing her. Damn it, why did he have to be so perfect in so many ways? She\u2019d really been hoping that seeing him again would prove to her that the heat they\u2019d generated had been a fluke, or if not, at least that that\u2019s all it had been. Unfortunately, the attraction she felt for him was more than hormones.</p><p>So that settled one question but left so many others unanswered. As long as she was walking beside him, she\u2019d never get her head on straight.</p><p>She stopped at the next corner. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better leave you here. All that work on my desk won\u2019t finish itself.\u201d</p><p>Rather than risk looking at Larem\u2014fearing he\u2019d see the confusion written in her expression\u2014she knelt down to take her leave of Chance. \u201cYou take care, big fella. Next time maybe we\u2019ll go to a park and play fetch.\u201d</p><p>The big dog\u2019s tail instantly drooped, and he whined before licking her hand. Darn it, did she have to like the dog as much as she did his owner?</p> <p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d</p><p>She tore her attention from Chance back up to his grim-looking companion, her pulse doing a fifty-yard sprint. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Please not back to Kalithia. Not yet. Maybe not ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, but Chance doesn\u2019t belong to me. He\u2019s from the shelter where I volunteer. Now that his injuries are healed, the vet has listed him for adoption. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Chance finds a new home.\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking the pain in Larem\u2019s voice. She put her hand on his sleeve. \u201cCan\u2019t you adopt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I could, but I don\u2019t have my own place. I live with Lonzo, and the apartment is barely big enough for the two of us. Now that Chance\u2019s leg is getting stronger, he needs a big yard and a family.\u201d</p><p>The dog deserved a little happiness in his life, but what about Larem? It was clear he had developed a strong attachment to the dog. So had she, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cListen, I just moved into Laurel\u2019s condo, and I\u2019m rattling around in all that space. Maybe I could keep Chance for you until you have a place of your own. I know it\u2019s not a perfect solution, but at least you\u2019d still be able to see him whenever you wanted to.\u201d</p> <p>And her, too. Though that could be a problem. Some secrets have a way of revealing themselves. She\u2019d have to tell Larem the truth and soon, but not out here on the street.</p><p>Larem studied her for several seconds. \u201cAre you sure? Adopting a dog is a big commitment, and my situation is unstable. Besides, I thought your stay here was only temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it. Besides, Chance would really be yours.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to check with Laurel to make sure it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>From the way Larem was looking at Chance, he was definitely wavering. \u201cLet\u2019s do this. You check with Laurel and think about it overnight. I\u2019ll ask Dr. Isaac to take Chance off the list for the next couple of days. If you\u2019re still interested, call me and we\u2019ll make the necessary arrangements.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look entirely happy, but she knew she really didn\u2019t need the extra time at all. If Laurel was okay with Chance moving in, this time tomorrow she\u2019d have someone to share her new home with.</p><p>She patted Chance one more time. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got calls to make and work to do. I hope to see you tomorrow. Both of you, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Larem nodded good-bye and tugged Chance\u2019s leash, pulling the dog in the opposite direction. Sasha allowed herself to watch Larem as he and Chance made their way back toward the shelter. When Larem stopped abruptly, she quickly turned away, not wanting to be caught staring.</p><p>Okay, it was time to get her head back in the game. She really did have more work waiting at the office. Later she\u2019d think about all the implications of seeing Larem and Chance again tomorrow. At least, it had felt good to get out for a while.</p><p>Except she was suddenly being crowded. She inched forward, trying to put some room between her and whoever was hovering just over her shoulder. She was already standing on the edge of the sidewalk when someone jostled her, almost causing her to lose her balance. Before she could say something, everything went to hell.</p><p>One minute she was waiting for the light to change, her thoughts churning as she tried to make sense of her life, and the next she was flying forward to the tune of squealing tires and honking horns. The pavement came up hard and fast as she instinctively wrapped her arms around her abdomen, leaving her head unprotected. The last thing she remembered was a dog barking and a pair of strong arms muscling her up off the ground.</p><p>Larem ignored the crush of people gathering around. Thanks to Chance, they were keeping a respectful distance. Larem cradled Sasha against his chest before setting her down. Yeah, a couple of helpful individuals mumbled something about not moving her, but did they really think he\u2019d leave her sprawled out in the street, giving somebody a second try at killing her?</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t given in to looking back at her one last time, he would\u2019ve missed the whole thing. She\u2019d been waiting for the light to change when a man in a dark sweatshirt with the hood cinched down over his face had given her a shove out into traffic before taking off down the street at a dead run.</p><p>Chance had led the charge back down the block, barking and clearing the path for Larem. He didn\u2019t need to tell the dog to stay close while he dropped the leash to deal with Sasha\u2019s injuries. Chance gave him room to work and glared at anyone who got too close. Larem left it up to others to call the authorities. He had more important things to do.</p><p>He ran his hands up and down Sasha\u2019s arms, chanting softly under his breath. For once he was able to focus his gift, pulling in the healing warmth of the early afternoon sun and blending it with the magic of his ancestors. He found bruises and scrapes but no broken bones. Using the lightest of touches, he threaded his fingers through her hair, searching for the cause of her continued unconsciousness.</p><p>She jerked in pain when he came into contact with a large lump on the back of her head. His hand came away slick with blood. He paused to slow the bleeding and reverse the swelling, taking comfort that some of the tension eased in her facial expression. Next, he passed his palm over her chest and on toward her stomach. No bleeding. Her ribs weren\u2019t fractured but badly bruised. He sent another surge of energy to soothe them.</p><p>As he concentrated, hurrying to do what he could before the medics arrived and took over, he continued to pour everything he had into healing the damage. The sirens were growing louder. Knowing he had seconds left at best, he made one more pass over her, paying special attention for possible internal injuries.</p><p>And found something. His blood ran cold and his skin flushed hot. He checked one last time and then surrendered her care to the medics after pulling Chance back out of the way. At least the dog sensed that the uniformed man and woman were there to help his Sasha.</p><p>As the EMTs ran through their protocols, they kept up a steady stream of questions. A police officer had joined the party, jotting down the information Larem provided before moving on to take witness statements.</p><p>\u201cSir, we\u2019re going to transport her to the trauma center now. Is there anyone who should be notified?\u201d</p><p>Larem, still reeling, nodded. \u201cShe has no family locally. Her father lives in St. Louis. I don\u2019t have his number with me, but I\u2019ll see that he and her personal physician are contacted.\u201d</p><p>That last was a stretch of the truth, but would give Laurel a chance to intervene if necessary.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have any allergies that you know of?\u201d</p><p>There were so many things about her he didn\u2019t know, and that was one of them. \u201cI have no idea, but there is one thing the doctors should know.\u201d</p><p>The EMT paused, waiting for Larem to finish.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Sasha\u2019s head felt as if someone were using it for bongos. Where was she? She focused her energy on listening for any clues she could pick out over the banging inside her skull.</p><p>Judging by the sounds and smells, she was at the hospital, most likely in the emergency room. It made sense considering her last coherent memory was fighting a losing battle against a very big car. Well, it had looked pretty darn big coming straight at her, but she\u2019d been in no real position to judge for sure. How had it happened?</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d been a bit distracted over her encounter with Larem and Chance, but she knew for a fact she hadn\u2019t stepped out in front of that car.</p><p>As she tried to clear her mind, other worries rose up to demand attention\u2014one in particular. Her eyes finally opened enough that she could look around to see who could answer her questions.</p><p>A familiar figure hovered at the edge of her vision, just inside the curtain that surrounded her bed in the chaotic world of the emergency room. She was hoping for a doctor or even a nurse, anyone other than the man standing there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLarem?\u201d she whispered, trying not to jar her head.</p><p>He moved closer to the bed and enfolded her hand in his. As soon as their hands connected, the bongos faded to a more bearable level. She sighed in relief, briefly accepting the comfort of his touch.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t relax, not until she knew. \u201cWhere\u2019s the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith another patient, but she said she\u2019d stop back to check on you soon. The nurse was also called away, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not far.\u201d His accent had grown stronger again; his emotions were running high.</p> <p>\u201cWho did this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, but the police are investigating. Witnesses were able to give them a pretty detailed description of the guy who pushed you.\u201d His eyes closed, and he squeezed her hand tighter. \u201cSasha, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Or would be once she could talk to the medical staff. \u201cCan you ask the nurse to come back in? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked out. She heard the low rumble of his voice and then the sound of footsteps heading her way. She braced herself to ask some hard questions.</p><p>A woman wearing a lab coat walked in. \u201cMs. Willis, I\u2019m Dr. Brand. I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re perking up. Give me a minute to check a few things and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p> <p>She poked and prodded and took readings, her touch gentle but firm. When she was finished, she pulled up a chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one very lucky lady. According to the police, you took quite a hit. You have a few bruises and abrasions as well as an impressive bump on your head, but none of your injuries are life threatening.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Mr. Jones told us about the pregnancy. We confirmed it with a blood test, but so far there are no signs of any problems in that quarter. Of course, you\u2019ll want to follow up with your OB/GYN about the accident as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Relief mixed with confusion. Thank God the baby was all right, but how in the world had Larem known? She certainly hadn\u2019t told anyone about any of the home pregnancy tests she\u2019d taken over the past couple of days, least of all him. The man had a lot to answer for, but this wasn\u2019t the time or the place.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Brand smiled. \u201cI always figure it\u2019s a good sign when my patients start asking that question. However, I\u2019d like to admit you overnight to keep an eye on that head wound, since you don\u2019t have any family in Seattle. Unless you have someone who can stay with you, concussions can be tricky. You don\u2019t want to take any unnecessary chances, especially with a pregnancy involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with her.\u201d</p><p>Larem had returned. No surprise there. She\u2019d sensed that he\u2019d remained close by, but then he did have a vested interest in the doctor\u2019s report. The last thing she wanted to do was spend a night in the hospital surrounded by strangers, especially since the accident hadn\u2019t been an accident at all.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Larem, that would be great.\u201d Sort of.</p><p>She told herself that she\u2019d accepted Larem\u2019s offer simply because she didn\u2019t have any other close friends here she could ask. The real truth was much simpler: she trusted him to keep her safe.</p><p>The doctor may have sensed some of the tension between them, because she glanced at Larem before giving Sasha a considering look. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, I\u2019ll write your discharge orders, but I don\u2019t want you to go home until after all the test results are back. Also, the police are going to want to take your statement before you leave.\u201d</p><p>When the doctor disappeared, Larem ventured closer. \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken to the authorities. They were going to stop by soon to see if you were awake. Devlin and Laurel are on their way, as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha leaned back against her pillow and felt the burn of tears. The last thing she wanted was to be grilled by either the police or Devlin Bane, but she supposed there was no avoiding it.</p><p>Larem\u2019s gentle touch melted the last of her self-control, unleashing a stream of tears. He immediately perched on the edge of her bed and slowly pulled her into the sanctuary of his arms.</p><p>\u201cThis really wasn\u2019t an accident, was it? Someone shoved me out in front of that car,\u201d she whispered, trusting Larem to give it to her straight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t an accident. Devlin has D.J. monitoring the police investigation, and they\u2019re handling the case as an assault. There\u2019s no indication the driver was involved, but they\u2019re hunting for the guy who ran from the scene.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, making her want to purr. The man certainly had a calming touch. No wonder an abused dog like Chance had taken to him. Chance!</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chance?\u201d</p><p>Larem smiled at her concern. \u201cSafe and sound back at the shelter. The two of us ran there and then the vet, my friend Dr. Isaac, drove me here to the hospital. I arrived shortly after the ambulance.\u201d</p><p>He wiped her tears away with a tissue and then held it to her nose. \u201cBlow.\u201d</p><p>She did as ordered, as embarrassing as it was. \u201cWill the vet hold on to Chance if I can\u2019t take him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Dr. Isaac that you\u2019re hoping to adopt Chance. He\u2019ll keep him at the shelter until you\u2019re ready to bring him home. He said once a dog chose to adopt a human, there was no sense in arguing the point, especially when there was a beautiful woman involved.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was sweet. \u201cThank him for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Someone hesitated right outside the curtain. \u201cExcuse me, Miss Willis, I\u2019m Detective Lake, the investigating officer on your case. Are you up to answering a few questions?\u201d</p><p>No, but that really wasn\u2019t an option. Larem immediately stood up and moved away from the bed. Sasha drew a deep breath and said, \u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><p>If the detective was surprised to see Larem there, it showed only in a slight widening of his eyes. \u201cMr. Jones, we meet again.\u201d</p><p>Larem nodded and remained silent as the police officer settled into the one chair in the cubicle. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re on the mend, Miss Willis. Judging by the witness statements at the scene, that was quite a hit you took.\u201d</p><p>Which sent a chill straight through her. \u201cIt sure feels like it. I should warn you that I don\u2019t actually remember much.\u201d</p><p>The detective smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising, but I\u2019d still like to hear any details you can share. Why don\u2019t you start with how you happened to be at the intersection and go from there?\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness, as an employee of the Regents, she had a cover story ready for just this kind of situation. \u201cI recently transferred here from St. Louis to replace the administrator who resigned from the consulting firm I work for. I went on a walk from the office to a coffee shop, and as I was going in, I ran into my friend Larem out walking his dog. The accident happened just after we\u2019d gone our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>Lake nodded, as if to say her explanation jibed with what he already knew. \u201cOkay, slow down now and give me any details you can, even if they seem unimportant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting at the corner for the light to change. I distinctly remember the crosswalk light was still red. There were others waiting to cross on that corner, too, enough that I was feeling pretty crowded. Someone jostled me, but I didn\u2019t see who it was.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, replaying the sights and sounds in her head. \u201cI was still watching the light when someone shoved me hard from behind. The last thing I remember was the squeal of tires and then a loud thump. I guess that would\u2019ve been me hitting the car or the ground.\u201d</p><p>The detective sat with his pencil hovering over his notepad. \u201cDid you see the person who shoved you?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it. \u201cA vague impression of a guy, but I could be wrong. Maybe he ran into me by accident and then took off scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d the detective conceded, but his tone clearly said otherwise.</p><p>He asked a few more questions until he was satisfied that he\u2019d mined her scattered memories for any useful information. After tucking his notebook back into his pocket, he pulled out a couple of business cards.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my number. Call if you remember anything else, or even if you just need to talk. You seem to be handling all this pretty well, but trust me, it can blind-side you even days later.\u201d</p><p>Larem asked one last scary question. \u201cWhat do you think the chances are of catching the guy before he tries again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a better physical description, it will be hard but hopefully not impossible.\u201d His easygoing fa\u00e7ade faltered a bit. \u201cBut rest assured, I\u2019m going to do my best. Even if the guy ran into you by accident, I understand the first urge might be to run. However, any decent human being would turn himself in after the adrenaline burns off.\u201d</p><p>Sasha clutched his business card like a lifeline. \u201cThank you, Detective. I\u2019ll call if I think of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I hope you feel better soon.\u201d He smiled again and started to leave.</p><p>At the last second he turned back toward Larem. \u201cMr. Jones, the doctor says you\u2019ll be keeping an eye on Ms. Willis tonight. That true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I will make sure she is not left alone.\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged a long look before the detective finally nodded. \u201cLike I said, call if you need me. Bye, folks.\u201d</p><p>This time the detective finally left and with him, Sasha\u2019s last bit of energy. She tugged her blankets up higher and tried to find a position where her head didn\u2019t hurt quite so much.</p><p>Very aware of Larem still hovering nearby, she said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to sleep for a bit. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve missed at least one meal. Why don\u2019t you go grab a bite to eat? I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he rested his hand on hers. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here until Laurel arrives. You shouldn\u2019t be alone right now.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn man. \u201cBut I\u2019m not alone. If I need anything, the nurses are right outside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But then maybe he was talking not about her injuries but the fact that someone might be gunning for her. If so, she shouldn\u2019t be alone, and that idea scared her all over again.</p><p>She gave up and closed her eyes, determined not to cry. \u201cAll right, fine. Stay if you want to, but at least sit down. I don\u2019t like being hovered over.\u201d</p><p>He gently brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to hover. Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Then he leaned down to press a feathery kiss on her forehead. That was the last thing she remembered.</p> <p>Duke sat in his living room and shook. God, what the hell had he gotten himself into? His fingers traced the wound on his neck, a reminder that he\u2019d already come within a hair\u2019s breadth of dying. It still weirded him how quickly the cut had healed, and now he had Devlin Bane riding his case. That wasn\u2019t going to change in the near future.</p><p>He supposed he was lucky he still had a job at all. Earlier, he\u2019d been in Devlin\u2019s office when the Paladin had gotten a phone call. The man had started cussing a blue streak and immediately ordered Duke to go home and plant his ass there until further notice. On the way home, Duke had driven past a guy parked in an unfamiliar car down the street. Duke had just checked and he was still there.</p><p>Was his house being watched? If so, who was doing the watching? One of Devlin\u2019s boys? Or did Rusty have someone spying on Duke? It really didn\u2019t matter as long as he hunkered down on the couch watching TV and calming his nerves with a six-pack.</p><p>The mysterious watcher wasn\u2019t what had Duke all weirded out anyway. When he\u2019d come home and turned on the computer, there\u2019d been another anonymous e-mail with a video clip attached. When he played it, his blood ran cold. Someone had tried to kill Sasha Willis. Thank God he\u2019d still been at headquarters with Devlin Bane himself when it happened. At least Duke\u2019s name wouldn\u2019t be tossed in the hat as a possible suspect.</p><p>The really creepy part was that someone had filmed the whole thing. He\u2019d been debating whether or not to forward it to Bane for the past couple of hours and still hadn\u2019t reached a decision. It might help him start earning his way back into the organization\u2019s good graces. On the other hand, Rusty, most likely the bastard who\u2019d sent it to him, was obviously willing to kill for the cause. Duke really didn\u2019t want to offer himself up as the next target.</p> <p>Maybe it was time to think about asking for a transfer. Things here in Seattle were getting too damned weird. Yeah, sure, he\u2019d insulted the new administrator, but what the hell did she expect when she took up with a freak instead of a human? That didn\u2019t mean he wanted her dead.</p><p>No doubt Larem q\u2019Jones and his buddies were already on the prowl, looking for whoever was responsible. Once again, Duke traced the raised scar running across his throat, a permanent reminder of how Larem had slit him open. No way he wanted to give that Other an excuse to finish what he\u2019d started.</p><p>The phone rang, causing him to jump about a foot in the air. He reached for his cell and checked the number. The ID was blocked; no surprise there.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the video I sent you?\u201d The male voice was altered, making it impossible for Duke to identify the caller.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Rusty, is that you? If so, quit fucking with me. You shouldn\u2019t have gone after Sasha Willis. I don\u2019t want anything to do with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Duke, you disappoint me. And here I had such high hopes for you.\u201d Then he laughed, the distortion making it sound as if it came straight out of some cheesy horror film.</p><p>Duke hated cheesy horror flicks, but somehow his life had become one. \u201cDon\u2019t call me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in no position to be giving orders. You\u2019re part of us now. I\u2019d suggest you do as you\u2019re told. When I need your services again, I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuke, you don\u2019t want to know the answer to that question. And by the way, for your sake, I\u2019m really glad you didn\u2019t give in to the temptation to forward my e-mail to your friend Devlin. That would not have pleased us at all.\u201d</p><p>When the phone went dead, Duke reached for another beer. Maybe he should have bought two six-packs.</p><p>Larem studied Sasha\u2019s face, wishing he could risk performing another healing. His energy supply was running low, and he had to keep something in reserve in case he needed to act quickly.</p><p>The curtain stirred, warning him that someone was about to join them. He rose to his feet, prepared to defend Sasha if necessary. He relaxed when a familiar face appeared in the small gap at the edge of the curtain.</p> <p>Laurel peeked in, taking in both him and Sasha in a quick glance. She kept her voice to a soft whisper. \u201cOkay if we come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>He backed into the corner near the head of the bed to make room for the Handler and her husband. Devlin followed her in, his broad shoulders taking up most of the extra room in the cubicle.</p><p>Laurel studied the readouts on the monitor on the wall. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired, scared, sore,\u201d Larem answered, fisting his hands to resist touching Sasha, who stirred restlessly as if in pain.</p><p>She needed her rest, and he needed to bring the Paladin leader up to speed. \u201cLaurel, will you stay with her while Devlin and I find a more private place to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Laurel studied Larem for a second, those dark eyes seeing far too much. \u201cDev, take this man and get him some food. Judging by his appearance I suspect he\u2019s been practicing his mojo on Sasha, and he\u2019s running on empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. You two should be safe enough here.\u201d He jerked his head in the direction of the nurses\u2019 station. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of medical staff around and security officers down the hall. We won\u2019t stay gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Go before the man falls down.\u201d She gave Larem a gentle shove toward the exit. \u201cWhen you get back, I\u2019ll hunt down the ER doc and get a full report as Sasha\u2019s primary caregiver.\u201d</p><p>Larem swallowed hard, knowing exactly what detail that report would contain. Sasha was going to hate having others find out about the pregnancy when she clearly hadn\u2019t yet come to terms with it herself. God, he was still reeling with the knowledge that they\u2019d created a new life together.</p><p>He said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. The doctor was going to write her discharge orders but said Sasha had to stay here until the final reports are all in. I\u2019ll be staying at Sasha\u2019s place tonight because the doctor says she shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>Laurel gave him one of those looks that very clearly said she knew there was more to that story, but at least she didn\u2019t press for details. He and Devlin made their way out of the chaos of the emergency room and followed the signs to the cafeteria.</p><p>Devlin handed Larem a tray. \u201cLook, I know how much you guys like your veggies. However, if you\u2019re going to keep burning energy like you\u2019ve obviously been doing, you need protein. Eat some meat or at least some eggs and cheese. Don\u2019t make me force the issue.\u201d</p><p>Larem appreciated the rough concern in Devlin\u2019s order, but he could take care of himself. He wasn\u2019t an idiot. Or maybe he was, everything considered. Rather than argue, he chose a salad with grated cheese and a bit of ham. After adding a couple of hard-boiled eggs to his tray, he picked up two cartons of yogurt and one of whole milk.</p><p>Noticing that Devlin was watching his every move, he sighed in disgust. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good start, although I\u2019d rather you ate a big slab of the meat loaf and some of that chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how I feel after I eat this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Devlin pulled out his wallet and told the cashier to ring up both trays.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t tell any of the guys I was so generous. D.J. would be hitting on me to pick up the tab all the time.\u201d</p><p>Larem smiled, partly because it was true, but mainly because he appreciated Devlin\u2019s efforts to lighten up the situation for a few minutes. They\u2019d all had a big scare, and a little humor would go a long way toward helping them both find some balance.</p><p>For a few minutes, they ate in silence. Larem hadn\u2019t realized how hungry he was until he took that first bite. It wasn\u2019t long at all before his tray was filled with empty cartons and dishes. He waited until Devlin polished off the last of his sandwich and pushed his tray away before speaking.</p><p>He looked around the cafeteria. They\u2019d deliberately chosen a table in a quiet corner, and the two closest tables were now empty. This was going to be their best shot at some privacy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>Devlin leaned back in his chair, balancing it on two legs as he listened. Larem started with meeting up with Sasha at the coffee shop and brought him up to speed on almost everything. He considered whether or not to tell Devlin the one thing he\u2019d left out, but decided not to until he and Sasha had had a chance to talk.</p><p>Laurel would probably find out from the doctor overseeing Sasha\u2019s care, but he trusted her to keep that bit of information to herself.</p><p>Devlin rocked forward, bringing the front legs of his chair down with a thud. \u201cYou\u2019re holding something back, Larem, but I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt. If I find out whatever it is puts Sasha at further risk, though, I\u2019ll kick your ass. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, but I promise it has nothing to do with today.\u201d He fiddled with his napkin, tearing it into small shreds. It was time to lay the rest of his cards on the table.</p><p>\u201cThis was a deliberate attack on her, Devlin. The bastard shoved her out into heavy traffic, doing his best to kill her. It\u2019s only a matter of luck that she was knocked aside by the fender instead of getting hit head-on. Coupled with the fiasco in the tunnels, it would seem that someone is determined to see her hurt\u2014or worse.\u201d</p><p>Larem bit his lip, fighting to control the renewed surge of murderous fury. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been there, that head wound could have been dangerous. I managed to contain the damage, but just barely.\u201d</p><p>Devlin\u2019s sympathetic expression almost proved Larem\u2019s undoing. The big man looked away, giving Larem a precious bit of time to collect himself before Devlin spoke again.</p><p>\u201cSo far, Duke\u2019s our only connection to whatever\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll sic Cullen and D.J. on his phone and computer to see if anyone\u2019s contacted him. I know for a fact that rat bastard wasn\u2019t involved today, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s completely innocent. I\u2019ll also call in Barak and Hunter to spell you on protection duty for Sasha. If Sasha is anything like their women and mine, she\u2019s going to insist on getting right back to work, and you can\u2019t be on guard twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Devlin. Promise me when we track down the monster who did this, I get first crack at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word. Now, let\u2019s go see if your woman is ready to get out of here. We\u2019ll drive by your place so you can grab a few things and then take you both to the condo. Just so you know, I had a top-of-the-line security system installed when Laurel was still living there. It won\u2019t stop someone who\u2019s really determined, but it should give you time to respond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Larem grimaced. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m not sure Sasha would be happy to hear herself referred to as mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Devlin\u2019s predatory nature showed in his grin. \u201cYeah, that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re both dealing with some pretty strong feelings for each other.\u201d Then his smile faded. \u201cSeriously, Larem, you have to know you\u2019ll both be fighting an uphill battle if you try to make this thing work between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Like he didn\u2019t know that already. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first human-Kalith pairing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but Sasha clearly wants to be the next Seattle Regent. And judging by what she\u2019s trying to accomplish here, I think she\u2019d make a damn good one. I have to tell you that having someone like her after the shit we\u2019ve put up with in the past is pretty incredible. I\u2019d hate to see anything screw that up.\u201d</p><p>Larem got up to dump his tray, not wanting to hear another word on the subject. But Devlin wasn\u2019t the kind to take a hint, not when he had something on his mind.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, God knows I\u2019m the last one who should be pointing fingers when it comes to this kind of thing. The Regents still aren\u2019t happy about me hooking up with my Handler. My advice? Do what you have to do, and we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>The knot in Larem\u2019s chest eased just enough to make him smile. \u201cThanks, Devlin. I know my presence in your world has caused more than a few problems for you, and I regret that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompared to the grief I get from that bunch I ride herd on, you\u2019re hardly a blip on my radar when it comes to being a problem.\u201d He punched Larem on the arm. \u201cKeep it that way. Now let\u2019s get a move on. I hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Sasha counted the minutes until they reached the condo, where she could take a shower, crawl into bed, and pretend the world didn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>It also didn\u2019t hurt that Larem had thought to ask Laurel about the possibility of Chance moving in with Sasha. Not only had the Handler agreed, she\u2019d offered to stay with Sasha and help her get settled while the two men made a run to the pet store for the doggie necessities. Larem had also called Dr. Isaac, who agreed to wait until they got there to pick up the dog.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait. Right now she could use the comfort of her furry friend, because once Devlin and Laurel left, she\u2019d be alone with Larem. Any kind of buffer would come in handy.</p><p>Devlin pulled the car into the garage and turned off the engine. Larem hurried around to help her out. Pride had her wanting to refuse, but the truth was she was so stiff and sore that she had to accept. Once he got her into the house, Laurel, bless her, took charge and shooed the men back out of the cono.</p><p>As soon as they left, Sasha stopped trying to maintain a brave front and sagged against the counter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be such a bother, Laurel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Besides, that\u2019s what friends are for. Now let\u2019s get you into the shower before the guys get back with your new roommate.\u201d</p><p>Sasha let Laurel help her down the hall. Funny, she hadn\u2019t realized they\u2019d crossed the line into friendship, but she liked the idea.</p> <p>The hospital had given her a pair of disposable scrubs to wear home. Her clothes had been torn and covered in blood, and the police wanted to check them for trace evidence from her attacker. Laurel stayed close by in case she needed help peeling the scrubs off, but she managed to do it on her own. A small victory, but a victory nonetheless.</p><p>The shower stung when it hit her scrapes, but the heat soothed away some of the stiffness. At first the water ran brownish red as it took two rounds of shampoo to get rid of all the blood in her hair. Washing away the last vestiges of the accident was well worth the price of a little pain.</p><p>Laurel was waiting to help Sasha dress in a clean pair of pajamas and her robe. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit on the edge of the bed and let me dry your hair? I\u2019d like to take a look at your head, too.\u201d</p><p>Sasha eased herself down on the corner of the bed and let the Handler do her thing. She winced when Laurel\u2019s fingers pressed briefly on the bump.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, but it\u2019s looking good. Not nearly as bad as I feared.\u201d She gently toweled Sasha\u2019s hair and then used the blow dryer to finish the job.</p><p>\u201cOnce we get you settled in the living room, I\u2019ll make us tea. I\u2019m pretty sure I left some in the cabinet. One of the caffeine-free herbals will be safe for you to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Sasha agreed as she shuffled down the hallway to the living room.</p><p>The mention of herbal tea hinted that a question was coming. She\u2019d hoped to have more time, but circumstances had made that impossible. When Laurel joined her with two steaming mugs, Sasha spoke first.</p> <p>\u201cSo the doctor told you I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Laurel nodded. \u201cShe did, and for what it\u2019s worth, I haven\u2019t told Devlin and won\u2019t without your permission. I take patient confidentiality seriously, but I do think he should be told. He can help you deal with any fallout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. I only found out for sure yesterday myself.\u201d She sipped her tea and blurted out the rest. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve also figured out Larem\u2019s the father. He knows, but I don\u2019t know how. I hadn\u2019t told anyone, not even him.\u201d</p><p>Laurel frowned. \u201cWere you going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, but not yet.\u201d She managed a smile and placed her hand on her still-flat stomach. \u201cOf course, eventually the truth will reveal itself.\u201d</p><p>Laurel seemed to take it all in stride. \u201cHave you had a physical yet, other than what they did at the ER?\u201d</p><p>One more thing to add to her to-do list. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m so new here, I don\u2019t have a doctor of any kind, much less an OB/GYN. Never imagined I\u2019d need one, at least not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make a couple of recommendations for you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that took care of the basics. \u201cLaurel, about Larem. I know this is going to sound crazy considering everything, but I\u2019m worried about how he\u2019s going to feel about this. Before all this happened, the last time I saw him we didn\u2019t exactly part on good terms.\u201d</p><p>The Handler looked sympathetic. \u201cFrom everything I know about him, Larem is one of the good guys. Devlin sure likes him, and he has made good friends among the Paladins.\u201d</p><p>Laurel stopped to sip her tea. Finally, she said, \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t told you his story, you should ask him. I can guess how he found out about the pregnancy, but you\u2019ll need to hear that from him.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the garage door warned them that their private conversation was about to end.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right with Larem staying with you? If not, we can stay over.\u201d</p><p>Sasha couldn\u2019t avoid Larem forever, and the truth was that she felt safer when he was with her. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Besides, Chance will keep both of us occupied.\u201d</p><p>When the kitchen door opened, Chance came bounding in, skidding to a halt in front of Sasha\u2019s chair. Then he approached her slowly as if he sensed that she needed a gentle touch. He laid his big head in her lap and sighed.</p><p>Laurel\u2019s eyes were huge as she took in the size of the beast.</p><p>\u201cYou said it was a dog, not a horse,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>Devlin spread out the cartons of Chinese food he\u2019d brought on the coffee table. She could hear Larem rooting around in the kitchen, and a minute later he appeared with plates, serving spoons, and forks.</p><p>Sasha struggled to sit forward, trying to push the dog\u2019s head off her lap. \u201cCome on, Chance, give me a break here,\u201d she said, giving his soft fur a stroke. \u201cI promise to pet you all you want once I\u2019ve eaten. Why don\u2019t you go check the place out?\u201d</p><p>His ears immediately perked up and then he did exactly as she suggested. He made the rounds in the living room, accepting pets from all four people before taking off to investigate.</p><p>Devlin loaded up a plate for himself and one for his wife. \u201cYou got yourself a nice dog, Sasha. Larem told me his history. I\u2019ve gotta tell you, it makes me want to hunt down his former owner and heap some serious abuse right back at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, but he\u2019s really Larem\u2019s dog. I\u2019m just Chance\u2019s roommate for now.\u201d</p><p>Although she had a feeling it would be really hard to hand him over when the time came. Rather than dwell on it, she concentrated on finishing her dinner before she gave in to sleep.</p><p>She set her plate back on the coffee table, content for the moment to listen to the murmur of the other three talking between bites. After a bit, their voices grew more distant, until they almost disappeared altogether. Right before sleep claimed her completely, though, a pair of strong arms lifted her off the couch. Bits and pieces of conversation floated past her.</p><p>\u201cCan you turn down the sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you with her robe.\u201d</p><p>The touch of cool cotton against her skin felt good as someone\u2014Larem?\u2014settled her on the bed. She thought maybe she smiled. Then there was nothing but silence and sleep.</p><p>\u201cCall if you need us, and don\u2019t forget to set the alarm.\u201d Devlin jingled his keys in his hand. \u201cBarak said he\u2019d be glad to come over first thing in the morning if you need him to relieve you. I\u2019ve also posted a couple of the young Paladins across the street to keep an eye on the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Devlin.\u201d Larem patted Chance on the head as he followed Devlin toward the kitchen door. \u201cI know she appreciates both of you coming to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>Laurel joined the conversation. \u201cDevlin, would you mind waiting in the car for me? I need to talk to Larem for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her husband looked less than pleased as he started for the door. \u201cYou know, I really hate secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that I need to talk to Larem in private.\u201d She frowned before adding, \u201cAnd crank up the radio, so that super-duper Paladin hearing doesn\u2019t let you eavesdrop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, you are way too suspicious.\u201d But Devlin was laughing as he disappeared into the garage.</p><p>Laurel waited until she heard the music turn on before speaking. \u201cI wanted to remind you to wake Sasha up every couple of hours. Any sign that she\u2019s slow to respond or can\u2019t answer simple questions, call nine-one-one and then me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But there was more\u2014he could see it in the way her eyes kept bouncing between him and down the hall to where Sasha lay sleeping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, Larem, I know about the pregnancy and that you\u2019re the father. The ER doc saw no sign of any problems, but I\u2019ll be setting Sasha up with an obstetrician for a full workup as soon as possible. It would help if you made a list of anything you know about Kalith pregnancies that might be helpful. For example, the normal human gestation period is nine months. If it\u2019s different for your people, we\u2019ll have to keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he hadn\u2019t had time to think that far ahead. In fact, he hadn\u2019t let himself think beyond the next few minutes since the time of the accident.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. I\u2019ll also ask Hunter to contact Sworn Guardian Berk to obtain a medical book on the subject from my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking.\u201d Laurel knelt down to pet Chance again. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve been practicing your mojo on the animals at the vet\u2019s clinic. I assume you\u2019ve also used it on Sasha.\u201d</p> <p>Larem nodded. \u201cI eased the bruising on her ribs, slowed the bleeding on a few cuts, and repaired some of the damage to her head. My gift wasn\u2019t strong enough to completely heal her, though.\u201d</p><p>Judging by the way Laurel hesitated, she was about to venture into awkward territory. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s how you discovered she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know about your gift?\u201d Laurel stood and picked up her purse.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I was going to tell her, but it never seemed to be the right time. Now I guess I\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Laurel said with a small smile. \u201cAnd, Larem, sooner would be better than later. I don\u2019t know how things are in your world, but the women here tend to take it badly when they find out their men have been holding out on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I already pointed out to your mate, I doubt Sasha considers herself mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarem, I don\u2019t know what has happened between the two of you. Obviously you\u2019ve got some serious stuff to work through, but stop and think for a minute. After almost being killed, Sasha has to be terrified, especially when she has no idea who\u2019s behind the attack. Right now, she\u2019s vulnerable, hurt, and barely able to take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>Laurel tilted her head to the side as she looked up at him. \u201cSo who is the one person she trusts enough to protect her tonight? You. Just you. And don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t offer to run you off and take your place if she wanted us to.\u201d</p><p>Then she gave him a quick hug. \u201cNow, I\u2019d better get out there before Dev decides to leave without me.\u201d</p><p>They both knew her warrior husband wouldn\u2019t do any such thing, but it was nice to part on a teasing note. He locked the door after Laurel and set the alarm.</p> <p>\u201cWell, boy, let\u2019s make the rounds.\u201d</p><p>The dog followed him from room to room as Larem checked to see that the windows were locked. It seemed unlikely that anyone knew for sure where Sasha was living now, but on the other hand, someone had evidently been following her.</p><p>He saved Sasha\u2019s room for last, not wanting to disturb her. It was still another hour until the time Laurel said he should check on her. Chance quietly stalked into Sasha\u2019s room, acting like a perfect gentleman. He walked around the periphery of her bed, testing the air and whining softly. Obviously, Larem wasn\u2019t the only one who wished he could crawl under the covers and lay his head on the pillow beside hers.</p><p>After checking the window lock, Larem allowed himself the small privilege of watching Sasha sleep. The room was dark except for the light that poured through from the hallway. That didn\u2019t matter; his eyes functioned better in dim light than a normal human\u2019s, allowing him to drink in Sasha\u2019s beauty. He wanted nothing more than to gather her up in his arms and hold her tight.</p><p>The thought of how close he\u2019d come to losing her made him physically ill.</p><p>Chance moved up next to him and rested his head on the foot of the bed. Larem smiled at the dog. Boy, talk about kindred spirits. Both of them had it bad for the same woman. That was okay\u2014he was more than willing to share her with his four-footed friend.</p><p>Sasha might not appreciate waking up to the two males standing over her, although she probably wouldn\u2019t mind Chance sticking close by.</p><p>\u201cStay, boy. I\u2019ll check in on both of you soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The living room was a lonely place with both of the other occupants of the condo sleeping down the hall. Larem made the rounds again, more because he was restless than because he thought there was any immediate danger.</p><p>He stared across the street, trying to see where their Paladin guards were hiding. Even with his superior night vision it took him a while to spot them lurking in the shadows. It was doubtful that anyone passing by would see them at all.</p><p>Larem went back to trying to outdistance his demons.</p><p>Half an hour later, he finally admitted that no amount of pacing was going to help and stretched out on the couch. It was a few inches too short for comfort, but he needed to wake Sasha shortly anyway and didn\u2019t want to risk falling asleep.</p><p>Lying on his back, he laced his fingers behind his head and stared up at the ceiling. It was the first time since discovering Sasha carried his child that he\u2019d had a chance to really think about things. It was almost impossible to sort out the tangle of emotions knotted up inside him.</p><p>Starting with the fact he was going to be a father. A child that he and Sasha had created in a moment of angry passion. He tried to picture an infant with his eyes and her hair or the other way around. The images made him smile even as they scared him.</p><p>True, he\u2019d always imagined a day when he\u2019d find the right mate and start a family, but that was before his life had been ripped out of Kalithia by the roots. After that, he\u2019d pretty much given up looking beyond the day at hand. Despite his efforts to find a place for himself in this world, somehow, someday, he\u2019d always hoped to find a way to go back home and pick up the pieces of his life.</p><p>As unlikely as that possibility had been, it had kept him moving forward one day at a time, but now he\u2019d been cut completely adrift. How could he return to Kalithia and leave his son or daughter behind? Here, half-Kalith children could blend in and live a normal life. In his world that wouldn\u2019t happen, and he\u2019d never subject a child of his to the pain of prejudice.</p><p>He would\u2019ve expected to be angry over having the decision made for him, but oddly enough, all he felt was relief and maybe a bit of excitement. It didn\u2019t really matter to him where he lived; the why was far more important. A child gave him a new sense of purpose, a new focus for his future.</p><p>But what if Sasha decided to return to her life back in Missouri to be closer to her father and friends? She might not want him to follow, but he would. Granted, the move would be hard. At least here in Seattle, the Paladins were willing to accept him as part of their inner circle. That was unlikely to happen anywhere else, but it was a risk he\u2019d have to take to remain near his child\u2014and the woman who held his heart.</p><p>From the beginning, he\u2019d been fighting the attraction he felt for Sasha, but no longer. His feelings for her ran deep and true. There wasn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do to keep her and their child safe.</p><p>Anything, that is, but walk away.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Closing his eyes, Larem reached out with his senses to listen to the night. When he\u2019d first arrived in Seattle, it had taken him weeks to grow accustomed to the noises that humans took for granted. Right now it was quiet except for the buzz of the city in the background. But for a second there, he could\u2019ve sworn that something had jarred.</p><p>Sitting up, he waited to see if he heard it again. There. It was coming from down the hall. A soft moan and a whine. The first was Sasha, the second a worried Chance. Immediately, Larem was up and running.</p><p>He paused in the doorway. Chance stood beside the bed watching Sasha thrash around, twisted up in the sheets. The dog looked relieved to see Larem and backed away to give him space at the head of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSasha, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She stilled briefly but then started struggling again. Larem drew on his replenished pool of energy as he cupped her face with his hands and used a small trickle of healing warmth to soothe her. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He said her name louder this time. \u201cSasha, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cPlease, honey, I just need to make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d He shook her shoulder slightly, just enough to break the hold sleep had on her now.</p><p>Finally, she blinked up at him. \u201cLarem? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to wake you, but you were having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was.\u201d Her eyes looked haunted. \u201cI keep hearing that car and then I jerk awake just before it hits me. Then I\u2019m back down in the tunnels with someone following me. I keep running, but I end up going in circles. It\u2019s all mixed up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cAre you hurting?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her hand straying up to where her head had hit the curb. \u201cA little, but I don\u2019t want to take any more pain medicine. You know, because of the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably wise.\u201d He wondered if he should risk giving her another dose of his energy. Maybe it would be better to wait until she was asleep again.</p><p>She petted Chance, who\u2019d worked his big head under her hand as soon as Larem stepped back out of his way. Her eyes followed him to the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be exhausted, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. I was stretched out on the couch.\u201d He remained in the doorway. \u201cIf it helps ease your mind, Chance and I made sure everything was locked, and I set the alarm after Laurel and Devlin left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I really appreciate all that you\u2019ve done, Larem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy to stay.\u201d He backed into the hall. \u201cI won\u2019t be far. Don\u2019t hesitate to call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Clutching the covers with her hands, Sasha sat up. \u201cI\u2019d really sleep better if you stayed closer.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go drag a chair in from the other room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d She flipped back the covers from the empty side of the bed. \u201cI was thinking a lot closer. Besides, we need to talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still he hesitated. His mind might know she was hurt and fragile right now, but he wasn\u2019t so sure his body understood. Before he could make up his mind, he noticed her smile was quickly fading. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt her feelings. He walked to the side of the bed and kicked off his shoes. When he started to sit down, she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cSuch a gentleman. Look, you might as well get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>In no mood to argue, he ditched his shirt and pants, conscious of her watching his every move.</p><p>\u201cI promise to behave,\u201d he said as he slid in between the sheets.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she murmered.</p><p>Sasha slowly released the breath she\u2019d been holding as Larem snuggled in close until her head was resting on his chest, his arm wrapped around her. Being near him soothed her in so many ways.</p><p>The two of them still had some major hurdles to face, no doubt about it, but for tonight, she needed his warmth and his strength to hold back the darkness. As they lay there in the quiet room, there was one thing she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cLarem, how did you figure out that I\u2019m pregnant? I only just knew for sure myself yesterday and hadn\u2019t told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my Kalith nature, a gift that has been lost to my people for generations because of the fading light in our world. But here, with your bright sun, I have become what you would call a healer.\u201d</p> <p>She could feel the rumble of his words through his chest as his hand brushed lightly up and down her arm, leaving a warm tingle in its wake. Gradually the warmth spread, easing the aches that had kept her from really falling asleep. On the other hand, she could feel Larem tensing up.</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my world, I could sometimes do small things\u2014close up cuts, ease minor pain. But when Hunter was dying from a gunshot wound, I took a chance and tried to heal him. My efforts enabled him to come back faster than he would\u2019ve on his own. By early the next morning, his injuries were all but gone.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, relaxing a bit. \u201cOther than that one time, I haven\u2019t used my gift on any humans or Kalith to heal major injuries until today.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been staring up at the ceiling but now angled his head down to look at her. \u201cMy gift doesn\u2019t always work as it should, so I\u2019ve been practicing on the abused animals at the shelter. Chance wouldn\u2019t have survived his injuries without my help, and it may be the reason he\u2019s learning to trust people again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his skin. \u201cWhat a perfect use for your ability. I can see why you\u2019d have some misgivings about using it to aid Paladins on a regular basis. Is it weird to have so many friends among those you always thought were your enemies?\u201d</p> <p>He briefly squeezed her tighter. \u201cIt is a problem that all of us who now live in the light must come to peace with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever go back?\u201d God, she hoped not, although she wasn\u2019t sure she had the right to ask him to stay.</p><p>\u201cI had hoped to someday, but now . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to ask what had changed his mind, not when his hand immediately settled over her stomach. A feeling of warmth and well-being spread through her, right up until it occurred to her that his magic was Kalith and she was human.</p><p>She caught his hand with hers. \u201cIs doing that safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not harm you or the child\u2014our child.\u201d But he withdrew his hand anyway. \u201cBut I understand why you would worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell if it\u2019s a girl or a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Do you have a preference?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled again. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead yet, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll keep our child?\u201d</p><p>She turned to stare into his worried face. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Regents\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with them when the time comes, but the baby\u2019s more important. Push come to shove, there are other jobs.\u201d</p><p>His relief was obvious. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a great mother, so fierce and protective.\u201d He gently cupped her face, a small smile softening his somber expression. \u201cSasha, you know I want to be there for both of you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to nuzzle his hand, pressing a soft kiss to his palm. \u201cI never doubted it.\u201d</p><p>When she yawned, he pulled her closer again. \u201cNow, you need to sleep. I have to wake you up again in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and relaxed. Maybe she should be worried about how good sharing this moment with him felt, but that was something she\u2019d deal with tomorrow. Or maybe the next day. Right now, she needed this man beside her and that was enough.</p><p>Morning came slowly. Larem hovered somewhere between sound asleep and pleasantly aware of the warm female currently half-sprawled across his body, her head tucked under his chin. If this was a dream, he didn\u2019t want to wake up. If it was reality\u2014well, he was in no hurry to let the outside world intrude.</p><p>Besides, neither of them had enjoyed a quiet night. Every couple of hours he\u2019d had to make sure she woke up. Right now, it was enough to doze with Sasha in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking way too hard.\u201d Sasha blinked up at him sleepily, her fiery hair surrounding her sweet face in a halo of unruly curls. \u201cGot something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>Yes, a couple of things, starting with how tempting it was to have her lush body so close to his. All that separated them was the thickness of his boxers and her pajamas. Even that kept them too far apart. Better to deal with one last issue.</p><p>\u201cI was asked to befriend you deliberately.\u201d</p><p>He immediately felt a new thrum of tension in Sasha when she asked, \u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling, not wanting to see her reaction. \u201cThe other Kalith and their mates. They thought if the new representative got to know me as a real person before finding out I was Kalith, it would change how all of us were dealt with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did they pick you instead of Lusahn or Barak?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even try to sugar-coat it. \u201cBecause I was expendable. If it blew up in my face, I could disappear more easily than any of them.\u201d</p><p>Sasha was looking pretty darn fierce. \u201cI understand why they did it, but that was mean of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey meant no harm. They were trying to protect themselves.\u201d He trailed his fingers down her shoulder, trying to soothe away her anger.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that, but who was protecting you?\u201d</p><p>Her question pleased him, sending another surge of desire for this woman burning through him. \u201cI won\u2019t complain, Sasha, not if it led me here. Don\u2019t hold it against them. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything, but I wanted nothing but truth between us. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He felt her nod.</p><p>\u201cThere is one other thing on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately answer, she raised herself up to look at him. Her eyes widened and her mouth curved in a seductive smile. \u201cNever mind. I think I can guess what it might be.\u201d</p><p>Her playful mood had him smiling. \u201cSo now you\u2019re a mind reader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have to be when there\u2019s obvious proof readily at hand.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers traveled down his chest to stroke the hard evidence. He thought about claiming it meant nothing, that it was normal in the morning, but they both knew this time was different.</p><p>She caressed his cock slowly with the palm of her hand. Out of pure selfishness, he let her continue, wishing like crazy they could finish what she\u2019d started. Finally, he gently grasped her hand, threading his fingers with hers.</p><p>She pouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do, but you\u2019re testing my already shaky control.\u201d He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I want you out of control?\u201d</p><p>She slowly slid her body up over his until her core was centered right over his erection. Dear gods, how was he supposed to think straight when she rocked against him like that?</p><p>\u201cSasha, I want you, but you were badly injured yesterday. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, the pain is almost completely gone. Thanks to a certain healer I happen to know, I\u2019m feeling positively frisky.\u201d She nibbled on his chin after each word.</p><p>He might be cautious, but he wasn\u2019t fool enough to dismiss her offer out of hand. Still, he had to ask, \u201cAre we doing this because you were almost killed yesterday or because you really want me?\u201d</p><p>She sat up and eased her hands under the hem of his undershirt and spread her fingers out over his chest. \u201cA little of the first and a whole lot of the second.\u201d</p><p>He appreciated the honesty. \u201cPerhaps, as your healer, I should reassess your injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>He gently rolled her back onto her own side of the bed, and then lifted her head enough to tuck his pillow in on top of hers. \u201cNow lie back and relax. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside Sasha and took her hand in his. Closing his eyes, he slowly traced the length of her arm, pausing over each bruise or scrape long enough to add a small jolt of healing. He repeated the same procedure with her other arm before moving over her shoulders and neck.</p><p>Her hair slid like silk over his fingers as he checked the bump on her head. \u201cAny headache?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed, her face peaceful. \u201cNot now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward until his palms hovered a hair\u2019s breadth over her breasts. Sasha drew a deep breath and that small distance disappeared. When her eyes flew open at his touch, he started to pull back, but she stopped him by putting her hands on his.</p><p>\u201cI like when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>So he did, gently kneading the soft curves until her nipples pebbled. As much as he wanted to linger there, he had more territory to cover. He continued down her sides to the curve of her hips and then checked each of her legs, top to bottom and back again. Sasha\u2019s breathing had sped up, as had his.</p> <p>He held his palms over her stomach, smiling at the fierce bit of life that had taken hold there. Male, female, it didn\u2019t matter. The miracle was that he and Sasha had created the child together. He lowered his mouth down to press a kiss right above where his child rested, smiling when Sasha\u2019s legs stirred and her hips flexed.</p><p>The exam was quickly becoming a seduction. He eased the waistband of her PJ bottoms down and kissed the same spot again and then lower and lower still. Sasha lifted her hips in encouragement. He quickly peeled her pajamas off and then took his time driving his lover wild with his touch and his tongue.</p><p>Sasha shattered once and then a second time before she said, \u201cLarem, I want you up here. Naked. Now.\u201d</p><p>She punctuated her demands by taking off her top and flinging it aside. He\u2019d never seen a more beautiful sight than this woman staring at him with such powerful desire in her eyes. His boxers joined her pajamas on the floor.</p><p>Then they were skin to skin, his knee between hers, pressing against the damp heat at the juncture of her thighs. He kissed her, trying to go slow and losing the battle. Sasha\u2019s hands were everywhere, touching, teasing, stroking until she\u2019d shredded what little sanity he had left.</p> <p>\u201cSasha, I need to . . . no, we need to slow down.\u201d</p><p>But how could he when everything she did only drove them both crazy? Finally, he wrested control of the situation by pinning her hands over her head while he did his own little bit of tormenting. She arched back, demanding more, as he nuzzled and tongued her breasts into stiff peaks.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned solemn. \u201cI like all of this, so much that it scares me.\u201d</p><p>She was right. What they shared was incredibly powerful. He wasn\u2019t sure where this exploration would take them, but right now it was simply too amazing to resist. He released her hands.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, Sasha.\u201d</p> <p>She stroked the side of his face. \u201cYou can\u2019t promise that, Larem, but I believe you mean it.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to deny the truth of that but wouldn\u2019t lie to her, either. Instead, he set about stoking the fire again. Conscious of the vestiges of yesterday\u2019s injuries, he didn\u2019t want her to bear his weight. Instead, he turned her on her side facing away from him, her back against his chest. He lifted her leg back over his hips.</p><p>Slowly, he pressed forward, seating his cock deep within her welcoming heat. Sasha\u2019s head kicked back as he thrust in and out, her eyes half shut, her breath coming in shallow puffs, matching his rhythm. He memorized her satin smooth skin, the plump softness of her breasts, the way they fit perfectly in his hand. He loved the firm curve of her hips, flexing to absorb the power of his thrusts, and the throaty little moan she made when he moved in exactly the right way.</p><p>There was no longer a Larem and a Sasha. It was as if they had forged someone new, a combination of the two seeking the ultimate joining. He stroked her with his fingers as he accelerated the pace, no longer able to rein in his need to take her fast and hard. Sasha whimpered and called his name. Then she was shuddering in his arms, pressing back against him as he rode out his climax.</p><p>Then the tension melted away, both left gasping for breath and basking in the aftermath. He gently kissed the back of her neck; there were no words for what had just happened between them.</p><p>Larem reluctantly withdrew from her body, once again stretching out beside her. \u201cAre you all right? Was I too rough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were perfect. In fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Chance made his presence known, throwing a major fit in the other room. Larem could just make out the sound of the doorbell over the racket. There was a definite note of danger in Chance\u2019s bark that had Larem rolling out of bed, pausing only long enough to snag his pants and shirt on the way out.</p> <p>The dog stopped barking as soon as Larem reached the living room. Even so, he growled deep in his chest, positioning himself firmly in front of the door.</p><p>Larem checked the time. Had Devlin said that Barak was coming this morning or that Larem was supposed to call him? Who else could it be? All he could tell through the frosty glass in the front door was that the unexpected guests were most likely male.</p><p>He hopped on one foot and then the other to pull on his jeans and then yanked his shirt on over his head. Palming the gun Devlin had left with him, he disconnected the security system and then threw the dead bolt. Opening the door a few inches, he peered out.</p><p>Two young Paladins stood flanking a disgruntled-looking human male, perhaps in his late fifties. The human had been glaring at his captors but immediately turned his bad mood in Larem\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWho is this guy?\u201d Larem and the stranger asked at the same time.</p><p>The nearest Paladin ignored the human and responded to Larem instead. \u201cThis guy\u2019s ID says he\u2019s Charles Willis.\u201d</p><p>The glint of red in the older man\u2019s hair suddenly made Larem\u2019s question unnecessary. He had no doubt that he was facing Sasha\u2019s father. To once again quote Lonzo, Holy hell, the shit was about to hit the fan.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Larem\u2019s first urge was to slam the door, but panic wasn\u2019t going to change anything. He opened the door the rest of the way and then grabbed Chance by the collar in case the dog took his same instant dislike to the man. Of course, that was probably a knee-jerk reaction typical of any male who\u2019d just come from a woman\u2019s bed and was feeling a bit guilty about it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, gentlemen, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Sasha\u2019s father, he stood back to allow the man to enter. \u201cYour daughter wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t, but I\u2019m here anyway. Deal with it.\u201d The man stalked through the door, careful to give both Larem and Chance a wide berth. \u201cWhere is she? Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d Mostly anyway. Having her father show up on her doorstep would certainly complicate the situation.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat and I\u2019ll tell her you\u2019re here. She was just getting up when the doorbell rang. I\u2019ll make breakfast while she gets dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, and when you get back, you can tell me who the hell you are and why you spent the night in my daughter\u2019s . . .\u201d He hesitated briefly. \u201cIn my daughter\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t the man figure that out for himself? Perhaps not. Most humans lacked the enhanced senses that Paladins shared with the Kalith, so maybe Mr. Willis really couldn\u2019t detect the musky taint of sex in the air. If that was true, there was a small chance they could avoid a complete disaster.</p><p>Dragging Chance with him, Larem went back down the hall to the bedroom door and knocked. \u201cMiss Willis, I hate to disturb you, but you have a guest.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Sasha peered out. \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Larem glanced back toward the kitchen, hoping the man had stayed where he\u2019d left him. \u201cYour father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, why? And how did he find me?\u201d</p><p>There was a definite note of panic in her voice. When Sasha started to charge out of the room, Larem blocked her way. The last thing she needed was to encounter her father looking as if she\u2019d just gotten out of bed, especially one she\u2019d shared with her lover. Larem shook his head, begging her without words to stop and think.</p><p>\u201cMiss Willis, I\u2019m sure your father won\u2019t mind waiting for a few minutes since he arrived unannounced. I\u2019ll tell him that you\u2019ll join us when you\u2019ve had a chance to get dressed. As your bodyguard, I\u2019ll remain here only until my relief arrives.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll call Devlin and suggest he send one of the Paladins instead of Barak. I\u2019m not sure your father has recognized me as Kalith, and I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Then he leaned in and gave her a quick kiss. \u201cCan you hand me my boxers and socks? I don\u2019t think your father would appreciate stumbling over them.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed red, but she actually giggled. \u201cI like a man who thinks clearly in times of crisis. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>A second later she shoved the rest of his clothing through the door at him. \u201cGive me fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the guest bathroom long enough to finish dressing. After washing his face and combing his hair, he studied his image in the mirror. The strain of the past twenty-four hours definitely showed in the dark circles under his eyes, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do about that. Hopefully Sasha\u2019s father would put it off to a night spent on guard duty rather than a bout of scorching hot sex with his daughter.</p><p>Before rejoining Mr. Willis, he texted Devlin about the situation, not wanting to risk a call that the Regent might overhear. Satisfied he\u2019d done as much damage control as he could, he headed back to the kitchen.</p><p>Chaz parked his ass on a stool at the kitchen counter, even though he\u2019d rather be pacing the floor. But from the way that damned dog kept staring at him, he\u2019d play it safe and sit still. At least he could breathe again. Maybe the situation wasn\u2019t as out of control as he\u2019d feared.</p><p>But as soon as that guy came back, he was going to demand answers. What the hell was going on? All he knew for sure was that he\u2019d gotten an e-mail from Rusty about Sasha being hit by a car. It had taken him several phone calls to find out where she\u2019d been taken, and then the hospital would tell him only that she was a patient there. After that, all he could think about was getting on the first plane heading west. He\u2019d envisioned finding her safely ensconced in the hospital, craving the comforting presence of her father.</p><p>But upon arrival, he found out that she\u2019d already been discharged. After digging through his backlog of e-mails, he\u2019d located the address for her condo and grabbed another cab, hoping like hell that she\u2019d made it through the night all right on her own.</p><p>But then she hadn\u2019t been alone after all, which raised a whole new bunch of questions. Like why were there Paladins posted outside? Not that he was complaining. But who the hell was that long-haired guy, and what was he doing in Sasha\u2019s home?</p><p>Even without knowing his name, it didn\u2019t take a genius to recognize a stone-cold killer on sight. Even without that gun in his hand, he had the same look that all Paladins did\u2014like they were the toughest sons of bitches on the planet. Chaz had met enough of them over the years to know they might just be right about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was something different about this guy that Chaz couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on. The man\u2019s eyes were an unusual color, but it also could\u2019ve been all that hair. Chaz hadn\u2019t really gotten a good look at him because he\u2019d been too busy keeping a wary eye on that monster of a dog.</p><p>Which, he just noticed, was back again. The animal sat blocking the hallway that evidently led back to Sasha\u2019s bedroom. Even if Chaz were so inclined to go pound on her door and demand answers to his increasing number of questions, he wasn\u2019t about to challenge a dog that size.</p><p>A door opened somewhere behind the dog. Sometime between the time he\u2019d gone back to tell Sasha of his arrival, the guy had straightened his clothes and combed his hair, which he now wore back in a ponytail. It looked better that way, but only marginally. Maybe Chaz should have a talk with Devlin Bane about enforcing a dress code. And that he was even worried about something so stupid was just a sign of how tired he was. It had been years since he\u2019d pulled an all-nighter.</p><p>\u201cMiss Willis will join us shortly. Would you like a cup of tea or would you prefer coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoffee, Mr.\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarem. Larem Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Jones, would you care to explain what you\u2019re doing here? Forgive me for being a bit pushy on the subject, but fathers are always curious when they discover a man spent the night in their daughter\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>And maybe in her bed. But surely not. This guy certainly had little in common with the men Sasha had dated in the past. Still, a father had to wonder.</p><p>Chaz drew some comfort from noticing the guy wasn\u2019t at home in Sasha\u2019s kitchen. He\u2019d had to hunt for the coffee and then the sugar. Good. Finally, when the water was on to boil and the coffee pot was doing its thing, Larem slowed down long enough to talk.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re here because of the incident Sasha was involved in yesterday. Since Devlin Bane wasn\u2019t sure it was an accident, he asked me to stay over to keep an eye on things. He\u2019ll be sending someone to relieve me shortly.\u201d</p><p>Then he pulled a dozen eggs out of the fridge and began cracking them into a bowl. He dumped them into a skillet he\u2019d had heating on the burner and started stirring.</p><p>A few seconds later, he pointed toward the other end of the counter. \u201cYou want to put bread in the toaster?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so breakfast was going to be a team effort. Fine, he\u2019d go along with the program for the moment. But when Chaz started to stand up, the dog took notice and didn\u2019t particularly like it.</p><p>Jones gave the dog the evil eye. \u201cChance, stop it. Mr. Willis has every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>The dog backed down but still followed his every move with a great deal of suspicion. Maybe Chaz would learn more if he asked a few questions, starting with the easy ones.</p> <p>\u201cYour dog is huge. What kind is he?\u201d</p><p>Larem looked up from the skillet. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Miss Willis adopted Chance from a rescue shelter. She brought him home yesterday evening.\u201d</p><p>A lump of disappointment settled in Chaz\u2019s stomach. If he\u2019d had any doubts about Sasha wanting to make this move permanent, they were rapidly disappearing. The thought made him sick, especially if Devlin Bane thought she\u2019d come under attack.</p><p>Short of the entire Board of Regents ordering her back to Missouri, there wasn\u2019t much Chaz could do. Besides, he wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d even listen to him, even if he told her it was unlikely the other Regents would ever invite her to join their ranks.</p><p>At the sound of a door opening down the hall, Chance lumbered to his feet, his tail wagging like crazy. From his reaction, the dog was already firmly attached to Sasha. When she appeared in the kitchen doorway, he made a beeline for her. At least the dog had the good manners to sit down and wait for Sasha to notice him.</p><p>In fact, this Larem guy acted much the same. Although he kept himself busy serving up eggs and buttering the toast, there was a new level of tension in the air. The bodyguard\u2019s reaction to Sasha\u2019s presence was definitely interesting\u2014and pretty damned disturbing.</p><p>Sasha gave her dog a quick pat. \u201cGood morning, big guy.\u201d</p><p>Then she walked over to kiss Chaz on the cheek. \u201cHi, Dad. What brings you here?\u201d</p> <p>He would\u2019ve thought it was obvious. Her cavalier attitude infuriated him, but before he could sputter out an answer, she\u2019d already moved on.</p><p>\u201cLarem, that smells delicious. I\u2019m usually not big on breakfast, but I woke up with quite an appetite this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jones shoved a mug of tea into her hands. \u201cI\u2019d think that was normal, considering everything you\u2019ve been through since yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Sasha stared at the bodyguard over the rim of her cup as she sipped her tea. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anything that\u2019s happened since yesterday could be classified as normal, at least not in my experience.\u201d</p><p>Why was she smiling at the man that way? Chaz studied the interplay between the two of them. He\u2019d always been good at reading layers of meaning in any given situation, and what he was picking up right now really pissed him off. He was willing to accept that this Jones guy stood guard last night to keep an eye on Sasha. The real question was just how close he\u2019d been to her while he carried out his duties.</p><p>Larem set out three plates of eggs and toast along with a glass of orange juice for each of them. \u201cDo you take cream or sugar with your coffee, Mr. Willis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack is fine.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he noticed the guy\u2019s accent earlier? He was almost positive it was heavier now. Something niggled at the back of his mind. He\u2019d give them all a chance to relax over their meal and then pounce.</p><p>Contrary to Sasha\u2019s earlier claim, she was merely toying with her food. When she thought Chaz wouldn\u2019t notice, she watched the grimly silent man seated at the far end of the counter.</p><p>As much as he respected the Paladins and the work they did, no father would want his daughter to get mixed up with one. There\u2019d been no keeping Sasha from pursuing a career working for the Regents, but at least in St. Louis she\u2019d had only minimal contact with the blood-and-guts part of the business. She had a tender heart, the kind that was ripe to fall for someone she saw as a real hero.</p><p>Chaz set his fork back down on the plate. \u201cThanks, that was good.\u201d</p><p>Jones grunted in response and started clearing things away. Sasha slipped a couple of bites to her dog and then pushed the rest of her breakfast away.</p><p>Her bodyguard shoved it right back toward her, adding another spoonful of scrambled eggs from the skillet. \u201cEat all of that. You need it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so the guy didn\u2019t know her very well after all. Ordering Sasha to do something was a surefire way to get her to dig in her heels. But much to his dismay, she sighed heavily and then tugged the plate back and started eating again.</p><p>What was that all about? And why wasn\u2019t she reading him, her own father, the riot act for encroaching on her territory without calling first? There was something definitely off about her behavior.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Mr. Jones, where are you from? I don\u2019t recognize your accent.\u201d</p><p>The silence was deafening. A sick feeling settled in his chest, making it hard to draw a full breath. There was only one reason not to respond to such a simple question: the answer was damning in some way. He grew more sure of it when Sasha tried to distract him.</p><p>\u201cDad, so I\u2019m guessing some helpful person took it upon himself to report back to you about what happened yesterday. I was going to call you myself this morning, but obviously someone saved me the trouble. Care to tell me who your spy is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. It was bad enough that I had to find out through the grapevine instead of hearing it straight from you.\u201d He took great pains to keep his voice calm. \u201cAnd, Mr. Jones, you haven\u2019t answered my question, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t be rude.\u201d Sasha stood up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the two of us go into the living room?\u201d</p><p>He stayed right where he was. \u201cIs there a reason you don\u2019t want him to answer me, Sasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because it\u2019s not your business. You\u2019re in my home, and I won\u2019t let you be rude to one of my friends.\u201d</p><p>He happened to be looking toward Larem at that moment. Judging by his reaction, he wasn\u2019t happy that she\u2019d let that last part slip. The two of them had obviously conspired to act more like employer and employee in front of him. If they were reluctant to admit they were at least friends, it meant their relationship had gone way past that stage.</p><p>Chaz helped himself to another cup of coffee while he mulled over the situation. For now, he\u2019d quit pressing for answers he really, really didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>Sasha buried her face in Chance\u2019s soft fur, taking comfort in the dog\u2019s undemanding acceptance. Could this be any more awkward? All she wanted to do was skulk back into her bedroom and pull the covers over her head\u2014alone this time. Not that she regretted what she and Larem had shared, but right now life was throwing too much at her too quickly.</p><p>Footsteps stopped a short distance away. She knew without looking that it was her father who stood there. She had only one question for him. Was he there in his role as Regent or solely as her parent?</p><p>He sat down on the far end of the sofa and stared at Chance. \u201cYou know, if you wanted a pet, a goldfish would\u2019ve been easier to take care of and a lot more portable.\u201d</p><p>She gave Chance one last hug before sitting up straight. \u201cYeah, but they\u2019re harder to take on long walks.\u201d</p><p>As if aware that he was the subject of their conversation, Chance wandered over to stare at her father for several seconds before laying his head on his knee, woofing softly as he did so. She had to laugh at the look of horror on her dad\u2019s face as he gave the dog an awkward pat on his head, sending up a small cloud of white fur.</p><p>Then he gave in with a rueful grin. \u201cAre you sure this guy is really a dog? Did you check the news for any lost pony reports?\u201d</p><p>She knew anything she and her father discussed would probably be overheard by the man in the next room, even over the racket he was making as he cleaned up the kitchen. Maybe Larem sensed she needed to talk to her father alone, because he appeared in the doorway with Chance\u2019s lead in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take the pony for a walk,\u201d he said, confirming that his Kalith hearing had picked up their discussion. \u201cWe won\u2019t go far, just up and down the block a few times. My relief will be here soon, but you should be safe with your father here and the guys across the street.\u201d</p><p>Then he pegged her dad with a hard look. \u201cI left my spare gun on the counter. I assume you know how to use one. If not, be smart enough to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Her dad went into full Regent mode. \u201cI do, and watch your tone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, cut the man some slack. He\u2019s been up all night.\u201d Well, not all night, but an impressive amount of it. Not that she was about to share that little tidbit with her father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Miss Willis. Don\u2019t open the door for anyone you don\u2019t immediately recognize.\u201d</p><p>Then, while her father was looking at her, Larem winked at her and smiled. Then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than just your bodyguard, Sasha, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Her father sipped his coffee, obviously prepared to wait her out if she didn\u2019t immediately answer. Fine, but she\u2019d learned everything she knew about being stubborn from him.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, what Larem is, Dad, isn\u2019t your concern. All you need to know is that he made sure I was safe last night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cNow, I get that you were worried, but why not just call? If you couldn\u2019t reach me, you could\u2019ve called Devlin Bane or his wife for a status report before hopping a red-eye from St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>They both knew she\u2019d inherited her temper from him. Her dad\u2019s eyes flashed hot before he visibly put a lid on it. \u201cI\u2019m here because you\u2019re my daughter. I have a right to be a little curious about this new life you\u2019re building for yourself here in Seattle. That coupled with the fact that you were almost killed seemed to warrant more than a phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m doing my job, Dad. The one the Regents sent me here to do. I spend most of my time knee-deep in reports and numbers and meetings. I\u2019m making some real progress in reestablishing some trust between the Paladins and the organization. That seems to have ruffled a few feathers in certain quarters.\u201d</p><p>She picked at a small thread that had come loose on the arm of the sofa. \u201cI like the people I\u2019ve met here, and the Paladins deserve better than the way they\u2019ve been treated the past few years. Based on prior experience, they have no reason to believe that things are going to change for the better, but they\u2019ve been willing to give me a chance.\u201d</p> <p>She chose her next words carefully but let more than a hint of her anger show as well. \u201cKincade was a sadistic bastard who screwed with people\u2019s minds and lives for years. I can\u2019t believe no one listened when Devlin Bane and others tried to tell the Regents what was going on here.\u201d</p><p>He settled into the corner of the sofa, turning to face her more directly. \u201cI\u2019m listening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise none of this goes any further until I\u2019m ready to make a formal presentation to the Board itself. I\u2019d appreciate getting your opinion on some things.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his heart, he held his hand up. \u201cI can keep a secret with the best of them. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKincade was robbing the Regents blind. He funneled money out of every account he had access to, and then played with the numbers to cover his tracks. Over the years, it had to add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Not only that, but he stirred up animosity between all the departments out here to keep everyone on edge. What he did to torment the Paladins was nothing short of criminal. We\u2019re lucky there wasn\u2019t an out-and-out rebellion.\u201d</p><p>Then she narrowed her eyes. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t working alone either. As far as we can tell, he kept most of the money for himself, but the rest was sent to offshore accounts leading back to the Midwest Region.\u201d</p> <p>Chaz erupted: \u201cLike hell he did!\u201d Then her father paused. \u201cWait a minute, surely you don\u2019t suspect me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. But I can\u2019t speak for what Devlin Bane thinks. What I can tell you is that I\u2019ve had two of Devlin\u2019s IT specialists working on breaking the encryption codes on Kincade\u2019s computer. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to follow the money right back to Kincade\u2019s accomplices.\u201d</p><p>Her dad snorted. \u201cIT specialists? Is that the new politically correct term for hackers? I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve been working with D. J. Clayborne and Cullen Finley. God, Sasha, letting those two have free rein in a computer system is like turning a bunch of first-graders loose in a candy store.\u201d</p><p>She gave him her most innocent look. \u201cI didn\u2019t mention any names, Dad. All I can say is that the gentlemen in question are doing a terrific job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but keep an eye on them. I can\u2019t tell you how many complaints I\u2019ve heard over the years about their antics. Of course, I suppose there is some sense in that old adage about using a thief to catch one.\u201d</p><p>Sasha nodded. \u201cMy men have put in some long hours on the project, and that\u2019s on top of all their other duties. You know how Paladins are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do, which should explain why I worry.\u201d He softened the comment with a smile, although his gaze briefly strayed toward the door; clearly he was thinking about Larem. \u201cI never wanted you to get entangled in their world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ve dedicated your life to serving the Regents and the Paladins. I\u2019m following your lead. When do you think the Regents will make a decision about appointing a permanent Regent for this area?\u201d</p> <p>And did she really stand a chance? She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say that last part out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt will be discussed at the next general meeting, which will be a teleconference. If you\u2019re serious about applying for the position, put together some hard data on what you\u2019ve accomplished and what\u2019s next on your agenda. Include any negatives, too, or they\u2019ll get suspicious. It would help if you listed possible solutions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my plan.\u201d</p><p>Her father sat up taller. \u201cYou have to know that with this possible attack on you, I\u2019d feel a whole lot better if you finish up what you were sent to Seattle to do and come back home. Now that you\u2019ve proven yourself here, the Board can find a position more commensurate with your abilities in St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d vote against me.\u201d That hurt, but it was really no surprise either.</p><p>\u201cSasha, honey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, don\u2019t go there. We both know that as long as I stay in St. Louis, I\u2019ll be living in your shadow and under your thumb. I want more than that, and you should want it for me, too.\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door saved them both from going any farther down that road. She didn\u2019t want to fight with her father, but his heavy-handed protectiveness drove her crazy.</p><p>She got up and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cSasha, wait.\u201d Her father was up and charging past her to grab the gun. \u201cStand back and let me open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but at least let me see who it is.\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly stood back and let her look through the peephole. Great. What was Devlin doing back on her doorstep?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad. It\u2019s Devlin Bane, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his wife is with him.\u201d</p><p>The Paladin leader walked in with Laurel right behind him. \u201cMr. Willis, what a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>That was a lie, but at least her father let it pass. \u201cI needed to see for myself that my daughter was all right. If I\u2019d waited for a report from her or you, I suspect hell would be frozen over.\u201d</p><p>Laurel caught Sasha\u2019s attention and rolled her eyes. \u201cSasha, why don\u2019t I give you a quick checkup while these two finish their discussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I don\u2019t know about you, but I truly hate the smell of testosterone in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Laurel laughed, although the two men didn\u2019t seem to get the joke. Too bad.</p><p>Feeling better now that the cavalry had arrived, Sasha led the way to her bedroom. She flipped on the radio next to the bed, hoping to give them some degree of privacy. When they\u2019d closed the door, Laurel set her small medical case on the bed. Sasha dutifully let the doctor do her thing.</p><p>\u201cAny problems?\u201d Laurel asked as she wrapped a blood pressure cuff around Sasha\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides my father showing up unannounced? Or that I still have no idea who tried to kill me or why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s start with the injuries from yesterday. Any headaches or dizziness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny cramping or bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny problems having wild monkey sex with Larem last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. As soon as the word slipped out, Sasha blushed furiously.</p><p>Meanwhile, Laurel finished pumping up the cuff and closed her eyes to listen as she let off the pressure. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. Your dad couldn\u2019t possibly have heard us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but Devlin probably could.\u201d</p><p>Laurel put all her stuff back in her bag. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who bet me Larem wouldn\u2019t end up sleeping on the couch last night. By the way, we spoke to him before we came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about you. Not sure what he should be doing right now, especially with your father here. He offered to let us bring Chance inside, so he could leave. Devlin told him to hang around a little longer until we knew what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Sasha rested her elbows on her knees and buried her face in her hands. \u201cI want more time alone with him, so we can really talk. That\u2019s not going to happen with my father here. Heck, Dad\u2019s already suspicious that Larem\u2019s more than just someone Devlin ordered to stand guard.\u201d</p><p>She prayed for patience. \u201cDad\u2019s asked Larem twice where he\u2019s from because he didn\u2019t recognize his accent. The man\u2019s not stupid. Sooner or later, he\u2019ll figure out that Larem is Kalith.\u201d</p><p>Laurel sat down beside her. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through. I love my parents dearly, but they\u2019ve only recently come to understand that I\u2019m never moving back home. It hurts them that I don\u2019t fit in there anymore, but they love me enough to let me go.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been there when they met Devlin for the first time! Not exactly the son-in-law they had in mind. It was a dicey couple of days, I can tell you, but the bottom line was that they love me and so does he. They\u2019ve managed to build on that.\u201d</p><p>All that was nice, except Laurel\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t exactly the same as hers. \u201cAt least Devlin\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>Laurel\u2019s laugh had little to do with real humor. \u201cNot exactly. He\u2019s also decades older than I am.\u201d</p><p>Sasha was pretty sure the front door had just opened and closed. \u201cAt least you and Devlin have each other. With Larem, I have no idea where we\u2019re headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Sasha hesitated. \u201cA month ago that would\u2019ve been a simple question to answer. I wanted to be the first female Regent and make a difference in how Paladins are treated. Dad doesn\u2019t know this, but I dated a Paladin for a short time. He was a great guy, really special, but then they all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Laurel asked, although the shadows in the Handler\u2019s eyes said she already had a pretty good idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was killed and didn\u2019t make it all the way back. I didn\u2019t figure out that\u2019s what really happened until later, but the how didn\u2019t matter. Dead was dead.\u201d</p><p>Sasha grabbed a tissue from the nightstand. \u201cI swore then that I\u2019d do whatever I could to make sure we gave these amazing men the best of everything. And there has to be some way to stop losing them to the insanity, to save men like David. Like Trahern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a worthy goal to me. What\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would seem obvious. Most of the Regents are a bunch of old-school traditionalists at heart. Not only am I going to be a single parent, but the father is someone they\u2019d just as soon see dead or shoved back across the barrier. It could even affect my father\u2019s position if they want to get nasty about it.\u201d</p> <p>Laurel stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to them. No matter what they think, Larem\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Laurel. I don\u2019t have wild monkey sex with just anyone. I care about him.\u201d Honesty forced her to add, \u201cA lot. I\u2019ve already told Larem that if the Regents won\u2019t accept me, I\u2019ll leave the organization and stay here anyway.\u201d</p><p>She wadded up her tissue and tossed it at the waste-basket, smiling briefly when she hit it dead center. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one with decisions to make. I still don\u2019t know the story behind what brought Larem to our world. What if all he wants is to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Laurel said, shaking her head. \u201cNo way, not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want him to stay just because I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d She wanted him for herself, too.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you want him to stay for you,\u201d Laurel said, echoing Sasha\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>A soft knock at the door ended their chance for any more conversation. Sasha got up and opened the door.</p><p>Her heart fluttered in her chest. \u201cLarem, we were just talking about . . . things.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained stoic, but there was a gleam in his eye that warned her that he\u2019d heard at least the tail end of their conversation. \u201cI wanted to let you know that Devlin is going to take your father to a hotel so he can get some sleep after traveling all night.\u201d</p><p>Then there was a spark of mischief in his eyes. \u201cHe wanted to stay here, of course. However, I pointed out that since your guest room is full of boxes, and your bodyguard will be sleeping on the sofa, there is no room for him. Devlin was kind enough to offer him a ride after I pointed out the problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow considerate of both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we thought so.\u201d Then he looked past her to Laurel. \u201cDevlin said he\u2019s ready to leave when you are.\u201d</p><p>Laurel replied, \u201cTell him I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Before he could leave, Sasha caught him by the arm. \u201cSo will you be staying?\u201d</p><p>Larem\u2019s expression turned solemn. \u201cIt is my duty and my honor to protect you, unless you would prefer someone else.\u201d</p><p>They were both talking about more than just a few hours of patrolling her condo, and she knew it. \u201cI only want you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and then stood back to let Laurel pass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go say good-bye to my father. Maybe we can take him out for a nice dinner tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell him about me, about us, about everything,\u201d he said, his gaze briefly dropping down to her stomach before returning to her face, \u201cit would be better done in private.\u201d</p><p>What could she say to that? He was right, of course, but she couldn\u2019t find the words to respond. All trace of softness disappeared from his eyes. Once again, she\u2019d hurt him without meaning to.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cPerhaps you should ask Devlin for a different guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just thinking that you\u2019re right about talking to my father here instead. Once they all leave, we\u2019ll figure out what to say\u2014together.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her shoulders to ease the knots of tension forming there. \u201cGod, this is going to be so much harder than when I was sixteen and had to tell him I\u2019d wrecked his brand-new car. At least he can\u2019t ground me for a month like he did back then. He might try to take a swing at you, though.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quick hug. \u201cFor the sake of family peace and since he\u2019s your father, I promise I won\u2019t hit back.\u201d</p><p>She laughed despite the lump in her throat. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got that settled, let\u2019s go say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Chaz Willis stood by the front door with barely disguised fury at being the one to leave. Larem trailed down the hall beside Sasha but positioned himself in front of her and slightly to the side to make sure that no one had a clear shot at her when the door opened. He suspected her father thought Larem was trying to protect her from him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo, Sasha, do I have to have your bodyguard\u2019s permission to hug my own daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d She stepped past Larem to give her father a quick embrace. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have you back for dinner tonight. Say, six o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Larem winced inwardly. Sasha probably didn\u2019t mean anything by her use of the word \u201cwe,\u201d but her father certainly picked up on it.</p><p>Chaz\u2019s hands balled up into fists. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>He might have answered his daughter, but the look he shot in Larem\u2019s direction conveyed far more than a simple acceptance of a dinner invitation.</p><p>To make sure that they were both on the same page, Larem gave the older man a cold smile. \u201cAs will I, Mr. Willis. I look forward to seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Mr. Jones, no offense, but I\u2019d prefer to have dinner alone with my daughter. She\u2019ll be safe enough with me, especially with the guards outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible. As her bodyguard, I plan to remain in very close proximity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother.\u201d Sasha stepped between the two of them. \u201cLarem, Dad\u2014both of you\u2014that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Devlin cleared his throat. \u201cLook, we should be going. Larem, call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Larem stood back and held on to Chance\u2019s collar as they all filed out. The big dog had inexplicably taken a liking to Sasha\u2019s father, a feeling that wasn\u2019t at all mutual. The man had been trying to brush a layer of white hair off his pants as he walked out the door.</p><p>Now that everyone was gone, a strained silence settled over the room, but at least they were alone.</p><p>He and Sasha had a lot of ground to cover before her father returned. They certainly hadn\u2019t done much talking during the night, but they\u2019d communicated in other ways. Never had he experienced something quite as sweet as holding Sasha Willis by his side. Making love to her had soothed his soul.</p><p>Larem watched Devlin\u2019s car disappear down the street, with Chance at his side. Sasha had disappeared into the kitchen. If he had to guess, she was making a pot of tea. Maybe she needed a few minutes to gather her thoughts. If she didn\u2019t come out soon, he\u2019d check on her.</p><p>A short time later, she returned carrying a tray with a teapot and two mugs. He crossed the room to take it from her, setting it down on the coffee table. Chance stretched out in front of the door and closed his eyes, leaving them to fill in the silence on their own.</p><p>She looked frustrated.</p><p>\u201cSasha, say what you need to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, all of this is difficult enough without you deliberately provoking my father.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself a cup of tea and took a seat at the far end of the couch. He sat down on the opposite end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to do better, but there\u2019s not much about me that is going to make him happy. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be true, at least at first, but there\u2019s no use making a bad situation worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll try.\u201d He sipped his tea. \u201cWhat else is on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here. Not here in the condo, but here in this world.\u201d She angled her head to look him straight in the eye. \u201cNo one wanted to explain, saying it was your story to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>As she listened, he poured out the whole tale. About serving as Lusahn\u2019s Blademate. About how Cullen Finley crossing into their world had changed everything. About the betrayals that would have ended with Larem\u2019s execution if he\u2019d refused to follow Lusahn and her Paladin lover into this world.</p><p>\u201cYou loved her. Lusahn, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He considered the idea. \u201cI thought I did, but now I don\u2019t think so. Not really, more that I liked the idea of being in love with her. For sure, Lusahn never felt anything beyond friendship for me. You only had to see her with Cullen once to know that he had claimed her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it must have been hard for you to lose everything because of them. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not bitter.\u201d</p><p>Hard didn\u2019t even come close to describing his rage over his life being shattered by the selfish actions of others. If Lonzo hadn\u2019t offered Larem both a home and his friendship, Larem didn\u2019t know how he would\u2019ve survived those first few weeks. It wasn\u2019t until Hunter Fitzsimon had allowed Larem to serve at his side, hunting the traitors who had betrayed both their worlds, that he\u2019d found a renewed sense of purpose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same man I was then.\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d lost everything when he\u2019d been dragged into this world. But now, with this woman and the child they\u2019d created, he realized he\u2019d been wrong. Nothing he\u2019d left behind came close to what he stood to lose if something happened to Sasha.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking pretty fierce there, Larem. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what happened yesterday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done about it now. The police will let us know when they find the guy.\u201d</p><p>Larem didn\u2019t want the authorities to get their hands on her attacker\u2014he didn\u2019t want the culprit behind bars. No, he wanted the bastard where he could watch him die slowly and painfully.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of going after him yourself.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to respond. Any warrior worthy of the title would insist on avenging his woman.</p> <p>Sasha knew it, too. It was there in the frown lines bracketing her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe Dad\u2019s right. I should meet with him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Although he suspected he knew. She wanted to make plans for her future, one that didn\u2019t necessarily involve him.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s going to be hurt and angry, and you don\u2019t need to be here for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>Sasha stared down at her cup. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve already done enough, and it\u2019s not your problem.\u201d</p><p>He set his own cup down hard enough to slosh tea onto the table. He ignored the mess. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, her dark eyes came up to meet his. \u201cIt means I like you too much to tangle you up in my life any more than you already are. I may have to tell Dad that I\u2019m pregnant, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to tell him who the father is.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cAnd you think he won\u2019t be able to guess? And after everything we\u2019ve been through . . . after last night and this morning . . .\u201d It took all he had to ask the question. \u201cAre you going to deny me my child?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Chance barked softly and then growled down low in his chest. He moved away from the door, dividing his attention between it and the windows. Larem stood up and reached for his gun.</p><p>\u201cSasha, get down behind the kitchen counter and stay there until I say otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke, he pulled out his cell and dialed the number Devlin had given him for the guards outside. No answer. He tried the Paladin leader\u2019s number next.</p><p>\u201cDev, something\u2019s going on. Chance is sensing danger, and the guards aren\u2019t answering their phones.\u201d</p><p>But any help Devlin might send was going to be too late. The front door took a heavy blow at the same time the window shattered. Two canisters of gas hit the living room floor and started spraying smoke into the air.</p><p>Larem shoved the phone back in his pocket and ran for the kitchen. The air in the living room was already growing hazy enough to make breathing hard.</p><p>Sasha was crouched down near the floor. \u201cLarem, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He quickly considered their options, which were damn few and none of them good. Whoever was after them had to be pretty desperate to attack in broad daylight.</p><p>\u201cWhere does the side door in the garage lead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA sidewalk to the alley behind the building.\u201d</p><p>That was their best option. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Crawl to the door. The air is safer down low.\u201d</p><p>He let Sasha go first as he called the dog.</p><p>\u201cChance, come!\u201d</p><p>The dog backed toward Larem, never once taking his eyes off the front door, his hackles up and his teeth bared. The door gave way just as Sasha disappeared into the garage, and two men charged inside already shooting. A burning pain shot up Larem\u2019s left arm as he stood up and fired at the first guy, hitting him three times, while Chance leaped up to grab the second shooter\u2019s gun arm. The guy screamed as the dog savaged his wrist.</p><p>Larem\u2019s target dropped to the floor choking on his own blood while his companion tried without success to fight off Chance\u2019s attack. Larem stripped off the dying man\u2019s gas mask to cover his own face. The man no longer needed it.</p><p>Deciding the dog had done enough damage, Larem grabbed Chance by the collar and hauled him off the shooter. He kicked the injured man\u2019s gun out of reach and then dragged him into the kitchen where the air was slightly clearer. Stripping the guy\u2019s mask off, Larem pressed the barrel of his automatic against the guy\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow many are out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, Other,\u201d his prisoner choked out. \u201cYou and the other freaks are already dead. You just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>Larem leaned in close. \u201cThat may be, but I\u2019m betting you\u2019ll be there before me.\u201d</p><p>Then he shot the floor right next to the cringing fool\u2019s head, sneering when the guy screamed as if he\u2019d been hit. \u201cTell your friends that Kalith warriors defend their own.\u201d</p><p>Larem ran for the door with Chance hot on his heels. Sasha stood near the door, holding the handle of a rake like a ball bat, ready to defend herself. It wouldn\u2019t have done much against a bullet, but he loved her warrior spirit, loved her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She backed toward the door, keeping her eyes on the kitchen. \u201cAre they dead?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in lying to her. \u201cOne is. The other is chewed up but still breathing.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the side door and peeked outside. If there was anyone waiting out there, he couldn\u2019t sense them. He could, however, hear sirens approaching.</p><p>\u201cSomeone called the police. We need to get out of here before they arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not wait for them?\u201d she asked, but she followed him out anyway.</p><p>\u201cBecause right now we don\u2019t know who we can trust. I promised to protect you and our child, and I will.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the gas mask into a trash bin in the alley as they cut between a couple of buildings to the street on the far side. At the end of the alley, Larem stopped to think. His arm would be of little use if they ran into more attackers. At least he was wearing a dark shirt, so the blood wouldn\u2019t be immediately obvious to anyone who saw them.</p><p>For now, they were in the clear.</p><p>Sasha appreciated the chance to catch her breath, but why were they standing there so long? If Larem wanted to avoid the police, shouldn\u2019t they be putting a lot more distance between themselves and the condo?</p><p>\u201cLarem, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>When she looked at him, waiting for his answer, he was using the hem of his shirt to wipe away a trickle of blood running down his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been shot!\u201d</p><p>He winced in pain as he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just a graze. We\u2019ll go to the animal shelter. The vet will help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a hospital. Or at least let me get you to Laurel\u2019s lab.\u201d</p><p>Larem was already shaking his head. \u201cCan\u2019t risk a human hospital getting a look at my blood, and I don\u2019t trust the guards. We\u2019d have to get past them to reach Laurel.\u201d</p><p>There was no time to argue. \u201cAll right, but let\u2019s get moving then.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he tucked his gun in the back of his jeans. As they started down the street, she let him set the pace. As tempting as it was to run, walking would draw less attention even if it left her feeling exposed. Chance brought up the rear but stayed close.</p><p>Finally, Larem stopped outside a heavy door in an alley and rang the bell. A few seconds later a white-haired man in a lab coat opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed.\u201d Then he spotted Larem. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Did you forget your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, I need your help.\u201d Larem held up his bloody hand.</p><p>The vet\u2019s bright blue eyes widened in surprise. He stepped back and motioned them inside. \u201cCome in and let me take a look at it.\u201d</p><p>He managed a small smile for Sasha. \u201cYou must be Sasha. I\u2019m Dr. Isaac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Although the circumstances seriously sucked.</p><p>Chance butted the vet\u2019s hand, startling a laugh out of him as he slipped the dog a treat. \u201cAnd Chance, I certainly didn\u2019t expect to see you back so soon. Let\u2019s go see if your friend is a better patient than you were.\u201d</p><p>Larem was waiting in the closest examination room. Sasha hurried forward to help him remove his shirt. The fabric was slick with blood, and his white T-shirt underneath hadn\u2019t fared much better.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a washer and dryer down the hall that you can use after we get him stitched up.\u201d</p><p>Then Dr. Isaac peered at her over the glasses perched low on his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a bit shaky, so do me a favor and sit down. Were you hurt, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just Larem. That\u2019s bad enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said as he started gathering supplies.</p><p>Larem reached out to catch the vet by his arm. \u201cDoc, I\u2019m sorry to have brought troubles to your door, but I didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, son. What are friends for if not to help out in times of trouble?\u201d He pulled on a pair of surgical gloves. \u201cNow sit down and let me get this cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>When he started to fill a syringe, Larem stopped him. \u201cRegular pain medicine doesn\u2019t work for me, Doc. Just stitch it up.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Isaac looked puzzled. \u201cWhy? Do you have allergies?\u201d</p><p>Larem met Sasha\u2019s gaze with a small shrug. \u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not originally from this world and don\u2019t always react well to human medication.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The vet froze briefly and then nodded, a broad smile lighting up his face. \u201cWell, that certainly explains a lot. Okay, so we\u2019ll do this the hard way. Brace yourself because this is going to hurt like hell.\u201d</p><p>Sasha couldn\u2019t stand to see Larem hurting and not try to do something. Maybe a distraction would help. She wheeled her chair over closer to his and took his other hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about names yet. What do you think of Ella for a girl?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Isaac\u2019s bushy eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he continued working as Larem kept his eyes trained on Sasha\u2019s face. \u201cThat sounds almost like my mother\u2019s name, although in Kalithia we would put the emphasis on the last half of the word. Eh-lah.\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cThen that one goes to the top of the list. How about if we have a boy?\u201d</p><p>Despite how much he was hurting, Larem shot her an impish grin. \u201cIf it would help your father accept me, perhaps we should name our son after him.\u201d</p><p>Perish the thought. \u201cNo way. One Chaz in the family is more than enough,\u201d she said, studying the vet\u2019s name tag.</p><p>Obviously the man and Larem were close friends, probably the only one Larem had outside of the Paladins. She liked the way the man had accepted Larem\u2019s explanation with such ease and offered his help without hesitation. Friendships like that were rare.</p><p>\u201cHey, how about Isaac? I\u2019ve always liked that name.\u201d</p> <p>Her lover didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIsaac would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Larem looked as pleased as his elderly friend did. The vet snipped one last thread and winked at Sasha as he applied a bandage to cover the wound. \u201cYou might want to hold off on that decision until you get my bill.\u201d</p><p>She tried to laugh\u2014she really did\u2014but instead, tears started streaming down her face as the combination of terror and fear for what might happen next broke through her last bit of control. Nothing like big gulping sobs to panic two grown men.</p><p>Larem jumped to his feet and pulled Sasha into his arms while Dr. Isaac pressed his handkerchief into her hand.</p><p>The vet then stammered, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll leave you two alone and go see if Chance needs food or water or something.\u201d</p><p>Nodding to his friend, Larem rubbed his hand up and down Sasha\u2019s back in soothing strokes. \u201cLet it all out, Sasha, but remember that I\u2019m all right, you\u2019re all right, and Chance is out there happily pigging out.\u201d</p> <p>The storm was intense but brief. Already the tears were slowing down. Still, he held her close as if needing the comfort as much as she did. Finally, she sighed and wiped her face dry.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I swear, I\u2019ve never cried as much as I have in the past few days.\u201d She even mustered up a brave smile. \u201cSo what do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe call Devlin.\u201d</p><p>He fumbled for his cell phone, wincing a bit as he kept his good arm around Sasha and used his injured one. He punched in Devlin\u2019s number.</p><p>The Paladin answered on the first ring. \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe for now. Send Lonzo to pick us up where I do volunteer work. He\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods that the Paladin leader was the sort to remain calm, at least until the battle was over. There was more he should know.</p><p>\u201cDevlin, the two who attacked the condo had to be guards. The one that I left alive said all my kind were dead even if we didn\u2019t know it yet. I want only men I can trust to protect Sasha and Mr. Willis while we deal with this. Warn Barak and Cullen. Get Lacey, Lusahn, and the kids someplace safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s this world coming to?\u201d Devlin obviously didn\u2019t expect an answer because he kept right on talking. \u201cI\u2019ll have the guys round up all the guards here at headquarters and throw the bastards in a locked room until we have time to sort them out.\u201d</p><p>Larem liked the way Devlin thought. \u201cOn our way in we\u2019ll stop and pick up Sasha\u2019s father. He should be in on what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll call and give him a heads-up, but hurry. As long as you two are out there, you\u2019re both targets.\u201d</p><p>When Larem hung up, Sasha looked bewildered. \u201cThey were guards? Why would they attack you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey obviously hate all Kalith, but that doesn\u2019t explain why they waited to come after me at your place. They could\u2019ve killed me anytime without drawing so much attention to themselves or risking injury to the daughter of a Regent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m the real target? Something I\u2019ve done has set them off.\u201d</p><p>The explanation felt right. \u201cI\u2019d guess it\u2019s a combination of things. From what I\u2019ve been told, once Kincade took over, there was always tension between the guards and the Paladins here in Seattle. It all started when one of them went rogue and tried to kill Laurel after Barak crossed over into this world. Then Cullen compounded the problem when he returned with Lusahn and her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd me. Most likely the guards feel betrayed that the Paladins have accepted us as friends but not them.\u201d</p><p>Sasha sighed. \u201cAnd then here I come, making it clear that my first priority is making things better for the Paladins, to correct the wrongs committed by Colonel Kincade. Despite how he treated the Paladins, he obviously still has loyal followers among the guards.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Isaac stuck his head back in. \u201cLarem, come quick. Someone is at the back door.\u201d</p><p>Larem drew his gun. \u201cIt\u2019s probably my roommate, but just in case, you two stay here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Chance trailed along behind him, obviously thinking Larem needed backup. Rather than risk opening the door for the wrong person, Larem shouted, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the damned Tooth Fairy and his sidekick, the Easter Bunny. Now let us in.\u201d</p><p>Larem didn\u2019t know who the Tooth Fairy was, but he did know his roommate\u2019s voice and opened the door. Lonzo hadn\u2019t come alone, either. Hunter was right behind him, and both were heavily armed.</p><p>Larem stood back and motioned for them to come inside. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>As both men crossed the threshold, they came face-to-face with Chance. The dog eyed the two Paladins and woofed softly.</p><p>Larem patted the dog on the head. \u201cThey\u2019re okay, boy.\u201d</p><p>Chance immediately wagged his tail and sniffed the hand Lonzo held out. \u201cDamn, Larem, he\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a helluva guard dog. He not only gave us enough warning to stop those guys from killing us, but he took one out himself.\u201d He dropped his voice, not wanting Sasha to hear any more bad news. \u201cHow are the Paladins Devlin had watching the condo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged and a little roughed up. They\u2019ll be okay, so no problem there.\u201d Hunter looked around. \u201cHow\u2019s Sasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaken up. Scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd able to answer for herself.\u201d The woman in question walked up beside him and held out a clean shirt. \u201cDr. Isaac said this probably won\u2019t fit, but it\u2019s the best he could come up with.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, guys,\u201d Sasha added as she matter-of-factly helped Larem ease the shirtsleeve up over his wound.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lonzo eyed the bandage. \u201cLooks like you took one for the team. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be when we catch the bastards behind these attacks.\u201d</p><p>Larem rolled his shoulders and lifted his arm, testing its mobility. The pain was already starting to fade as his healing ability kicked in.</p><p>\u201cDevlin has Cullen and D.J. tracking the guards through their e-mail accounts to see if we can pick out the culprits. Penn and Craig are manning the alley so we can get you and Sasha into the building safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>While they were talking, Sasha looped her arm through Larem\u2019s and rested her head against him. Lonzo\u2019s eyebrows shot up, but then he grinned.</p><p>She smiled back at him and then asked, \u201cHow about my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Devlin we\u2019d pick him up on the way. Speaking of which, we\u2019d better get a move on.\u201d Then Larem gave her a quick hug. \u201cSasha, can you tell Doc we\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>All three men watched until she\u2019d disappeared into one of the exam rooms. Hunter punched Larem lightly on his good arm.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and the boss lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me and her.\u201d Then softly he added, \u201cAnd a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Lonzo stumbled back a step. \u201cOkay, I so didn\u2019t see that one coming. How in the world did that happen?\u201d He slapped his forehead. \u201cWait, forget I asked that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter just grinned. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><p>Then his eyes flicked past Larem in warning that Sasha was on her way back. \u201cI guess now\u2019s not the time to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if anything happens to me . . .\u201d</p><p>The good-humored Paladins disappeared, replaced by two of the deadliest warriors on the planet. Hunter\u2019s voice thickened with emotion, making it sound even rougher than normal. \u201cYou know we will. Now let\u2019s go get the bastards.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 20</p><p>Under other circumstances, Sasha might have opted for more discretion when it came to the nature of her relationship with Larem, especially in front of his buddies. Things would\u2019ve been too new, too unsettled for her to be completely comfortable with their openly acting like a couple in front of the rest of the Seattle contingent.</p><p>However, there was something about almost dying three times in the past few weeks that shattered all need for caution. She might not know how things would play out for the two of them, but not for one second did she want Larem to doubt that he was important to her.</p><p>She watched as he quickly checked his gun. Lonzo and Hunter did the same, the motions clearly second nature to all three of them. Just as they were about to leave the examination room, Larem\u2019s cell rang. Everyone froze and waited, the tension in the room immediately ratcheting up.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s up?\u201d He listened for several seconds without saying a word. \u201cWe\u2019ll check it out.\u201d</p><p>When he hung up, Sasha asked, \u201cLarem, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His expression was grim. \u201cThat was Devlin. He hasn\u2019t been able to reach your father. He\u2019s not answering his cell or the phone in his hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Sasha dug her nails into her palms, trying to stay calm. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ve taken him? And don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Larem\u2019s answer was terrifying in its stark simplicity.</p> <p>They started toward the door again, only to have their plans interrupted again with the sound of a phone ringing, this time Sasha\u2019s. She checked the number on the screen and should\u2019ve been relieved. She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>Larem caught her hand before she could answer. \u201cPut it on speakerphone.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and did as he said. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha, run! Get the hell out of there!\u201d</p><p>There were horrifying sounds of a struggle followed by a brief silence and then a different voice came on the line.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Willis, listen and listen carefully if you want to see your father again. Especially if you want to see him alive.\u201d</p><p>Fear and fury had her gripping the phone hard enough to break it. She forced her hand to relax, wishing she had the same control over her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but if you hurt my father, you\u2019re dead. The Regents will authorize whatever it takes to hunt you down, along with anyone stupid enough to follow your orders. There isn\u2019t a place in this world or any other one where you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, Miss Willis. Threats will get you nowhere. I want Kincade\u2019s account numbers, and I want the money you\u2019ve stolen from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat money wasn\u2019t his to begin with, and it definitely isn\u2019t yours.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that wasn\u2019t the smartest thing she could\u2019ve said, but Lonzo was making circles in the air, telling her to keep talking. Was he having the call traced?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t seriously think I give a rat\u2019s ass where he got the money. Kincade owes me for a couple of jobs I did for him and I have a rule about that. People who don\u2019t pay me end up dead, just like the targets they sent me after.\u201d</p><p>The cold pride in his voice was nauseating. \u201cI get paid top dollar for what I do. I suspect you don\u2019t approve, but I\u2019m really just a businessman with a specific skill set, one that happens to be in big demand lately. If it makes you feel better, I\u2019m planning to retire as soon as I collect my pay, although I plan to do the world a favor before I disappear. Free of charge, too.\u201d</p> <p>She hated encouraging the bastard, but keeping him on the line might help rescue her father. \u201cAnd what favor would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to rid our world of that pale-eyed monstrosity who\u2019s probably standing right next to you. Just the thought of him walking the streets of Seattle as if he owns the place, passing for one of us and screwing human women, makes me sick. Who knows, if I get lucky, I might even take out a few of his mutant buddies, too\u2014preferably while you watch.\u201d</p><p>Then he laughed. \u201cOops! Sorry, Miss Willis, I\u2019m guessing from your father\u2019s reaction he just now realized your boyfriend is Kalith. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s happy to learn his daughter has been fucking an alien. Sorry if I let the cat out of the bag.\u201d</p><p>The humor in his voice disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes to get the account numbers for me.\u201d</p><p>Then the line went dead.</p><p>Hunter looked at Lonzo. \u201cTell me D.J. was able to track the bastard?\u201d</p><p>Lonzo nodded and started cussing. \u201cDamn it, he\u2019s right outside!\u201d</p><p>Before she had time to absorb the implications, a ruckus broke out at both ends of the cavernous warehouse that housed the clinic. All three men immediately pointed their weapons at the examination room door.</p><p>Then the phone rang again. Larem took it from her hand. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the woman back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to deal with me if you want those numbers.\u201d</p><p>There was another nasty laugh. \u201cFine. It\u2019s your funeral\u2014literally. Come out unarmed or Willis and the vet die. You\u2019ve got three minutes until I start shooting. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Larem disconnected the call and then gently pushed Sasha back toward Hunter. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t know you and Lonzo are here. Keep her safe while I distract him. Tell Devlin to send backup.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo held up his phone. \u201cAlready did. ETA is ten minutes. They may not make it in time.\u201d</p><p>Sasha broke free from Hunter\u2019s grasp. \u201cLarem, wait! Can\u2019t we hold them off that long?\u201d</p><p>He backed away, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll try to buy enough time for reinforcements to arrive. They already have your father. I won\u2019t let them hurt him or Dr. Isaac because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave up trying to explain and settled for throwing herself into his arms. Larem held her close and kissed her. Then she cupped his handsome face with her hands, memorizing the moment.</p><p>\u201cGo, but be careful. I need you. We need you.\u201d</p><p>Before he could back away, she added, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips across hers one last time. \u201cSasha Willis, you hold my heart. Make sure our child knows I loved\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sasha covered his mouth with her fingers. \u201cI have faith in you. We\u2019re going to get through this, Larem q\u2019Jones.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but the regret in his eyes made it clear he had his doubts. He handed his gun to Lonzo and started for the door.</p><p>Lonzo and Hunter immediately moved to stop him. Hunter whispered low enough so that his words would\u2019ve been inaudible to human ears.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, partner. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>It was a warrior\u2019s question, so Larem gave his friends a warrior\u2019s answer. \u201cI will free Chaz Willis and Dr. Isaac and kill any of the bastards that get in the way.\u201d</p><p>The Paladins nodded in approval. \u201cWhat\u2019s the layout of this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room on the left is another examination room and has a door to the dog runs outside just like this one.\u201d He pulled his keys out of his pocket and handed them to Lonzo. \u201cThe big one will get you in that door. Maybe you can flank them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it my best shot.\u201d</p><p>Larem continued his description of the clinic. \u201cAcross on the right are the kennels, and beyond that is the surgical suite. The swinging doors at the far end lead to the lobby, which has the only other door out to the street. If this guy has any brains at all, he\u2019ll have someone covering it. He won\u2019t want to be trapped without a way out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chance bumped up against his leg. He patted the big dog on the head. \u201cStay with Sasha, boy.\u201d He looked toward Hunter. \u201cIf things turn ugly, get Sasha out of here even if you have to climb the fence of the dog run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Hunter held out his hand. \u201cWatch your back.\u201d</p><p>Larem looked past the Paladin to where Sasha stood, her face pale with fear. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Lonzo was ready to slip outside into the dog run, hoping the enemy would be too focused on Larem to notice the sound of the second door opening and closing.</p><p>Out in the clinic, the scene was pretty much as he expected. He did a quick head count. There was at least one man stationed at each of the two exits. Chaz Willis was kneeling on the floor next to Dr. Isaac. Duke held a gun to Sasha\u2019s father\u2019s head. No surprise there. Another older man stood off to the side, looking awfully unhappy about being there even though he was also armed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to pick the leader out. Although he didn\u2019t know the guard\u2019s name, he was all too familiar. He\u2019d been the one who\u2019d started yelling that Larem was an escaped Other, inciting one of the other guards to go on the attack that day by the elevator.</p><p>He acknowledged the bastard with a brief nod. \u201cWe meet again, although I never caught your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty.\u201d The guard smiled, looking pleased. \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget my enemies.\u201d Larem returned the smile. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve buried them.\u201d</p><p>Rusty\u2019s smile faltered only briefly. After all, he had the advantage and knew it. He glanced toward his nameless companion. \u201cSo where\u2019s the bitch? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be excited to know her beloved Uncle George has joined us.\u201d</p><p>The man in question flushed bright red. \u201cShut up, Rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to find out anyway.\u201d</p><p>Rusty obviously enjoyed outing his partner in crime. \u201cSeems George here has a bit of a gambling problem, which is how Kincade got his hooks into him in the first place. As a Regent, he\u2019s been feeding the colonel inside information for years, not to mention helping the man hide his tracks. But now that the money stream has dried up, he\u2019s hurting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn it, Rusty, I told you to shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You didn\u2019t want her to find out that you ordered the hit on her? Sorry, my bad.\u201d Rusty turned his attention back to Larem. \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth. Seems he hasn\u2019t been at all happy about Sasha letting her hackers siphon money back out of his accounts.\u201d</p><p>Chaz flinched and then shot the other Regent a look that promised retribution. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this, George.\u201d</p><p>Rusty waved his gun in the direction of the exam room. \u201cTell her to get out here and join the family reunion. She\u2019d better have the numbers I need. She can use my laptop to transfer the funds.\u201d He pointed toward the computer sitting on the exam table.</p> <p>Yeah, like Larem was going to let that happen. \u201cHere\u2019s our counteroffer: if you and your men leave now, she\u2019ll order the money you want transferred to your accounts.\u201d</p><p>Rusty fired a shot at the ceiling, causing everyone to flinch.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? No way am I walking out of here without that money. Either she comes out now or I start shooting for real, starting with her father and then you. I figure that this old man only matters to you, so maybe I\u2019ll shoot him now just for grins.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Isaac straightened his shoulders. He might be about to die, but the man wasn\u2019t going to beg for his life. Larem met his friend\u2019s gaze and nodded, hoping he understood the unspoken message of how much he honored and cherished their friendship.</p><p>A movement caught Larem\u2019s eye. Hunter waved at him from the small window in the swinging doors at the far end of the room. The Paladin had regained control of the lobby. Good, but then where was Sasha?</p> <p>Unfortunately she answered that question for him when the door to the exam room behind him opened. Her voice rang out across the room, sounding calm and collected.</p><p>\u201cLower your gun, Rusty. I\u2019ll get your money for you. But if you shoot anyone, the deal\u2019s off. My hacker buddies can make it disappear just as fast.\u201d</p><p>Larem wanted to throttle her for risking herself and their child, but he should\u2019ve known she wouldn\u2019t cower in a corner if her loved ones were threatened. When she stood in front of him, he started to push her to the side when he realized that she\u2019d tucked his gun into the back of her waistband.</p><p>He retrieved the gun, careful to keep it behind her back as he moved to stand beside her.</p><p>She whispered \u201cLonzo\u201d under her breath before continuing her dialogue with Rusty. She held up a small piece of paper. \u201cHere are the routing numbers you\u2019ll need to collect the money.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked around the room. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like nearly enough to pay off all your men. After all, being on the run for the rest of your lives will be expensive, especially when there are five of you.\u201d</p> <p>Clever woman! Now both Hunter and Lonzo knew exactly how many they were up against.</p><p>Rusty glared at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about my men getting paid.\u201d</p><p>The reason for that was obvious: he had no intention of sharing the money. Larem didn\u2019t know about the other guards, but Duke was definitely looking suspicious.</p><p>\u201cGive me the numbers and we\u2019ll finish this.\u201d</p><p>Sasha started forward holding the paper out, but then she deliberately stumbled and fell flat to the floor. At the same time, the door to the second exam room opened and Lonzo came flying out. He got off three shots, taking out the guard by the back door, Duke, and finally Sasha\u2019s godfather before Rusty returned fire. Sasha screamed when the Paladin flew back against the wall and landed in a crumpled heap as a blossom of blood spread across the front of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cSasha, stay down!\u201d Larem shouted.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rusty looked behind him and realized his escape route was blocked. His eyes crazed, he grabbed Chaz by the hair and hauled him to his feet.</p><p>George managed to get back up on his feet and staggered toward Rusty. \u201cDon\u2019t leave without me!\u201d</p> <p>Rusty\u2019s only answer was a bullet that hit the Regent high in the chest, sending him flailing backward to land broken and bloody on the floor.</p><p>The rogue guard kept moving toward the exit, dragging Chaz with him. \u201cShoot me and he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to hear him over Duke\u2019s moans as the man tried to stanch the blood pouring out of his arm. It didn\u2019t matter because there was no mistaking Rusty\u2019s intent. He shoved the barrel of his gun against the older man\u2019s temple and backed toward the alley door.</p><p>Larem kept his own gun aimed at Rusty\u2019s head but was afraid to take the shot. If Rusty moved at the wrong moment, the bullet could hit Chaz instead.</p><p>\u201cLet him go and I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>Rusty was already shaking his head. \u201cNo way I\u2019m trading a Regent as a hostage for a worthless piece of shit like you, Other. Now get the hell out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Before he could drag the terrified Regent more than a handful of steps, Chance charged out of the exam room in a blur of white. The movement distracted Rusty long enough for Larem to make his move. The guard\u2019s gun went off just as the dog latched on to the back of his calf and bit down with all his might.</p><p>Larem\u2019s momentum combined with the dog\u2019s, slamming Rusty to the floor. Chaz managed to roll out of the way, leaving Larem and Chance struggling to subdue the guard before he could pull the trigger again. Larem clamped down on Rusty\u2019s throat with one hand and squeezed, but the bastard managed to get off one more shot before Larem could pin down his gun hand. Chance yelped and fell to the side, his white fur splashed with red. Larem bellowed in fury and cold-cocked the bastard with the butt of his gun.</p><p>Then he crawled over to the dog, calling on the gods to help him. \u201cPlease, give me the strength!\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hands on Chance\u2019s shoulder and prayed as he\u2019d never prayed before. The lights overhead faded and flickered as he drained every ounce of energy he could from them. As he stared at his bloody fingers, they took on a golden glow. Warmth and healing poured out of him and into his friend.</p><p>Almost immediately, Chance whined softly and his tail thumped the floor. The bleeding from the deep gash across the dog\u2019s shoulder gradually slowed and then stopped altogether. Already the wound was closing. Still Larem gave of himself, determined that his friend not suffer for his amazing act of bravery.</p><p>Finally, he had no more left to give. When he tried to look around for Sasha and his friends, he saw nothing but spots\u2014and then darkness.</p><p>Damn, Larem hated waking up on cold steel. But then, that probably meant that the good guys had saved the day and he was back in Laurel\u2019s lab.</p><p>He pried open his eyes to find out if he was right. As soon as he turned his head, he was greeted by a wet tongue and a blast of doggie breath.</p><p>\u201cGet down, dog.\u201d</p><p>Larem recognized Chaz Willis\u2019s voice and looked up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you resurfaced. Welcome back to the land of the living.\u201d Then the Regent smiled.</p><p>Surely not. Larem blinked to clear his vision, but Sasha\u2019s father really was standing over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevlin and his men arrived about thirty seconds after you saved the dog and the day. Sasha\u2019s fine, although Laurel ordered her to lie down and rest until you woke up. Lonzo is across the room, already on the mend. Both me and your friend Dr. Isaac are safe and sound. We have you to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Then Chaz\u2019s smile faded, to be replaced with the expression common to irate fathers everywhere.</p><p>\u201cSo about you and my daughter . . .\u201d</p><p>Did they have to do this now?</p><p>Larem\u2019s head was pounding, and he seriously doubted he could mount any kind of defense if her father decided to go on the attack. Even so, he gathered enough strength to sit up. Chaz even gave him a hand. Chance stood up on his hind legs and laid his head in Larem\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sasha and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make it clear that I still believe allowing you and the others to live in our world might be a major mistake. Up until now, the Paladins\u2019 mission has always been clear. Having you here only muddies the water. However, short of inciting a rebellion, there\u2019s not much I can do about the situation. What\u2019s done is done, and that\u2019s the recommendation I\u2019ll be taking back to the Board of Regents.\u201d</p><p>Obviously Chaz clearly had more to get off his chest. Larem waited him out.</p><p>\u201cSasha has worked long and hard to get where she is. She has a real shot at being the first Regent of her generation, and I think she deserves the job. But with you in the picture, that may not happen. She\u2019s already made her choice clear, but I want you to understand what she may be giving up for you.\u201d</p><p>It was time to rejoin the conversation. \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me anything that I don\u2019t already know. Sasha, too, for that matter. I might hate it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to slink off and hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. And I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure she gets the job. There\u2019s a lot to be done, not only here but in the organization as a whole.\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with pain. \u201cGeorge didn\u2019t make it, and his betrayal has sent shock waves throughout the organization. At least Rusty has been naming names, so Devlin has been able to start cleaning house. When the dust settles, Sasha will need to hire a bunch of new guards.\u201d</p><p>Chaz drew a deep breath and stared at Larem for several seconds as if choosing his next words carefully.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line. If you\u2019re the one who makes my daughter happy, there\u2019s not much I can do about it. If I were stupid enough to force her to choose, I\u2019m pretty sure I know which one of us would be on the losing end of that argument. I\u2019ve also spent my life working with Paladins. I\u2019ve learned to trust their judgment when it comes to matters of honor and duty. From what I\u2019ve been able to gather, the Seattle contingent claim you as one of their own. That\u2019s fine, but as far as the Regents are concerned, the jury is still out.\u201d</p><p>Even so, there was a strong hint of reluctant acceptance in Chaz\u2019s words.</p><p>Larem sat up straighter. \u201cI plan to marry your daughter if she\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Chaz looked resigned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019ll marry you all right.\u201d</p><p>What did he mean by that? \u201cI won\u2019t have you trying to force her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Regent actually laughed. \u201cSeriously, have you ever tried to force Sasha to do something she didn\u2019t want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like telling her to stay out of the line of fire at the vet clinic?\u201d That was going to give Larem nightmares for years.</p><p>\u201cExactly. She\u2019ll marry you because that\u2019s what she\u2019s made up her mind to do, even if you haven\u2019t asked her yet. By the way, I don\u2019t know how things are done in your world, but the men here like to do the proposing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the same in Kalithia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen better ask her sooner rather than later, or she\u2019s likely to steal your thunder.\u201d Chaz looked toward the door. \u201cAnd here\u2019s your opportunity. Before she runs me off, thank you again for my daughter\u2019s life, Larem.\u201d</p><p>Then he snagged Chance\u2019s collar. \u201cCome on, dog. You\u2019ve shed enough in here.\u201d</p><p>Sasha kissed her dad on the cheek and gave Chance a quick hug as they passed her on their way out. What had her dad been saying to Larem? She\u2019d told her father everything that had happened. He\u2019d taken it all pretty well, including the fact that Larem was Kalith and that Sasha loved him enough to give up her career with the Regents if necessary. He was still reeling from the news that he was going to be a grandfather.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure either of them would get over her godfather\u2019s betrayal anytime soon. He\u2019d been such a huge part of her world, and his absence would leave a big hole in her life. That he\u2019d been behind the attacks on her was almost unimaginable. An investigation had already been launched, and only time would tell how many more heads would roll.</p><p>But right now, she had more important things on her mind. Namely, the handsome man sitting on a cold stainless steel table. God, she loved him so much. Those beautiful pale gray eyes that spoke so eloquently even when his expression was so solemn. Right now, they looked at her with an intensity she could feel in her bones.</p> <p>\u201cLarem, please tell me my dad wasn\u2019t being a pain.\u201d</p><p>He reached out for her, spreading his knees wide so she could cuddle in close with her head against his chest and her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, he offered me some sound advice.\u201d</p><p>There was definitely a hint of laughter in her lover\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should hurry up and ask you to marry me before you got it in your head to propose first.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed hot, partially because her father was interfering and partially because he\u2019d been right on the money. Before they crossed that line, though, she had questions of her own to ask.</p> <p>\u201cI still plan to apply for the job as Regent. Can you live with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The Paladins need what you can do for them. Can you live with the knowledge that there will always be people who hate me for what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s their problem, not ours. If we do this, you know you\u2019ll have to give up your world for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Larem crooked his finger and used it to tilt her chin up. He looked deep into her eyes and beyond. \u201cSasha Willis, don\u2019t you know that you and our child are my world? Marry me?\u201d</p><p>The man sure knew all the right answers. But then, so did she. \u201cYou bet I will.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked up into a smile and she melted into him. Then she kissed him to seal the deal.</p><p>Turn the page</p> <p>for a special look</p><p>at the next irresistible Paladins novel</p><p>from</p><p>Alexis Morgan</p><p>The Darkness Beyond</p><p>Coming soon from Pocket Star</p><p>D.J. bent low and started forward, his gun in one hand, sword in the other. The blade would be his first choice of weapons, but he couldn\u2019t risk the Other getting the upper hand with Reggie depending on D.J. to rescue her.</p><p>The Other rose up to look around. Had the guy decided that he\u2019d only been imagining someone dogging his footsteps? Maybe, because after ducking down briefly, the Other stood again to stare up the trail. After a few seconds, he started forward, his sword at the ready. D.J.\u2019s prey moved slowly, his head sweeping from side to side, testing the night air and hunting using his sense of smell.</p><p>It was easy to know the instant the male picked up D.J.\u2019s scent. The Other froze in midstep, slowly bringing his sword up into attack position. From where D.J. stood, he could take the Other out with a single shot. Tempting as it was, D.J. holstered his gun and followed the Kalith, Larem\u2019s sword in his hand.</p><p>He was able to get surprisingly close before the guy realized he was no longer alone. He\u2019d started backing up, only to realize that his prey stood right behind him.</p><p>D.J.\u2019s predatory nature had him smiling. \u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>The Other didn\u2019t hesitate but spun and charged forward, swinging his sword in an arc designed to slash D.J.\u2019s head from his shoulders. He blocked the blow with his own blade and shoved the bastard back a few steps.</p><p>D.J. taunted his opponent. \u201cTsk, tsk, is this how you usually greet guests in Kalithia? I didn\u2019t see any of us trying to kill you while you were in my world.\u201d</p><p>He went on the attack as he spoke. \u201cOf course, I would\u2019ve skewered both you and your buddy had I gotten the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>The tip of his blade sliced open the Other\u2019s cheek. Blood flowed in dark contrast to his pale skin, but the wound was more painful than serious.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that was my woman you kidnapped?\u201d D.J. danced forward and marked the male\u2019s other cheek the same way. \u201cTell me who has her and why, and I promise to ease your passing.\u201d</p><p>The Other rejoined the battle, doing his own fair share of taunting in heavily accented English. \u201cYou will die screaming in my world, Paladin. I will celebrate your death by taking your woman to my pallet. I have already tasted her kiss and held her body against mine.\u201d</p><p>D.J. fought to control his burning fury, knowing cold hate served him better in a battle to the death. He studied his opponent\u2019s technique. The Other was good, but not great. No way this guy had the skills of a Sword Guardian. He might get lucky, but he\u2019d never defeat D.J. on skill alone.</p><p>One thing was clear. The Other wouldn\u2019t offer any useful information, not unless D.J. subdued him long enough to use some creative interrogation techniques. There wasn\u2019t time for that, and it was doubtful the information would be reliable anyway.</p><p>But from the increasing panic in the guy\u2019s fighting style, the dance was about to turn lethal. So far D.J. had managed to stay out of striking distance, but it was going to come down to stamina or bad luck.</p><p>With a bellow loud enough to wake the dead, the Other charged one last time, nicking D.J.\u2019s sword arm and then shoving him backward. D.J. ignored the stinging pain and pushed back, causing the Other to lose his footing right at the edge of the drop-off.</p><p>For a handful of slow-motion seconds the Other hovered there, his arms pinwheeling until he finally lost his balance and went flying backward over the edge. His scream echoed through the valley, only to be cut off in midnote when his body crashed onto the rocks below.</p><p>D.J. peered over the edge in a futile attempt to determine if the Other was still breathing. All he could tell was that the Kalith wasn\u2019t moving. Rather than wasting his time climbing down to make sure, D.J. opted for retrieving his pack and taking off down the trail after Reggie.</p><p>If the Other\u2019s dying scream had carried as far as the campfire, his partner might panic. At the very least, he\u2019d be waiting for D.J. now, most likely armed and ready to use Reggie as a hostage.</p><p>This time, D.J. wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use the Glock. He ran full out, grateful for the boots that Barak had loaned him. They made little noise as he tore through the darkness. As he ran, he ignored the pain in his arm, his near exhaustion, and his lungs\u2019 struggle to filter enough oxygen from the thin air.</p><p>All that mattered was getting to Reggie.</p><p>Her captor was practically twitching with nerves. So far, Jeban had been the calm one, but with Kolar gone so long, he paced restlessly, stopping every so often to listen to the night.</p><p>She knew the instant he sensed something because he turned in her direction, his pale eyes reflecting the flames of the campfire. His hand hovered over the pommel of his sword, as if unsure about drawing his weapon. What had he heard that had him so freaked out? Rather than sit there on the ground, she rose to her feet, not sure what she intended to do. But whatever was about to happen, she\u2019d face it head-on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jeban?\u201d she asked, even though she doubted he\u2019d actually answer. \u201cAre your friends coming?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey aren\u2019t due until late tomorrow afternoon. Kolar went hunting. It appears he found something.\u201d</p><p>No, not something. Someone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two of them stood staring off into the darkness.

She tried closing her eyes, hoping that she\u2019d be able to hear better that way.</p><p>After a few seconds of continued silence, a horrifying scream ripped through the night, only to be cut off abruptly, unfinished. The night grew quiet again, but this time with a feeling of building tension. Jeban didn\u2019t hesitate. He drew his sword and then yanked Reggie close to his side, the blade at her throat.</p><p>\u201cI would guess the hunt has ended,\u201d he whispered near her ear. \u201cThe question is, which hunter was successful?\u201d</p><p>With chill of cold steel against her skin, Reggie could neither talk nor even swallow for fear the sword would draw blood. Her instincts told her that someone had died up there on the trail. There was nothing to do now but wait and pray that the footsteps running through the night belonged to D.J. and not Kolar.</p> <p>Time came to a screeching halt. For an eternity, it was just her, Jeban, and the pounding of her heart. Her captor had turned to stone, his body stiff with anticipation. His gaze remained trained on some invisible point in the impenetrable darkness beyond. What was he sensing that she wasn\u2019t? Wave after wave of chills washed through her, fear quickly eroding her self-control.</p><p>Please, God, she didn\u2019t want to die alone in this alien world, but neither would she go down without fighting. Calling upon all her years of training, she yanked her focus away from the anxiety churning in her chest and on to the externals.</p><p>She could hear her sensei\u2019s gravelly voice in her head. Breathe in and breathe out, slow and steady. Control yourself even if you cannot control the situation.</p><p>Good advice. As she gradually calmed down, she realized there was now a hair\u2019s breadth more room between her neck and Jeban\u2019s blade. If he so much as flinched, she\u2019d go on the attack, using her bare hands if necessary.</p><p>Suddenly, she could make out the vague shape of someone coming toward them. One minute the trail was empty, and the next, as if forming from the darkest of the shadows themselves, a man stepped into the farthest reaches of the firelight. He wore all black and a Kalith cloak, the hood pulled down close to his face.</p> <p>Her heart sank as he calmly strode toward them, everything about him screaming that he didn\u2019t doubt his welcome. At first glance, she assumed it was Kolar. But then she looked again. After hours of trailing after the Kalith, she knew how Kolar moved. And this wasn\u2019t him. She was sure of it.</p><p>The weight of the silence pressed down on her, making it hard to breathe and even harder to hope. If something had happened to Kolar, it didn\u2019t necessarily translate to this guy being on her side.</p><p>Jeban shifted his weight, the first movement he\u2019d made since he\u2019d grabbed her. She leaned in the opposite direction, but he only tightened his hold.</p><p>Then he rattled off something in his native language. Whatever he said, it clearly wasn\u2019t meant to be friendly. The newcomer showed no reaction at all, instead continuing his approach without a break in his step. If he was at all worried, it sure didn\u2019t show.</p><p>Jeban spoke again, this time clearly in warning. He was growing more agitated by the newcomer\u2019s refusal to answer because he once again pressed the blade of his sword against Reggie\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI will kill her.\u201d This time he spoke in English.</p> <p>The hooded figure paused a short distance away and tossed the edge of his cloak back over his shoulders as he drew his weapon. A Kalith sword. Then she saw the gun in his other hand.</p><p>For the first time the new arrival spoke. \u201cIf she dies, so will you, and it will be a death without honor. You will die screaming for mercy, just as your buddy did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jeban demanded as he dragged Reggie back a few steps.</p><p>The stranger followed them, step for step. Then he tipped his head back and let the hood drop onto his shoulders. He was no stranger after all, at least not to her.</p><p>\u201cReggie, has this bastard or his dead partner hurt you?\u201d D.J.\u2019s dark eyes met hers, promising retribution if they had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right now,\u201d she whispered around the pressure of the blade on her throat. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Her captor didn\u2019t like that remark one bit. His hand dropped from her throat to her breast. \u201cTell me, human, is she really that good? That you risk dying for the chance to have her underneath you again?\u201d</p><p>Did Jeban see his own death reflected in the Paladin\u2019s angry gaze? Reggie hoped so. She might not survive the night, but at least the two men who had dragged her into this hellish world would pay for their crimes.</p> <p>Then she realized that Jeban was now pointing his sword toward D.J. rather than at her. This might be her one chance to break his hold on her. She slowly blinked three times right at D.J. and then slowly tilted her head to the side, trying to convey her intent. The corner of his mouth twitched up in a small smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, Other, do you prefer death by bullet or blade? This sword was loaned to me by a Kalith friend, if you\u2019re curious. Didn\u2019t want you to think I stole it off your dead friend.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Jeban started to respond, Reggie lunged to the side, dropping to roll out of his reach and leave him an open target for D.J. The Kalith charged after her, his sword raised and ready to slash down in a lethal arc. She had instinctively held up her arm to block the blow when a series of shots rang out. Jeban\u2019s murderous fury evolved into a look of stunned surprise as his life ended in a burst of blood and brains.</p><p>Pure panic took over as Reggie stared at the aftermath. Jeban lay sprawled on the ground, crumpled and broken. His unseeing eyes stared at her in dead bewilderment as someone screamed loud and long. Even when she realized that she was making all the noise, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. It went on and on, ripping her throat raw.</p><p>Damn, D.J. hadn\u2019t meant for Reggie to catch the brunt of the Other\u2019s death. But if he\u2019d delayed even a second longer to see if she could get out of range, the Other could\u2019ve gutted her with his sword. Why the fucker had gone after her instead of D.J. was a mystery, unless he thought to hurt D.J. in the worst way possible by taking her life.</p><p>If Reggie had to end up covered in gore, at least it was the Other\u2019s. D.J. paused to cover the body with the guy\u2019s own cloak before kneeling down to wrap Reggie in his arms. She buried her face against his chest, still keening her pain and fear.</p><p>\u201cShhh, honey, it\u2019s over for now. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, her sobs slowed down and then stopped. But when she tried to wipe away the tears on her cheeks, her hands came away covered in blood.</p><p>She held out her bloody palms, her hysteria ramping up again. \u201cGet it off! Please get it off!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d love to accommodate her, but he had to prioritize what came next. He caught her hands in his as he looked around the Kaliths\u2019 camp.</p><p>\u201cI will take care of this, but it will have to wait until I make sure there aren\u2019t any more of these bastards in the immediate vicinity. By the looks of things, this place was set up for more than just the two of them and you.\u201d</p><p>Reggie looked back toward the shrouded figure on the ground with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cJeban said the rest would be here late tomorrow.\u201d Her words came out in hiccups as she fought to control the sobs.</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s real good, Reggie. Okay, I\u2019ll go back and get some water. The creek I passed is some distance away, but I promise I\u2019ll haul ass. Will you be all right alone while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d She held out a shaky hand to point in the opposite direction. \u201cPast the tents. There\u2019s water that way.\u201d</p><p>Better yet. \u201cGood, we\u2019ll go wash all of that off you.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up and carried her over to the side of a quiet pool of water that fed into a narrow stream. After setting her back down, he rooted through his pack for something Reggie could use to clean up with. A spare shirt would have to do. He tore off a strip to use as a washcloth while keeping the rest for a makeshift towel.</p><p>Then he tested the temperature of the water with his hand.</p><p>\u201cThe water is clear but a little cold.\u201d He considered their options, none of them good. Best to just get on with it.</p><p>\u201cReggie, your clothes are covered in blood, so I need you to strip them off. Afterward, you can cover up with my cloak and sit by the fire while I wash out your clothes and hang them up to dry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her hands were shaking too hard to manage by herself. D.J. reluctantly took over, starting with her shoes and then working his way up to her tunic and trousers. Yeah, he\u2019d been wanting to get Reggie naked, but not like this.</p><p>For both their sakes, he left her bra and panties in place for her to deal with. He did his honorable best not to notice how her nipples pebbled up in the evening chill or the way her narrow waist gave way to the gentle flare of her hips. God, he was a bastard for even thinking about such things.</p><p>He held out the pieces of his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re good to go. Use these to wash up.\u201d</p><p>Then he noticed a dark streak caught up in the curls of her hair. When he touched it, his hand came away bloody.</p><p>\u201cUh, looks like you need to wash your hair, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror as the implication of what he was saying sank in. \u201cHow am I going to do that from the edge of the water?\u201d</p><p>She was right. \u201cMaybe a quick rinse won\u2019t get the job done. Maybe you should just go for broke and take a quick bath.\u201d</p><p>Reggie studied the dark sheen of the water suspiciously, but finally she nodded. \u201cAll right, if you think it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be,\u201d he assured her, mentally crossing his fingers. \u201cGive me a second so I can see what kind of supplies I have that you can use.\u201d</p><p>He dumped the pack out on the ground and studied the contents: shampoo, a toothbrush, a bar of soap, and even a spare tunic. Damn, Devlin and Barak had thought of everything.</p><p>He arranged the items on a flat rock next to the edge of the water. \u201cHere you go, Reggie. I\u2019ll turn my back, but I\u2019ll stay close by in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>He did as promised, but listened to make sure she was doing all right. The rustle of fabric sliding down skin, the almost silent plop of something dropping down on the ground, and then the splash of water, followed by a bloodcurdling squeal.</p><p>What the hell? He spun back around, gun in hand and ready to defend her against all comers. Except no one was there except a totally nude Reggie, standing thigh deep in the water and glaring back at him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said the water was just a little cold!\u201d</p><p>He tried not to laugh, he really did. But she was so cute, standing there naked and absolutely furious. She had no idea how clearly he could see in the dark, so she wasn\u2019t trying to cover up. At least the little lost girl was gone, momentarily replaced by her usual feisty nature.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I may have exaggerated a bit on that point,\u201d he said, trying to sound apologetic and failing miserably.</p><p>\u201cYou think, you big jerk?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disgusted look and then gingerly waded out farther into the water. \u201cRemind me to get even with you for this.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
