The feeling of my feet hitting the ground without anything between the pads of my skin and the earth, the undeniable pull of the moving forward, the spring of the leap, the scent of the cold north wind.</p> <p>It\u2019s all of the awesome Nike commercials combined, without having to fork over a hundred bucks for shoes. Because you don\u2019t need any shoes. Or boob binders.</p><p>I dashed through the underbrush, following the fresh scent trail left by a panicked rabbit. I yipped in my excitement, barreling between trees and under low fingers of pine. The foliage grew thinner, golden-green light filtering through the pine needles as we approached a clearing. Silly rabbit, heading for open ground. My canine brain was rolling over the potential hilarity of a silly rabbit as a sitting duck, distracting me from a less familiar scent on the breeze.</p><p>Man.</p><p>A strange man was not supposed to be wandering this close to the Crescent Valley, a fingernail-moon-shaped dent in the Alaskan interior that was a lush, game-filled heaven on earth for werewolves. Alone, there was nothing I could do but hide and hope he wasn\u2019t armed. Without breaking my stride, I turned, ducking under the branches of a pine tree the width of a minivan, and waited. I didn\u2019t recognize any part of this human\u2019s scent. It was smoky, mossy, but sort of fresh, like new leaves and my mom\u2019s homemade bread. My mouth started to water a little.</p><p>That was weird.</p> <p>My ears perked up at the sound of footsteps trudging through the soft, dry grass. I hunched close to the ground and waited for his boots to appear in my line of vision. I held my breath, knowing that I would growl and give myself away. The delicious greenery-and-home-cooking smell invaded my head as two feet stepped precariously close to my hiding spot. Old boots, worn and well cared for, stopped just outside the tree line, as if the wearer was waiting for something.</p><p>I heard him uncap a canteen, take several swallows of water, and then step away. I crept farther from the branches, getting a better look at the tall, broad-shouldered form. From the back, I could see wavy blond hair sticking out from under an old navy blue baseball cap on his head. All he had on him was an old backpack and the canteen. So, not a hunter. Probably just a hiker, wandering too far away from the nature preserve.</p><p>Still, the fewer humans who saw wolves near the valley, the better. He stopped again and turned. I ducked back under the brush. Branches obscured my view of his face, but his scent grew stronger, and my brain sort of, well . . . stilled. Everything seemed calm and clear, and the usual organic alarms that shouted \u201cStranger danger!\u201d quieted.</p><p>I huffed, trying to shake away the strange, numbed feeling. I liked my alarms blaring, thank you very much.</p><p>The man tramped into the woods, away from my little village. Some magnetic pull drew my paws in the same direction, to follow. I managed to break the spell and sprang out from under the pine needles, running toward home. The pounding of paws on dirt had almost cleared my head when I picked up a more familiar scent.</p><p>I skidded to a stop, my paws dragging into the cool, packed dirt and sending clods spraying onto my mother\u2019s candy-pink wool dress.</p> <p>Mom had a full, round, happy face, with twinkling brown eyes and a mouth made for smiling. That didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t be downright scary with maternal wrath when she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cMargaret Faith Graham, you get on two legs right now,\u201d she commanded sternly, tapping her slippered foot against the ground. From my oddly fish-eyed, waist-height perspective, it should have been intimidating. But I\u2019d been getting that same look since I was old enough to turn wolf. My sister-in-law, Mo, stood behind my mother, giving me her best \u201cI tried to stop her\u201d expression.</p><p>I sat on my haunches and huffed. Mom cocked her fists on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you sass me, young lady. Alpha or no, I\u2019ll phase and bite a chunk out of your hide.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I concentrated on my human form. Arms, legs, fingers, and toes. I felt a warm, tugging sensation, a thread being pulled through my chest, as my body stretched and pulled. I rolled my neck, enjoying the release of tension as my vertebrae snapped into place. My vision blurred into a golden haze, then focused. Finally, I was standing on bare human feet.</p><p>I smirked at Mo, who still wasn\u2019t completely comfortable hanging around with the frequently nude. She covered her eyes with one hand while making warning gestures with the other.</p><p>\u201cHow could you just not bother to show up?\u201d Mom demanded.</p><p>I stared at her, my face blank, as I tried to figure out what exactly I\u2019d missed. Honestly, there were a couple of options. Behind Mom, Mo held her hand over her head, making wiggling motions with her fingers. I arched my brow at her. She wiggled her fingers even harder, which really was so much clearer.</p><p>\u201cI was . . . attacked by a squid?\u201d I guessed.</p> <p>Mo\u2019s hand dropped to her side, and she glared at me as Mom turned to her. Mom rolled her eyes at both of us. \u201cHow is this,\u201d Mo demanded, waving her hand over head, \u201cattacked by a squid?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d Mo said, wiggling her fingers again. \u201cBaby shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t blame me because you suck at Charades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou skipped out on Katie\u2019s baby shower,\u201d Mo told me. Suddenly, Mom wearing her good church dress in the middle of the woods made a lot more sense.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I wasn\u2019t going to that anyway,\u201d I said, shrugging.</p><p>Mom spluttered. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d meet us at the community center this afternoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help you clean up!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThere was no way I was going to spend my Sunday measuring Katie\u2019s belly with toilet paper and eating little mints that taste like toothpaste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about two hours late to help with cleanup.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the sky, gauging the height of the late-afternoon sun. \u201cOops. I must have lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you skip your own cousin\u2019s shower?\u201d Mom demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have eighteen cousins, not counting second cousins, and at any given time, at least one of them is pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Mom gave me a sharp look and stalked toward the village. Mo gave me a sympathetic grimace.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you stand there all pious and pretend you had a good time at the shower,\u201d I told her as we followed Mom\u2019s trail through the trees.</p><p>She made a face and whispered fiercely, \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t. Hell, I didn\u2019t have a good time at my baby shower. Baby showers should be reserved as punishment for betrayers in the Seventh Circle of Hell. But I went. Why? Because that\u2019s what being part of a family is all about, spending a Sunday afternoon doing stuff you really don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who moved three thousand miles to be away from her parents,\u201d I said, shrugging into the Carhartt jacket Mo shoved at me. My brother\u2019s light autumn coat practically hung to my knees and could wrap around me twice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because my parents would have the mother-to-be naked in a drum circle, drawing down the moon goddess. By comparison, your werewolf stuff is downright Rockwellian.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. Mo\u2019s parents were unapologetic hippies. Two years before, Mo had moved to Grundy all the way from Mississippi just to get away from them, only relenting and allowing them to visit for Eva\u2019s birth. Now that I\u2019d met them, I couldn\u2019t blame Mo for picking werewolf pack drama over constant hovering and deep discussions of colonics.</p><p>I picked up my pace to catch up with Mom. \u201cWasn\u2019t I sweet as freaking pie to Mo the whole time she was pregnant?\u201d Mom and Mo both raised their eyebrows. I added, \u201cFor at least the last trimester. Didn\u2019t I show up when Mo had her pup and present my new niece to the pack like Simba in the damned Lion King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop calling Eva a pup,\u201d Mo muttered. \u201cYou know I hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is that I\u2019m plenty supportive of the women in the pack when they have babies. I just don\u2019t want to be there for the frilly free-for-all,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mom, who\u2019d given up on correcting my colorful vocabulary years ago, simply stared at me.</p><p>\u201cMom, please don\u2019t make me pull the alpha card on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing the alpha doesn\u2019t mean you get to do whatever you want to do without regard for the feelings of others,\u201d Mom intoned in her \u201cimportant pronouncement\u201d voice, turning away and walking out of the tree line.</p><p>\u201cKind of does,\u201d I countered, but softly, under my breath.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait until you get pregnant,\u201d Mo said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re forced to sit through your own shower. We\u2019ll probably have to duct-tape you to your pink-bedecked mother-to-be throne.\u201d</p><p>The very idea of being pregnant made me stop in my tracks and burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh, haha, laugh as much as you want, Scrappy,\u201d Mo told me as I braced myself against my knees for support. \u201cYou\u2019re planning on marrying a male wolf\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018plan,\u2019 \u201c I clarified. \u201cI said, when I get around to mating, I\u2019m going to marry another wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be pregnant before you leave the altar. You know you have superabsorbent eggs. It\u2019s hereditary. Your brother\u2019s ninja swimmers scoffed at modern prophylactics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Mo, I did not need that picture in my head.\u201d I scowled at her. She preened a little and loped after my mother.</p><p>My brother and his mate were nearly sickening to watch. They were a combination of every nauseating chick flick ever made and the complete catalogue of Barry Manilow\u2019s love songs. But in its own twisted way, their Disney-movie love affair helped me reconcile with said brother after years of not speaking and/or knock-down, drag-out fights. (The knocking and the dragging were mostly done by me.) So I was the tiniest bit fond of her, as fond as I could be of a human outsider.</p><p>Mo and I were a study of contrasts. I was small and what I prefer to think of compact and sporty\u2014like one of those Porsche coupes. Mo was one of those \u201cshouldn\u2019t be hot but somehow through the combination of interesting features is\u201d girls. She was willowy and tall, with a curly black halo of hair that had grown out to her shoulders while she was pregnant with Eva. I had stick-straight, aggressively brown hair that I never cut. She tried to be nice to everybody, where I never really bothered with that kind of crap. I charged into situations; she actually thought them through . . . which usually meant I got the first swing in.</p><p>Thanks to Mo, my mom was finally able to do all the froufrou girlie bonding shit she wanted to do when I was growing up. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be jealous, but honestly, I was happy for my mom. She\u2019s a smart cookie. She knew that stuff made me miserable and that I would only be suffering through it for her. While Mo actually enjoyed getting her nails done and going shopping for something besides hiking boots.</p><p>Mo cleared her throat and pitched her voice into an intentionally cheerful tone. \u201cSpeaking of your brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the next words out of your mouth have anything to do with sex, I can and will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cThen the next words out of my mouth will be \u2018fire extinguisher.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>I scowled at her, self-consciously rubbing at the crown of my head, where she\u2019d actually once beaned me with a fire extinguisher to break up a tiny altercation between Cooper and me. Total overreaction on her part.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of my brother,\u201d I prompted her, while sending her a mildly threatening glare as Mom opened the front door of our snug house on the outskirts of the village.</p><p>Mo and I stepped through the door as Mom strode into the kitchen to make tea. That was what she did when she was angry . . . or upset . . . or happy. Really, she was an all-occasion tea drinker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled on a pair of sweats and a T-shirt, wondering how long I would be apologizing for this latest misstep.</p><p>\u201cCooper wanted to know if you could drop by the Glacier in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not the house?\u201d I asked, quirking an eyebrow at her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s someone he wants you to meet, or at least see.\u201d</p><p>I groaned at Mo. \u201cMo, please tell me he isn\u2019t going to try to set me up on some lame blind date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. There\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been coming around the saloon asking questions about the attacks last year. Cooper thinks he\u2019s some sort of investigator. Nicholas Thatcher, PhDs. As in, he has more than one. He\u2019s not your typical Paranormal State wacko. There\u2019s not a dowsing crystal in sight. He seems to be doing actual scientific research. Since you\u2019re alpha, Cooper wants you to come by and get a look at him, see what you think.\u201d</p><p>I quirked my lips at her. \u201cThat was low.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at me. I was the youngest leader in our pack\u2019s history and eager to prove my mettle. I\u2019d inherited the job under less than ideal circumstances from our previous alpha, creepy-ass\u2014and by no coincidence thoroughly dead\u2014Eli, who took over the job for my self-exiled brother.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long story.</p><p>I took my job as pack leader seriously, and Mo knew the best way to get to me was to appeal to my position. She could be a conniving, sneaky wench, our Mo . . . hence my being the tiniest bit fond of her.</p><p>\u201cWhy the big discussion? Let\u2019s just get rid of him. Run him back to the lower forty-eight. Or we could go with a slightly less pleasant, but bloody and satisfying, second option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper and I think you should meet him before you jump to any conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll meet him, and then maybe his tires develop problems while he\u2019s in the saloon, and he ends up careening into a ditch, never to be heard from again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf, not a hit man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll look like an accident.\u201d</p><p>My mother shot me a sharp look, snatching the kettle from the stove with a clatter. \u201cHow many family conversations are going to be interrupted by me telling you, no, you can\u2019t kill someone and make it look like an accident? Now, would you two please sit down and drink this tea before it gets cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d we chorused sheepishly, taking seats at the table.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, you got us into trouble,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one planning the cold-blooded murder of a complete stranger,\u201d Mo stage-whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, you only plan cold-blooded murders when someone takes the last chocolate chess square without asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl\u2019s got to have her priorities,\u201d Mo insisted.</p><p>2</p> <p>I\u2019m a Loser, Baby . . .</p><p>BY THE TIME I arrived at the Glacier, I\u2019d worked up a pretty good head of steam.</p><p>I\u2019d done a little bit of research on Dr. Nicholas J. Thatcher, and my Google results were disturbing. Mo was right. Thatcher wasn\u2019t your typical lonely tech geek who fancied himself a paranormal investigator. He was calling himself a \u201czoological anthropologist.\u201d He\u2019d already decided that werewolves existed; now he just wanted to know how we came to be, how we lived. This was just the type of guy who would blindly stumble into proof of our existence, sell it to National Geographic, and send my whole family running away from scientists bearing tranq guns and skull saws.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing. I loved being a werewolf. I couldn\u2019t imagine living in just one skin. And I was lucky to be able to turn into such a cool animal. I could have been stuck as a were-skunk or something equally lame. (They do exist. Poor bastards.) Werewolves changed day or night and had the most complete, dependable changes. And we had the stable pack structure, led by an alpha male mated to the female of his choice, who becomes the alpha female. Unless the alpha male handed his office over to, say, his much cooler and wiser younger sister.</p><p>And don\u2019t believe all that crap Hollywood tries to peddle about being bitten and cursed by the full moon. You had to be born into our little club. No matter how many times we bit someone, that person would not go furry. They\u2019d probably bleed a lot, though, and maybe get an infection.</p><p>Humans had no idea that we existed. Sure, we were the subject of lame movies, and every Halloween, we put up with little kids running around with fur glued to their faces, yelling \u201cGrr!\u201d But humans would freak out if they realized that they saw us every day at the grocery store, in their schools, in the woods. Hell, some wildlife experts could see us in wolf form and would never know they were looking at anything but a large, but otherwise normal, wolf. A picture of my cousin Samson made it into National Geographic the year before with a caption calling him a \u201cmagnificent specimen.\u201d He\u2019d been carrying the damn article around in his wallet for months, using it to impress werewolf chicks.</p><p>Basically, we\u2019d gotten by undocumented with cunning and a lot of dumb-ass luck.</p><p>If people knew, really knew, that the things that go bump in the night existed, we\u2019d be hunted. Simple as that. Our children would be taken from us and put in special detention centers. We\u2019d be studied, dissected, chased.</p><p>Nick Thatcher would be lucky to leave Grundy with all his parts intact.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let myself wallow in the delicious, happy noise of the Blue Glacier before I had to get down to business. My cousin Evie owned the saloon, which was part diner, part bar, part dry goods store. The dining room was lit by picture windows and obnoxious neon beer signs. The scent of smoke from the black iron woodstove and potatoes fried in peanut oil had pictures of double cheeseburgers and apple-raisin pie dancing behind my eyelids.</p><p>Evie\u2019s husband, Buzz, had churned out plain old burgers and fries from the saloon\u2019s kitchen until Mo came along with her magical spatula. She overhauled the menu, started baking desserts from scratch, and turned out to be a bit of a marketing genius to boot. For instance, she figured out that while her new neighbors found \u201cshepherd\u2019s pie\u201d to be pretentious and British, if she called it \u201cmashed potato pot pie,\u201d we\u2019d lap it up. She even developed a signature moose meat loaf sandwich that got the place mentioned in some outsider foodie magazine.</p><p>Evie had even given Mo a stake in the place to keep her from quitting when she had the baby. I chose to believe that was why Mo and Cooper named the baby after Evie, instead of, say, a favorite sibling.</p><p>Trust my brother to mate with the best cook on this end of the state. Most werewolves are masters of the kitchen. If you can kill it or cover it in gravy, we\u2019ll serve it and serve it well. It is a biological necessity. Our metabolism is so high that we have to scarf down calories all day just to sleep all night, like a mini-hibernation. If you were a member of PETA, you would not be happy at a werewolf Thanksgiving, because in terms of menu, we take \u201call of column A and half of column B\u201d from the available woodland creatures. Still, none of us could compete with Mo in the kitchen. And trust me, several of my aunties tried.</p><p>I stopped to steal Alan Dahling\u2019s cap from the bar and plopped it on my head. \u201cHey there, Ranger, you ever catch up to that bear with all the pickanic baskets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha, mock the public servant,\u201d Alan said, scowling at me and snatching the cap back. Alan had been one of the most eligible bachelors in our end of the woods until he\u2019d hooked up with Kara Reynolds, who just happened to be one of Mo\u2019s childhood friends. Kara had come up for Mo and Cooper\u2019s wedding, jumped Alan, and never bothered leaving. Can\u2019t say I blamed her, really. Despite their recent engagement and the fact that he regularly solved problems with bear traps, Alan was still a headliner in my personal fantasy rotation.</p><p>What? I like uniforms.</p><p>\u201cKara won\u2019t like it much if she sees you eyeing Mo that way,\u201d I said, nodding toward the kitchen, where Alan was watching Mo flit from counter to stove.</p><p>Not for the first time, I envied the way Mo moved. I was stealthy and quick. I knew how to land on my feet. But Mo moved with the kind of fluid grace that made you think of swans and toe shoes. Then again, every once in a while, she had a fantastically spazzy moment and ended up falling on her ass, covered in brownie batter. I felt that balanced the scales.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not eyeing the girl,\u201d Alan told me. \u201cI\u2019m eyeing the sandwich.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as Mo delivered a steak melt, piled high with her special beer-battered onion rings.</p><p>Kara appeared at Alan\u2019s elbow, stealing one of his rings. She grinned and winked one of her china-doll green eyes at me. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Since high school, I\u2019ve never been able to compete with her lunch plates,\u201d she said in that honey-and-whiskey accent that kept the local guys circling Mo and Kara like confused, horny bees.</p><p>I snickered and snatched one of the onion rings for myself while Alan was distracted with nauseating prelunch smoochies. They were perfectly matched, Alan and Kara. Blond, blue-eyed and tanned, although Alan was about three heads taller. It was as if Alan had ordered her out of a happy couples catalogue or something. Sometimes I looked at all the smug, settled couples around me . . . and I wanted to yark a little bit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a joke in there somewhere, but I don\u2019t have time to find it,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes when Cooper started waving at me from across the bar.</p><p>Oh, right, I came here with an agenda.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I demanded, taking the stool next to Cooper.</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself. Here, you can\u2019t make a bloody public scene while holding the niblet,\u201d he said, holding out my niece like a tiny human shield.</p><p>\u201cDarn your powers of cuteness,\u201d I grumbled at the baby, who babbled and grabbed at my nose. I smiled despite myself. Little Eva was a sight to behold. I had never seen hair like this kid\u2019s, a shock of blue-black that stood out as if she\u2019d licked a light socket. She was born looking as if she was wearing a doll\u2019s wig. Between that and the marshmallow cheeks, she was basically a living Cabbage Patch Doll.</p><p>As beautiful and adorable as she was, Eva\u2019s birth was a blow for the pack. Cooper was born to be the alpha, our pack leader. He was the fastest, the strongest of us all. Being alpha wasn\u2019t exactly a hereditary monarchy, but it tends to stay in families with strong wolf genes. You can\u2019t get much stronger than Graham DNA. Despite the fact that he\u2019d turned the alpha position down and mated with the thoroughly human Mo, it had been expected that his baby would be a wolf. The early signs were promising. As in any pregnancy involving werewolf DNA, Mo had the typical shortened gestation. Eva had been a sturdy nine-pound newborn with a ridiculous amount of hair. But here she was, four months old, and not a tooth in sight. She was completely and utterly human.</p><p>The pack loved her, as much as we loved any of our \u201cdead-liners,\u201d family members who had all the same genetic opportunities we did but none of the wolf magic. Eva was cuddled constantly at family dinners, to the point where she fussed if she was put in a high chair or anyplace but a warm werewolf auntie\u2019s lap. Still, it was a bit of a disappointment that she wouldn\u2019t continue the line. Which put that much more pressure on me to produce the next Graham werewolf . . . which sometimes brought up old resentments against Cooper . . . which made me feel no guilt whatsoever for stealing half of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s extremely fucked up to keep your baby in a bar, right?\u201d I asked, stroking her hair, making a game of trying to find her scalp.</p><p>\u201cEasy, that\u2019s my pup you\u2019re holding,\u201d Cooper warned me, cupping his hands over Eva\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a bar,\u201d I pointed out again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a smart kid. She\u2019s going to start repeating everything she hears any day now,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIf her first word is \u2018goddamn,\u2019 her mom will blame one of us. And I\u2019m not above letting you take the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so whipped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby sister, when your wife looks like that\u201d\u2014he pointed toward Mo\u2019s kitchen ballet\u2014\u201cand cooks like this\u201d\u2014he scooped up some homemade chips and popped them into his mouth\u2014\u201cbeing whipped isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it Mo told you about Dr. Thatcher?\u201d</p><p>My fragile good mood dissipated like the steam from Mo\u2019s buttermilk biscuits. \u201cThis guy is trouble, Coop. He\u2019s already come to the conclusion that we exist. Now he\u2019s just trying to confirm his theories on \u2018pack structure\u2019 and \u2018mating rituals\u2019 for some \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 book he\u2019s working on. Just the fact that he actually used the words \u2018mating rituals\u2019 makes me want to punch him in the mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your solution to just about everything,\u201d Cooper noted dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd so far, it\u2019s worked out for me.\u201d I snorted, snatching a few of the chips off Cooper\u2019s plate. I chewed them while I surveyed the room. \u201cHe\u2019s probably some forty-something virgin who lives in his mother\u2019s basement and touches himself while watching The Howling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Mags, I\u2019m not any happier about him being here than you are. But I think we should take a more subtle approach than your usual \u2018bite first, bite again, keep biting until they\u2019re too busy bleeding to death to explain themselves\u2019 method.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d I shot back. \u201cSo, where is this loser?\u201d</p><p>I scanned the dining room, stopping on a plaid-clad form hunched over a notebook at his table. My mouth stopped mid-chew. Helloooo, yummy goodness. He looked like those old pictures of Vikings you\u2019d see in history textbooks. Wheat-colored hair that was just a little too long. A white-blond goatee dusted around a mouth that was curved into a smile. Blue eyes so bright I could spot the little lapis-colored ring around the iris from across the room. I could practically hear the freaking ocean when I looked at them. Strong chin, lantern jaw, high cheekbones. Lips that were currently being gnawed on as he scribbled in his notebook.</p> <p>And when he slid those little wire-rim glasses on his nose, I started drooling. Saliva was literally leaking out of the side of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMama likes,\u201d I whimpered as Mo approached behind the bar. I growled softly as the resident bar wench, Lynette, sidled up to his table and started flirting. She giggled and tossed her hair. She was practically scrawling \u201cDo me\u201d on her boobs in maple syrup. \u201cWho is that, and how much will I have to threaten Lynette to keep her skanky ass the hell away from him?\u201d</p><p>Mo grinned at me. A series of little mental tumblers clicked into place in my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the loser, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I groaned, to Mo\u2019s delight.</p><p>\u201cPay up!\u201d she crowed at my brother, who begrudgingly handed her a dollar bill. She smiled winsomely at me as she stuffed the bill into her stained blue apron. \u201cI bet Cooper a buck that you\u2019d pick him out of the crowd as soon as you saw him. You Grahams have a thing for outsiders. We are the forbidden fruit you just can\u2019t wait to get a bite of. Face it, accept the outsider hotness, and move on.\u201d</p><p>A couple of locals watched with bemused interest as Mo did a little victory shimmy behind the bar. Cooper\u2019s hands rushed to cup Eva\u2019s ears again as I narrowed my eyes at his wife. \u201cThat was low, Mo. I thought this guy made you nervous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t find the entertainment value in all this,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cWhat? We don\u2019t have HBO.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grumpily shoved a fry into his mouth. \u201cYou owe me a buck, Mags. He\u2019s not the type of guy I thought you\u2019d be interested in. Too pretty.\u201d</p><p>I snorted as Mo slid a cheeseburger plate in front of me, extra pickles, no tomato, double onion rings. These were the moments that made up for my sister-in-law being an occasional pain in my ass. \u201cSo, who exactly do you think is my type?\u201d</p><p>Cooper pursed his lips for a moment as I devoured the burger. \u201cWhat do they call those guys who fight in the octagon?\u201d</p><p>I slapped at his arm, choking a little on Mo\u2019s ambrosial half-pounder with cheese. Cooper was about to protest when Lynette streaked past us in a huff, pulling the shoulders of her artfully shredded Bon Jovi T-shirt back up over her sparkly purple bra straps. I shot a look back over to Dr. Thatcher\u2019s booth, where he was casually thumbing through some battle-scarred book, blatantly ignoring the tray-tossing hissy fit Lynette was throwing in the kitchen. Dr. Thatcher was apparently immune to her cleavage-y charms.</p><p>For a brief, horrible moment, I wondered whether he was gay and mourned the potential loss. Not just for me but for all womankind. This led to thoughts of Dr. Thatcher naked and sweaty, and I started feeling uncomfortably warm in certain places.</p><p>\u201cStill want to murder the good doctor Goodfellas-style?\u201d Mo asked, smirking at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I growled.</p> <p>\u201cJust that you\u2019re not looking at Dr. Thatcher with bloodlust right now . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to just overlook that he\u2019s trying to expose my entire species because he\u2019s got a pretty face?\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s sexist. As a matter of fact, the idea that he\u2019s trying to exploit innocent furred people instead of modeling for underwear ads\u2014the way God obviously intended\u2014is reason enough to kill him. \u201c</p><p>\u201cOK, calm down, crazy eyes,\u201d Mo told me. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. He\u2019s been asking questions about Jacob Bennett and Craig Ryan. About Susie Q and Abner, anyone who suffered mysterious bite wounds last year. I think he\u2019s trying to play it off as just general interest, like every yahoo who\u2019s seen the news reports about the attacks. I don\u2019t know what to make of him, Maggie. It\u2019s not that I think he has bad intentions. In fact, I find myself sort of liking him and feeling sorry for him because I know what it\u2019s like to be the new guy around here. But he seems to be the type who\u2019s smart enough to bring this whole \u2018fur issue\u2019 crashing down on our heads. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised you guys have pulled it off for this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you want me to do now that I\u2019ve seen him?\u201d I asked. \u201cSince I\u2019m not allowed to run him out of town on a rail, I feel as if my hands are tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had an actual rail ready, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Mo asked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking your truck later,\u201d Mo muttered under her breath.</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cI thought it would be helpful for you to talk to him. To get an idea of what he\u2019s looking for. And maybe feed him a little misinformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do all that,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not the alpha, oh great leader. We both know if I started doing your job for you, I\u2019d wake up missing parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParts that I hold in high esteem,\u201d Mo added, wandering down the bar to take an order.</p><p>\u201cIs that where she holds them?\u201d I asked, snickering. Cooper growled at me. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll play nice, for now.\u201d</p><p>I turned to hop off my bar stool, and there he was, standing in front of me in all his plaid-clad glory.</p><p>This close, I could appreciate Dr. Thatcher all the better. He was pretty. The beard almost camouflaged the generous curve of his lips. It drew the eye away from the fine, straight nose. Maybe that was the point. You could catch a lot of crap in this kind of place, being a pretty boy. And from what my cousin Caleb told me, you could get some unwanted attention from truckers at rest stops.</p><p>Still, he was tall and broad-shouldered and moved with a sort of competence. And Geek Squad was hiding some serious muscles under that Simpsons T-shirt and flannel. I started having some weird waking-dream hallucination in which I pictured him busting into the saloon like Aragorn entering the royal halls of Rohan in Lord of the Rings. As the Dr. Thatcher-Aragorn hybrid made his away across the floor in full armor, I stared up at him with saucer eyes and a mouth full of drool but no words. All I could manage in the scope of this guy\u2019s little grin was an incredibly un-wolf-like squeak.</p><p>This was a first for me. I didn\u2019t have trouble talking to guys. Hell, Samson and Cooper named me an \u201chonorary dude\u201d when we were kids, to save their pride after losing so many foot races to their baby sister. But I was used to relating to guys on that familiar, buddy-buddy level. The Grahams are related to almost every family in our little valley. It\u2019s difficult to find a potential date who doesn\u2019t cross some creepy genetic boundaries.</p><p>And this was the point where I realized that I was having my own personal mental vacation, staring blankly at a complete stranger.</p><p>\u201cDr. Thatcher, this is my sister-in-law, Maggie,\u201d Mo said, filling the awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nick Thatcher,\u201d he said, stretching out his hand.</p><p>I froze. Cooper watched me, his brow furrowed. Normally, he would be afraid that I would punch Nick. At the moment, I think he was afraid I was going to throw up on Nick.</p><p>Nick reached forward, grabbed my motionless hand, and shook it. As he moved closer, his scent hit me full force, and I had to put a hand on the bar to steady myself. New leaves. Thanksgiving dinner. A smoky note of moss. I narrowed my eyes at him. I recognized that smell.</p><p>The hiker. Dr. The Truth Is Out There had been wandering in my backyard.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d I said, looking up to find those seawater eyes of his pinning me to the floor. He was staring me down. Nobody stared me down! Eye contact is a serious no-no with predators. In the animal kingdom, it basically says, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you. I plan on taking your food and your dignity, and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>I found it was a lot easier to be annoyed by that than hypnotized by his evil baby blues. I ratcheted my chin up a few degrees. \u201cWhat brings you to our neck of the woods, Dr. Thatcher?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cJust a little research trip. I think I disappointed some of the locals, though. They heard \u2018doctor\u2019 and thought a new MD had come to town.\u201d</p><p>I entertained myself with the image of the locals showing up at Dr. Thatcher\u2019s door, requesting help for hemorrhoids and plantar warts.</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t get a lot of academics up here.\u201d I tilted my head and smiled back, a hundred percent guile-free. \u201cIn fact, how did you hear about Grundy? Was there an ad or a brochure that caught your attention?\u201d</p><p>The doctor was an equally skilled bullshitter, which earned him a little bit of my grudging respect. There was no trace of hesitation as he said, \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. And I wanted to lick his chin. I actually had to keep my jaw tense to fight the urge. Sensing the weird energy that seemed to be swirling around my body, Cooper\u2019s eyebrow winged up to his hairline. Mo leaned against the counter, her head whipping back and forth as if she was watching some sort of dirty tennis game.</p><p>\u201cSo, Maggie, do you live nearby?\u201d The question seemed loaded, just by the tone Nick was using. I stared at him, trying to decipher the slight tilt to his head. A good hunter excels at interpreting body language, whether it\u2019s an elk preparing to bolt or a guy sneaking peeks at your ass. Dr. Thatcher already knew where I lived. I could only assume he had asked me that because he wanted to talk about the valley.</p><p>\u201cNot too far,\u201d I said blithely.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Maggie might be able to show you around the area, Nick.\u201d</p><p>My facade dropped for a second, and I shot my brother a meaningful look, the meaning being \u201cshut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t even blink, as if butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. \u201cWell, Nick heard I was a field guide, asked me to take him on some of the tougher trails around here. But I really don\u2019t have time in my schedule. And since you\u2019re the only one who knows the area almost as well I do . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be possible,\u201d I said, my voice flat. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, you can move your schedule around,\u201d Mo said, grinning at me. \u201cYour hours are pretty flexible.\u201d</p><p>OK, that was going too far. Being an unofficial official for the pack meant settling disputes between pack members, monitoring the wildlife (i.e., food sources) available around the valley, controlling the pack when we ran together. And it\u2019s hard to find a day job that will accept \u201cgot kicked in the ribs by an agitated moose\u201d as a reason to call in sick. The village paid me a salary for maintaining records and appearances at the town hall. And I was the closest thing there was to law enforcement in my valley. I didn\u2019t have time to escort the yummy doctor around by the nose.</p><p>OK, that wasn\u2019t true. I spent a good portion of my \u201cwork day\u201d bored out of my ever-loving mind. But no one, particularly the yummy doctor, had to know that.</p> <p>\u201cMo, my hours are none of your business,\u201d I said through a clenched, fake smile.</p><p>Nick shrugged, and the motion brought his arm brushing across my shoulder. It felt as if a warm electric current had passed through my skin. I held my breath, willing away the tremor that skittered up my spine.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you find a way to fit me into your schedule, let me know. I\u2019ll probably just wander around the eastern butte for a few days, take in the sights,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a climber, and I\u2019m eager to see what sort of trouble I can get into around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d I asked. The eastern side of the Wheeler Mountains range was where Buzz had uncovered the bones of hikers who disappeared the previous year. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a beginner\u2019s slope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a beginner,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cSo says every goofball who manages to hike across the parking lot to a sporting-goods store and buy a North Face jacket,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I need a guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll go with me,\u201d he said, as if the matter were obvious and settled.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2014wait, no. Wait, what?\u201d I spluttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call to settle the details,\u201d he said, nodding at Cooper and Mo. \u201cIt was nice to meet you all.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and walked out of the saloon, leaving me gaping after him.</p><p>What just happened?</p><p>\u201cAre you high?\u201d I asked Mo, slapping her arm. \u201cWhy did you guys tell him that I would show him around?\u201d Evie shot me a sharp look, and I lowered my voice. \u201cThis is the man who wants to reveal our existence to the world, and you want to set me up with him? Are you and Cooper that desperate to double date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I figured this was the best way to keep him out of our hair. He\u2019s your problem now. What better way to keep an eye on him than to accompany him on his investigation? He gets nothing but goes home happy. You . . . get a little something and go home a lot less cranky,\u201d Mo suggested, giggling unrepentantly when my brother winced. \u201cWhat? After watching you talk to him, I think we should change our approach. Keep our enemies close, so to speak. Hell, maybe you could convince him that a Sasquatch did it or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, we couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSasquatch is a pretty nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasquatch is real, too?\u201d Mo whispered. \u201cWhy do I have to find things out like this? I\u2019m in the family, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we don\u2019t speak to Thatcher,\u201d I told Cooper as Mo dashed back to the kitchen to check on some pies in the oven. \u201cWe don\u2019t take him into the woods. Nothing. As far as we\u2019re concerned, Dr. Thatcher doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a decree from the alpha?\u201d Cooper asked, lowering his tone to a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cDo I need to make it a decree, or do you have the sense to admit that we need to stay away from him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d Mo asked, coming back to refill Cooper\u2019s coffee mug and top off my Coke.</p><p>\u201cMaggie said she doesn\u2019t want us talking to him,\u201d Cooper said, sipping his coffee. \u201cNo visits, no tours, no spilling of ancient family secrets.\u201d</p><p>Mo frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re giving us a whole lot of credit. I think I\u2019m clever enough to maintain a friendly conversation without vomiting up forbidden information. I have just as much to lose as you two. And if he tries to interview me, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019m afraid his pocket recorder will capture my soul or something. Come on. Maggie finally has a crush on somebody. This is going to be better than one of those Japanese game shows.\u201d</p><p>I glared at her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFor the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to catch you without your trusty fire extinguisher. And then your ass is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on, Scrappy Doo.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Chuck Norris and the Calendar of Death</p><p>I SAT AT MY DESK in the community center/town hall, writing out the whopping four paychecks the village issued each week. One to myself; one to our village physician, Anna Moder; one to my cousin Teresa, who taught twenty-six kids in all twelve grades at the village school; and another to my gargantuan cousin-but-might-as-well-be-my-brother, Samson, who was the closest thing we had to a civil engineer. He delivered the mail, ran our modest recycling program, and maintained our handful of public buildings. He also occasionally fell asleep while driving a snowplow, but he was such a cheerful guy it was hard to stay pissed at him. Besides, every village needed an idiot.</p><p>I didn\u2019t live in a normal little town. Every single household in my valley was either were or descended from were. And I was related to each and every person there on one side or the other, and I\u2019m very aware of how wrong that sounds.</p><p>Dating as a werewolf is complicated, particularly for packs in the Great North. Every pack has to maintain close relationships with other packs and \u201cimport\u201d mates at every opportunity, to prevent inbreeding. You practically have to review your extended genealogical history before you can agree to a movie and dinner.</p><p>This might sound isolated and sort of claustrophobic, but wolves don\u2019t know any other way. A pack generally lives in close quarters, filling an apartment complex, a subdivision, or a gated community in the case of more urban, affluent clans. In southern packs, it usually means parking a number of double-wide trailers on a farm. For us, it was a self-contained, nearly self-sustaining, community surrounded by some of the richest hunting lands known in the Great Northwest.</p><p>Not that I like to brag or anything.</p><p>I munched on a handful of red Swedish Fish I kept in a huge apothecary jar on my desk. I had to refill the damn thing about once a week, depending on how often Samson stopped by. The rest of my morning would consist of checking on a pothole in the parking lot of the village clinic and writing up a schedule for the community center that might finally settle the ongoing feud between the local quilting group and the bridge club.</p><p>It was good to be the queen.</p><p>OK, so I had the most boring job in the village. I considered it a trade-off because the rest of my responsibilities\u2014running, hunting, protecting the borders of the valley, and so on\u2014were pretty awesome. And busting my ass for a few hours that morning meant I could get a few precious moments of quiet and read the copy of the new J. D. Robb paperback I had hidden in my filing cabinet. I wasn\u2019t a classics girl, despite Mo\u2019s best efforts. The woman actually bought me a subscription to the English Writer of the Month Club. I was shameless in my supermarket-shelf mass-market taste. I loved King, Evanovich, Grisham, and Brown. I won\u2019t lie; the official-looking filing cabinet in the corner is actually stuffed full of my paperbacks.</p><p>I might have been reading at that very moment, if I could manage to concentrate long enough to write a damn check correctly. I\u2019d slept about three hours each night since my humiliating meeting with Nick Thatcher. I kept waking up all sweaty and tangled up in the sheets, with visions of his cheeky little grin still dancing behind my eyelids.</p><p>Jumpy and irritated, I spent hours trying to get back to sleep, only to end up stomping out of the house to run through the woods on all fours. It was the only thing that could clear my head. By the time I got back to the house, everybody was bustling around town. And it hardly served as a good example for me to flop back into bed. Lazy never works for wolves. Read a few fables. So, for the last four days, I\u2019d basically been skimming by on caffeine and luck.</p><p>Beyond day-to-day operations, I also served as a sort of figurehead for the pack. I was \u201cthe face\u201d for the valley and its inhabitants. And that face had some pretty serious undereye luggage. Now that I was alpha, the pressure for me to settle down and birth a litter went from good-natured rumbling at holidays to an all-out roar. I couldn\u2019t walk from my office to my house without one of my relatives accosting me with some promise of the man of my dreams.</p><p>While a lot of girls\u2014particularly girls living in one of the most remote, eligible-werewolf-bachelor-starved regions in the world\u2014would be thrilled to have such a devoted network of matchmakers, I thought about following in the shoes of Jan Brady and making up my own \u201cGeorge Glass\u201d to get them off my back. Most of their recommendations were either far more interested in becoming the alpha for my pack than in me as a person. Or they were more interested in Samson than they were in me\u2014which was disappointing. Then there were Cro-Magnon wolves who hadn\u2019t quite grasped the whole \u201cfemales are my equal\u201d concept.</p><p>Fun times.</p><p>I was not counting on a love match. Not everybody had a marriage like my parents\u2019. My mother had come from a pack in Oregon. She moved to Alaska after meeting my dad on one of his rare trips to the mainland. He came into her uncle\u2019s garage to get a part for some motorcycle Samson\u2019s dad wanted. My mom was doing the books in the office. She looked up and smiled at him, and he was so distracted by that smile that he walked into a wall. Dad died when I was a baby, but Cooper told me a lot of stories about what I\u2019d missed growing up. The silly jokes, the googly eyes, Dad bringing bunches of wildflowers to her when he came home from a run. He once told Cooper that the trick to a happy life was to find the person you can\u2019t breathe without and marry her.</p><p>How was any guy I chose going to compete with that sort of romantic goo?</p><p>So, given my candidate pool, marriage and kids weren\u2019t exactly things I was looking forward to. I loved Eva. I loved cuddling her, the sweet apple and baby-shampoo smell that radiated from that crazy hair. But the best part was that I could give her back. When the cuteness was over and she had a smelly diaper or a tantrum, I could just claim ignorance and hand her over to Mo, who somehow had the patience needed to deal with stuff like that.</p><p>I was basically a selfish creature. I liked sleeping and being able to leave the house without making sure I had a half-dozen toys and a Baggie full of Cheerios. But not having kids wasn\u2019t an option. For one thing, I wasn\u2019t planning on dying a virgin. And in my family, if you have sex, you\u2019re going to have kids. And second, I sort of owed it to my bloodline to pass the werewolf magic along.</p><p>It seemed blatantly unfair that I seemed to be suffering from some hormone surge when Nick Thatcher came into the picture. Clearly, some wire labeled \u201cDon\u2019t mess around with men who could ruin your life\u201d had short-circuited in my brain. I\u2019d known plenty of guys with big blue eyes, guys with pouty, kissable lips, guys who smelled like Sunday lunch. I\u2019d just never met one who had all three qualities.</p><p>That was the problem. It was all looks. It was my primal brain at work. It wasn\u2019t that he was smart or funny or that he actually managed to thwart me in conversation, which until now, no one but Mo could do. And it definitely wasn\u2019t because I\u2019d developed some weird, creepy, stalker-at-first-fascination thing with him. . .</p><p>Moving on.</p><p>As hard as I tried to shrug off his thrall, Nick just kept popping up, like one of those damn plastic whack-a-moles. First, I found out my cousin, Evie\u2019s husband, Buzz, unaware of his wolfy in-laws\u2019 involvement in the debacle, had given Nick an extensive interview about his search for the killer wolf. Alan Dahling had taken Nick up the mountain to the area where Walt and Hank had shot the huge male timber wolf we were letting the public believe was responsible for the attacks. I had to hand it to Nick, he was good at his job. If you considered being a giant pain in my supernatural ass a job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the final blow? Mo was delivering Tupperwared meals to his house like some cross between a Welcome Wagon and Marie Callender. He tried to pay for it, and she refused to take his money. She considered it some sort of outreach program. I think the point was reaching out to drive me crazy.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d I\u2019d hissed at her over the phone. \u201cI say don\u2019t have anything to do with the nosy outsider, and you start delivering care packages to his door? I can\u2019t get your meat loaf in my freezer, but you\u2019re dropping them on Thatcher\u2019s doorstep with reheating instructions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him at the market the other day, and the poor guy had twenty Banquet dinners in his cart,\u201d Mo said, her voice rising to a disturbing, defensive octave. \u201cDo you have any idea how expensive those things are up here? Plus, they\u2019re all fat and sodium, and he\u2019s too pretty to be allowed to get all bloated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, with all the questions Nick is not so subtly trying to work into conversations, it would look weird and suspicious if I went all silent religious-compound wife whenever he walked into a room. Doesn\u2019t it make more sense that we would remain neighborly?\u201d</p><p>There was silence on my end of the line . . . unless you counted the sound of my teeth grinding.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find a hole in your argument that doesn\u2019t involve me threatening you,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI got nothing.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of questions is he asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, little things, about how Cooper and I got to know each other. He heard from a few of our neighbors that we weren\u2019t exactly an instant love connection. Some of my better insults are fondly remembered. So he\u2019s using \u2018getting to know you\u2019 conversations to ask what turned the tide, what couples around here do to date, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you telling him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mo huffed. \u201cOh, I told him that Cooper showed up on my doorstep with a bear trap clamped around his leg, told me he was a werewolf, and we decided to go steady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa freaking ha.\u201d</p> <p>My sister-in-law was not to be trusted.</p><p>My embarrassment was replaced by annoyance, frustration, a desire to be rid of Nick that bordered on religious. It was obvious that he had been sent to torment me for some horrible wrong I\u2019d committed in a past life.</p><p>I failed to see how turning me into a blithering, sleep-deprived idiot was going to make me a better person. As a concept, karma was ass-backward.</p><p>\u201cOh, good gravy, snap out of it, you loser!\u201d I groaned, thunking my head against the desk.</p><p>\u201cWell, that seems harsh. I just walked in the door,\u201d a voice boomed over me. I looked up to see Samson towering over my desk.</p><p>I snickered, leaning back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cNow, what kind of werewolf doesn\u2019t even notice when her office has been invaded?\u201d Samson smirked, ruffling my hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Midget?\u201d</p><p>My cousin Samson, ladies and gentlemen, the five-year-old trapped in a pro wrestler\u2019s body, the man who gave me the Chuck Norris Fact of the Day calendar on my desk, which was why I tolerated abuse from him more than I would from most people. I loved him just as much as I loved Cooper. His mother had died before I was born, and his dad was a screwup of the first order, abandoning him to live with us when we were just kids. He\u2019d been the one who helped keep me somewhat in line when Cooper left, and as my unofficial second in command, he was the first member of the pack to call me out when I was being a jerk.</p> <p>Well, the first to call me a jerk to my face and walk away without a limp . . . ok, without a permanent limp.</p><p>He walked it off.</p><p>I scowled up at him, but there was no real heat in it. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a midget compared to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make the nickname any less fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the ink isn\u2019t even dry on this yet,\u201d I retorted, pointing to his paycheck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not signed, either,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou only think I don\u2019t pick up on stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, you\u2019ve claimed your thirty pieces of silver, go do something crazy like put gas in that penis replacement you call transportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t mock the truck or my junk,\u201d he said sternly, pointing out the window toward the mammoth F-250 required to haul his ass around. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not compensating for anything if it\u2019s to scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d I shuddered but was grateful for something to think about that did not involve hot outsider eggheads. I was still shuddering in revulsion when a sandy-haired werewolf stuck his head in the door, toting a jam-packed postal box.</p><p>Clay Renard was one of a handful of people in the valley not related to me by blood or marriage. In fact, that handful was pretty much limited to Clay, his widowed sister, Alicia, and her two boys. Clay was a few years younger than me. He was a likable, easygoing sort of guy, friendly and helpful, without being a pain in the ass about it. He was as close to the all-American type as werewolves got, with a strong, square jaw, high, sharp cheekbones, and light blue eyes. Even though his hair was brownish-gold, he had dark eyebrows that served as exclamation points on his open, expressive face. I liked the way they tilted when he smiled. And he had a cute little overbite that caught his bottom lip when he tucked the smile away.</p><p>\u201cHey, Clay, what are you doing with the mail?\u201d I asked, grinning at him.</p><p>Clay shrugged. \u201cSamson was pressed for time, so I stopped by the Grundy post office to pick up the mail for him.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Clay worked in a garage on the outskirts of Grundy. But the errand still meant he had to drive twenty minutes out of his way to do something Samson was supposed to do three times a week.</p><p>\u201cOh, you did, did you?\u201d I narrowed my eyes at my cousin. \u201cYou were pressed for time? Would that be nap time?\u201d Samson shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m giving Clay half of your paycheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I should have made you sign it,\u201d Samson muttered.</p><p>Clay chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I got to stop by the saloon for one of Mo\u2019s burgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, why\u2019d you have to go and mention Mo\u2019s burgers?\u201d Samson moaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, cheer up, buttercup, Mom made chicken and dumplings,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cMeh,\u201d Samson said in a disinterested tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be in soooo much trouble when I tell Mom you said that.\u201d I laughed. Samson cringed. \u201cClay, are you too full to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am never too full for anything,\u201d Clay said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Mom, let her know you\u2019re coming,\u201d I told him. I turned to my cousin. \u201cYou, on the other hand, have some mail to deliver. Jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hand,\u201d Clay said, following a grumbling Samson out the door.</p><p>\u201cSuck-up,\u201d Samson shot back.</p><p>I was in a much brighter mood as I finished up a few housekeeping tasks and closed down my computer. I called my mom to warn her we\u2019d be having a guest for dinner, but she didn\u2019t pick up, which was weird. But Mom always cooked enough to feed an army with Samson around, so I figured we were covered.</p><p>I left my office without bothering to lock it. I mean, seriously, there were sixty people in the village, and they had just as much business going into the building as I did. That was the benefit of being related to nearly everyone you lived with. There was a certain level of trust that was expected. As I walked the whopping half-block to my house, I congratulated myself on finding a pleasant evening\u2019s distraction from plotting the violent demise of one Nicholas Thatcher.</p><p>Clay and I had been on a few friendly outings that didn\u2019t quite qualify as dates. I\u2019d taken him hiking up the north pass, near the elk hunting grounds. We\u2019d gone to see a movie, some date-appropriate Will Ferrell comedy we\u2019d abandoned halfway through in favor of the action flick two theaters down. As a candidate, he was far less complicated than . . . other people, but he was a cautious soul, which I respected.</p><p>Besides Clay, I\u2019d gone on a fix-up or two with boys from other packs in Olympia and Anchorage. It always had this weird game-show feel to it. The grand prize being \u201clifelong mated bliss and a half-dozen purebred werewolf pups.\u201d And then I realized that the reason these guys needed to be fixed up by the interpack dating service wasn\u2019t the scarcity of female candidates but the fact that they were obnoxious, stupid, or creepy\u2014or all of the above.</p><p>Every once in a while, I thought an entrepreneurial were should set up some sort of online supernatural dating service. But, you know, that is the sort of thing that attracts attention. Some smartass little hacker would get into it, and next thing you know, there\u2019d be a complete list of supernatural creatures in America, and some nut job might take it seriously and go Van Helsing on our asses.</p><p>I spotted Clay\u2019s truck in my great-aunt Billie\u2019s driveway and decided to duck in to tell Alicia that her brother would be at our place for dinner. I took a few deep breaths before I knocked. Visiting Billie was always sort of awkward. Besides being a murderous, back-stabbing traitor, her son, my alpha predecessor, Eli, had also been the primary caretaker for Billie. Between setting us up for a takeover with another pack, attacking humans at random to drive Cooper away, and trying to kill Mo, I honestly don\u2019t know how he found time for it all.</p><p>Billie had dementia, a rare affliction among werewolves, and it had wiped her once-sharp mind like a slate. She needed almost constant care to keep her from phasing and running away. The last time she did this, she was found wandering naked in human form at the grocery store in Grundy.</p><p>The pack didn\u2019t hold a grudge against Billie for her son\u2019s actions. As the mate of my grandfather\u2019s late brother, James, she would always be considered one of us. And while the rest of the pack was more than willing to take over her care, it seemed right when Clay and Alicia, Billie\u2019s niece and nephew, left their pack in Ontario a few months before to move in with her. They were a welcome addition to the group; they were smart and hardworking, and they could hunt like nobody\u2019s business.</p><p>Still, considering that it was Cooper who brought Eli down, with my help, I always felt little twinges of guilt when talking to Billie, even though she probably had no idea that Eli was gone.</p><p>I knocked a little harder on the front door, but there was no answer. Nudging it open, I could hear a cartoon blaring from the living room. Someone was moving around in the kitchen. \u201cHello?\u201d I called.</p><p>Paul, Alicia\u2019s youngest, toddled up to me. His four-year-old brother, Ronnie, sat mesmerized by dancing animated bears. The boys didn\u2019t resemble Alicia or Clay with their white-blond hair and huge brown eyes. But they were adorable. Sort of sticky and always had runny noses, but adorable. \u201cUp!\u201d Paul commanded, tugging on my jeans. I slid my hands under his arms and hoisted him onto my hip as I walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNana?\u201d he said, his tone hopeful as he eyed the fruit bowl on the counter.</p><p>Billie was in a rumpled blue and green plaid housedress, her thick white hair tumbling around her face. She was shuffling back and forth between the cabinet and her counter, spreading peanut butter on six slices of bread. I peeled a banana for Paul, which he promptly devoured.</p><p>\u201cAunt Billie?\u201d I murmured quietly.</p><p>She turned, her deep brown eyes focused and alert but vacant. Whatever she was seeing, it wasn\u2019t what I was seeing. She smiled, her still-smooth cheeks dimpling prettily.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie, honey, have you seen Eli?\u201d Billie asked, topping each of her half-dozen sandwiches. \u201cYou need to tell him it\u2019s time for lunch. He can go out and play with Samson and Cooper later.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the little lump in my throat and nodded. \u201cOK, Aunt Billie, I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting the crusts off for him,\u201d she said, adding the sandwiches to a massive pile on the counter. I found myself blinking back against hot, wet pressure in my eyes. Sure, Eli had turned out kind of evil, but he was still my cousin. I\u2019d grown up with him. I could remember the afternoons that had trapped Billie\u2019s mind. I could remember him as a little boy, arguing with Cooper and Samson over who had to be Aquaman when they played Justice League. And I\u2019d taken a part in killing that little boy. It was a weight on my heart that wouldn\u2019t go away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Alicia said, nearly dropping her laundry basket as she came through the kitchen door. Alicia was a compact little female, with short-cropped dark blond hair. She smiled, seeming relieved that the surprise guest in her kitchen was me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Alicia, I just stopped by to see how Billie\u2019s doing. I knocked, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the laundry room,\u201d she said, putting the laundry basket on the table and surveying the gummy mess on her counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you. Did Maggie give you a \u2019nana, little man?\u201d</p> <p>Paul grinned at her, his cheeks puffed out with fruit. \u201cNana!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay\u2019s going to be at our place for dinner,\u201d I told her. \u201cDid you want to join us?\u201d</p><p>Alicia smiled, ruffling Paul\u2019s hair. \u201cThanks, but we\u2019ve got a pretty good routine going. And any interruption to that routine kind of sets Billie off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this sort of thing happen often?\u201d I asked, setting Paul down as he strained toward the living room. I\u2019d served my purpose as the \u2019nana provider, and the theme music for Barney was starting up. It\u2019s hard to compete with that chipper purple bastard.</p><p>Alicia shrugged, giving me a tired smile. \u201cShe has good days and bad. Today hasn\u2019t been a good day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you guys need anything?\u201d</p><p>The village kept an account to pay for most of the pack\u2019s seniors\u2019 groceries and medicine, including Billie\u2019s. Alicia moved to a little Filofax by the phone and handed me a short stack of receipts for reimbursement. She watched as Billie continued to make sandwiches. \u201cWell, it looks like we need more bread and peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>Billie turned, as if she was just now registering Alicia\u2019s presence. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked, suspicion creeping into her voice. \u201cWhat are you doing in my kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Alicia sighed, and smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m Alicia. I\u2019m your sister Judy\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you!\u201d Billie cried, throwing the butter knife across the room at her. Alicia plucked it out of the air, looking tired and worn.</p><p>\u201cShe does this at least once a day,\u201d Alicia told me. \u201cI\u2019m your niece, Aunt Billie. We\u2019re here to help take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you! I don\u2019t know you!\u201d Billie yelled, throwing herself toward me. \u201cMaggie, make her go away. Tell Eli. Tell him I don\u2019t want her in my house! I don\u2019t want strangers in my house!\u201d</p><p>I looked to Alicia for guidance. She was more accustomed to Billie\u2019s episodes than I was. Looking sort of tired and resigned, Alicia reached up into one of the cabinets and pulled out a pill bottle. She put a little white tablet in my hand with a juice box. \u201cNap,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cBillie, we\u2019ll get this all straightened out, OK?\u201d I said, putting my arm around her and leading her to her room. The dresser was dusty. And the sheets looked as if they hadn\u2019t been changed in a while. Alicia wasn\u2019t much of a housekeeper. Then again, I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to keep up with two toddlers and a senile werewolf who occasionally played knife thrower.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d Billie whispered. \u201cTell Eli I don\u2019t want her in the house, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised. \u201cBut why don\u2019t you just stay here in your room for a while, get some rest? Eli and I will work this out.\u201d</p><p>I handed her the pill, which she took without a fuss, and she drank the juice. I lifted her legs onto the bed and pulled the blankets up to her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Maggie,\u201d Billie said, her voice slurring slightly from the pill\u2019s effects. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Eli says.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThanks, Aunt Billie.\u201d</p><p>I walked home, feeling a bit deflated. Alicia\u2019s intentions were good, but she was stretched so thin. Billie wasn\u2019t exactly cooperative. And Clay didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with the kids. I started composing a schedule in my head, arranging for the aunties to come by and give Alicia a break\u2014give her some help with Billie and maybe even watch the boys, so Alicia could do some errands or just go for a run.</p> <p>I stomped the mud off my boots and shucked them near the front door, knowing better than to track dirt into Grace Graham\u2019s house. I might be the baddest, toughest wolf in my pack, but there are still times when my mother can make me cower like a newborn pup.</p><p>Mom never had much money while we were growing up, but her home was a showplace. The living room was meticulously clean, decorated with scattered photos of Cooper, Samson, and me in various stages of childhood. The walls were a warm, creamy color. A bright blue throw rug was settled comfortably in front of a large brick fireplace. On the mantle were three carved wooden wolves that Cooper made with his own hands. The house pulled you in, made you feel instantly at ease and at home. While other wolves might disarm you with fangs or claws, my mother did it with kind words and good meals.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good!\u201d I called, inhaling the scent of my mother\u2019s chicken and dumplings. She served huge vats of it with fresh, crusty sourdough and as much of her homemade applesauce as you could eat. \u201cI hope it\u2019s OK, we\u2019re going to have some company for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know!\u201d she called back. \u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I rounded the corner and heard Nick Thatcher in mid-sentence, \u201cThere are a lot of theories about where exactly the line between man and animal is drawn. Psychologically, spiritually, physically. Where do the two lines split on the evolutionary scale? Is the missing link some step along the way? Or could legends that link man and animal be signs of a step forward? A mix of the best of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>Nick freaking Thatcher was sitting at my kitchen table while my mother served him chamomile tea and a piece of her special apple cake. My favorite apple cake.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Is nothing sacred?\u201d I howled.</p><p>Faced with my mental tormentor, the interrupter of sleep, and his head-clouding scent, I\u2019d expected to feel awkward and bashful again. But mostly, I felt anger. Sweet, clarifying anger. Who the hell did he think he was, waltzing into my valley, with his stupid feet under my table, eating my freaking cake?</p><p>His feet did look awfully big, I noticed, biting my lip. And from what I could gather from a lifetime spent around men who were comfortable in the nude, the old wives\u2019 tales about foot size tended to be accurate.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Focus, Maggie, I commanded my wandering brain. My eyelid actually twitched when he looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maggie, it\u2019s nice to see you again,\u201d he said, smiling so sweetly I thought I might need insulin.</p><p>\u201cYour work sounds so interesting, Nick,\u201d Mom said, ignoring my outburst and turning back to the stove to stir the contents of a huge iron pot. \u201cBut how do you even study something like that?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cEyewitness accounts. As many police reports as I can get my hands on. Local legends. Scientists tend to downplay the importance of oral history.\u201d</p><p>While he ticked down the list with his long, strong fingers, my mouth went dry. My worst fears were confirmed. He was just smart enough to be dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I demanded, tired of being ignored.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought we got off on the wrong foot the other day, so I wanted to come by and try to make a better second impression. Your mom was nice enough to keep me company while I waited and serve me some of this delicious cake.\u201d</p><p>I scowled. I had to stop thinking about the cake. And Nick. And Nick smeared in cake icing. I glared at my mother. Clearly, this conspiracy was wider spread than I thought. I gritted my teeth and reached for my mother\u2019s cake plate.</p><p>\u201cNo cake for you,\u201d Mom said, smacking my hand away. \u201cYou\u2019ll spoil your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has some!\u201d I pointed out, shaking my smarting fingers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guest.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at Nick while he smarmily chewed on a big bite of cake.</p><p>He would pay for this. Dearly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to ask about your brother\u2019s suggestion that you\u2019d show me around. I\u2019d be more than happy to pay you whatever you\u2019d charge for guiding me around the trails. I\u2019ve hiked around a little bit myself. But I haven\u2019t seen much in the way of wildlife. Your brother has such a solid reputation in the field guide community, I was hoping you might show me the best places to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t have the time,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cNick, you\u2019re going to stay for dinner, yes?\u201d Mom asked, stirring the huge vat of chicken and dumplings on the stove. She had a knack for relieving the tension in a room by pretending my rudeness away with cooking. Many, many chickens had given up their lives to cover my conversational shortcomings.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I know you have better manners than that.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Mom was right. Werewolves have this whole thing about hospitality and making sure that guests are safe and well served. Guests never left werewolf land hungry or unhappy. I was behaving very badly, and I should have been ashamed, even if I wanted to make him swallow that stupid Yankees cap along with my cake.</p><p>I cleared my throat, recognizing when my mother had been pushed too far. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What I meant to say was that Samson already invited Clay for dinner,\u201d I said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Nick to be uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Nick said, his cheek dimpling.</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d I hissed under my breath.</p><p>He smirked at me and pushed back from the table, pausing to scrape one last bite from the plate. Just to irritate me. \u201cI\u2019d love to stay, Gracie. And as much as I appreciate the invitation, I\u2019ve got to head back to Grundy before it gets dark,\u201d he said, packing his little notebook into his messenger bag. \u201cI\u2019m moving out of the motel into a rental place in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRental place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Gogan set it up for me,\u201d he said, hitching his bag onto his shoulder. \u201cI think the owner\u2019s name is Quinn?\u201d</p><p>My lip rippled back from my teeth just a tiny bit. Susie Q had been the first person Eli attacked the year before. She\u2019d had to move in with her daughter in Texas because of her injuries. I wondered if he\u2019d chosen the house on purpose or if it was a coincidence. More important, renting a house meant Nick was planning to stay in Grundy for more than just a \u201clittle research trip.\u201d And despite the fact that I knew this was a bad thing, I couldn\u2019t help but be a little happy about it.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cCould I have a rain check?\u201d he asked my mother.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Anytime you\u2019re close by, come on over,\u201d she said, shaking his hand. \u201cIt was lovely to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice boy,\u201d Mom told me as Nick shrugged into his jacket and moved toward the front door. \u201cHe has good manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot invite a man into your home just because he calls you ma\u2019am,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he has eyes the color of the morning sky and a butt that won\u2019t quit?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEw, Mom!\u201d</p><p>She lowered her voice to a range only she and I could hear. \u201cI\u2019m middle-aged, sweetheart. I\u2019m not dead.\u201d</p><p>My mother had been widowed young, and she hadn\u2019t been on so much as a movie date since. It was starting to show. Filing that under \u201cproblems I have to solve before they become psychologically traumatic,\u201d I followed Nick onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to pull,\u201d I told him as he took the steps. \u201cBut I want you to stay away from the valley. You\u2019ll scare the locals . . . or annoy them into kicking your ass.\u201d</p><p>He seemed honestly insulted, frowning up at me and pouting those soft-looking, pouty, full, pouty lips . . . and there went my train of thought. . .</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m a fairly likable person. I could get you testimonials from a half-dozen or so people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t count,\u201d I spat.</p><p>He objected, \u201cYour mom should count twice. She loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cWhy are you here, Dr. Thatcher? Why are you so hell-bent on spending time around me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re funny and prickly, which works for me. You know you\u2019re beautiful, but you don\u2019t seem to care about it all that much. And your bullshit tolerance is low\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should realize that I\u2019m not buying your answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He lowered his voice and leaned ever so slightly toward me. We were at eye level and so close I could feel his warm, frosting-scented breath fanning over my cheek, making my mouth water. I could almost feel the burnt-gold strands of his hair brushing against my skin. \u201cBesides hoping to charm you into a date, which is obviously not working, you know exactly why I\u2019m here, Maggie. Your family can\u2019t expect to protect Mo forever.\u201d</p><p>Insert awkward pause in which I stare at Nick as if he\u2019s whistling \u201cO Canada\u201d out of his left nostril.</p><p>\u201cWait . . . what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour sister-in-law has been sweet, polite, downright hospitable. But she has an uncanny way of wiggling out of answering questions.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Mo was way smarter than I gave her credit for. But I would never, ever tell her that to her face. I scoffed. \u201cWhy would you even talk to Mo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I studied the reports for the wolf attacks last year. Do you realize that besides the occasional bar fight, there\u2019s nothing in the state police reports even mentioning Grundy for the last two years until Mo reported being attacked by a trucker named John Teague?\u201d he asked. I gave a noncommittal nod, so he just barreled on. \u201cAnd then, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a rash of wolf attacks around town. And wolf attacks are pretty rare. Wolves don\u2019t normally come close enough to humans to attack them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re sick, which was Alan Dahling\u2019s theory about the timber wolf Walt and Hank shot last year,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThat wolf wasn\u2019t nearly big enough to leave the bite marks left on Abner Golightly. And it certainly wasn\u2019t big enough to kill two fully grown hikers,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, everything seemed to start with Mo. And she was connected to each of the attacks thereafter. She took in Susan Quinn\u2019s dog. The missing hikers ate at the saloon just before they disappeared. She found Abner in the woods. Everything comes back to her. I think that Mo could be something more than human. And I think you and your family are helping her cover it up.\u201d</p><p>If he was trying to imply that Mo was a werewolf, I was going to pee myself laughing. Wait, I think I was going to do that anyway. I had propped myself against the siding and was trying to contain the loud, hiccupping guffaws. \u201cSo, you think my sister-in-law, the shorthand cook, loving wife, and mother, is a werewolf?\u201d</p> <p>Somehow he managed to say with a straight face, \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that John Teague was a werewolf and that somehow, when he attacked Mo, he changed her.\u201d</p><p>And now I was back to laughing. \u201cThat is the dumbest thing I have ever heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? There are shape-shifting legends found in almost every civilization. The Central Asian stories about snakes that could assume human form and the Japanese kitsune, fox spirits that were able to become beautiful women. When you go westward, you find the Wendigo, the Deer Woman, skinwalkers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do my with my sister-in-law supposedly wolfing out and terrorizing the townsfolk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t Mo talk to me about the attack, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>My laughter died as if he\u2019d flipped a switch. From what I understood, Mo had been closing up the saloon last year, alone, and John Teague decided she was a prime target for robbery and possibly way more disturbing activities. He\u2019d knocked her around when she wouldn\u2019t cooperate, leaving her with bruises and scrapes across her face. She\u2019d managed to get a few good licks in before my brother swooped in on four paws and saved the day. Mo didn\u2019t connect human-shaped Cooper to the wolf at the time and thought maybe her furry savior had eaten Teague. However, Teague had managed to make it to his truck, then passed out from his injuries and died in a fiery crash outside town.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t talk to you about it because she won\u2019t talk to anyone about it,\u201d I growled. \u201cDo you realize that most people in Grundy don\u2019t even know about that night? Mo didn\u2019t want a big fuss, the questions, the pitying looks. She just wanted to go on with her life. And then you come along with your questions, stirring everything up again. You\u2019re surprised she\u2019s not just hopping up and down to give you the full Barbara Walters treatment?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, a flash of shame flickered across Nick\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize. She seems so sturdy, you know? No-nonsense. I just . . . That doesn\u2019t change what happened after the Teague incident. It doesn\u2019t explain why she was so close to every wolf attack that followed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit happens!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWe live in the middle of one of the biggest untamed wildernesses left on earth. We\u2019re bound to run into animals every once in a while. Sometimes there are no explanations! No matter how hard you try to force it to fit one of your bullshit theories, there\u2019s just no explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always an explanation,\u201d he countered, color rising into his cheeks as he stepped closer. I could hear his heart beat in his chest, practically hear the blood humming through his veins as we stood nose-to-nose. \u201cSometimes you have to sift through a couple of \u2018bullshit theories\u2019 before you find the right one, but eventually something clicks. If you would just explain to Mo that I don\u2019t mean any harm. If anything, I want to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says she needs help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, why are you being so difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s fun!\u201d I shot back.</p><p>Nick tilted his head back and groaned in frustration.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, are you driving another guy over the edge?\u201d Samson asked from behind me.</p><p>I looked over to find Samson and Clay smirking at us. Well, Samson was smirking. Clay seemed to be glaring a little bit. Nick turned and made a motion to introduce himself to Samson, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cDr. Thatcher was just leaving,\u201d I told them.</p><p>Samson\u2019s face hardened at the mention of his name, and Nick, wisely, drew his hand back. Samson muttered, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Cooper had filled Samson in.</p><p>\u201cClay, why don\u2019t you go inside?\u201d I said. \u201cMom\u2019s just setting the table. You, too, Samson.\u201d</p><p>Clay moved past me, his hand squeezing mine, and warm little tingles sizzled up my arm. He shot Nick a curious look before walking through the door. Moving after Clay, Samson didn\u2019t break eye contact with Nick, who couldn\u2019t seem to understand the sudden shift in demeanor. It would have been far more impressive if Samson hadn\u2019t nearly walked into the doorjamb headlong.</p><p>\u201cSo, that guy in there, Clay,\u201d he said, jerking his head toward the door. \u201cAre you dating him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is my possessive, recently paroled fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cSo . . . no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHow did we go from \u2018Your sister-in-law\u2019s a werewolf\u2019 to \u2018Are you seeing anyone?\u2019 Can\u2019t you just have one conversation at a time, like a normal person?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and gave me another beautiful, irritating smile. \u201cI\u2019ll call you in a few days, to see if you change your mind about the guide thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t change my mind, because you are clearly insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you then,\u201d he said, shrugging as he hopped into his truck. \u201cAnd ask you out on a proper date. Your mom gave me your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t answer!\u201d I called as he turned the ignition and waved before speeding off. I huffed out a breath. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Of Mistaken Identities and Wounded Ass Cheeks</p><p>COOPER DIDN\u2019T LOOK HAPPY when he answered his door\u2014probably because I was beating on it. A lot.</p><p>\u201cIf you wake up the baby, I will smack you down like the hand of God,\u201d he growled as I moved past him, deliberately shoulder-checking him.</p><p>I was in a foul mood. Despite his easy promise that he would, Nick had not called. It had been two days, and not a peep. I can\u2019t say I was sitting by the phone staring it down, but there were a few times I ran across the room to grab for it when it did ring. I also might have unplugged and replugged it a few times to make sure it was working, but I will never admit that to a living soul.</p><p>This was unacceptable. I was Maggie Fucking Graham. I did not get wound up over some man. Yet here I was, twitching and pacing across my brother\u2019s living room, with no idea what stupid excuse I would make for coming over beyond \u201cI\u2019m confused, and I want to hit something.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, the tension breaker I needed came in the form of Mo stumbling into the room wearing what looked like a sports bra, one of Cooper\u2019s flannel shirts, and some basketball shorts. Her hair was pulled into one of those weird shih tzu puffs on top of her head. She blinked at me blearily. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I recoiled. \u201cGah! Is that outfit what you\u2019re doing for birth control now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she grumbled, pulling the ponytail out and fluffing her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, because the ponytail was the problem.\u201d I snorted. She punched my arm and yawned. I chuffed and shoved her back.</p><p>\u201cSo, what brings you to our door at this time of night, besides insulting me?\u201d she asked, handing me one of the many bathrobes she kept on hand for when I dropped over on a run. She had this thing about not wanting naked people on her upholstery. Prude.</p><p>Clothing can make life awkward for werewolves, for whom the most comfortable state is to be in wolf form. In an environment where we\u2019re relaxed, sometimes we don\u2019t even realize we\u2019ve changed. There\u2019s a shift of light, and suddenly there\u2019s a full-grown wolf standing next to you. It\u2019s difficult to change form while dressed. At the same time, adult werewolves become conditioned to associate clothing with being out in public among humans. It becomes less of an issue for us as the weather gets colder, but for southern packs, clothing is handy as a reminder to stay on two feet.</p><p>You would think it would be weird to see your male relatives running around naked all the time, but really, you stop noticing. It\u2019s sort of sad, really. You\u2019ve seen one penis, you\u2019ve seen them all.</p><p>I had to stop saying that in front of my mother, because she said it was something a hooker would put on a business card.</p><p>Cooper flopped down on the couch, throwing his arm over his eyes. Mo slumped next to him and buried her face in his shoulder. There was a fond little twitch to his lips as he nuzzled his nose along her brow line.</p><p>Gag me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seven-thirty!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, as much as I appreciate your dropping by to call us lame, please get to the point,\u201d he muttered. \u201cKeeping in mind that if you raise your voice above a whisper\u2014\u201d He stopped and gave a jaw-cracking yawn while waving his right palm at me. \u201cHand of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d I muttered, showing my big brother exactly how much he intimidated me. \u201cI thought you should know that Nick doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Cooper sat up, his brow furrowed. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing, right? Problem solved, you can go home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks Mo is a werewolf,\u201d I said, biting my lip and waiting for the reaction that would, indeed, wake up my niece.</p><p>Cooper locked eyes with me, looked over at his wife, grinned at me again, and then laughed so hard he nearly toppled off the couch.</p><p>\u201cBwahahahaahaha!\u201d Cooper guffawed. \u201cHe thinks . . . he thinks . . . Mo?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mo threw up her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s that funny!\u201d</p><p>Mo\u2019s indignant hiss was just what I needed to double over laughing. \u201cGrr!\u201d I gave a exaggerated fake growl. \u201cI\u2019m Mo, fierce predator. I could catch you if my designer thong wasn\u2019t riding up!\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cOr how about, \u2018I\u2019m Mo, the baking werewolf. I\u2019ll stuff you so full of chess squares you won\u2019t be able to run away!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Mo asked in a dead, flat voice.</p><p>Cooper sucked in a breath. \u201cSorry, baby, it\u2019s the sleep deprivation. It\u2019s getting to me.\u201d His face flushed as he spluttered. \u201cNope, I have one more.\u201d Mo scowled at him. He bit his lip, suppressing a snicker. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cCan we get back to why Nick thinks I\u2019m a wolf, please?\u201d</p><p>I wiped at my eyes while she stared daggers at both of us. \u201cWhew. Sorry, I have to catch my breath. He, ahem, he thinks John Teague turned you into a werewolf and then you were on some sort of Wolf-man rampage across the countryside,\u201d I said, rubbing the ache in my side.</p><p>\u201cAnd what stopped my rampage, exactly?\u201d she asked dryly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Cooper,\u201d I said, a giggle escaping my tightly pressed lips. \u201cHe saved you from yourself. And we, your loving human in-laws, are helping you suppress your homicidal urges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s awfully nice of us,\u201d Cooper said blandly.</p><p>\u201cActually, we can use this,\u201d Mo said, sitting up, getting that \u201cI\u2019ve got a project\u201d expression that always scared the hell out of me. \u201cI\u2019ll just start eating raw meat, standing out in the street, howling at the moon. It will totally throw him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and then we\u2019ll go into Susie\u2019s attic, rattle some chains, and make him think the house is haunted,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSusie Quinn\u2019s place?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s renting it.\u201d</p> <p>Mo frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of ghoulish. Besides, how would we even get into Susie\u2019s attic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I hadn\u2019t considered that. I got sort of hung up on the fact that this means he\u2019s going to be here for a while. Which is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not good,\u201d Cooper said, scratching his bare stomach and shuffling into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m getting something to eat. Mags, pecan pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m insulted you have to ask,\u201d I told him as he unloaded one of Mo\u2019s calorie-laden pie plates from the fridge. He cut two huge slabs and brought one to me.</p><p>Mo eyed the pie with longing, obviously thinking of the postbaby weight she was still shedding. \u201cI hate you and your damned werewolf metabolism.\u201d</p><p>Cooper offered his wife a little bite of pie, which was quite a concession for a wolf. We generally don\u2019t share food if we can help it. She took a tiny birdlike nibble, which we all knew wouldn\u2019t satisfy her. But the gesture on Cooper\u2019s part was the important thing.</p><p>As was his habit, Cooper asked about Mom, Samson, Pops, the cranky aunties in the bridge club, and the kids who kept dipping tobacco behind the school. I told him that I\u2019d solved the underage \u201cchaw\u201d problem the same way Pops had when he caught Cooper and Samson dipping when they were twelve. I let our young cousins Ricky and Benjamin finish off the can of Red Man they\u2019d swiped from my uncle Steve, indulging until they were an unpleasant avocado color and finally upchucking violently while they paid Steve back for the stolen can.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never dip again. Trust me.\u201d Cooper shuddered. \u201cAnd how\u2019s Aunt Billie doing?\u201d</p> <p>The teasing smile evaporated from my face. \u201cGood days and bad. Alicia says she\u2019ll be lucid one minute and then freaking out the next. Or she just sits in a chair staring into nothing. I always seem to stop by when she\u2019s having a bad spell, and sometimes I find myself trying to find reasons not to go over, which, of course, makes me feel even worse for taking advantage of Alicia and Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot on your plate,\u201d Cooper told me, squeezing my shoulder. \u201cAnd I know your ego and your God-given stubbornness make you think you can do it all. But it\u2019s natural to want to try to find ways to lessen the load. Billie\u2019s family, and you\u2019re going to do right by her no matter what. Don\u2019t feel guilty for letting Alicia and Clay shoulder some of the burden. They\u2019re her family, too. You\u2019re no good to anybody if you\u2019re worn down to nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I admitted softly, picking at the pie.</p><p>\u201cI would say I\u2019m proud of how you\u2019re handling yourself as alpha, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d sock me one for being a sissy,\u201d he said, nudging my arm.</p><p>I nodded but nudged him back.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Clay, how are you two doing?\u201d Cooper asked, trying and failing to seem nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d I said, my brow crinkled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Lee dropped by yesterday. With a moose carcass,\u201d he added, chuckling nastily. \u201cI just thought maybe Clay should be told about his competition.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, which made Cooper that much happier.</p><p>Big, brawny, and without discernible brain function, Lee Whitaker was my uncle Frank\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s son, raised in a pack eighty miles west of the valley. He\u2019d been thrown in my face as a potential mate since I was, oh . . . born.</p><p>We went out on two measly dates, one of which was dinner at his mother\u2019s house. And Lee seemed to think our getting married was already sewn up. He tried to monopolize my time at any and all gatherings between our packs. I once spent an entire Memorial Day pretending to have pinkeye just to keep him away.</p><p>Lee had good intentions but was dumb as a post. He also had some strange ideas about what he would be \u201centitled\u201d to as my husband. He seemed to think I would be just handing the reins of my pack over to him, that I was just waiting for a big, strong man like him to sweep me off my feet so I never had to worry my little head with decisions like what to eat for breakfast or whether to go outside.</p><p>Clearly, he had never paid attention when I spoke.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been Uncle Frank\u2019s favorite nephew, I would have just beaten the hell out of him and sent him on his way. But Uncle Frank, my dad\u2019s brother, had always been \u201csensitive\u201d about his position in the pack. He resented the fact that Cooper had assumed the alpha role so young and felt that he hadn\u2019t been given a fair shot. Which was sort of ridiculous, because he wasn\u2019t even in the running. He protested\u2014loudly\u2014when Eli took over Cooper\u2019s leadership role and became an all-around pain in Eli\u2019s ass. Believing that I would one day marry Lee and give him some sort of power base within the pack had kept him quiet under my leadership. So, I put up with Lee and his blithe advances and contented myself with giving him minor injuries whenever he tried to touch me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve meant to ask, is there a significance to the moose carcass?\u201d Mo asked. \u201cBeyond \u2018ew\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLee is officially opening negotiations for Maggie\u2019s paw,\u201d Cooper said, his eyes glinting gleefully.</p><p>I huffed, gritting my teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s so insulting, and just like him. He shouldn\u2019t be coming to you to negotiate for my hand. He should be coming to me. I\u2019m your alpha, not the other way around. Not to mention the fact that he\u2019s a big pain in my ass, and I will never, ever . . . ever, marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if he was the last fertile werewolf on earth?\u201d Cooper prodded.</p><p>I growled. \u201cHe would have to be the very last,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I would look into artificial insemination.\u201d</p><p>Cooper nearly choked on his pie, trying to contain his laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself,\u201d I barked.</p><p>\u201cI really am,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cJust so you know, I told him that if he wanted to marry you, he was going to have to talk to you about it. He just shrugged and said he\u2019d get around to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this was completely unhelpful. I\u2019m leaving now,\u201d I told them. \u201cEnjoy the many, many hours left in the evening, none of which you will spend sleeping. And I don\u2019t mean that in the fun way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was mean,\u201d Cooper told me. I blew him a raspberry and waved good-bye to Mo. As I walked out, I made like I was going to shut the door quietly, then slammed it at the last minute. I counted to three and waited for the baby to wail.</p><p>Just before I phased, I heard Mo mutter through the door, \u201cIf we\u2019d moved to Australia when I suggested it, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT DAY, Nick still hadn\u2019t called. I\u2019d gone from making excuses for him to sitting at my desk, enjoying imagined scenarios where he might have been digested by a bear.</p><p>I ran past Susie Quinn\u2019s place on my way home from Cooper and Mo\u2019s . . . just because it was on my way. Seeing the warm, homey light shining through the windows, I\u2019d paused. I\u2019d sat on my haunches at the edge of the tree line. And I\u2019d felt like a creepy stalker. But through that disquieting interest, I\u2019d felt better, settled, to be sitting there, knowing he was inside, safe and well. When Cooper and I had started talking again the year before, he\u2019d described his compulsive habit of running past Mo\u2019s house while he was wolfed out, feeling at peace for the first time since he\u2019d left the valley. He said it was like the primal part of his brain was leading him there every night, just to be near her. He\u2019d been torn up for years over leaving home, and with Mo, he was given a little glimpse of tranquillity. And when they stopped being idiots and admitted that they were crazy for each other, that contentment had become part of his everyday life.</p><p>After watching Nick\u2019s house, I\u2019d woken up and felt calm, warm. I usually woke up thinking of all the things I had to get done, my mind racing and raring to get started. But the moment my eyes had popped open, I felt . . . light, I guess. I stretched under the covers and smiled into my pillow, reveling in the feeling of serenity washing over me.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>I forced myself to jump out of bed, to go through my normal routines. I kept trying to recapture my normal patterns and feelings. I knew it sounded like one of Mo\u2019s lame pop-psychology rants, but in the absence of that anxiety, I was a little depressed. I\u2019d never realized how much pressure I put on myself. The idea that Nick was somehow a solution to a problem that I didn\u2019t know I had was upsetting.</p><p>My mental self-torture was interrupted when my cousin Will stuck his grizzled brown head through my office door. Will was one of my gruffer cousins, quick with the sarcasm and quicker to attack if a packmate was threatened. He\u2019d married Angie, a wry, blond female from a Seattle-area pack, and produced two towheaded little boys, the only wolf boys to be born to our pack in the last five years.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maggie,\u201d Will said, tossing me a Baggie of Angie\u2019s famous oatmeal-raisin cookies. I opened the bag and inhaled the heavenly, spicy fragrance before shoving one into my mouth. Angie was known to shove dozens of cookies into Will\u2019s coat pockets before he left for the day. If he hadn\u2019t married her, he probably would have had to fight Samson and half the valley\u2019s male population for her, just for the potential cookie privileges.</p><p>\u201cI was just running along the east border, and there\u2019s a hiker up there. Seems harmless enough, but I thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlond?\u201d I asked, frowning. I held my hand far over my head. \u201cYea tall? Looks like a hot, annoying Viking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to that,\u201d Will said, shaking his head, taking a cookie for himself. \u201cNot without you making fun of me later. But yeah, I think that would cover it.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cDid he see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I was being all stealthy-like,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m like a ninja with fur. Quiet, quick, and a mind like a steel trap.\u201d He tapped his temple and winked at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, steel traps are scary and dangerous, too,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He laughed, and I told him to go on home. I shed my clothes, phased, and ran toward the east border. I might not have been as big as Samson or as strong as Cooper, but no one in the pack could match me for speed. Still, I kept my pace even, light. I didn\u2019t want Nick to hear me coming.</p><p>What did he think he was doing? Forget the all-out rudeness of coming to my valley\u2014again\u2014without so much as stopping in town to let us know he was tromping around in our backyard. He was supposed to be touring the eastern Wheeler range. What was Nick looking for? He thought Mo was the wolf, so what was he doing up there instead of in Grundy?</p> <p>Werewolves in the movies always had some convenient crypt or basement where they locked themselves up during the change. Did he think we had some bunker carved out for Mo in the woods somewhere? Did her family think we spent three nights a month tossing her rabbit carcasses and hoping for the best? The more I thought about it, the more his whole \u201cMo as a werewolf\u201d scenario insulted me. Nothing about Mo screamed predatory or even vaguely threatening, unless you cut her off from chocolate. I was the tough one. I was the one who could take care of myself. I\u2019d spent most of my life defining myself by those qualities. Why didn\u2019t he see them in me?</p><p>This level of introspection could not be healthy. This was why I avoided self-help books.</p><p>I found him sitting on a rock, overlooking the valley. There was a backpack beside him on the ground, and he had a big coil of neon orange rope attached to it, with some carabiners and a few climbing blocks. He\u2019d said he was a climber; was he planning on rappelling down the rock wall? That seemed like a rude thing to do in someone\u2019s backyard without permission.</p><p>At the moment, he seemed content to sit. He could see everything from this spot, the green expanse of the valley walls, the thick forest that sheltered us from the harsher winds coming down the mountain and provided the rich supply of game we needed to keep the pack fed. It was a spot Cooper often used for \u201cthinking,\u201d a.k.a. \u201cgetting the hell away from Maggie and Samson for a few minutes of peace.\u201d I\u2019d come here a few times, but I always got my best ideas while running.</p><p>And there sat Nick, scribbling in that notebook again with a silly grin on his face.</p> <p>Under the shelter of low-hanging spruce, I sat on my haunches and watched him. I watched the light and the wind play against his hair. Damn it, the sight of his wire-rim glasses sliding down his nose was bringing out some sort of professor fetish that I didn\u2019t even know I had. My heart did this weird skittering thing, as if it was going to jump out of my chest and run away. I really needed to get this thing under control,</p><p>He turned suddenly and saw me.</p><p>The smartest thing to do would be to bolt, as a real wolf would do. But I just sat there frozen, staring at him. His face. There was such an expression of joy there, stretching his smile from ear to ear. I wasn\u2019t one to throw around pretentious phrases like \u201cchildlike wonder,\u201d but it was the only way to describe his face. Moving with slow, deliberate steps, he hunched down and stretched his hand out toward me.</p><p>Innocent wonder or no, if he tried to scratch behind my ears, I was so going to bite him.</p><p>\u201cMo?\u201d he whispered, smiling down at me. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>I huffed and stepped back. He retracted the hand. \u201cWait!\u201d he called as I backed into the tree line. \u201cMo?\u201d</p> <p>Mo? He looked at me that way, left me hanging for days on end, and now he thought I was Mo? I growled, the low, threatening sound resonating deep in my chest. This was beyond messed up. He flirted with me in human form and had a weird little werewolf crush on my sister-in-law.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t this a story line in one of those lame-ass teen-vampire movies?</p><p>I was the one who\u2019d spent weeks doing a sad little avoidance shuffle around him. And he was thinking of Mo? Not happening.</p><p>I cantered back over to him, huffing at him to get his attention. We locked eyes, and I did my best to glare at him, which is difficult to do without eyebrows. He narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re not Mo, are you?\u201d</p><p>Too damn right, I wasn\u2019t. I huffed again and pivoted in the opposite direction, to make him think I was leaving. Then I feinted left. Nick only had a second to turn before I lunged, sinking my teeth into his nicely rounded butt cheek.</p><p>\u201cYipe!\u201d he cried, clutching at his ass. \u201cWhat the? Hey! Come back here!\u201d He hobbled after me, wincing in pain.</p><p>I made a sort of whickering sound, spitting out a chunk of the denim from his jeans. He gaped down at me. I sniffed, stuck my nose in the air, and trotted home, feeling a lot better about the situation.</p><p>THE FARTHER I got from Nick, the more that heavy guilty feeling crept into my chest. I wasn\u2019t used to feeling remorse. It sort of sucked. Maybe I should go back and check on him. I slipped back into my jeans and sweater inside my office. I would just amble up there and pretend I was taking a long walk around the valley. I\u2019d just make sure he made it to his truck OK and then come right back. I slipped on my boots and was bounding out of my office to do just that when I heard a sly voice to my left.</p> <p>\u201cMaggie, Maggie, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>I cringed.</p><p>There stood the pretender to my throne, all overdone muscle and wavy black hair. If Nick was my Aragorn, Lee was Lando Calrissian: handsome, confident, and about as trustworthy as a used-snowmobile salesman.</p><p>Lee quirked his full lips as he struck a casual pose against the wall of the community center. I was thankful that my body seemed as annoyed by Lee as the rest of me, and whatever hormones had been surging through my blood had now retreated like low tide. Clearly, despite the many lures of Lee\u2019s exterior, my primal brain had some taste.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, Maggie, Maggie,\u201d Lee said again, because he was incapable of saying my name just once. He winked down at me with his wide brown eyes. And once again, I cursed Cooper and Samson for getting all the height in the family.</p><p>\u201cLee.\u201d I acknowledged him, my voice as flat as Aunt Winnie\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cI had an interesting conversation with your brother the other day.\u201d</p><p>I bared my teeth, making him take the slightest step back. \u201cI heard about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Cooper told you we settled things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t settle anything. Because Cooper isn\u2019t going to arrange my marriage. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to deal with me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, and his voice dropped to this weird cross between seductive and condescending, as if he was trying to lure me into his van with candy. \u201cI was just following the rules, Maggie. Cooper is the rightful alpha and the oldest male member of your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that\u2019s the tack you should take with me?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cLook, baby, when we\u2019re married and you\u2019ve grown up a little, you\u2019ll see how silly you\u2019re being.\u201d When I stared at him, shocked speechless for once, he added, \u201cUncle Frank says you\u2019ve had a human hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I asked, wondering how Uncle Frank had heard about my interest in Nick and how many other pack members were talking about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how I feel about my girl spending time with a human,\u201d he said, stepping close enough that he could almost run the tip of his nose down the side of my face. I resisted the urge to shrink away. \u201cYou never get that smell out of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I do is none of your business, Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never understand why so many of our females are letting humans sniff around them,\u201d he continued, as if I hadn\u2019t even spoken. \u201cI mean, why dilute the blood? Just look at your brother\u2019s little girl. She could have been the pride of the pack. And now what\u2019s that pup good for?\u201d He sniffed dismissively. \u201cShe\u2019s not even breeding stock. She\u2019ll live a quiet little life as some human\u2019s wife, and no one will care. What a waste.\u201d</p><p>I tried hard to remember that from Lee\u2019s perspective, he wasn\u2019t saying anything offensive. His pack was a little more \u201cconservative\u201d than mine. He was repeating the opinions he\u2019d heard his whole life. And he just wasn\u2019t bright enough to keep them to himself.</p><p>But I guess the way I was gritting my teeth gave me away, and Lee said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t pretend that you and Cooper are back to being attached at the hip. I remember how you talked about him after he ran off. You can\u2019t say you\u2019re any prouder now that he\u2019s a coward and a dead-breeder.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at his use of a rarely spoken epithet for a dead-liner\u2019s parent. I bunched my hand into a fist and had it half raised when Clay stuck his head through his front door.</p><p>He saw the fist and the pissed-off, uncomfortable look on my face and frowned. \u201cMags, you all right?\u201d</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow. Enter Clark Kent or, at least, Val Kilmer as Batman. My packmates rarely asked me if I was OK, particularly the males. They usually assumed I was fine, as long as I wasn\u2019t griping at them or hitting them in some way. But somehow Clay had managed to ask without making it sound patronizing, as if he was about to swoop in and rescue me. And it was sort of nice. The decency of the gesture made me feel a genuine rush of affection for him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Clay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>This was a completely inappropriate time to be thinking about nibbling on Clay\u2019s earlobes.</p><p>\u201cMore competition, Maggie?\u201d Lee asked, giving Clay a long appraising look before dismissing him with a sniff.</p><p>I gave Lee a dead-eyed stare. \u201cClay is a member of our pack.\u201d</p><p>Lee shot a scathing glare at Clay. My lips quirked into a twisted smile. Lee was all swagger and smirks until he realized he was on an even playing field.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the close family ties that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich some people would consider a good thing,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Clay stepped out of the house and took none-too-subtle steps toward us, positioning himself at my side. Despite the comfort of his presence at my elbow, I wanted to tell him not to bother. Lee was all lazy, no action. In the years I\u2019d known him, he\u2019d never once been in a real fight. He backed off the moment he realized he might have to make an effort to cover his own ass. But he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to, say, attack a lone human wandering around our valley in some misguided attempt to prove himself to me. There was no way I could go check on Nick now. My chest sort of ached at the thought, and I rubbed my hand against my sternum absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cMaggie and I go way back,\u201d Lee told him. \u201cWay back. We\u2019ll be married and mated any day now.\u201d</p><p>Clay arched his eyebrows and smiled at me. I shook my head. Clay snickered.</p><p>\u201cShe tries to deny our love.\u201d Lee trailed a finger along my cheek. \u201cMakes her feel like she\u2019s playing hard to get.\u201d</p><p>Clay growled. I barely resisted the urge to clamp my teeth down on Lee\u2019s offending digit, but I put a restraining hand on Clay\u2019s arm. As much as I appreciated it, it would hardly do to have him \u201csticking up\u201d for me. It would make me look weak, and that was exactly the sort of thing that got around to other packs.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah, Lee, we\u2019ve talked about this,\u201d I said, clucking my tongue. \u201cAnything that touches, I get to keep.\u201d</p><p>But as I said, Lee was none too bright, and he seemed to like the idea of staking his claim in front of Clay. He kept rubbing his freaking hands along my cheek. So I wrapped my fingers around his, yanked his hand palm up, and jerked his arm. He yowled and dropped to his knees. I smacked him on the back of the head for good measure.</p><p>The arm would heal, probably by tomorrow morning. But it would keep him from phasing until then, keep him from snooping around the valley and stumbling onto unsuspecting humans who had probably made it to their trucks by now.</p><p>I walked away, hooking my arm through an astonished Clay\u2019s as we walked into his house. I wanted to visit Billie before we headed home for dinner.</p><p>\u201cGood talking to you, Lee,\u201d I called over my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice was hoarse as he choked out, \u201cYou, too, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Humble Pie a la Mo</p> <p>THE NEXT DAY WAS Saturday, which meant a long run, in human form, for me. Sure, it was easier and more fun to run as a wolf, but I liked the challenge that came with running on two feet. Plus, it was really difficult to keep an iPod clipped to fur.</p><p>I had a hard-packed dirt path worn up to the north point of the valley, beside the river, through a dense thicket of pine trees. It was rare that anyone joined me on my Saturday runs. As much as I loved running with my pack, I liked that it was just me, the wind, and the scent of pine. Every girl needs a little time to herself to hash things out in her head, even if my problems were a little more complicated than \u201cWhich dress should I wear tonight?\u201d or \u201cI need something waxed.\u201d</p><p>Waxing was sort of a moot point for me.</p><p>I was reaching the hardest part of the incline up the valley wall, when a strange presence in the woods stopped me in my tracks. I lifted my face to the wind and waited, fighting the instinct to phase, just in case it was Nick again. I scanned the trees. This didn\u2019t smell like Nick. It smelled like . . . nothing. It was like an olfactory blank space. The little hairs on my arms and neck rose as I felt the scrutiny intensify, as if whoever it was was trying to decide what to do. I stood my ground, waiting.</p><p>Eventually, the presence faded away, and I shook off the feeling. It was just before noon when I jogged up the steps to find my mother standing at the door with the cordless phone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you, hon,\u201d she said, kissing the top of my sweaty head. \u201cIt\u2019s your brother. He doesn\u2019t sound happy. I\u2019m making waffles for when he\u2019s done yelling at you.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, stretching my aching legs and pressing the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to explain to me why Nick Thatcher showed up at the Grundy clinic last night with a bite wound on his ass?\u201d my brother demanded without bothering to say hello.</p><p>Shit. I\u2019d forgotten about Nick. After the Lee incident, Billie had had another spell, in which she claimed strangers were breaking into her house every night and moving things around. I ended up spending the night with her while Dr. Moder monitored her at the clinic. If nothing else, it helped give Alicia some rest. Dr. Moder had forced me to leave at around four A.M. I crashed and completely blanked out Nick\u2019s mangled butt cheek.</p><p>\u201cI was provoked.\u201d Cooper was silent on the other end of the line, so I continued, \u201cHe saw me, and he thought I was Mo. He was looking at me like I was Christmas morning, and then he called me by Mo\u2019s name. Mo would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t dignify that with a response. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky he\u2019s telling everybody around here that he had a run-in with a stray dog. I don\u2019t know why, but he doesn\u2019t seem to want to make a fuss. If he had been anyone else, he would have called the Weekly World News as soon as his butt cheek got stitched up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStray dog?\u201d I spat. \u201cStray dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you were the one who said we should stay away from Nick. And then you not only let him see you in wolf form, but you bit him? What were you thinking? Were you thinking? You could have seriously hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy biting his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo says there are lots of important nerves and stuff back there. She was laughing too hard to get a lot of information across. I\u2019m serious, Mags. I\u2019m not cleaning up this mess, you got it? You\u2019re always going on about you being the alpha. Great, you\u2019re the alpha. You take care of this.\u201d He slammed the phone down.</p><p>I yanked the receiver away from my ear, wincing. My dramatic eye roll was interrupted by a knock at the door. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>I opened the door to find Mo, holding one of her sinful brownie cheesecake pies. Two of my favorite desserts combined in a chocolate graham-cracker crust.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys guilt-stalking me?\u201d I huffed, closing the door behind me so my mother wouldn\u2019t overhear. Mo, used to this sort of response from me, only smirked and stepped out of my way. \u201cI told Cooper biting Nick was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Mo\u2019s coal-black eyebrows winged up. \u201cSo that was you. Nice, Maggie. Excellent job keeping a low profile.\u201d</p> <p>I growled at her. \u201cSo, you drove all this way, bearing pie, to make sure Cooper\u2019s lecture sank in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here. I\u2019m on the clock.\u201d She pressed the pie into my hands and then pulled a note out of her jacket pocket. \u201cNick called the saloon last night\u2014thoroughly hopped up on pain meds, I might add\u2014and begged Evie to arrange for your favorite food to be delivered to you ASAP. Offered her an obscene amount of money and then rambled on about you being \u2018Uhura pretty\u2019 and how you were ignoring his calls and he had to find some way to get through to you. I guess he knew the way to that teeny-tiny Grinch heart of yours is through your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhura pretty?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Mo shook her head, exasperated. \u201cI gave up trying to understand men around here a long time ago. Are you going to read his note or not?\u201d</p><p>Bobbling the heavy pie tin, I opened the little white envelope. I read Evie\u2019s neat block print aloud. \u201cThinking of you, Nick. P.S. I think you may need to check your voice mail. It\u2019s full.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Voice mail? I hadn\u2019t looked at my cell phone in days. Not since I drove to the Glacier.</p><p>Aw, hell.</p><p>As usual, I\u2019d left the phone in my truck. I only used it when I was driving, and I tended to forget about it otherwise. I plopped the pie into Mo\u2019s hands and ran to retrieve my dead phone. Mom was hugging Mo while I bolted back to my room to connect it to the charger on my dresser. I had five missed calls. And three voice-mail messages. All starting the day before, from a weird area code that could only be Nick\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, when Nick asked for my number, which one did you give him?\u201d I called, not really wanting her to answer.</p><p>\u201cYour cell phone,\u201d Mom called back. \u201cI thought you\u2019d probably want any messages he left you to be private.\u201d</p><p>I heard Mo give a soft snicker.</p><p>Well, now I felt horrible. I\u2019d marred perfectly good ass cheeks for no reason. It was as if I\u2019d sneezed on the Mona Lisa.</p><p>Mo was sitting at the kitchen table, drinking tea, while my mother mixed more waffle batter. \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to need those waffles to go. I\u2019m driving to Grundy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving?\u201d Mom asked, cracking a half-dozen eggs into her mixing bowl. \u201cToday\u2019s your running day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe Dr. Thatcher an apology . . . or something.\u201d</p><p>Mo hid her smirk behind her teacup, and Mom\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>I took a precautionary step back. \u201cIt was just a misunderstanding, Mom. I might have hurt his, uh, pride a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust his pride?\u201d Mom asked pointedly.</p><p>I smiled innocently and dashed for the shower.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re going to have to get better at lying if you\u2019re going to survive as a public servant,\u201d Mom called after me.</p><p>THE DRIVE TO Grundy was spent coming up with really awkward apologies for biting Nick on the ass. And then I remembered that Nick didn\u2019t know I was the one who bit him on the ass and that saying so would tip him off to the whole \u201cworld of werewolves\u201d thing. Maybe I could just continue to let him think Mo bit him on the ass. That wouldn\u2019t make things awkward.</p><p>The smart thing would be to send a detached, polite thank-you note for the pie or ignore him completely. But I felt this new, unpleasant gnawing sensation in my chest. I actually cared about what Nick thought of me. I worried about him thinking badly of me. I felt guilty for hurting him, not just little pangs of regret but full-on spasms of \u201cwhy did I do that?\u201d</p><p>I was maturing emotionally. Ew.</p><p>OK, pie. I\u2019d stick with the pie. He\u2019d taken the time to order me pie while he was laid up on a doughnut pillow. That he\u2019d send me something edible was oddly touching. Courtship in this part of the country rarely centered on flowers and perfume. Nick had made an effort, and he\u2019d put some thought into it. And that was doing strange things to my ability to produce coherent thoughts. By the time I pulled my truck into Nick\u2019s driveway, I\u2019d come up with \u201cThanks for the pie.\u201d</p><p>Brilliant, I know. I was considering a career in speechwriting if this whole werewolf-leadership thing didn\u2019t work out.</p><p>I forced myself out of the truck and considered Susie\u2019s former home. \u201cSusie Q\u201d was the town\u2019s former postmaster and the first victim of Eli\u2019s weird string of attacks. I\u2019d like to think that she was just a victim of opportunity, that Eli had stumbled across her as she was letting her ridiculous little wiener dog, Oscar, out to pee. Because the possibility that he spent time stalking a harmless, though eccentric, middle-aged country music fan was plain icky.</p><p>Susie saw the world through Dolly Parton\u2013colored glasses, you might say. Platinum blond and blessed with more boobs than sense, Susie wore tight western shirts and jeans that looked painted on. But when it came to running the post office, she\u2019d been all business, save for the fact that she kept Oscar in the mailroom for company.</p><p>Mo took Oscar in after Susie moved in with her daughter to recover from her injuries. When Susie\u2019s daughter claimed to be asthmatic and allergic, Mo kept him. As a rule, werewolves don\u2019t keep dogs. There are food-competition issues. However, Cooper considered it a mission of mercy. Susie was awfully fond of doggie sweaters.</p><p>Shaken from my reminiscing by the sound of a TV clicking on inside the house, I raised my hand to knock. But I lost my nerve, turning on my heel and preparing to dash for the truck. I\u2019d taken a step when I heard the door open behind me.</p><p>Double damn it.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d</p><p>Nick was looking all cute and rumpled, wearing sweats and a Tribhuvan University T-shirt. His hair was mussed, and he was limping a little, but he didn\u2019t look too bad.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cI just wanted to say thanks for the pie. That was very thoughtful. And I didn\u2019t get your calls. I left my phone in my truck a few days ago, and the battery died. I hardly ever use it; I don\u2019t know why Mom gave you that number. Well, uh, see ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, wincing as he stepped toward me. \u201cUh, if I\u2019d started calling sooner, I might have gotten you before the battery died. I actually hiked by the valley to try to work up the nerve to try to talk to you, when this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait so long?\u201d I asked, trying to keep the demanding tone at bay.</p><p>\u201cHolding on to some scrap of my male pride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the man holding a special sittin\u2019 pillow,\u201d I noted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small scrap,\u201d he said, leading me into the house. The hitch in his stride needled at me. Watching him struggle down the hall, I wondered how he\u2019d made it back to his truck from the valley. And I felt a cold flush of guilt and fear spread through me, thinking of what might have happened to him if he hadn\u2019t been able to get to the truck. The image of him sprawled on the dirt, defenseless, unable to get to help, tore a hole through my chest, leaving me swaying dizzily against the wall. I took a deep breath, and Nick heard the huffing sound. He turned, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you all right?\u201d he asked, closing his fingers around my bicep, the warmth of his hand seeping through my sleeve. \u201cYour face just went really pale.\u201d</p><p>I let a long breath stream out of my nostrils, marveling at the electric tingles traveling from his hand to my arm, easing the ache in my chest. I gave him a shaky smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I promised him, looking up and gaping at my surroundings. \u201cI\u2019m just allergic to suede and rhinestones.\u201d</p><p>Susie\u2019s house looked as if she\u2019d decorated from Roy Rogers\u2019s garage sale. The sofa was covered in denim-colored suede and had Bedazzled pillows made of red bandanas. There were posters for old country-western acts such as Hank Williams Sr. and Patsy Cline on the walls. There was even a longhorn skull over the mantle, where most of us would put a moose head or a particularly impressive fish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only sign of Nick\u2019s presence was a pair of night-vision goggles on the wagon-wheel coffee table and a laptop on the kitchen table, surrounded by books piled in wobbly stacks. They made a nice holding pen for the random pages of loose-leaf paper strewn around, covered in Nick\u2019s neat block lettering. There were little sketches in the margins, of wolves, of the moon in various stages. I laid my keys on the table and picked up one of the more complicated pictures, a pair of wide, heavily lashed eyes. I tore my gaze away from the little drawings and smirked at the cow skull. \u201cI had no idea that you were such a huge country-western fan.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m not, but apparently, Susie\u2019s daughter wanted to leave the house furnished for renters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning she didn\u2019t want the cowboy look encroaching on her carefully decorated McMansion,\u201d I said, snorting. He shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you feel a little weird, living in Susie\u2019s house while reading about her attack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really. It keeps it more real for me, reminds me that I\u2019m dealing with actual people. Susie seemed like a nice lady. She didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her.\u201d He was watching my face for signs of change, deception.</p><p>I gave him a placid smile. \u201cSusie is a nice lady, and she\u2019s lucky to be alive. Abner Golightly, another nice person, wasn\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>He chewed his lip thoughtfully. \u201cI know we\u2019ve gotten off on a, well, bizarre foot here. I know you think I\u2019m nuts. And I know that you\u2019re an unusual girl, so the usual dating tactics aren\u2019t going to work with you. So I\u2019m going to lay all my cards on the table, since that\u2019s something you seem to respect. I like you. A lot. I like that you\u2019re contrary and know how to say what you think. And you\u2019re beautiful and strong and a little peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeculiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love peculiar,\u201d he assured me, edging slightly closer, his voice husky. \u201cPeculiar is sort of my thing.\u201d</p> <p>Bolder now, he moved closer, bringing with him that delicious scent of man and spice and woods. I watched his cobalt eyes come closer and closer to my face as he leaned toward me. His mouth was a hair\u2019s breadth away from my lips. I was torn between praying he would kiss me and hoping he wouldn\u2019t, so my life wouldn\u2019t get even more complicated. I whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re very confident, Dr. Thatcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m faking most of it,\u201d he assured me as he leaned closer bit by bit.</p><p>Behind him, I saw Susie\u2019s less-than-plasma television showing a very young William Shatner romping with a green-skinned chick in a silver bikini. On the top of the entertainment center, I saw a DVD set labeled \u201cStar Trek: The Complete Original Series.\u201d The man had driven thousands of miles away from civilization, and he\u2019d brought his favorite DVDs. I couldn\u2019t decide if that was adorable or idiotic.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re a Trekkie.\u201d</p><p>Just call me Maggie Graham, Moment Ruiner.</p><p>Startled, Nick blushed as he pulled away and looked toward the screen. \u201cI simply enjoy the aesthetics and storytelling involved. I don\u2019t take it to the creepy fan-boy level.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I smirked at him. \u201cHow many conventions have you been to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree, but only because my college roommate dragged me . . .\u201d he spluttered. \u201cFine, there was a fourth incident as well. But just because the guy who played Chekov was auctioning off one of his communicators for charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, even when you look past the great story lines and the compelling characters, the show is worth watching because it was groundbreaking. Star Trek was one of the first network shows to reflect America\u2019s emerging youth counterculture. At the time, television was a wasteland of picture-perfect nuclear families and white-hat-wearing cowboys. There were no flaws, no textures. It was one of the first shows to really examine class warfare, racial justice, sexual equality, the role of technology in society,\u201d he said, ticking the subjects off on his fingers as he got more and more flustered.</p><p>I cannot explain why the \u201cprofessor\u201d tone he used while passionately extolling the virtues of geek porn sent tingles to my special places. All I knew was that I was having a hard time staying on my side of the couch. So, instead, I feigned disinterest and snickered. \u201cAnd it was the first network show to feature half-naked alien chicks dressed in aluminum-foil swimwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, fine, now we\u2019re watching it.\u201d He nudged me down onto the couch and slowly lowered himself onto a special doughnut pillow. I sank into the soft cushions, watching as he manipulated the DVD system he\u2019d obviously installed on top of Susie\u2019s TV. Susie was sweet but not exactly techno-savvy.</p><p>He clicked on some episode called \u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever,\u201d and the theme music started. From a little cooler he kept near the couch, he offered me a pack of Sour Patch Kids and a Coke. I wondered where to put my hands. Well, I knew where I wanted to put them, but I think that would probably be a felony if I did it without warning him first. I crossed my arms over my chest for safekeeping.</p><p>This was strangely pleasant. I\u2019d never done DVDs as a dating activity. I didn\u2019t bring guys home. I didn\u2019t force them into awkward interactions with my mom or brothers. Because that could end badly. And bloodily.</p> <p>I was hyperaware of Nick, the warmth from his body, the hints of his scent wafting toward me, luring me closer to him. His arm was stretched over the back of the couch as he struggled to find a comfortable position to sit. His fingers played with the ends of my hair as we watched Captain Kirk kick ass and make intergalactic booty calls. I found Spock oddly hot, though, considering my recent nerd-hag leanings, this wasn\u2019t surprising.</p><p>Still, three episodes later, I wondered aloud, \u201cWhy would anyone on the crew put on a red shirt? Honestly, it\u2019s like they\u2019re standing in front of their closet, and they\u2019re thinking, \u2018Yellow? Blue? Nah, today\u2019s a good day to die.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cRed shirts meant you were part of the operations crew, who spent most of their time in the engine room or on security duty, off-camera, so the audience didn\u2019t care much about them.\u201d Nick tilted the bowl of popcorn we were sharing toward me. \u201cThe writers needed a way to ramp up the violence without killing off characters people were fond of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike on The A-Team or G.I. Joe.\u201d I nodded. \u201cWhen the bad guys would shoot and shoot at the good guys but never seemed to hit anybody?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s face was a mockery of solemnity. He clutched my hands to his chest. \u201cMarry me and have my babies.\u201d</p><p>My voice was a little shaky when I chucked a licorice rope at him and said, \u201cIn your dreams, Thatcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, until humans start procreating like seahorses or penguins, you would be the designated egg bearer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t help yourself, can you? You have to be the smartest person in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor of zoology. It\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said as he popped a few more gummy candies into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you love it,\u201d he said. When I lifted my eyes to the ceiling and shook my head, he gently tucked his fingers under my chin and brought my face level with his. \u201cYou like that I\u2019m smart. You like that I\u2019m different from most of the guys you know. You even like the fact that I could be just a little bit crazy. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed at him. Damn it, he was right. But I wasn\u2019t about to admit that. It would give him too much power. So I gave him a speculative look. \u201cYou\u2019re a very direct nerd,\u201d I mused.</p><p>\u201cI just want us to be on the same page,\u201d he said, leaning close to me.</p><p>Despite my saner, sensible half\u2019s screaming at me to back away, to get my horny wolf ass back to my truck, I stayed still, feeling more like prey than predator for the first time in my life. He was cautious in his approach, just barely brushing his lips over my own, the faintest whisper of flesh against flesh. I sighed, mingling my breath with his. His thumbs traced lightly over my cheekbones, down the line of my jaw. I wrapped my arms around his waist as he drew me closer, parting my lips with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>Boy and howdy. I felt warm from the toes up, like the first flash of heat that comes just before phasing. And I couldn\u2019t seem to keep my hands still. They kept moving over the small of Nick\u2019s back, holding him to me.</p><p>I was lost, and it felt nice. No worries. No responsibilities. Just warmth and peace and a pleasant coil of pressure building in my belly.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he whispered, and my heart thundered in my ears. When his fingertips grazed the hollow of my throat, I jumped, my own fingertips digging into the rear of Nick\u2019s sweats. I felt papery bandages crinkle underneath the cotton. Nick yelped. My eyes went wide. I remembered with a flush of guilt that I\u2019d been the one to hurt him. As a wolf. While he was investigating us. And all of the reasons not to be anywhere near Nick came crashing down on me again.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I gasped and scrambled back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. We can work around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d I said, leaping off of the couch and backing down the hall.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, wait,\u201d he called as I stumbled out the front door. I got two steps to my truck before I realized I\u2019d left my keys on Nick\u2019s table. I glanced back to the door, where Nick was limping into the frame.</p><p>\u201cOh, screw it,\u201d I grunted, and took off running down the driveway.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d he yelled, but I was already on the highway, sprinting toward home.</p><p>I was running at my top human speed, having put a couple of miles between Nick\u2019s driveway and my feet. A light rain had started to fall, misting over my damp cheeks. Running in my human shape felt right, as if I was bleeding poison from the ragged human wound in my chest with every step. I needed to go through this as a woman, not a wolf. Obviously, my more animal instincts weren\u2019t leading me in the right direction.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t put my whole pack\u2014hell, my whole species\u2014in jeopardy because a man happened to curl my toes and give me arm tingles.</p><p>My hair clung in damp ropes to my cheeks as my feet ate through the intense climb up the winding mountain road to the valley. It was late September, and the sharp bite of the air was leeching the warmth from my bones, leaving me shivering in my soaked jacket and jeans. The raindrops grew bigger, splashing into my eyes, making me wish for my hat. I would have phased and run the rest of the way, but these were my favorite boots, soggy as they were, and it was a bitch to keep replacing my clothes.</p><p>I had to find the positive. I needed this. I needed to feel foolish and humiliated and crazy. It was like cauterizing a wound. The next time I thought about throwing myself at Nick Thatcher, I would remember this feeling, and it would turn me off faster than Lee bragging about his nunchuck collection.</p><p>I doubted Nick would want to see me again for a while anyway, I told myself. He probably thought I was nuts. Normal girls didn\u2019t respond to delicious, earth-shattering kisses by running away down an Alaskan highway. Maybe I was nuts. This was like some episode of not-so-temporary insanity. Even if he was this decade\u2019s answer to Fox Mulder, I couldn\u2019t afford to throw myself at good-looking humans just because I got tingles in special places. I needed someone like Clay, someone who understood all the weird drama that came with being a wolf, who could help me continue the line. Nick needed. . .</p><p>I slowed my pace to what a human runner would consider jogging. Thinking of the kind of woman Nick needed and deserved put that hole back in my chest. I rubbed a hand over my aching breastbone, feeling suddenly out of breath. A man like Nick deserved a woman who was smart. A woman who would be nice to him, all the time, who would be pretty and soft and sweet. Who didn\u2019t wolf out and bite him on the ass.</p><p>I\u2019d never had a crisis of self-esteem. I\u2019d never minded not going to college. I\u2019d never minded not having a skill set, as Mo did with her cooking. All I knew was the pack, and so far, it had worked out for me. Some people would find that depressing, limiting. But I thought it was a nice way of simplifying my life. And now it felt as if it might not be enough, and that was terrifying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind me, I heard my truck\u2019s engine rumbling. Shit. I wiped at my eyes. Considering his butt-cheek injuries, I hadn\u2019t expected Nick to come after me. I\u2019d expected to have to call Cooper to pick up my truck.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, stop!\u201d he yelled out of the driver\u2019s-side window. I slowed to a crawl, for me, and eyed him warily through the window.</p><p>I could just keep running. Hell, part of me wanted to phase right there and make tracks for Canada. But Grahams didn\u2019t shirk away from problems. We didn\u2019t run. Well, Cooper did, that once, for a few years. But he eventually came back.</p> <p>None of this inner coaching was helping, as Nick was still staring at me through the rain.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m halfway home. Just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s pouring. It\u2019s going to be dark soon. Get in the truck!\u201d</p><p>I tipped my head back, blinking as I watched the dark clouds swirling overhead. The rain wouldn\u2019t be letting up anytime soon. And I didn\u2019t relish the idea of jogging all the way home with Nick trailing me at idling speed, yelling through my window.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I grumbled, stomping toward the truck. He leaned over and popped the passenger door open, wincing in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cOh, you must be kidding. This is my truck. Scoot over,\u201d I told him, opening the driver\u2019s door. He carefully moved over to the passenger seat. I watched him settle against the bench, his face contorting, and I felt that twinge of guilt again.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell did you take off like that?\u201d he yelled, pulling me close. My clothes slapped wetly against his, and he dug his hands into my snaggled hair. \u201cWhat the hell was that? If I move too fast, you tell me. You don\u2019t run off.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I\u2019d been yelled at before. And I\u2019d been hugged, but not at the same time. Weird.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you get so far?\u201d he asked, pointing the truck\u2019s heat vents toward me and cranking up the thermostat. \u201cWhat are you, a champion sprinter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you gave me a pretty good head start,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t get your truck started,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to steer . . . and slow down. Your brakes are making really weird noises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clutch is kind of tricky,\u201d I confessed as he pulled at the sleeves of my wet jacket and made me shrug out of it before I slipped the truck into gear. \u201cI think Cooper and Sam rebuilt the transmission a few too many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just get a new truck?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was my dad\u2019s,\u201d I said as I pulled a careful U-turn and pointed the truck downhill toward Nick\u2019s place. \u201cHe died when I was really little. I barely knew him. And I just like the idea of having something that used to be his.\u201d</p><p>The rain was pouring now, sheeting down the window in rippling waves. We rarely had what you\u2019d call heavy rainfall, so the roads were slick with a layer of newly rehydrated oil and dust. I could hardly see through the windshield for the rain flowing down the glass, but I could tell that the landscape was moving by faster than it should be. I tapped the brake, but the truck didn\u2019t respond. It rolled along faster, building speed.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat. \u201cOK, Maggie, I know you want to get home, but you need to slow down.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the brake with more force. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were trying, the truck would be going slower,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>I pressed my foot down harder, but the truck kept coasting along. The tires squealed slightly as I rounded a corner. \u201cHey, Nick,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cDid you notice anything weird about the brakes on the way out here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBesides the noise? They were a little sluggish, but it was uphill most of the way. I didn\u2019t use them much.\u201d</p><p>I grunted as the end of the truck bed swiped an outcropping of rock while I took a curve. Nick\u2019s eyes went wide with alarm. \u201cNick, I need you to pull up the emergency brake. Hard. I\u2019d do it, but I think I need to keep my hands on the wheel.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and scooted toward me. As he wrapped his hands around the brake lever, I braced myself for the jolt of the wheels stopping.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t bad,\u201d Nick assured me as I eased around a minor curve. \u201cI once drove a Jeep down the Yungas Road in Bolivia; it\u2019s the most dangerous road in the world. I came around a corner, and there was a logging truck stalled out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please shut the fuck up and pull the fucking brake!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cI am pulling it!\u201d he exclaimed, tugging the brake arm up. Nothing happened. We locked eyes. Nick\u2019s gaze flashed toward the road. \u201cLook, just anticipate the turns; we should slow down enough to come to a stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading downhill. We\u2019re picking up speed! Did you get your PhD online?\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t yell at me because you\u2019re panicking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not panicking!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>We came to a particularly nasty turn, almost forty-five degrees overlooking a deep ravine. My heart thumped in my throat the closer we rolled. I pumped the brake furiously, hoping for some last-minute Hail Mary solution. I tried to turn the wheel, but the curve was just too sharp. \u201cHold on!\u201d I shouted as he braced his arms against the dash.</p><p>The truck careened down the embankment, side-swiping trees and bouncing us back against the rear window separating the cab from the camper top attached to my truck bed. The truck pitched left, and my head cracked against the driver\u2019s-side window. I closed my eyes, letting the pitch and roll of the cab flop me around like a rag doll as I concentrated on not throwing up. We finally slid into a bank of trees and skidded to a stop.</p><p>\u201cShit! Shit! Shitshitshitshit!\u201d I yelled, my eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>A few moments later, careful fingers pried my fingers loose from their death grip on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, the truck\u2019s stopped. You can stop murdering the English language now,\u201d Nick said. He gently turned my head to examine the rather impressive swelling on my temple. I winced and hissed as his fingertips brushed the throbbing skin.</p><p>The passenger side was wedged against a pair of trees at the bottom of a ravine. Frankly, it was a miracle the truck hadn\u2019t flipped. God bless solid, pre-plastic American auto engineering.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I asked, gripping his wrists. \u201cHow\u2019s your ass?\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m worried about your ass,\u201d I told him, a sudden wave of dizziness washing over me. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d I said, tracing my hand along his cheek. I smiled, feeling sort of loopy. \u201cYou have such a nice ass.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as I leaned my forehead against his. \u201cYou cracked your head pretty good, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, cringing at the pain that spiraled out of that small motion. I dug into my pocket for my newly recharged cell phone. I had a healthy battery but no bars. \u201cNo cell-phone reception out here. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid an obscene amount of money for 3G network coverage.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>I carefully stuck my head out through the shattered window, staring up the steep rock and earth wall that separated us from the road. Nick could barely walk. There was no way I was making it up that incline in human form in this rain. I considered knocking him out and phasing so I could run for help. But knocking someone unconscious sort of made rescue efforts irrelevant. Plus, the last time I ran with a concussion, I woke up in Juneau, naked in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven, with no clue what day it was. I could forget where I was running, and he could end up stuck out there for who knew how long.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting out of here anytime soon,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, we wait for morning or for the weather to break?\u201d he asked, looking back into the truck bed.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhichever comes first. There\u2019s some blankets and stuff in the back. We\u2019re going to need to cover the window. It\u2019s still fall, technically, but it\u2019s going to get cold tonight.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the back window, which Sam and Cooper had custom-installed. It was just wide enough to shimmy through, though Nick was going to have some trouble with his injuries. I was glad that I\u2019d recently cleaned out the truck bed. The camper top wouldn\u2019t allow us to stand or move around much, but at least we had shelter from the wind and rain. I passed the blanket and some duct tape through to him and started putting together a pallet. I\u2019d insisted that everyone in the valley keep emergency kits in their cars, for situations like this. But I\u2019d been expecting something more along the lines of a blizzard or a zombie invasion, rather than failed brakes and an impromptu slumber party with my human crush.</p><p>I gnawed my lip and considered the situation. My truck was old, but it was well maintained. Samson took a look at it every few months, inspecting the rebuilt engine, the aging axles, and the brakes, which he\u2019d replaced last winter. It didn\u2019t make any sense for the brakes to crap out like that. Samson was goofy and lazy, but he was a solid mechanic. Also, as far as I knew, he didn\u2019t want me dead. Of course, that might change after I went home and put a boot up his ass.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is cozy,\u201d Nick said wryly after struggling through the camper window. He pulled one of the blankets off the pallet and wrapped it around my shoulders. \u201cMaybe I should have you redecorate Susie\u2019s place for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know this is going to sound like a line, but I think we need to get you out of those wet clothes,\u201d he said, pulling my boots off. I pushed his hands away and yanked them off myself. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get cold in here, even with the blankets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an extra set of sweats in here, just in case,\u201d I told him, not bothering to add that they were there \u201cjust in case\u201d I woke up naked in a strange place after a run, which was sort of an occupational hazard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll turn around,\u201d he said.</p><p>I arched my brows, then laughed as he dutifully turned his back and covered his eyes.</p><p>When you spend so much time around people who pay no attention to nudity, you forget niceties like modesty. It was sort of strange, but a refreshing change from guys who paid no attention when my boobs were exposed to God and everybody. It was nice to have a little mystery about me . . . you know, beyond the furry issue.</p><p>I peeled the wet shirt over my head and slid into the warm, dry sweatshirt. It felt absolutely delicious against my skin. It took a bit of effort to fight my way out of the wet jeans, but it was worth it to pull on the dry sweatpants.</p><p>Now that the adrenaline was wearing off and I was seventy-five percent sure we weren\u2019t going to die, I was suddenly so tired I felt as if I\u2019d just run a marathon. I pulled my hair into a messy bun on top of my head. I wasn\u2019t going to win any beauty contests, but I was comfortable and warm. I couldn\u2019t want much else.</p><p>\u201cYou decent?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends on who you ask,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>He turned, pulling the emergency bag open. \u201cAnd for dinner, we have our choice of protein bars that taste like peanut butter or protein bars that taste like chocolate and dirt. Paired with a lovely domestic bottled water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go with the peanut butter,\u201d I said, shuddering. \u201cThe chocolate and dirt one lives up to its reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice,\u201d he said, tossing the packet to me.</p><p>I stripped off the foil and shoved most of the protein bar into my mouth. Between the run and keeping warm, my body was starved for calories. His eyes went wide, and I swallowed. I tended to forget my table manners when I was hungry.</p><p>\u201cI eat when I\u2019m nervous,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFeels like there\u2019s a drunk marching band in there,\u201d I said, gingerly rubbing my temple. \u201cAnd the tubas are way off-key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your pupils look good, but we should probably keep you awake for a while, just in case you have a concussion,\u201d he said. \u201cTalk to me. Why\u2019d you run off like that earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t think of something a little more small-talkish before diving right into the deep end?\u201d I griped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBlue.\u201d I sighed, staring up into his eyes and hating myself for being such a sappy masochist.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the Red Wings\u2019 chances this season?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine until the Avalanche take the ice,\u201d I muttered, biting off another hunk of protein bar.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOK, then, why did you run off earlier?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how you make me feel,\u201d I said, my lips somewhat loosened by exhaustion, warm dry clothes, and the weight of the protein bar in my belly.</p><p>His eyes widened in alarm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I like you, too much. You make me forget. You make me feel like you\u2019re more important than anything, and I can\u2019t let that be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, pushing my hair behind my ears.</p><p>\u201cI have to take care of everybody,\u201d I said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cAnd who takes care of you?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody takes care of themselves all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho takes care of you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grinned suddenly. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d I blinked again, letting my eyes droop closed.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, pinching my arm lightly. \u201cStay awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I grumbled, swatting at his hand. \u201cOK, fine. Tell me something. Anything. Tell me anything. Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Reno, originally,\u201d he said, tucking a blanket around my shoulders. \u201cMy mom ran out on us when I was five or six. Didn\u2019t give much of a reason, but she\u2019d made it clear that she didn\u2019t like being a mom nearly as much as she liked getting loaded or going to the casino with her friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in personal-history small talk, either, do you?\u201d I asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll reciprocate,\u201d he said. \u201cI always thought Dad was just putting up with her, but he sort of fell apart after she left. I\u2019d never seen him drink more than one beer at a time, but he started drinking the better part of a six-pack as soon as he came in from work. I was handling the bills and signing my own report cards by the time I was eight. Dad lost one job and then another, so we started moving around. I think the highlight of my truancy report was the year I spent more time out of school than in it. Still, my grades were good. And by the time I hit high school, I was able to get a job, start sharing some of the load. I figured I could keep us in one town for a while, so I could go to school. We ended up in Darien, Connecticut, of all places. I went to class in the mornings and then did whatever I could at night, loading groceries from trucks, convenience-store clerk, mucking out stalls at a dairy farm, sawing limbs for a tree trimmer\u2014which is how I developed an interest in climbing, by the way.</p><p>\u201cDad died in the middle of my senior year, liver failure. Mom sent a registered letter asking if he\u2019d kept up his life-insurance payments. I had a guidance counselor who actually cared about her job and helped me get a full scholarship to a minor state school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI had enough grant money to stop working and just be a student. It was the first time I remember being able to just sit and study and read. And that\u2019s all I did. It kind of freaked my roommate out. I wasn\u2019t used to living with someone who liked to talk. I think Dane was convinced I was going to go postal on him, but two months into the semester, he put in this Star Trek DVD. I\u2019d never seen the show. I started asking questions. And that\u2019s all it took. He was really into comics, sci-fi, role-playing games, and he shared it with me. He dragged me to all these conventions and meetings. It was fun. I\u2019d never really had a friend before. So I just went along. Kind of pathetic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s sort of sweet.\u201d</p><p>He looked faintly embarrassed. \u201cDane was always going on about this online multiplayer game software he was designing. It was different from anything we\u2019d ever seen, an Internet-based joint experience among gamers all over the globe. A fully developed world where they could chat, build their characters, and, most important, pay subscription fees and buy upgrade packages. He spent every cent he had on hard drives for his \u2018rendering farm.\u2019 He told his former jock dad he\u2019d joined some hard-core gym, swindling Daddy Dearest out of a few hundred a month, which he has paid back in spades, by the way. The game looked great, but he was having trouble coming up with character options and story lines. He was a genius with code but crap at storytelling. I filled in the gaps. I\u2019d just taken a class in mythology. I\u2019d served as dungeon master for a couple of our D&amp;D games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to know what that means.\u201d</p><p>He poked me in the ribs, his mood lightening. \u201cIt just means I wrote the story lines for the game. Pervert. Anyway, I wrote a bunch of different scenarios and created a colorful cast of characters. I based them on the stories we studied in class. I took a little Celtic mythology, some Greek, some Norse, some faerie lore, swirled in a little Tolkien, and voil\u00e0, you had Guild of Dominion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, are you telling me you helped invent Guild of Dominion?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cMy delinquent cousin Donnie lives for that game! We didn\u2019t see him for three weeks when you offered that upgrade package with the scantily clad elf ladies!\u201d I gasped, slapping at his arm. \u201cAre you loaded, Thatcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an incredibly rude question, but yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. I\u2019d never met anyone with money before. Evie was the most affluent member of our clan, though we wouldn\u2019t dream of asking her for anything. I wondered whether I should be embarrassed that he\u2019d seen my house, my little village in its sometimes charming state of semishabbiness. Then again, he drove a truck that was almost as old as mine. He wore flannel and jeans, and other than insisting that there was a deep metaphysical meaning to The Prisoner, he didn\u2019t put on airs. If he could deal with the fact that I didn\u2019t have much, I could deal with the fact that he had a lot. \u201cGood, then I don\u2019t feel bad about you springing for dinner later.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDane beat his competitors to the market by about six months. He was a hit. I did some freelance work for him during his first year in business, writing gaming manuals, cheater guides. I was glad to have the extra money and figured that was where it ended. Imagine my surprise when I was presented with a five-percent share in his company. I was able to retire at twenty-five, just from the dividends. Dane was as happy as a pig in shit running his company. I transferred to a much better school and finished my bachelor\u2019s. I was able to study whatever I wanted, and I decided to stick with folklore. I liked to look at the way people explained the world around them. And the more I looked, the more I saw patterns in nature, in reality. It made me question how much of myth was real. And boom, I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I wanted to find the connections between fact and the fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI write journal articles about the people and the stories I\u2019ve studied,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are published in well-respected academic journals. I\u2019ve written a book or two. For the most part, I just like traveling around and learning about people. Everything was cool until Dane and I went to speak at a gamers convention in Vegas a couple of years ago. Some old friend of my mom\u2019s was tending bar at the convention center. She called my mom, let her know I\u2019d come into some money. Next thing I know, Mom\u2019s calling me, says she\u2019s missed me, wants to reconnect, sob sob sob. I was working to get my PhD in folk studies. I\u2019d just bought my own place, and I had the room. I actually sent her a first-class plane ticket. Isn\u2019t that stupid?\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers along his earlobes, applying faint pressure at the tips. \u201cNo, you wanted her to see what you\u2019d become, what you\u2019d made for yourself, what she\u2019d missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it only took about a week for dear old Mom to swipe my ATM card, pawn everything that wasn\u2019t nailed down, and hightail it to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s a very sad story,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI mean, you actually have a PhD in folk studies?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at me, though he was obviously trying hard not to laugh. I measured a small distance between my thumb and forefinger. \u201cIt\u2019s a little funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn your powers of sarcasm-slash-cuteness,\u201d he grumbled, relaxing against me, letting me wrap my arms around him. He nuzzled my neck. \u201cWhat about you? Where\u2019d you go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to high school in the valley,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I stayed in the valley. I didn\u2019t go to college.\u201d</p><p>His blond brows furrowed. \u201cWhy not? You\u2019re articulate, smart, scary as hell. You could have given the professors a run for their money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just it,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have the money. I made really good grades, scored high on those college aptitude tests. Cooper tried to get me to sign up for scholarship programs and grants. But I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t interested\u201d was a major understatement. Cooper\u2019s attempts to force me into leaving the valley to go to the University of Alaska led to one of our legendary brawls. He\u2019d lost three fingertips and part of an ear. But I didn\u2019t think that was the sort of thing I should share.</p><p>Nick and I talked for hours, until my throat was dry and my tongue felt swollen. It was hard, editing myself. I wanted to tell him everything. I wanted to tell him what it was like growing up in what was more of a wrestling league than a family. I wanted to tell him that I\u2019d never reacted to anyone the way I reacted to him. I wanted to tell him about the mating urge and how it made me crazy for him, how I was expected to marry another wolf.</p><p>But every time I was on the verge of telling him, I\u2019d get quiet and let him talk for a while about the places he\u2019d grown up. Florida, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, California. I couldn\u2019t imagine seeing so many places\u2014the desert, the mountains, the beach. I envied him that, but at the same time, it broke my heart that he\u2019d never had a real home. I couldn\u2019t imagine living without a place to run back to, without people who\u2014as much as they annoyed and needled me\u2014loved me and accepted me for what I was. How did he live like that?</p><p>\u201cChina is like a hundred different countries in one. Crowded cities, sweeping mountains, huge, vast open plains, Scotland, India. India is so hot that you can actually taste the air, like spicy cotton candy,\u201d he said. \u201cScotland was nice; the people were friendly. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s where I ended up getting the tattoo, which just goes to show you that you shouldn\u2019t get into drinking contests with people who have their own class of whiskey named after them.\u201d He turned his back and pulled up the hem of his shirt to reveal a red lion on his shoulder, the kind you might see on some old English battle flag.</p><p>I thought maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to see those places. I wouldn\u2019t ever want to live anywhere but the valley. But it might be interesting to go where Nick had gone, to see what he\u2019d seen. But my opinion was probably being swayed by the fact that he was practically shirtless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Long after the sun set and the rain stopped, Nick finally decided that I could fall asleep without danger. I stirred in the middle of the night, feeling pleasantly warm. My fingers were curled around his collar. His skin smelled like sleep and spice. I brushed my lips along his throat. He mumbled, still asleep, and swiped his fingers across his chin. I snickered. I kissed the little divot in his chin, edging toward his mouth. I pressed my lips against his, soft and deliberate, so I wouldn\u2019t forget what it felt like. He moaned. I did it again, then raked my teeth against his plump bottom lip. His hands slipped under my chin, keeping my face against his. His thumbs grazed my cheekbones to my hairline.</p><p>I fell asleep again, content.</p><p>I woke up hours later, Nick\u2019s face hovering in front of mine. His eyes fluttered open, and I could see the morning sun reflected in them. He grinned down at me. His eyes went wide. He scrambled back, whacking his head against the window.</p> <p>I looked down to where my arms should have been and saw paws covered in black fur.</p><p>I was a wolf.</p><p>Shit and double shit.</p><p>6</p><p>The Best Laid Plans of Men and Morons</p> <p>\u201cMAGGIE?\u201d HE ASKED, REACHING out to touch me and then pulling his hand back, remembering the bite mark on his butt cheek.</p><p>Werewolves rarely phase during sleep, but sometimes it happens after a serious injury. We heal faster in our wolf state, and sometimes our bodies want to give us a little push toward running at full speed. I must have hit my head a little harder than I\u2019d thought, I mused as I forced myself back into my human shape. I quirked my face into an awkward sort of cringe. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all real?\u201d he choked out. \u201cWerewolves? Ghosts? Vampires?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about vampires, but werewolves definitely. And ghosts, probably. I thought you knew all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s a difference between knowing and knowing. I feel so stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf, like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mo\u2019s not, but I am. And Cooper and Samson and my mom and most of my family. Do you see now why I don\u2019t want you investigating the wolf stories?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bit me on the ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that. I was a little upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset?\u201d he repeated. \u201cUpset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop repeating that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry! I have so many questions for you,\u201d he said, patting his pockets for his notebook. \u201cHow often do you change? Obviously, your cycle isn\u2019t tied to the moon. Does it hurt? Is the transition painful? I mean, there was a sort of glow, and then you were just there in your human form. I always thought I would see your bones stretch around and change shape, but it\u2019s just like a trick of light, isn\u2019t it? What about your diet? Your sleep patterns? Can everyone in your family change? Is it passed on the mother\u2019s side or the father\u2019s side? Or both?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my eyebrows raised. \u201cI see you\u2019re over the scarred-ass-cheek thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemporarily. \u201c He chuckled at his own goofiness. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re real.\u201d He sort of dove for me, clasped my face between his hands, and closed his lips over mine. I moaned into his mouth, threading my fingers through his hair.</p><p>I pulled back, surprised.</p> <p>\u201cIs that not OK? I mean, this isn\u2019t because of the wolf thing. Obviously, it\u2019s an added bonus. But I\u2019ve wanted to do that since the minute I met you, and now I can\u2019t seem to stop.\u201d</p><p>I basically tackled him and pressed myself against his body. He rolled me onto my back. My clothes were torn from the transition, and I felt my breasts pressing against the rough fabric of his jacket. My nipples puckered, tingling from this strange new sensation. This was so much farther than I\u2019d been before. Sure, I\u2019d been naked around men; it sort of came with the territory. But I\u2019d never been touched like this, never touched someone to seek out this kind of pleasure.</p><p>He traced the lines of my thighs with his fingertips to bring my legs over his hips. He ground into me, his denim-covered\u2014oh, my God!\u2014pressing into my hot, uncovered . . . lady business.</p><p>I really had to start using grown-up words.</p><p>Every cord of muscle in my body felt as taut as a bow string. I was full, plump, ripe, warm, wet. My body sang with want and needs soon to be fulfilled.</p><p>I hooked an ankle around his calf, arching into him. He moaned, gripping my hips and leading me into a slow, steady rhythm against him. He gently ripped the remains of my shirt and peeled it away, tossing it aside. I pulled his T-shirt over his head. A heavy silver medallion, threaded on a rawhide strip, bounced against my collarbone as he pushed my hair back from my face. It felt as if every part of him was reaching out for me, taking me in. I ran my thumb along his lower lip. He playfully bit down on the tip of my thumb as I tried to unbuckle his belt with the other hand. It was a trickier maneuver than you\u2019d think.</p><p>I whispered kisses across the hollow of his throat. He splayed his hand across my stomach, rubbing slow, tentative circles down until he reached the nest of curls covering my waiting\u2014</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Outside, I heard paws thumping against the damp ground, jarring me out of whatever spell we\u2019d woven in that warm little space. My brothers had tracked me down.</p><p>My eyes widened as I looked down at my own naked skin, Nick\u2019s half-undone pants. I\u2019d almost\u2014we\u2019d almost\u2014I shrank back from him. He frowned as I eased out from under him.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d I told him. He leaned forward to kiss me, but I ducked, reaching into the bag to pull the extra, extra sweatpants out. I climbed out over the tailgate.</p><p>The rain had stopped, leaving the woods with that cold, smoky-clean smell. The horse-sized russet-colored male was Samson. Cooper was the large black specimen. I tossed the sweatpants at them. \u201cHey, guys. Took you long enough to find me.\u201d</p><p>They phased simultaneously. Cooper looked furious. Samson looked as if his head was about to explode.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Cooper demanded. \u201cMom\u2019s worried sick. She called last night freaking out because you hadn\u2019t shown up. Samson and I have searched every run path between here and the valley. Why didn\u2019t we think of looking in ditches for some improvised truck treehouse? And I just realized you couldn\u2019t call because you had a wreck. Sorry, it\u2019s taking me a little bit to work through the mind-numbing terror.\u201d Cooper threw his arms around me. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>Samson joined the group hug by nearly knocking us both over.</p><p>\u201cMidget, you reek of . . . guy.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he caught Nick\u2019s scent. \u201cDr. Girlie Face? You spent the night \u2018stranded\u2019 with Dr. Girlie Face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Cooper growled</p><p>\u201cNot until after I kill him,\u201d Samson countered.</p><p>They both lunged toward the truck. I caught them by the scruffs of their necks and pulled them back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not killing anybody. We got into a wreck. He\u2019s injured. I whacked my head. I couldn\u2019t phase to run home and leave him alone. He was a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Samson and Cooper locked eyes. \u201cWe kill him anyway,\u201d Cooper said. Samson nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Cooper exclaimed when I shoved him back. \u201cThis is a time-honored tradition! Older brothers hurting and/or scaring the crap out of their sisters\u2019 boyfriends. It\u2019s the whole point of having a little sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Coop! And he\u2019s not my boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but!\u201d Samson sputtered.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Cooper conceded. \u201cWe won\u2019t kill him because he\u2019s interested in you. We\u2019ll kill him because judging by the way your clothes are clearly thrown on, I\u2019m assuming that he saw you naked or saw you phase. Either offense warrants me knocking the crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phased while I was asleep.\u201d I cringed. \u201cI whacked my head pretty hard and must have needed the beauty sleep.\u201d</p><p>Cooper nodded. \u201cDamned inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he knows our secret? Much better reason to kill him,\u201d Samson said, rubbing his hands together gleefully.</p><p>I snapped at him, \u201cSamson, shut it. We just have to think this whole thing through. Now is not the time for one of the nasty, bloody overreactions you end up apologizing for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time, Maggie. This time, I have a well-thought-out three-step plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, guys,\u201d Nick said, limping around the side of the truck. \u201cLook, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Nick made a startled \u201cuhf\u201d noise. His eyes rolled back, and he sank to his knees. Samson was standing behind him with a tree branch in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDid I knock him out?\u201d Samson asked, raising the tree branch over his head to strike Nick again.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I yelled, dropping to the ground next to Nick to check the wound on the top of his head. \u201cYou could have killed him! This is your plan? What are steps two and three? \u2018Find a shovel\u2019 and \u2018Dig a hole\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Nick was well and truly unconscious. But his pulse was strong, and his breathing was even. I sprang up to my feet and punched Samson in the nose, knocking him flat on his ass.</p><p>\u201cTold you she liked him,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cOw! What the hell, Maggie!\u201d Samson grunted, cupping a hand around his bleeding nose. \u201cThat really hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to hurt, dumb-ass!\u201d I yelled, flexing my bruised fingers. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Samson swiped at his nose. \u201cThis is just step one. Step two is we take him to the clinic in Grundy. We call Buzz to report the accident. And then we tell Nick that he hit his head really hard during the crash, and if he saw anything, like Maggie turning into a werewolf, it was probably just a bad dream. You know, the result of his concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been watching soap operas again?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually not that bad of a plan,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd if he goes around telling everybody he saw you turn into a wolf, he\u2019ll just get laughed at. It will discredit him. People will think he\u2019s loony.\u201d</p><p>My chest ached a little at the thought of Nick being mocked by locals. But I had to admit it wasn\u2019t totally misguided, as plans went. It was far better than Samson\u2019s idea for getting us out of trouble when we knocked over Mom\u2019s china cabinet, which centered on faking a robbery by carnies. \u201cThere are four steps in your three-step plan,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Samson brightened, and tossed Nick over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cWould you be careful with him?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to save your truck, Mags,\u201d Cooper said, trying to distract me from fluttering around Nick\u2019s unconscious form like an overwrought soccer mom.</p><p>I sighed, prying the tailgate open, knowing that my scent, mixed with Nick\u2019s, was now billowing out of the truck full-force. My face flushed hot, and Cooper pretended to be fascinated by some moss on a nearby tree.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a wrecker on earth that will be able to haul it out of here,\u201d I said, grabbing my bag. I rescued the necessary paperwork from the glovebox and claimed a couple of CDs from the floorboards. I took my dad\u2019s Saint Edmund medal from its honorary spot on the rearview mirror. The lot was stuffed in my emergency bag. I slid my still-damp boots onto my feet, as it seemed we would be walking home human. I stood at the edge of the ravine and stared at my former transportation. It felt as if I was losing my last connection to my dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Maggie,\u201d Cooper said, wrapping his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019ll get you an older, shittier truck when we get back to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss.\u201d I coughed to cover the sniffle caught in my throat and punched his arm.</p><p>\u201cCan we get going?\u201d Samson demanded, shifting Nick\u2019s weight. \u201cI\u2019ve got things to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get Samson a girlfriend,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSpeaking of which, what exactly happened between you and Dr. Girlie Face last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice attempt at a segue, but it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re, you know, being all careful with him. Being protective. You don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a monster, Coop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you once left a date at the emergency room with appendicitis because you didn\u2019t want to miss the previews for a Steven Seagal movie.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing. It\u2019s sort of nice to see this softer side of you. But, uh, Maggie, please understand, this is a conversation I never, ever wanted to have with you, but Samson was right. That guy\u2019s scent is all over you, and vice versa. You two obviously got . . . pretty close last night. And it seems like we interrupted something when we showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, shuddering. \u201cIt\u2019s just you\u2019ve always said you were going to . . . you know, with another wolf. I just want to make sure you\u2019re not rushing into anything. Of course, keep in mind that I don\u2019t have a lot of room to throw stones here, since I pretty much leaped into a relationship with Mo without even thinking of looking. And you\u2019re my baby sister, so I prefer not to think of you even doing that until you\u2019re, oh, eighty or so. Or when I\u2019m dead. Whichever comes first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCooper, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. You interrupted something. And it would have been a mistake. I realized that as soon as I snapped out of the haze I was in. I let my hormones and all that \u2018we almost died\u2019 adrenaline get the better of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems like an OK guy,\u201d Cooper admitted. \u201cI mean, I have to hate him a little bit, because it\u2019s my brotherly duty. But as guys who want to nail my sister go, I guess you could do worse. Like Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to see him again?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head and chewed on my bottom lip. Nick was changing me, making me weak, distracting me. Making me irresponsible and putting me this close to making life-altering decisions on a whim and a whiff of pheromones. I hadn\u2019t even thought about my family the night before. I didn\u2019t worry about whether my mother was worried about me or if Pops\u2019s heart-cath results had come back from Dr. Moder yet. All I could think about was Nick. That was unacceptable. I had people counting on me. People I loved and to whom I owed far more loyalty than some random guy I\u2019d know a few weeks. I shrugged, trying to give Cooper my most convincing nonchalant sigh. \u201cNo. I\u2019m done. This is over.\u201d</p><p>CAMPED OUT IN the uncomfortable waiting-room chairs in the Grundy clinic, I stared at Nick\u2019s face for most of the night. Dr. Patterson, who spent two days a week at the Grundy clinic, assured me that the \u201cblow to the head\u201d\u2014Samson\u2019s dumb-ass idea\u2014probably didn\u2019t do any long-term damage. The masochist in me wanted to take in as much of Nick as I could while I could, because what I was about to do would keep me away from him for the foreseeable future. I kept thinking of a passage in the final act of Romeo and Juliet, something about \u201cEyes, look your last!\u201d</p><p>Devoting any thought to the words surprised me, since I\u2019d loathed being forced to read about two spoiled, lovesick kids in high school. But I think I finally got why Romeo was so desperate and unbearably whiny while crouching over Juliet\u2019s body, even if my own situation was far less emo. He was trying to savor what was no doubt a scary, extremely crappy moment, because he didn\u2019t know what the future held.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need deep thoughts right now,\u201d I moaned, pressing my fingers to my temples.</p><p>\u201cMy head.\u201d Nick whimpered, the paper underneath him crinkling as he squirmed on the clinic cot. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was driving us to your place, and I lost control of my truck.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me a few times and then gingerly nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWe rolled into a ravine,\u201d he said, moaning as I handed him a glass of water. I had Dr. Patterson\u2019s number, but I held off on calling him back to the clinic just yet. Nick sipped the water and carefully tilted his head back to the pillow. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I nodded. \u201cAnd you hit your head on the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You hit your head,\u201d he said, squinting at me. \u201cI had to keep you awake. Kissed you. And when I woke up, you\u2019d changed. I woke up, and you were a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have hit your head pretty hard, huh?\u201d I said, forcing myself to give him a sympathetic smile.</p><p>He blinked at me, frowning. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit your head in the accident. You must have had some crazy dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream. You were there. We spent all night talking. And Cooper was there, eventually. And Samson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, too?\u201d I asked, struggling to keep the wry smile on my face. This hurt. It hurt so much to make him feel crazy, stupid, anything less than the sweet, brilliant man who kept me awake to prevent my brain from leaking out my ears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to play this off, Maggie. You\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cNo, Mo\u2019s the werewolf. Oh, wait, no, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m the werewolf. Or maybe it\u2019s my mom or Great-aunt Tilda.\u201d I sighed, fighting to keep my expression placid.</p><p>Of course, Great-aunt Tilda was one of the most intimidating specimens of geriatric wolfdom you could ever come across. But that was beside the point.</p><p>\u201cNick, this whole thing with werewolves has just gone too far. I humored you at first, because it was kind of quirky and charming, but it\u2019s just weird now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that I didn\u2019t wake up next to a little black wolf this morning, and that wolf didn\u2019t phase into a very human you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that we were in a car accident, and you have a pretty severe concussion. Beyond that, I don\u2019t have one clue what\u2019s going on in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw. You don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m not\u2014I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how I wished I could believe that.</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, look, I remember. We were at my house. We were watching Star Trek. I kissed you. And you ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran away from your house because I was upset. Because I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Nick sank back against the mattress, recoiling as if the wind had been knocked out of him.</p><p>I twisted my hands together, trying desperately to look like a guilt-ridden girlfriend, the kind you couldn\u2019t trust to go on spring break with her girlfriends. \u201cI started dating Clay a little while ago. He\u2019s good for me. He\u2019s a close friend of the family. Part of the reason I came to see you was to tell you that I can\u2019t accept things like pie from you. I\u2019m a oneman sort of woman. I don\u2019t play around like that. Between that and the wolf thing, I don\u2019t think we should see each other anymore. Don\u2019t come by my house. Stay away from my family. You\u2019re creeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought . . . I thought we were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Nick. You just misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, this was making my chest hurt.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what it\u2019s like!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know what pisses me off more, you denying that there\u2019s anything between us or you denying what you are. Do you know how much people would give to be able to do what you do? To be special? To be able to escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you like one of those weird guys who post sexy sketches of half-animals/half-ladies online?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe term is \u2018furry,\u2019 and no, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re a wolf. I like you because you\u2019re strong and funny and loyal and smart. You\u2019re special in a lot of ways. Being able to morph into a wolf is just one of them. And certainly not the one I will tell my friends about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you know the term for people who are sexually attracted to\u2014You know what? Never mind. None of this matters, because it\u2019s all in your head.\u201d</p><p>He smirked at me in that ridiculously cute way of his. \u201cOf all the things I just said, what you picked up on was my vast knowledge of sexual preoccupations?\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstances, that would have made me laugh my ass off. But I needed to pretend to be a normal girl, with normal tolerances for dirty jokes.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Maggie. Why are you fighting so hard against liking me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a mythological creature!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOK, if I was willing to drop the werewolf thing, if I was just to become another tourist up here, enjoying the Alaskan scenery, would you reconsider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t. The supernatural crap, it\u2019s your whole reason for being. It\u2019s what makes you . . . you. And I wouldn\u2019t ask you to give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m damned if I do and damned if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I stood up and slid into my jacket. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please, don\u2019t call me. Don\u2019t show up around my valley. Stay away from me and mine. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019d slammed the door before he could get out of bed.</p><p>AFTER I\u2019D HANDED over my clothes and bag, Samson and Cooper let me run home solo. Given the way my face was all pinched up, I think they knew I needed some time alone. I ran until I thought my lungs would burst. I collapsed to the ground outside town, phasing to human and lying on my back.</p><p>I lay there, staring up at the pine needles shifting over the endless expanse of blue.</p><p>I could smell a badger shuffling in the underbrush. I hated badgers; they were like sour-smelling, crotchety old men who could claw your face off. I considered chasing it just for the hell of it, but I just didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>I had to pull it together. I couldn\u2019t go home like this, all frazzled and twitchy. I took deep breaths, pulling the air down through my toes. I closed my eyes and went to my happy place, the ferry from Bellingham. My mother took me on a rare visit to her family in Seattle when I was seven, and I\u2019d spent most of the three-day trip sitting on the deck, with my legs dangling under the railing, my face in the wind. It gave my mom fits, seeing me that close to the edge, but she couldn\u2019t keep me inside.</p><p>I\u2019d never been anywhere before, really, and I remember marveling at how big the world was. How you could actually taste salt on the wind. How the spray from the ocean broke down to almost nothing and whispered across my face like kisses.</p><p>That\u2019s about as poetic as I got.</p><p>Nothing I\u2019d done since had ever been as peaceful or as right. Every time I was stressed or just needed a few minutes to myself, I closed my eyes and put myself right back on that boat. And I felt better for it.</p><p>The moment I closed my eyes, I could almost feel the tilt and roll of the deck under me. I leaned my chin on the cool aluminum rail and watched the whitecaps lap against the hull. I smiled, deciding to give myself just a few more minutes before I returned to reality.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to see Nick standing over me. He sat down next to me without benefit of a doughnut pillow, so I figured I\u2019d managed to slip into a dream state. It didn\u2019t stop me from being really annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my happy place?\u201d</p><p>He smirked at me. \u201cI was this close to getting to your happy place, so if that\u2019s an invitation, I accept.\u201d</p><p>My dream version of Nick was pretty perverted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? This is where I go to get away from things that bother me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked offended. \u201cI bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you were really upset with me, you probably would have dreamed me with a hump or a debilitating, itchy disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not wrong,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSo, what, you think you can show up here and put in a good word for reality Nick?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHow should I know? It\u2019s your happy place.\u201d</p><p>I muttered, \u201cWell, you could at least do this with your shirt off. What are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think there are probably some things you left unsaid earlier, and your brain is just giving you a chance to get it out of your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that couldn\u2019t be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he huffed, pulling his T-shirt over his head.</p><p>My eyes went wide at the sight of finely sculpted abs lightly dusted with a little gold happy trail. \u201cGod, this is going to be so much worse if you look like that in real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s even better,\u201d he assured me.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I have to lie to you. And I\u2019m sorry I have to make you feel crazy or unsure of yourself. I wish I could help you, but I just can\u2019t. As much as I think you could mean to me, I can\u2019t put you ahead of the people I love. You are a smart, funny, strange, drop-dead-gorgeous man. And I would like nothing more than to get to know you a hell of a lot better. But I think it\u2019s better this way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut none of that had anything to do with you, or you being a wolf, or how you feel. It\u2019s about everybody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your reasons are bullshit. You\u2019re so afraid of expressing how you really feel that you\u2019ll use any excuse to stay away from me. You\u2019ve never had someone interested in you and only you. And you\u2019re so afraid that\u2019s not enough to keep me around that you\u2019ll do anything to avoid finding out one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my figments are supposed to mouth off to me,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI was never much for rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cButterflies taste with their feet.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI bet you didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake. You can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want a lesser version of me in your happy place,\u201d he said, giving me a cheeky little leer.</p><p>I snorted and closed my eyes. \u201cGood-bye, Nick.\u201d</p><p>I felt a featherlight touch on my shoulder. \u201cGood-bye for now, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>I woke up with a start.</p><p>Well, that was helpful.</p><p>My head throbbing, I sat up, wondering how long I\u2019d been sleeping. The sun was hanging low over the mountain range. I sat up, feeling more groggy than refreshed. This was not the point of the happy place. Stupid Dream Nick and his verbal riddles consisting of stuff I already suspected.</p><p>I stretched my arms over my head and popped my back. Sleeping on the ground might connect you with the earth and all that crap, but it was hell on the vertebrae. Sure that my mom was worried enough to chew through phone books by now, I jogged toward home. I felt a fresh flush of guilt as I entered the village. This must be what parents felt like, returning to their kids after a long weekend away. I was a short step from giving every member of the pack a tacky T-shirt and a teddy bear. But at the moment, all I wanted was a hot meal, a large one, a hotter shower, and my bed. My front door was in sight when I heard my name called.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw Clay jogging down Main Street toward me. I groaned inwardly, bidding that hot meal a mental farewell. But I took a deep breath and turned to him with a genuine smile on my face. Clay was a good guy and considerably less of a pain in the ass than most people I knew. He deserved my undivided and nonirritated attention.</p><p>I sighed as I watched him lope to an easy stop in front of me and give me one of those heartwarming grins. In a good and decent universe, my choices would be limited to Lee and Clay, and the decision would be relatively easy: Clay and his cute little chin dimple by a landslide. I huffed, thinking about stupid, shirtless Dream Nick and the \u201cgrindy\u201d encounter in the back of my truck. I had to do something to get him out of my head. I had to show him that I was serious about staying away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of going to dinner with me some night?\u201d I asked Clay before he could say anything.</p><p>Clay hesitated. \u201cUh, I was just going to tell you that part for the snow blower came in yesterday. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of having dinner with me Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d he said, smiling hesitantly. \u201cWe could try that new pizza place in Burney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was thinking of the Glacier. We could see Mo and Cooper. It would be fun.\u201d</p><p>Clay looked confused but shrugged. \u201cWho am I to turn down one of Mo\u2019s burgers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up?\u201d I offered, then suddenly remembered that my truck was at the bottom of a ravine. \u201cHmm. No, wait, I think you\u2019ll have to drive.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Say It with Pastry</p><p>ON FRIDAY MORNING, I walked outside to find a tow truck unloading my truck in the little side lot by the community center. It hurt to see the scraped, dented side panels, the huge crater the trees had left on the passenger\u2019s side. The fender was bent to hell where the truck had tugged it up the incline. It was a wonder the tow truck had managed to winch it up from the ravine at all.</p><p>I could still smell Nick\u2019s scent, mingled with mine, wafting from the rear compartment. The scent made all previous empty chest aches feel like a mild tickle. I actually had to bend over and brace my hands against my knees as the tow-truck driver lowered the winch and gently dropped my poor baby to the concrete. He stepped out, a rangy, weathered man in his forties, wearing blue overalls that stated his name was Wesley.</p><p>\u201cHi, can I help you?\u201d I asked, straightening and doing my best to function like a normal person. \u201cDid the state police send you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, unhooking a chain from under my truck\u2019s tires.</p><p>There was something off about his smell; he definitely wasn\u2019t human. He wasn\u2019t a werewolf, either. He was definitely a were but something little, which was sort of funny, given that he looked as if he was blown out of a straw. I sniffed again. A weasel? Oh, come on. This guy was a were-weasel that ran around with \u201cHi, my name is Wesley\u201d stitched on his shirt? Some people had no sense of irony.</p><p>\u201cOK, do you just drive around the wilderness rescuing random were-creatures\u2019 stalled vehicles?\u201d I asked, my tone just a little bit snotty.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever say anything besides nope?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201c</p><p>I laughed, which made his lips twitch. \u201cThe bill\u2019s taken care of. Your cousin Caleb says you should call him.\u201d</p><p>With a chortle at my shocked expression, he drove away, taking the north road through the preserve. I dashed into my office to grab my cell phone and dial Caleb\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019ello?\u201d my cousin and packmate mumbled into the phone, using his \u201cbeing held hostage\u201d voice, which he only used when he was conducting surveillance.</p><p>\u201cHey, cuz! You got a mullet yet?\u201d I sang cheerfully into the phone . . . because it annoyed him.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHi, Mags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d I asked. Normally, Caleb, who spent his time on the road using his werewolf senses to track down society\u2019s misfits for a handsome fee, loved a good Dog the Bounty Hunter joke. \u201cWho was the were-weasel who just dropped my truck off? And how the heck did he manage to yank it up a forty-percent incline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesley\u2019s done some work on my truck,\u201d Caleb said. \u201cHe replaces a lot of my windows.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. As a not-quite-legitimate bounty hunter, Caleb came into contact with people who did not like being delivered back to the people they owed money to. And sometimes they took out their \u201cfeelings\u201d on his truck.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. And he gets into those hard-to-reach places. Samson called, told me what happened to your truck. I thought Wesley could lend a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks, I appreciate it. But is it causing you pain in some way? Why do you sound so weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesley took a look under the truck when he was hooking up the chain. He said your brake line looked worn. But not from use or age. He said it looked like something sharp had been scraped over the brake line over and over until it was ready to rupture. Maggie, have you pissed anybody off lately? Besides Cooper? Or Samson? Or Mo? Or your mom? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, I get it,\u201d I grumbled, considering the question. \u201cHonestly, other than that little problem last summer with Eli, I haven\u2019t gotten into any more scrapes than I normally would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much.\u201d He snorted.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ve been a relatively nice girl.\u201d Caleb snorted again. I shot back, \u201cI said relatively! So, what, you think someone tampered with my brakes because I was a smart-ass to them? Or maybe it was a rabbit out for revenge for all the little bunnies I\u2019ve eaten? Seriously, I rarely leave the valley. Who would mess with my truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mags,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think you need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in a veritable fortress, surrounded by burly protective relatives willing to kill for me. And not to mention, I sort of kick ass myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not invincible,\u201d Caleb argued.</p><p>\u201cFine. If I see a rabbit dressed in camo trying to jimmy the screen door with a hunting knife, I\u2019ll call for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I get the feeling you\u2019re not taking me very seriously.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you would be right,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut I will keep an eye out, I promise, just to humor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Caleb kept me on the phone for another twenty minutes, asking about various relatives, which meant he had to be worried. He tried to avoid talking on the phone whenever possible. I hung up, unsure what to think. How likely was it that someone had tampered with my brakes?</p><p>I shrugged out of my jacket and slid under the frame. There were clods of dirt, pine needles, and dead grass spotting the worn chrome. I inched my way under the axle . . . and realized I didn\u2019t know nearly as much about big engines as I thought I did. I recognized the bottom of the transmission and the fuel line. I found the brake drum and followed the thumb\u2019s-width plastic rope with my fingertips. It was smooth and unmarked until it reached the point lowest to the ground. I frowned. It wasn\u2019t cut, exactly, but it was definitely damaged. And the tear didn\u2019t look like something that would occur over a long period of time. As far as I could tell, I\u2019d hit some debris on the road and ripped it myself, which wasn\u2019t surprising, considering the tumble the truck took off the road.</p><p>I leaned closer to inspect the rupture in the line and picked up the faint scent of dryer sheets, the sort of clean, floral fabric-softener stuff my mom was always using. I chuckled. Wesley didn\u2019t look like the April Fresh type. But maybe he had a concerned she-weasel mate at home.</p><p>I heard two of my older uncles arguing loudly between their front stoops over a borrowed power tool. Apparently, they\u2019d decided to use other power tools to settle the dispute, so I crawled out from under the truck. Distracted by senior citizens armed with band saws and extension cords, I abandoned my defunct vehicle and didn\u2019t give the brakes another thought.</p><p>NICK SENT ME a freaking apology pie.</p><p>Several, in fact. First, it was apple-raisin, then Mo\u2019s famous chess pie, then French silk, each delivered to my door every day by my decreasingly bemused sister-in-law. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m charging him mileage,\u201d Mo told me as she walked through my front door and placed the chocolate \u201ctoo fluffy to look real\u201d meringue masterpiece in my hands. I could see the delicate little chocolate shavings speckling the crusty brown dome through the plastic carrying case. Mo slapped the note into my palm. It just said, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>This was the saddest pie of all. The previous pies had at least told me Nick was sorry and that he wanted to start fresh.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s moved on to meringue,\u201d Mo said, shaking her head. \u201cThis does not bode well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how to respond to this,\u201d I said, taking the pie into the kitchen. Mo collected the empty pie tins from the counter. Pie never lasted long in our house. Samson had taken to stopping by the house every night to make sure no pie was left behind. As long as Mo was making daily deliveries, he said I could stay mad at Nick forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d I promised her. \u201cEven though I really don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Mo countered. \u201cHe asked this morning if I could get enough peaches to make a cobbler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one says they\u2019re sorry with cobbler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause saying it with pie is super-normal,\u201d she retorted.</p> <p>WORKING WITH MY hands generally helped me sort through whatever had me wound up. The weird swooshy, acidy feeling that twisted through my chest whenever I thought of Nick or Clay had me taking apart the village\u2019s snow blower piece by piece.</p><p>At least my emotional turmoil was serving some purpose. Part of the problem with having an aging population was elderly werewolves\u2019 increasing inability to negotiate icy streets and sidewalks. We couldn\u2019t afford to replace the snow blower, but we also couldn\u2019t afford the cost of adding a Broken Hip Wing onto the clinic. Hence my need to squeeze one more year out of the twenty-year-old snow blower.</p><p>I\u2019d replaced the belts, the oil, and the spark plugs and was now praying that it wouldn\u2019t literally blow a gasket or part of my hand as I fired it up. I grinned like a madwoman when the diesel engine roared to life. Then a cloud of black smoke spiraled up from somewhere just out of reach, and I heard the first signs of stalling.</p><p>\u201cStupid, useless piece of crap!\u201d I yelled, the sound of the engine whining and sputtering to its death covering the worst of my curses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that some things, like your naturally even temper, never change.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw my grandfather standing in the doorway, clearly amused.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I would come by and pay my favorite granddaughter a visit,\u201d Pops said, winking at me.</p><p>At eighty-two, Noah Graham was sort of the Robert Redford of the Alaskan werewolf community. He was still blessed with a headful of iron-gray hair and the blue-green eyes Cooper had inherited. He also appeared to be in his early sixties, which was one of the perks of being a werewolf. Our bodies are resilient because of the constant phasing, lots of collagen. As long as we keep up with the sunscreen, we can look young well into our golden years.</p><p>But we aged, like everybody else. Pops had had what Dr. Moder called a \u201cminor episode\u201d the year before, which scared the hell out of all of us. We\u2019d all babied him shamelessly, which irritated his independent soul. He finally blew up and tossed a quart of chicken noodle soup at my aunt Maisie. That was when I knew he was getting better.</p><p>Pops and I had always had a close relationship. Most girls confided in their mothers when they were worried about a test or upset with a friend . . . or going through \u201cweird new body parts\u201d anxiety. I relied on my grandfather. Cooper and Samson went to him with their problems, and I figured I should, too. So far, with the rare exception of what we will only call the Training Bra Incident, it had worked out pretty well.</p><p>I kissed his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t let your five other granddaughters hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as he hitched himself into the seat of a defunct tractor-mower. \u201cWell, you\u2019re each my favorite in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice save, Pops.\u201d I snickered, handing him a bag of the Reese\u2019s Pieces he favored. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed that you wouldn\u2019t start every conversation that way,\u201d he said, cocking a gray eyebrow at me.</p> <p>\u201cForce of habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he told me, tugging my hair gently. \u201cHow is the search for a new truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalled,\u201d I griped. \u201cBad pun intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I enjoy bad puns.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to go look for another one. Fortunately, I don\u2019t leave the valley much, except to visit Grundy. I can run there, so it\u2019s not a huge deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI saw your aunt Billie earlier. She seems to be having a good day. She was playing Legos with Paul and Ronnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought they were Eli and Cooper, didn\u2019t she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cBut she was happy and smiling. And at this point, we should be grateful she can have days like that. Alicia told me to thank you again for sending the aunties over to help at night while she bathes the boys and gets them to bed. She says it\u2019s been a big help.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Nobody should have to shoulder all that responsibility alone.\u201d Pops smirked at me. \u201cOh, hush,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia also mentioned that you went on a date with her brother the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to braid each other\u2019s hair now, Pops?\u201d He gave me the stink-eye in response, so I sighed and said, \u201cI went out on a date with Clay. And it was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re making it sound like a trip to the dentist\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone want to talk about my personal life all of a sudden?\u201d I grumped, jumping and inspecting a wrench on the other side of the room. \u201cHave you talked to any of those curious souls about your personal life?\u201d he asked. I shook my head. \u201cAre you likely to?\u201d I laughed and shook my head again. He held out his hands and waved his fingers, as if to say, \u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI like Clay. On paper, he is the perfect mate for me.\u201d</p><p>Pops nodded. \u201cClay is a good boy. He\u2019s kind, he thinks before he acts, he takes care of his family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to date him, Pops?\u201d</p><p>Pops frowned. \u201cWe should have never encouraged you to speak. So, if Clay has balanced your pros-and-cons list, why aren\u2019t you out there running with him, instead of hiding in this shed?\u201d He smiled at me, triumphant. I never have been able to fool Pops.</p><p>I picked at the engine grease under my fingernails. \u201cThere\u2019s another man who seems interested in me. And he confuses me, mostly, but I like him, too . . . almost against my will. And I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Thatcher?\u201d he asked, grimacing. \u201cYou know, Maggie, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you dating a human. It\u2019s mating with one that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy put the energy into dating someone if you can\u2019t mate with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fun of it?\u201d he suggested</p><p>\u201cObviously, it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve dated, Pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that we want you to be happy, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but when has telling someone to do what makes them happy ever resulted in a good decision? Remember when we told cousin Todd to do what made him happy and he came home with recently augmented boobs?\u201d</p><p>Pops gave me a stern look but was working hard to keep the snickering internal. \u201cAs I was saying, we want you to be happy. But you also have to think of what\u2019s best for the pack,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re the alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I got more votes than Samson?\u201d</p><p>Pops chuckled. \u201cBecause you see underneath. You cut through the layers of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say politeness,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cAnd say what you think. It\u2019s an undervalued quality for humans, especially in a woman. But after the initial sting, people appreciate hearing the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m about to get hit with some of that truth,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like the idea of mating and marrying. And I know you hate it when one of the aunties declares she\u2019s found the perfect male for you. You\u2019re afraid that you\u2019ll lose the independence you\u2019ve built up. And you\u2019re afraid of spending your life with someone who\u2019s not going to make you happy. But you have to settle down sometime. It\u2019s part of your responsibility as pack leader. You set the example, provide stability for the pack. And there aren\u2019t enough werewolf males running around out there for the taking. If you think you could make a life with Clay, you should start now.\u201d</p><p>A tiny, petty voice welled up somewhere in my gut and grumbled that Cooper hadn\u2019t bothered setting an example. He\u2019d tied himself up nice and tight to the first human to break that thick cement shell he\u2019d built around his heart . . . and his brain.</p><p>As if he sensed my resentment, Pops added, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the strong one, Maggie. We both know Cooper wasn\u2019t ever going to be ready to lead the pack, not really. I want him to be happy, and I\u2019m glad that he found Mo. But it\u2019s always been you. You\u2019re the one who can make the hard decisions. You\u2019re the one strong enough to make your own happiness, even if it\u2019s not exactly what you wanted. I will love you no matter what you decide, but I can\u2019t help but hope that you\u2019ll make the choice that those around you could not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pressure, huh, Pops?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead and ambled toward the door. \u201cIf you want easy advice, ask a different grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember \u2018asking\u2019 for your advice,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>LATER, I WAS wandering home for a late lunch, wiping my hands on my overalls, and wondering if it would be weird for me to do repair work nude just to avoid the stains. I passed the community center and noticed an odd, acrid scent on the air. I followed it toward my office door and saw the first curling gray tendrils of smoke winding their way out of the splintered door glass. The motion of my yanking the door open pulled a cloud of thick smoke right into my face. I spluttered and coughed, pushing my way through to the growing plume of flame blooming from my desk.</p><p>Even through the choking gray haze, I could see that my office was trashed. The filing cabinet lay on its side, drawers torn out. My shredded files were strewn across the floor like wounded birds.</p><p>Someone had put my wastebasket in the middle of my desk, crammed it full of my paperback books, and set them on fire. The plastic walls of the basket were starting to soften and melt as the flames reached toward the ceiling tiles. Covering my mouth and nose with a bandana, I grabbed the fire extinguisher from the wall and doused the whole flaming mess with white foam. The sterile-smelling chemicals sprayed across my desk and hit the wall with a muted splat. After giving the wastebasket one long, final blast, I took out my work gloves to protect my hands while I heaved the smoking remains out into the parking lot.</p><p>I left the door open and propped all of the windows to let the smoke vent. I wiped my streaming eyes with the bandana and searched the ceiling for the blinking light of the smoke detector. As the smoke cleared, I could see the frayed wires dangling from where the device had been yanked from the wall.</p><p>I moved closer to my foam-covered desk, opening the drawers and finding the petty-cash box intact and the village checkbook still locked up tight. I ran to the other rooms of the center but found that the damage was limited to my office space.</p><p>How had this happened without my hearing anything? Gah, the music. Between my too-loud worship of all things Journey and the noise of the engine, I wouldn\u2019t have heard a Mack truck parking in my office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom and a few of the aunties appeared at my door, gasping in shock at the mess and the smoke. Ignoring their murmurs, I strode out into the street, working up a decent head of steam while I worked through what might have happened. The kids were in school, and most of the adults were at work or indoors. We ran perimeter checks on occasion, but it\u2019s not as if the valley was under twenty-four-hour guard.</p><p>I heard the school bell ring down the street, announcing the end of lunch, and paused. The high school kids were allowed to run home for lunch if they wanted. Between the werewolf stuff and the regular human adolescent roller coaster, their bodies went through more food than could be easily carried to school. It was easier for them to run home and scarf down as many calories as possible just to get through the day. \u201cFree lunch\u201d left them unsupervised for a good hour of the day, but we tried to emphasize trust and personal responsibility in the pack. Obviously, that had come back to bite us on the ass.</p><p>I marched to the school building and called all five high school students to the office, which was basically the supply closet at the end of the classroom. If I was going to question one of them, I would question them all. Frankly, if one of them had anything to do with the fire, their friends were smart enough to distance themselves by ratting them out. Cousin Teresa gave the little kids busy work and sat with me while I marched the teens away.</p> <p>Their chatter and teasing died the minute I walked into the tiny room. The kids sat up a little straighter and put on their serious faces. They eyed me solemnly, all long, coltish limbs combined with baby cheeks and huge eyes. Of the five, only three, Ricky, Rebecca, and Benjamin, were able to phase, but they all recognized the authority of the pack leader. They knew that disrespect and sass would get them into trouble with me and then again with their parents. It was a double whammy of adult supervision.</p><p>My eyes narrowed at Benjamin and Ricky, the chewing-tobacco enthusiasts whom I\u2019d forced to overindulge to the point of vomiting. They were good kids but had been known to cause more than their fair share of trouble. This included accidentally setting my workshop aflame with a badly timed M-80. Had their pyromaniac antics escalated to intentional damage? Were they trying to get back at me for the puking?</p><p>\u201cDo any of you have anything to tell me? Something to do with my office?\u201d I asked, giving each of them my best motherly glare. The kids\u2019 eyes went wide, and their mouths clamped shut. \u201cLook, if you did it because you thought it would be funny or you\u2019re upset with me about something, it\u2019s not OK, but I get it. I did a lot of stupid stuff when I was a kid. But it\u2019s better to go ahead and fess up to it and take your licks now than to lie. Because then I\u2019ll be pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cNo one knows who gave my office the arsonist\u2019s makeover?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Teresa gasped. \u201cSomeone set fire to your office?\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin, the oldest of the group, shook his shaggy brown head. \u201cHonest, Maggie, we wouldn\u2019t do something like that. My dad\u2019s still pissed at me for the chaw thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re afraid of you,\u201d Lila added.</p><p>The other kids nodded solemnly. I gnawed on the inside of my cheek, focusing all of my energy on keeping my frustration and temper in check. I believed them, which meant that my anxiety over the whole episode had just doubled. It wouldn\u2019t do to explode all over these kids just because I didn\u2019t get the easy answer that I wanted. Breathing slowly through my nose, and getting a nostril full of the smoky stink rising from my jacket, I sighed. \u201cWhen you were on your way home for lunch, did you see anything strange or see anyone who isn\u2019t part of the pack wandering around?\u201d</p><p>The kids shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cWe just heard that crappy old-timer music you like blaring from the shed,\u201d Ricky said, smirking at me. Ricky was the resident smart-ass, which sort of endeared him to me. Rebecca, his twin, elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>My mouth twitched. That smart-ass little answer was exactly what I needed to snap my mood back into place. I kept my voice level but serious. \u201cOK, until I say otherwise, I want you guys to keep an eye on the little kids,\u201d I told them. \u201cAnd if you see anyone you don\u2019t recognize walking around, tell the nearest pack member. Don\u2019t try to approach them yourselves.\u201d I saw Benjamin bristle a little. \u201cEven though you are all clearly bad-asses.\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin smirked, appeased.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about we skip the history quiz this afternoon?\u201d Teresa suggested. The kids whooped and hollered. Teresa added, \u201cAnd as a community service project, you can go over to the center and help Maggie clean up her office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d The kids groaned.</p><p>Teresa lifted her brow.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yaaaay,\u201d Ricky said in the least convincing cheerful voice ever.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it, kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you call the cops?\u201d Teresa asked as the teens filed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI sort of am the cops around here,\u201d I reminded her. Teresa had lived in Portland for a while, after getting engaged to a male from one of the local packs. She lived there for two years, an incredibly long engagement for a were, before deciding that he wasn\u2019t a good match, and moved back home. Her mother had told my mother that the bastard had called it off and mated with a human.</p> <p>City life had left Teresa a bit out of sorts. She was used to public transportation, restaurants, movie theaters, cooperating with the human authorities . . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s just been so long since we\u2019ve had any sort of trouble. I sort of forgot the procedure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Thanks for sending the kids over. I\u2019m pretty sure I have a brigade of aunties helping me already, but the kids will make the job go faster. Do you need anything here at the school?\u201d I asked as she walked me out of the schoolhouse. \u201cSupplies? Snacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, we\u2019re pretty much covered, as long as I can get the Gilbert kids to stop chewing on the nap-time mats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss nap-time.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t?\u201d She chuckled, waving me away.</p><p>When I arrived at the office, the smoke had all but disappeared. Mom and the aunts and gathered outside the building, whispering among themselves, while the kids worked.</p><p>\u201cWhat a mess.\u201d Mom sighed, kissing my cheeks and checking me over for obvious wounds. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I promised, wiggling out of her grasp. There were people watching, for goodness sake. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure what happened. We might need to have a pack meeting later, OK? Can you all tell your families?\u201d The women nodded earnestly. \u201cFor right now, how about you go home and let the kids do the heavy lifting? Burn off a little of that energy.\u201d</p><p>I heard my aunt Bonnie, Ricky\u2019s mother, whisper, \u201cPlease, Lord,\u201d as the ladies dispersed.</p><p>I walked into my office and found that Rebecca, the most organized soul in the group, had already started sorting through the papers and trying to salvage some of my ripped file folders. Ricky and Benjamin were in deep conference regarding which caustic substance would best clean the smoke marks from my ceiling.</p><p>After convincing them that hydrochloric acid was probably overkill, I directed the others to help me gather my paperbacks and throw what couldn\u2019t be saved into the Dumpster out back. As I leaned over to right my slashed office chair, I caught the faint whiff of a familiar scent. Something clean and floral under the smoke.</p><p>Fabric softener. The same sort of April Fresh scent that had lingered on my truck.</p><p>I leaned closer, inhaling. It was new, definitely not something that had been clinging to my chair that morning. I tried to circulate through the room and subtly sniff the kids to check if maybe they\u2019d cross-contaminated the chair with their moms\u2019 laundry habits.</p><p>But kids today, what with the Dateline sex-predator expos\u00e9s, notice when an adult sniffs them. Frankly, that made me feel better about the kids\u2019 survival instincts. And it ended up being an exercise in unnecessarily creepy futility, because none of them smelled April Fresh. Spring Meadow? Mountain Breeze? Sure. But not a whiff of April Freshness.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. I believed the kids when they said they didn\u2019t barbecue my office. And we hadn\u2019t had a stranger wander into town for random vandalism in, well, ever. And I couldn\u2019t shake the odd coincidence that the undercarriage of my truck had smelled like dryer sheets. Who the hell would want to cut the brakes on my truck? Or toss my office? One act seemed rather serious, while the other just annoyed the hell out of me and cost me a new wastebasket. And who the hell used so much fabric softener that it obliterated all other traces of their natural scent?</p><p>Eli. The pack\u2019s former alpha would have thought of something like that as he was terrorizing and attacking people near Cooper\u2019s home in Grundy\u2014Susie Quinn, a couple of teenage hikers, Abner Golightly. Cooper had been convinced that he was doing it himself, that he was having some sort of wolf blackout, which was exactly what Eli wanted him to think.</p><p>Cooper had a harder time remembering his time as a wolf than most of us. The more time a wolf spends with the pack, the clearer memories are during the phasing. There was a sort of collective memory among us, which could be unfortunate, given some of the stupid shit Samson pulled while on four legs. Since Cooper had spent nearly two years away from the pack, he was practically an amnesiac. When people started dying and Cooper thought it was possible that he could hurt Mo, he thought his only option was to leave.</p><p>Eli would have pulled something sneaky and backhanded like messing with my truck or setting fire to the \u201cseat of my authority.\u201d</p><p>But Eli was dead, which left me without a suspect list.</p><p>8</p><p>Battle Scars</p><p>I CIRCULATED THROUGH THE VILLAGE, warning the older members of the pack to keep an eye out. And able-bodied pack members were going to be running perimeter a lot more often. We didn\u2019t want the police traipsing around the valley. I couldn\u2019t run fingerprint analysis on my own truck or my office door. So, beyond increased patrols, there wasn\u2019t much I could do.</p><p>And that\u2019s what had me on four legs, running along the lip of the valley on a Monday evening. Well, I was supposed to be running along the edge of the valley.</p><p>After Uncle Frank mentioned our possible intruder problem, Lee had shown up with \u201creinforcements,\u201d big burly males from his pack to help run patrols. I think he saw it as some sort of courting gesture, a \u201csee how well we will all work together when the two packs are in-laws\u201d thing. He kept trying to organize us into pairs and send the troops to \u201cstrategic locations\u201d in the valley, but he didn\u2019t know where those points were. And again, he just wasn\u2019t that smart.</p><p>The meeting spiraled into a chaotic mess, and it took Samson bellowing \u201cShut the hell up!\u201d at the chattering mob of weres before I could get everyone calmed down and paired off.</p><p>Of course, Lee refused to be paired with anyone but me. But I\u2019d managed to ditch him just outside the village while he was distracted. I took off through a tight passage under a bunch of scrub pines. He was too big to fit through and hadn\u2019t managed to catch up to me in more than an hour.</p><p>Wandering aimlessly in the dusky, purpling woods, I wondered where Clay was. He\u2019d been paired up with Teresa. I\u2019d planned on partnering him with Samson, but my cousin suddenly had to pee during the assignments. He came back in just as Alicia stepped through the door, eager for a day outside since my mother had offered to watch the boys. And somehow, conveniently, Samson was the only wolf left without a partner.</p><p>My big dumb cousin could be downright devious sometimes. His interest in Alicia was an interesting development. It was a little strange, as werewolf males didn\u2019t typically spark on widows, particularly widows with children. But if Alicia made Samson happy, I\u2019d help negotiate for her paw myself.</p><p>On the other hand, Teresa was showing clear interest in Clay, which was a problem. Clay and I had gone on two dates so far, and we\u2019d had a great time together. Clay could take my mind off the stresses of the pack, but I didn\u2019t forget myself completely. It felt safer being with him than the constant emotional carnival ride I seemed to be stuck on with Nick. But how was that was going to work with Teresa? I hated to think of her seeing us and feeling jealous, upset, alone. She\u2019d already been screwed over by Cupid once. Maybe I could try setting her up with one of Lee\u2019s packmates. Some of them seemed smarter than he was, though not as handsome. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was considering the various blind-date candidates when I caught the April Fresh scent of fabric softener lingering on the wind. I bolted after it blindly. Tactically, it was a stupid thing to do. But after tumbling that scent over and over in my head for nearly a week, it drew me like a beacon. My legs seemed to devour the ground as I raced through the trees, following the scent all the way to the town limits of Grundy.</p><p>I was running toward Cooper\u2019s house, my feet crunching on the frosted ground. The faint, shadowy outline of the moon was rising high over the trees. I lost the scent somewhere near the little brook that babbled through Cooper\u2019s backyard. It just disappeared. I slowed to a trot and tried to find some hint of it on the breeze, but I got nothing.</p><p>Suddenly, the hair on the back of my neck rose with some electric charge. The faintest trace of that smoky-moss and Sunday-lunch smell wafted around my head. Nick was somewhere near.</p> <p>And he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I dashed through the underbrush, charging headlong toward Nick. I broke through the tree line to find him sitting in the clearing, talking in a conversational tone to a huge tawny male wolf that was staring at Nick as if he were on the menu.</p><p>Seriously, what does it take to keep one human alive? It was as if he was the anthropological Evel Knievel.</p><p>I growled, announcing my presence to the male timber. Keeping his eyes on Nick, the wolf rounded his body toward me. He wasn\u2019t about to give up Nick, which had me worried. Most sane wolves try to shy away from human contact whenever possible. This one was treating Nick like prize prey. Using one last quick burst of running energy, I threw myself between man and wolf. I felt Nick retreat behind me, as if he\u2019d finally caught on that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><p>I widened my stance, making myself look as large as possible, and growled. The timber\u2019s lip curled away from his fangs, and he grumbled back. He advanced, thinking that because I was smaller, I would back down. I stepped forward, thumping my head against his chest and throwing my shoulder into him. He snapped his jaws, trying to catch my neck, but I\u2019d slipped back enough to give me room for another shove. He shifted his weight, feinting left and then dashing right. I held, sinking my teeth into his foreleg and dragging him away from Nick, none too gently. He retreated slightly, only to rear up on his hind legs and come at me with its front. I ducked, then leaped up, pushing at his stomach until he fell onto his back.</p> <p>The male leaped to his feet, gathering at his haunches to lunge at me. I braced myself for the impact and instead ended up dropping to the ground as a high-pitched shrieking noise made my head feel as if it was imploding. It was every annoying sound combined\u2014nails scratching on a chalkboard, tires squealing, my aunt Edie singing. I pressed my head against the ground, rolling my ears against the dirt, just to try to block it out. The noise lessened just a little, allowing me to raise my head.</p><p>I looked back to see Nick, on his knees, holding what looked like an air horn. His face tensed as his eyes connected with mine. Did he recognize me? Did he know? Could I persuade him to throw that freaking horn into the woods and never use it again?</p><p>The wolf beside me rose wobbily to his feet and seemed to be trying to mount another attack. Cringing, Nick blasted the damn horn again, knocking my legs from under me. I lay there for what felt like hours, praying for the pressure in my ears to subside. The other wolf got tired of writhing on the ground in agony, shook his way to his feet, and dashed off. As soon as he was out of the clearing, Nick laid off the \u201cpain horn.\u201d I whirled around to find him patting the ground for his glasses.</p><p>Honestly, I could have strangled him, but at the moment, I didn\u2019t have any thumbs. He reached his hand out, as if he was going to freaking pet me. I barked sharply at him and phased in mid-step.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of holy hell where you thinking?\u201d I demanded. \u201cDo you have any idea what could have just happened to you? Do you have instincts that might not lead to your certain death?\u201d</p><p>Nick gaped at me, a goofy look of astonishment and happiness twisting his moonlit features. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf!\u201d he exclaimed.</p> <p>Damn it. I hadn\u2019t meant to phase back in front of him. I\u2019d just been so mad at him for putting himself in such a stupid situation that I\u2019d put myself in the best form for yelling.</p><p>Honestly, I gave up. There was no way to keep Nick from finding out about us. He seemed to have some sort of unholy gift for putting himself in exactly the right place at the right time. He was just going to keep doing this sort of thing until he got himself killed. Maybe it was better this way . . . but there was no way I was going to admit that. I held my arms across my chest self-consciously and glared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d he cried, half accusing, half triumphant.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d I spat, throwing up my arms. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes, a little bit,\u201d he admitted, sliding his glasses onto his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that thing?\u201d I asked, snatching the little air horn out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, a friend of mine in the bio department at U Dub came up with that,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cHe\u2019s still testing it as a defense system for hikers. It works at a decibel level and frequency that are almost debilitating for canines. If you come across a wolf on the trail and use it, the wolf will either run off or be too distracted to chase you when you run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll make a fortune,\u201d I muttered, slapping it back into his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know it was you. I was just trying to break up the fight\u2014\u201d Realization suddenly dawned on Nick\u2019s face. \u201cOh, hey, wait a minute, so that means that whole scenario with the nudity and the kissing and the rubbing in your truck\u2014that really happened!\u201d</p><p>I blushed. Blushed! I never blushed, and here it felt as if my cheeks were going to burst into flames. \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He grinned winsomely. \u201cTrust me, I keep very careful mental records of the beautiful women I\u2019ve seen naked. And you are a very memorable entry in my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say \u2018spank bank,\u2019 I will literally knock teeth out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say\u2014\u201d He stopped in mid-sentence, suddenly aghast. \u201cWhere does a nice girl even learn a term like \u2018spank bank\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a nice girl. And I spend a lot of time with barely postadolescent men,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes. \u201cLook, can we have this conversation somewhere a little less secluded and open to attack? What are you even doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Alan make some crack about this being a high-traffic area for the wolf sightings. I came out here to investigate. I saw the wolf . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you assumed it was a werewolf and not, say, an actual timber wolf that could rip your throat out and leave your bones scattered all over this clearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Cooper,\u201d he said, paling. \u201cOh, shit, was that a real wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was a werewolf,\u201d I said, shaking my head and eyeing the tree line.</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>WE ENDED UP stumbling our way back to Nick\u2019s, although Cooper and Mo\u2019s place was closer. I didn\u2019t want to have to explain to my brother that I\u2019d phased in front of Nick again or endure Mo\u2019s superior little smirks.</p><p>I called Samson to tell him I would be away for the night and to watch the borders of the valley for strangers. He was confused, but I was using my \u201cdon\u2019t question me\u201d tone, so he agreed. I turned back to Nick.</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest, feeling oddly naked. Well, I was naked. But I felt more naked than usual. How was I going to do this? I wondered. What would this mean for my family? How much of this was I telling him because I wanted him to understand the pack, and how much of it was I telling him because I wanted him to understand me?</p><p>We basically stood in his front hall and stared at each other. I turned on my heel and walked into his kitchen. On the wall, he had a map marked with red pins at the attack sites. He had tried to mark the estimated hunting range, with a list of average wolfhunting ranges posted on the wall next to mileage estimates from each attack site to Mo\u2019s house. He had our accident scene marked with a blue pin. He had two huge lists written on two sheets of legal paper. One was marked \u201cProven\u201d and was completely blank. The other was titled \u201cTotal Bullshit\u2014Probably\u201d and included \u201cfull-moon phasing,\u201d \u201cbipeds,\u201d \u201cbitten vs. born,\u201d and, finally, \u201csilver bullets\u201d with a question mark next to it. And there was a stack of little notebooks, each one filled with scribbles.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, silver bullets will kill us,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd so will real bullets. Bullets kill pretty much everybody.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and pulled out a Sharpie to make a note on his chart. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any other little James Bond gadgets I should know about, do you?\u201d I asked, eyeing the air horn, which he\u2019d tossed onto the counter. \u201cA gun that\u2019ll launch a net over me? Cufflinks that shoot bear mace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That would be pretty cool, though.\u201d His lips twitched a little when I glared at him. \u201cBut obviously not appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Snickering, he tossed me a pair of old basketball shorts and a Reidland High School Greyhounds T-shirt. I turned my back to slip into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d he asked, suddenly very close behind me, running his fingertips along three slashing scars down my back.</p><p>\u201cAngry bear. I was on a run with my brothers at Eagle Pass,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI was young. I thought I was the biggest, baddest thing on the mountain. The bear reminded me otherwise, when I got too close to her cubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you heal so quickly; I seem to remember something about that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure, we heal, but we still scar. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re vampires.\u201d Nick\u2019s face lit up with delight and a million questions, so I had to add, \u201cAs far as I know, vampires are not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he grumbled as I pulled the shirt over my head and slid into the shorts. Nick lifted my leg and examined the waffle pattern of tiny dents along my thigh. He quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNever piss off a porcupine, no matter how jolly he may seem,\u201d I explained gravely. \u201cCartoons are very misleading.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to another long white streak on my shin.</p><p>\u201cSoftball game, sliding into second. Samson wouldn\u2019t get out of the damn baseline.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then traced his fingers along the faint trio of short lines just over my throat. \u201cI\u2019ll get to that one,\u201d I told him. His brows furrowed. \u201cAsk me anything,\u201d I offered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about us, and then I\u2019ll tell you why you shouldn\u2019t share what I tell you with other people.\u201d</p><p>His face lit up as if I\u2019d just offered him the Holy Grail, a Babe Ruth rookie card and Megan Fox\u2019s phone number.</p><p>Just to take the look off his face, I added, \u201cThat reason includes the words \u2018because I\u2019ll kill you and make sure no one ever finds your body.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cI can live with that.\u201d He nodded, making little \u201churry up\u201d motions with his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t start the explanations until you have your little notebook and a number two pencil and all that crap. I don\u2019t like interruptions.\u201d</p><p>Patting his pockets frantically, he ran for his notebook, and it was clear that he had pages of carefully scripted questions. His eyes scrambled over the pages for a few moments before he finally looked up at me, pushed his glasses up on the bridge of his nose, and said, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we change?\u201d I asked. He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just genetics. Some people have good balance or are really good at making egg salad. We can change into abnormally large wolves.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I explained to Nick that there were packs all over the world. Our pack happened to be descended from people who lived in the valley. An outsider crossed the frozen oceans, made his way over the mountains, and married a valley woman. He must have come from Russia or northeastern Asia, where there were a lot of packs. Either way, something about the mixing of their bloodlines produced the first wolf-sons, two huge, burly, probably pretty hairy fellas. There was a terrible winter, and the hunters couldn\u2019t get enough food for their families. People were starving. The Northern Man\u2019s elder son wished for the strength of the wolf, so that he could provide for his family and neighbors, and he wished so strongly that he was able to phase. And then his brother, seeing what the elder could do, joined in. They were able to hunt up enough food for the whole village and store some away, which was almost being a millionaire in the those days. The other villages kept asking how they did it, but my ancestors were smart enough not to tell. Instead, they shared what they had and prevented jealousy, which was pretty damned ingenious. I like to think my family invented public relations.</p><p>\u201cPhasing just became a way of life,\u201d I told Nick. \u201cThey had a lot of kids, all of whom could transform. So could their kids, and their kids, et cetera, et cetera. And here we are.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, his eyes all shiny and bright like a kid\u2019s on Christmas morning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d I said, motioning at his cabinets. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. I took a carton of eggs out of his fridge and heated a pan. I opened his spice drawer and was shocked to find garlic salt that was at least five years old and what might, at one point, have been nutmeg.</p><p>\u201cMo would be appalled by this,\u201d I told him, clucking my tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll subscribe to the Spice of the Month Club if you keep talking,\u201d he promised solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t do that online; you\u2019ll be shocked by your search results.\u201d I cracked eggs, beating them lightly. I poured them into the pan and took a hunk of cheddar cheese from the fridge. I sniffed to make sure it was mold-free. I wasn\u2019t a cook. I didn\u2019t have the knack or the time for it. Plus, my mom never let me near her stove. You melt one microwave, and the woman completely loses her sense of humor. But at the moment, it felt nice to move around the kitchen, to keep my hands busy and give myself some time to work through what I wanted to say.</p> <p>\u201cCan you make toast?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded, coming out of whatever contemplative fog he\u2019d been in. \u201cSo, is the pack set up like a real wolf pack? Is there an alpha male?\u201d he asked, sliding wheat bread into the toaster.</p><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s an alpha female,\u201d I said. His jaw dropped. I grinned and pointed to myself.</p><p>\u201cThat is so hot,\u201d he groaned. \u201cNot to be a chauvinist, but how do you get dozens of big, burly guys and older, stubborn ladies to listen to your every command? Don\u2019t they resent being bossed around by a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dr. Dolittle, as you well know, there are lots of matriarchal setups in the animal kingdom, including killer whales, bees, and elephants. Mother Nature isn\u2019t completely chauvinist,\u201d I said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s not typical for werewolves to be led by a female, but in the absence of the rightful alpha, Cooper, it was the pack\u2019s choice. The alpha serves as a sort of leader for the village. While the lesser pack members have property rights and general free will, all major decisions must be filtered through the alpha couple. Or would be, if I had a mate.\u201d</p><p>When he frowned, I could almost see the \u201csounds like a cult\u201d wheels turning in his head.</p> <p>I added, \u201cI know it sounds weird. Wolves work together to make sure that everybody in the pack is fed, safe. They\u2019re conditioned to work in harmony under a clear social rule. They need a single voice to lead them, the alpha. So when the alpha tells you to do something, even if you know what he\u2019s asking is stupid or dangerous, you\u2019ll do it. And you\u2019re happy to do it, because it\u2019s for the good of the pack. You need that community, the family, to feel complete. It\u2019s a little harder for me, because I\u2019m not the rightful alpha. Sometimes I have to appeal to my pack\u2019s collective common sense and, well, their fear that I\u2019ll kick their asses, to get my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if the pack is so important, why did Cooper leave?\u201d</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow and flipped an only slightly singed cheese omelet onto a plate. I poured more eggs into the pan and grated more cheese. I forked a huge mouthful of omelet into my mouth. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know how to ask softball questions, do you?\u201d I asked around my food.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t share!\u201d he exclaimed, handing me a piece of buttered toast, which I promptly devoured. \u201cNow that I know that the truck interlude was real, I know I told you about my crazy childhood. I can break out the stories about being left in the family station wagon while my mom gambled for twelve-hour stints. We can play the \u2018whose childhood was more screwed up? game. Because I\u2019ve never lost.\u201d</p><p>I countered, \u201cMy dad was shot in the head by research scientists because they thought he was going to eat them.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cSo, you are a contender.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. If I was going to do this, I was going all in. He was probably going to find out anyway. My mom would probably tell him over tea and cake. I took a deep breath and told him my story, that when I was sixteen or so, another pack came to the valley and tried to take it. Cooper had only been alpha for about a year. I guess at the time, I didn\u2019t realize how young Cooper was. He was my big brother and always seemed so grown-up to me. But he was practically a kid, and not only was he taking care of me and my mom, but he was running the pack, too. Looking back, I\u2019m sort of ashamed that I didn\u2019t see how much stress he was under. But I was young and, well, stupid.</p><p>Late one night, this other pack showed up and dragged me out of my bed into the street. I explained, \u201cThe alpha, this huge guy named Jonas, held me by the back of the neck and told Cooper that he\u2019d wring it like a chicken\u2019s if we didn\u2019t just hand the valley over and disappear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Roanoke?\u201d</p><p>I squinted at him.</p><p>\u201cColonial Virginia . . . whole community disappeared into thin air. It\u2019s like the first unsolved mystery of the New World.\u201d He held up his hands as I flipped the omelet onto his plate. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cAnyway, these numb-nuts had apparently hunted their own packlands into nothing, and the valley is known to be a particularly sweet setup in the were community.\u201d</p><p>He frowned while he chewed. \u201cI assume that\u2019s a werewolf faux pas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerritory is all we have sometimes. You just don\u2019t do that. Werewolves are genetically programmed to protect their packlands, to stay close. Ripping a pack away from that is just evil. A wolf\u2019s brain is hardwired to protect a certain area of land, to hunt there, to live there. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for our pack for almost a thousand years. So, if they\u2019d managed to snake it out from under us, imagine fighting against that kind of draw, every waking moment of every day. It would be torture. The sick thing is, if they\u2019d come to us and asked if they could stay, I know Cooper would have let them. Hell, he did offer them a place, even when they threatened us. He\u2019s just that kind of guy. He\u2019s better than me, kinder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, you\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hand over my heart. \u201cThank you, really, the praise, it\u2019s heartwarming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that you\u2019re fantastic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Back to my story. So, Jonas is shaking my head so hard I can actually feel my brain bouncing around in my skull. And I\u2019m just laughing my ass off, because I know any minute, my brother\u2019s going to open a case of whoop-ass on this guy. I could almost taste the fight, and it was going to be beautiful. I was so caught up in the anticipation that it took me a minute to realize Cooper was just standing there. He was frozen. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me that he wouldn\u2019t know exactly what to do. I mean, how stupid is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone idolizes their big brothers,\u201d he said, shrugging, pushing my hair over my shoulder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked Jonas in the balls and called him a jerkoff.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWell, of course, you did.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI figured it would wake Cooper up, draw him into the fight. And man, Jonas was pissed. He phased faster than you could blink and went right for my throat.\u201d I dragged my fingers over the faint white lines left behind by his claws. \u201cI thought, Bring it. If Cooper isn\u2019t going do his job, I\u2019ll do it. But damned if Cooper didn\u2019t phase and shove me out of the way. I tried to circle around, get at Jonas myself, but Cooper wouldn\u2019t let me. When I finally got a shot in at Jonas, I jumped at him too early, and the fucker pinned me. I would have felt like an asshole, except he had his teeth at my throat. I was too busy panicking.\u201d I twisted my fingers around the blankets and looked down. This was the part of the story I hated. The one I\u2019d never talked about with anyone but Mom and Cooper.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Maggie, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper knocked him off me. And he, um, he killed him. You know what they say about cutting the head off the snake? Well, it just pisses the rest of the snake off. The enemy pack circled on Cooper. They were going to tear him apart, and he took them all on. He killed all of them. He wouldn\u2019t let any of us near the fight. Except for a straggler male who tried to jump on his back. I killed him, without even thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Nick was quiet, picking at the remains of egg on his plate. \u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no,\u201d I exclaimed with false, exaggerated cheer. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to know I\u2019ve taken someone\u2019s life, that I\u2019m responsible for taking a wolf out of this world, when there are so few of us left. My mom brings it up every Thanksgiving, so the whole family can relive the memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking this seriously,\u201d he dead-panned.</p><p>\u201cCooper had a hard time with it. He had nightmares. He lost weight, stopped running with the pack. He didn\u2019t want to be near any of us. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch our mother, wouldn\u2019t even hug her, for the longest time. He said he was afraid of what he was, of what was inside him that let him kill people, even if it was in defense of the pack. If I\u2019d known anything back then, I\u2019d have known he probably had PTSD or something. But I thought he was being dramatic and stupid. Everybody tried to talk to him, to tell him how proud we were, how proud my father would have been. But nothing stuck. He just sort of retreated into himself. The pack suffered. It was like mass depression or something. Nobody wanted to run or hunt. Without a leader, we were more vulnerable than ever. I got scared, and I was hurt . . . and that\u2019s not something I work through very well. There was a lot of, um, lashing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWhen Cooper talked about that night, he made it sound like he\u2019d done something unforgivable. And that meant what I\u2019d done was unforgivable, too. I\u2019d depended on him to be everything, a brother, a father, and to have him snatch that away . . . well, needless to say, I got pissed. I mean, who did he think he was, being all tortured and selfish when we needed him? He was the alpha. He had a responsibility to us, and he was just pissing it away. I wouldn\u2019t have wasted it. I knew that much. And that little seed of resentment started to grow and take root.</p><p>\u201cCooper decided we were better off without him and moved to Grundy. I went a little crazy. And for years, I kept expecting the hurt to go away, even just a little bit, but it just seemed to get worse.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Eli air-quote \u2018reluctantly\u2019 stepped in to take over the pack. He\u2019d been a sort of kindred spirit. He always said he was just holding Cooper\u2019s place until Cooper came back. And I started to resent that, too. Without Cooper, I was the strongest in the pack. I was the fastest. Except for Eli, I was probably the smartest . . . which wasn\u2019t saying much. Once we were back on our feet, I didn\u2019t see why Eli should be holding the place at all. I thought I was ready to take Cooper\u2019s place right then. And why shouldn\u2019t I? He didn\u2019t want it, so why shouldn\u2019t I have it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick lifted his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I was eighteen. How level-headed and mature were you at eighteen?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, I was living on my own and putting myself through school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a person, I sort of sucked,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor years, I was just horrible to Cooper. Every time he came around, I made it as painful as possible for him. As in, I took parts of him off. It wasn\u2019t enough for him to be run from his home. I didn\u2019t think he was hurting enough. And it helped that Eli was there, pouring poison in my ear. \u2018See,\u2019 he said, \u2018Cooper\u2019s fine. He\u2019s making a life for himself. He\u2019s not even sorry.\u2019 And then Mo came along. Cooper was the one who saved her from John Teague. Mo figured out what he was, and she didn\u2019t care. She loved him. I saw how happy she made him. And somehow that made it worse.</p><p>\u201cI figured, I was hurt, so he should hurt more, you know? Eli fed into it, and I didn\u2019t realize how deeply I\u2019d fallen. He pulled the strings, and I danced. He said all the right things in all the right ways. Turns out Eli was the one who brought Jonas\u2019s pack down on us in the first place. Sort of an \u2018I\u2019d rather serve at the right hand of the devil\u2019 thing. When that fell through, he settled for running the pack himself. But he didn\u2019t think Cooper had moved far enough away. He was afraid Cooper would get over his guilt and come back.\u201d</p><p>I explained Eli\u2019s reign of terror, the attacks, and how they drove Cooper away from home, family, and the woman he loved. But when Mo was pregnant with Eva, Eli realized that Cooper was never going to leave permanently, that people in the valley would always be waiting for him to come back. He snapped. He went after Mo. He figured Cooper wouldn\u2019t want to go on without her.</p><p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t gotten there in time . . . well, it was Mo. Given that she was swinging a wrench at Eli when we showed up, she might have had a chance,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s kind of a bad-ass under the apron,\u201d I said, smiling fondly. \u201cYou know, this might be the most words I\u2019ve ever strung together in my life. I don\u2019t think I like it much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do it more often. You say really interesting stuff,\u201d he said, taking our plates to the sink.</p><p>\u201cThis is the part where I tell you that your body will never be found.\u201d I walked across the living room and flopped onto the couch. \u201cWerewolves don\u2019t share their secrets with humans often. And if you screw me over, I\u2019ll have to kill you. Not ha-ha, \u2018joking around\u2019 kill you. It will mean the actual end of your having a pulse.\u201d</p><p>He blanched, as if during all of the information I\u2019d just dumped on him, he\u2019d forgotten that he wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to share it with anyone.</p><p>\u201cBut this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life!\u201d he shouted. \u201cProof of an intelligent species besides humans! Proof that the folk tales, the fairy stories, the things that go bump in the night, they could all be real! This is one of those moments that redefines how we see our history. It\u2019s electricity, the Rosetta Stone, and Darwin\u2019s theory all in one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of which made the men who discovered them incredibly famous,\u201d I noted dryly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you think\u2014I don\u2019t give a shit about being famous! Hell, I\u2019ve already got more money than I know what to do with. I just want people to know what\u2019s really out there, what\u2019s possible. That there\u2019s more to life than what we\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop and think. You\u2019re not the first human to know about us. Do you honestly think I would tell you this and just let you run to the nearest wacko tabloid? Do you think I would let you unveil the existence of my species on a whim? This is one of those sacred-trust sorts of things. We let you into our lives, and you keep our secrets . . . or we kill you. It\u2019s not a particularly friendly sacred trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why tell me in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo keep you from wandering around in the woods, getting yourself eaten by random apex predators.\u201d I sighed, scrubbing my hands over my face. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those guys who won\u2019t stop until they stumble right into the path of certain death. You want to know everything. Well, I\u2019m willing to share that with you, but you won\u2019t be able to tell anybody about it. You have to decide which is more important, knowing everything or knowing a little and being published . . . and then dying. I can\u2019t emphasize that last part enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2014I can\u2019t possibly decide something like that right now!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, you kind of have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have some time?\u201d</p><p>I considered. There was a possibility that he could use that time to run to said tabloid. But he didn\u2019t have photos or recordings, just some scribbled notes that made him sound like a crackpot. I nodded, edging toward the door. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it weird that after all the death threats, I still sort of want to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and leaned in anyway. Opening the back door, I pressed my hand against his chest and gave him a gentle shove back. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I happen to remember, now that I know I wasn\u2019t having a concussion dream, that we\u2019ve already done this. Several times. And a little more, now that it\u2019s coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled ruefully. \u201cI just can\u2019t. If you decide that you can live with the consequences of knowing about us, I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of cruel.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWelcome to the wacky world of werewolves.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Are Eyelash Curlers Banned by the Geneva Convention?</p><p>THE NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT, I climbed out of my mother\u2019s SUV, pulling uncomfortably at my skirt and cursing the day I was born with two X chromosomes.</p><p>Yes, I was wearing a skirt.</p><p>I\u2019d finally made time for another date with Clay, and it just happened to be the biggest social event of the season. Such as it was. Every year, Evie and Buzz hosted the Big Freeze at the Glacier, a sort of big last hootenanny before winter set in. The first heavy frost of year always came pretty early, in what most lower forty-eight residents would still consider fall. And although it would be weeks before the snows truly set in and made travel difficult, the people of Grundy put on their Sunday best and gathered for beer, dancing, and general merriment. For most of the people who lived on the fringes of town, it was the last chance to socialize before winter hit. I rarely went, since it was basically a way for unattached men and women of Grundy to find the person they planned on shacking up with during the cold months.</p><p>Normally, Evie scheduled the party right before the almanac forecast the first freeze. But this year, she and Mo had rescheduled at the last minute because some Food Network guy was coming by to film a segment about \u201cHidden Gems of the Northwest,\u201d and they wanted to hold the party before the crews arrived. Clay had been pretty understanding when I told him that our date was suddenly semiformal and that I would have to meet him there, since I was dropping my mom off at Cooper\u2019s so she could babysit. Which was just one more reason to like Clay.</p><p>Mom knocked on Cooper\u2019s door, because she didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat\u201d mother-in-law. I rolled my eyes and opened the door, despite her scolding. Cooper was standing in the living room, eager to hand the baby off before she could spit up on his good shirt.</p><p>\u201cHello, my sugar pie!\u201d Mom cooed at Eva, who was all pink and rosy and recently bathed. That would last all of five minutes. As Mom snuffled and nuzzled her pride and joy, Kara and Mo came out of the bedroom and screeched to a halt. They were staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, looking down at my sleeveless black knee-length sheath. \u201cYou said to dress up. I\u2019m wearing my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your designated funeral dress?\u201d Kara asked, adjusting the strap of her own low-cut royal-blue number.</p><p>I huffed out an annoyed breath. I caught my mother, my own flesh and blood, standing behind me, nodding.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetie, we only have an hour or so to make this work,\u201d Kara said, pulling at my elbow.</p><p>\u201cMake what work?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>Mo and Kara hooked their arms through mine and dragged me toward the bedroom. Mo wasn\u2019t playing fair. She knew I wouldn\u2019t do anything in front of Kara. She knew I couldn\u2019t just shake her off, phase, and run. Cooper came ambling out of the bedroom, looping his tie around his collar.</p><p>\u201cCooper! Help!\u201d</p><p>The coward turned on his heel and walked into the kitchen as if he hadn\u2019t seen me getting frogmarched by the estrogen squad. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t hear me! Seriously! Remember that time I hid a salmon in your truck and it stank for a month? Child\u2019s play! My revenge will be swift and terrible. Damn it, Cooper!\u201d I yelled as they dragged me into their den of girliness.</p><p>They threw me into a chair near Mo\u2019s bathroom and spread out torture devices on the bathroom counter. They glared down at me like supervillians trying to pry information out of James Bond.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got such beautiful skin,\u201d Kara said, lifting my chin and talking about my face as if I wasn\u2019t even in the room. \u201cNo sense in covering it up. We just need to play up the eyes, tame the brows, and gloss the lips. A good, strong blood-red, I think.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and muttered something about a quick hunt on the way to the dance, and Mo gave me the stink-eye. Without warning, they pounced. My dress was whipped over my head, and my hair was pulled out of its ponytail. The next half-hour was a haze of stuff rubbed on my face, my hair yanked, and my body pushed and pulled at as if it wasn\u2019t even mine. I was tweezed. A lot.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do much about the painfully sensible shoes,\u201d Mo muttered as she safety-pinned the sides of my dress to give it a \u201csilhouette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too cold out for sexy shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. The one thing I miss about home is being able to wear peep-toes year-round,\u201d Kara griped, giving my hair a gentle yank to remind me to keep my head up. She was arranging my hair into some weird cinnamon-bun shape on top of my head. I only hoped I wouldn\u2019t walk out of there looking like Princess Leia . . . then again, Nick might dig that.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t care what Nick liked, I reminded myself. Clay was my date. Nick was the guy who was currently considering whether he could be a silent witness to my family\u2019s wolfy weirdness.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard from the good doctor in a few days, and given the fact that the valley hadn\u2019t been overrun with teams of commando scientists, I took that to mean that he was still considering my proposal. I\u2019d had twinges of panic that first day after the \u201cbig reveal,\u201d wondering if I\u2019d made a huge mistake in trusting him. But the silence of the last few days had been a sort of balm. Surely, the first twenty-four hours after hearing something like that were the hardest to keep it a secret. But I couldn\u2019t go looking for him to ask him what he decided. Every time I did that, I ended up naked in some way.</p><p>This might be harder than I thought. I frowned.</p><p>Kara stepped back to look at her handiwork. \u201cShe looks like a grumpy ballerina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little too . . .\u201d Mo took out the pins and shook my hair out, slicking it back with some citrusy goo. \u201cThat\u2019s better. More tousle, less froufrou. She needs a smoky eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds painful,\u201d I said, and was ignored. I shied away when Kara came at me with what looked like a cross between pliers and a speculum. \u201cWhat the hell is that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an eyelash curler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to curl my eyelashes when that thing rips them all out?\u201d I demanded, jerking my head away when she moved toward me with the sinister-looking device.</p><p>\u201cHold still, and it won\u2019t hurt,\u201d she said, clamping it down on my lashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOwowowow!\u201d I yelled, my eye watering as she pulled the lid away from my eyeball and crimped the hairs. \u201cYou\u2019re a damned liar, Kara Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty is pain, babe,\u201d Mo advised me. I snaked my hand around Kara and took a swipe at my sister-in-law. Since she could freaking move, she just danced out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWell, just focus on your breathing, and you should be fine,\u201d Kara said wryly as she went for the other eye.</p> <p>\u201cYou stay away from me, you psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk around with one set curled. It looks weird,\u201d Mo protested.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t make that much of a difference,\u201d I shot back. Mo rolled her eyes and thrust a hand mirror in front of my face. \u201cOh, I guess it does.\u201d</p><p>Since the lift and curve of my newly pressed eyelashes really did make them look bigger, I dutifully sat still while they put three shades of gray eye shadow on my eyelids, followed by eyeliner . . . then they wiped the whole thing off and started from scratch because it was \u201ctoo much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that called?\u201d I asked as Mo painted a bright, bold red across my lips.</p> <p>She checked the little label on the end of the lip-gloss tube. \u201cCabaret.\u201d I frowned, so Mo added, \u201cAs in, \u2018life is a\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you wonder why we don\u2019t always understand each other, it\u2019s because of jokes like that,\u201d I told her. Mo huffed and slicked my lips with gloss.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t allowed to see a mirror. Kara kept muttering under her breath about killer cheekbones and \u201clucky bitch who doesn\u2019t even appreciate her teeny-tiny pores.\u201d Finally, they stood staring at me, trying to figure out what to do next.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could. . .\u201d Kara trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s perfect,\u201d Mo said, stopping Kara\u2019s hand as she reached toward me with the powder brush. \u201cDoing anything else would make her overdone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hate her,\u201d Kara said. Mo shrugged.</p> <p>They turned me around to face the mirror.</p><p>I was me but different. My hair looked as if I actually planned for it to fall around my face in dark waves, instead of all messy and wind-blown. My eyelashes felt all stiff and goopy, but they looked damn good. The cinched-up dress showed off the few curves I had, and the satiny red scarf Mo had tied around my dress made my waist look tiny. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like me. But seeing this hotter, femme incarnation of myself was very cool.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You guys spend an hour scrubbing and polishing your faces, putting on three layers of makeup, and fiddling with your hair so you can like me after I take most of the makeup off ?\u201d I asked, grinning at them.</p><p>\u201cYep, definitely hate her,\u201d Kara decided.</p><p>Mom gasped and scrambled for a camera when I emerged from Barbieville, USA.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, hush, you\u2019re gorgeous. And it\u2019s not like you went to your senior prom. Give me a chance to fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t go to my senior prom!\u201d</p> <p>Mom snapped picture after picture, from every angle conceivable. Only Eva\u2019s spitting up in my mother\u2019s hair persuaded her to stop. I mentally doubled the amount I\u2019d budgeted for Eva\u2019s first Christmas present.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s just a party. There\u2019s no reason to make a big deal out of it,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s just another Friday night at the Glacier.\u201d</p><p>AND I THOUGHT so, right until we got to the edge of town and I lost my nerve. I wasn\u2019t about to change for some stupid guy. Even if he was hot and available and a werewolf, I didn\u2019t want Clay to think he had that kind of power over me. Screw this; the minute Mo was in the door, I was going to phase and run home.</p><p>Eyeing the way I was gripping the truck door, Mo warned, \u201cYou do that, and I\u2019m telling Samson you were too chicken-shit to go to a silly dance.\u201d</p><p>I grunted, growling at her and shoving a couple of warm, cheesy mini-quiches into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I muttered as Cooper parked his truck in front of the Glacier. \u201cI hate the both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me, too?\u201d Kara asked.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so touched.\u201d Kara sighed, with her hand over her heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, hate me while you\u2019re carrying in that tray of mini-egg rolls, OK?\u201d Mo asked, handing me one of a dozen carefully wrapped parcels of appetizers for the party. \u201cBut eventually, you will agree that you look hot and I am right, I have always been right, and I always will be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best not to argue with her when she\u2019s like this,\u201d Kara told me. \u201cShe literally remembers every single occasion she was right. She still brags about warning me against fluffy bangs in tenth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you went ahead and did it anyway,\u201d Mo snickered. \u201cAnd now, who hides her sophomore yearbook like it\u2019s homemade porn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you ten bucks to see the yearbook,\u201d I offered Mo.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Mo said, grinning. Kara scowled at us both. And it struck me that, other than the facial torture devices and hair shellac, hanging out with girls wasn\u2019t that different from hanging out with the boys. They didn\u2019t care if I cursed at them. We called each other names and threatened each other regularly. That was pretty much my top three activities with my male packmates. I wasn\u2019t ready to let them paint my toenails, but maybe I wouldn\u2019t respond quite so rudely the next time Mo asked me over for a movie night or something.</p><p>As we came through the door, goodies in hand, Alan sidled up to Kara and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart, who\u2019s that with you\u2014\u201d Alan started as I took off my coat and turned toward him. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d he exclaimed. The room got quiet as everyone turned to see what had made straight-arrow Alan curse. I heard glass crashing to the floor and looked to see Buzz holding a dishrag in one hand and a shocked expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I muttered to Alan.</p><p>Clay looked very nice, if not uncomfortable, in a crisp white shirt and red tie. He\u2019d obviously taken time to get his sandy hair in some order. Clay and Cooper eyed each other and gave each other a distant but not unfriendly nod, which I thought was pretty normal for brother-date interactions. At least, Cooper didn\u2019t start cleaning a firearm in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay,\u201d I said, waiting for some comment as he eyed me from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWanna get a beer?\u201d he asked, having to shout a little now that the band Evie and Buzz had brought in from Dearly had started a bad rendition of \u201cLooking for Love in All the Wrong Places.\u201d People were moving toward the dance floor in twos, doing dance steps I knew I was in no way qualified to execute.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, a little taken aback that he hadn\u2019t even mentioned that I wasn\u2019t wearing jeans and flannel. Was he setting me up for some sort of joke? \u201cSo, uh, you don\u2019t have anything to say, something smart-assy about my dress or the stuff on my eyelids?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou always look this good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like you,\u201d I said, smiling at him as he put his arm around me and walked me to the bar.</p><p>Across the room, Nick was talking to Alan, Kara, and Darby Carmichael, a checker at Hannigan\u2019s Grocery. Darby was a tall brunette with a heart-shaped face and big caramel-brown eyes. I\u2019d never really paid much attention to her before, but now, given the way her fingers were curling around Nick\u2019s arm, I sort of hated her. With the fiery passion of a thousand suns.</p><p>Nick saw me with Clay and frowned. He looked down at his beer, and I could see his hand flex around the bottle.</p><p>Ha, right back at you, Doc.</p><p>\u201cWanna get a table?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ll grab the beers.\u201d</p><p>Clay grinned and waved at Mo as he claimed one of the booths near the pool tables.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, what are you doing?\u201d Mo asked, smiling around the question and waving back at Clay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with Clay.\u201d</p><p>The line of her mouth did this weird pretzel thing, which was pretty funny. \u201cI thought you were going to meet Nick here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Cooper mentioned that you two were getting close. Or \u2018got pretty close to something.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. He flushed beet-red and started to mumble about concussions. I love him, but I don\u2019t always understand him,\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWell, he neglected to mention the part where I told Nick that us getting close was a hallucination brought on by head injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did leave that part out,\u201d Mo said, chewing on her lip. \u201cThis is why we need to spend more time together. I need unfiltered information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry your makeover efforts for Nick were in vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, that wasn\u2019t for Nick. We\u2019ve been itching to do that for a while. It had to be done, for the good of mankind,\u201d Mo told me. I frowned. Mo made a gesture toward her upper lip. \u201cMustaches are for porn stars and Tom Selleck, not young ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you very much, Mo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kiss my daughter with that mouth. I\u2019m afraid of what she\u2019ll pick up.\u201d</p><p>I made a sour face at her as I sauntered back toward the table. As I was walking past the restroom corridor, there was a yank on my arms. I was rather proud that I didn\u2019t spill a drop of beer as Nick pulled me into the little hallway.</p><p>\u201cHands! Hands!\u201d I exclaimed, shrugging out of the hold he had on my arms. He held up his hands in a defensive position but didn\u2019t step away. He kept his voice low, quiet, as he murmured, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know how else to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about \u2018Hey, Maggie, how about we have a conversation that doesn\u2019t involve lurking near a men\u2019s room?\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cThat probably would have been better,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo, I wanted to tell you, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know how to respond to that.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m willing to give up the possibility of ever telling anyone about your family, if you let me study your pack. I want to know everything there is to know about you. It would be worth it, just to have my questions answered. I give you my word, it would be for my own personal enlightenment. I will never tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>The intensity of his voice, the close proximity of his mouth to my ear, sent a shiver down my spine. I cleared my throat, backing away as much as the wall would allow.</p><p>He continued, \u201cWe don\u2019t even have to tell your family what I\u2019m doing. In fact, their behavior would probably be more natural if they didn\u2019t know why I was there. You can always tell them we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell them that, because they know that I\u2019m already dating Clay.\u201d</p><p>The confident nonchalance he\u2019d been using melted away, and he seemed honestly bewildered for a moment. \u201cYou were serious about that? I thought you were just trying to put me off at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to put you off at the clinic with information that\u2019s true. We\u2019ve been out a few times,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, a member of the pack. And that\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I looked down the corridor to make sure none of the other guests was within earshot. But given the head-splitting volume at which the band was playing, it wouldn\u2019t matter if they were. \u201cFewer and fewer of us are mating with werewolves. We\u2019re basically breeding ourselves out of existence. There are more dead-liners\u2014that\u2019s what we call our relatives who can\u2019t phase\u2014living in the village than pack members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Nick muttered, patting his pockets for his little notebook. He settled his glasses on his nose and found a pen. He took a deep breath and smiled at me. \u201cExplain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, wolves mate for life,\u201d I said in a low, soft voice. \u201cWerewolf mates are claimed with a bite, which is sort of ceremonial, or through flat-out impregnation. Our genetic material is what you might call obsessive. Once our bloodline mixes with someone, something in our bodies just won\u2019t let us make babies with anyone else. It\u2019s a one-mate-only opportunity. It\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a lot of remarried widows of childbearing age in packs. Their new husbands won\u2019t be able to have children of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re all virgins when you get married?\u201d</p><p>I waffled my hand back and forth. \u201cMost are, but there are exceptions. We can have sex with someone and not be mated to them . . . but since werewolves, particularly the females, are hyperfertile, having sex means you\u2019re probably going to end up pregnant either way. So most of us don\u2019t risk knocking up a random one-night stand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you about this.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cPurely scientific interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cSubject is uncooperative,\u201d he murmured, scribbling.</p> <p>\u201cSubject can\u2019t believe you\u2019re taking notes about my virginity,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cSo, what does any of this have to do with you dating Clay instead of taller, smarter, more charming candidates?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWhen I get around to having kids, I need to pass the wolf genes forward. And for a good shot at that, I need to mate with a werewolf. Our pack is dying out. Werewolves everywhere are dying out. We\u2019re an endangered species. I can\u2019t risk being with somebody unless I know for sure that I can produce a werewolf with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said there are dead-liners who come from two wolf parents, right? So, there\u2019s no guarantee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to at least try. I have a responsibility to my people, Nick. How could I live with myself ten years from now, fifty years from now, when there aren\u2019t any more wolves born to my pack? If I let this go anywhere, if I let myself get involved with you, and we couldn\u2019t produce a wolf, it\u2019s not like I can try again with someone else. I can\u2019t take it back, you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, frankly, I don\u2019t see why that would be so bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause if I do, what kind of example am I setting? I\u2019d be telling my people that duty and responsibility take a backseat to being happy? That putting yourself first is more important than the long term? I\u2019ve got people counting on me, Nick. Look, I like you, a lot. I like spending time with you. But if we\u2019re going to keep seeing each other, it can only be as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He took the beer bottle I was throttling out of my hands. I think he was afraid I would chuck it at him. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Maggie. If you don\u2019t want me, fine. But don\u2019t go blaming some breeding obligation for you running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning scared,\u201d Nick challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me except what I\u2019ve told you. And I\u2019ve told you more than I should. You can at least pay me back by not calling it \u2018bullshit.\u2019 I thought they taught you better at all those fancy schools, cultural sensitivity and all that crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling your beliefs \u2018bullshit,\u2019 I\u2019m calling your hiding behind them so you don\u2019t have to deal with me \u2018bullshit.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to stay here and listen to this,\u201d I spat, snatching the beer from him. \u201cI told you what you wanted to know. Now, either stand by your word, or go straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me move aside so you can run away.\u201d With a mocking little bow, he stepped aside and cleared a path to the barroom.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d I spat as I brushed by him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn brat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! I guess that will make it easier for you to get over this lame little crush on me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re on to a great start on this \u2018friends\u2019 thing, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He grunted as I stomped away. He caught my arm and ignored my protests as I tried to free myself, practically dragging him along with me. He turned me toward him, my nose nearly colliding with his chest. His free hand floated just over my shoulder, as if he knew that touching me would send me over the edge toward decking him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered, his mouth hovering close to my ear. I shivered but played it as a squirm to get away from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not handling this very gracefully. I want you, Maggie. But if he\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m not going to stand in the way.\u201d I shoved past him, but he caught my arm again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You said you wouldn\u2019t stand in the way. This is standing in the way and dragging me around like a rag doll, you jackass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, I was bluffing!\u201d Nick exclaimed. \u201cAnd you called me on it, so good for you.\u201d He grabbed my arms and shoved me against the door. His body pressed against mine, and the weight felt so good. Instead of pushing his shoulders away, as I intended to, I found my fingers wrapped around his collar, pulling him closer. His hand snaked around to the small of my back and bunched the fabric of my dress, until I could feel his fingers brushing against my ass.</p><p>His mouth was hovering so close to mine I could feel his breath fanning over my lips, and I instinctually flicked the tip of my tongue over them. He moved closer, and just before his whiskers brushed over my hypersensitive skin, I pressed the flat of my palms against his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He rested his chin against my temple and whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s no good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you,\u201d I said, stepping sideways, away from him. \u201cBesides, aren\u2019t you on the verge of being engaged to Little Miss Express Lane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarby\u2019s a nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Clay is a nice guy. You just don\u2019t like him because you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wish I had a forehead that proves our genetic link to Cro-Magnon man.\u201d I glared at him. He sighed. \u201cOK, fine, that was petty. And I am jealous. What am I supposed to do? He\u2019s a likable guy, and he can do the one thing I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind his glasses without the aid of the state police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the delicate charm that calls me like a siren\u2019s song,\u201d he said, his lips twitching into a smile.</p><p>I murmured, \u201cThis is it, Nick. We can be friends, or we\u2019ll have nothing. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making this easy for me.\u201d</p><p>I huffed out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it means that I can spend time with you, I\u2019ll call myself your friend. I\u2019m not going to stop hoping for more. But I\u2019m going to wait for you to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d I said, to myself as much as to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, wriggling his golden-blond eyebrows at me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and turned away, leading Nick out of the hallway.</p><p>Unfortunately, Clay had gone to the bar to look for his wandering date and was talking to Darby. I tried to plaster a pleasant expression on my face as I slid into the empty space on his left. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d crawled out the bathroom window to escape,\u201d he said, taking the beer and bussing my cheek. He stopped for a moment, inhaling. He shot a suspicious look at Nick, who had sidled up behind Darby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a \u2018cause a distraction with a bar fight, then sneak away through the back\u2019 sort of girl,\u201d I teased, watching Nick warily as he put his hand at the small of Darby\u2019s back. Without warning, I had the irrational desire for the power to make her spontaneously combust with my mind.</p><p>\u201cClay, have you met Nick Thatcher?\u201d For now, I was omitting Nick\u2019s job description. It would get around to the pack eventually, but it might help if the pack got to know him and trust him beforehand. Still, Clay\u2019s smile was sharp, and not all that friendly, as he reached forward to take Nick\u2019s hand. I guess he picked up on more than just my scent on Nick. I sighed and took a step farther away from both of them. Darby and I watched as the boys seemed to be competing over who could squeeze more circulation out of the other\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t awkward,\u201d Darby muttered. Despite myself, I shared a commiserating little grimace with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Maggie, by the way. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever really met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarby,\u201d she said, shaking my hand in a way that didn\u2019t leave me wincing, like the boys were doing now.</p><p>\u201cDarby works full-time at the supermarket,\u201d Nick told me. \u201cShe just got promoted to assistant manager.\u201d</p><p>I threaded my arm through Clay\u2019s and smiled affably. \u201cClay is a mechanic. We keep him pretty busy around the village, but there\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t fix. It\u2019s taken a load off of Samson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarby\u2019s studying for her master\u2019s degree online, in social work. She wants to help kids like herself who grew up in the foster-care system,\u201d Nick shot back, his tone a little bit more aggressive than proud.</p><p>\u201cClay is helping his sister raise her two children while they care for an ailing elderly aunt,\u201d I retorted as Clay began to look distinctly uncomfortable under my \u201cpraise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarby takes in retired rescue dogs. She\u2019s adopted two German shepherds through a state shelter program,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Damn it. That did make me like her a little more.</p><p>\u201cOK, I think it\u2019s time to get out of firing range,\u201d Clay said, pulling me toward the dance floor. \u201cDarby, it was nice to meet your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She snickered and waved as Nick glowered at us.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was that?\u201d Clay asked, spinning me around and slipping his hand to my waist. He stared over my shoulder to where Nick and Darby were chatting companionably. I gritted my teeth and stepped back, so Clay would have to turn me away from them. \u201cWere you two dating or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s a friend,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cA friend who is a giant pain in my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want I should get rid of him?\u201d he asked in his best New Jersey accent. \u201cWe could make it look like an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said when I first met him!\u201d I exclaimed as Clay snickered and pulled me closer. My head tilted up, and my forehead brushed the line of his jaw. Seriously, when did God stop giving men jaws like that? I muttered, \u201cBut I guess cold-blooded murder is wrong and all that junk.\u201d</p><p>Clay\u2019s eyes flickered with some emotion I didn\u2019t quite understand. His smile faltered. And it was as if some invisible mask had been pulled away from his face. He caught himself, it seemed, and lifted the corners of his mouth again. \u201cWell, if you need help burying the body, I\u2019m handy with a shovel.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s talk about something more interesting,\u201d he said, sliding his fingers along the bare skin of my shoulders, leaving a little trail of sparks in his wake. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you must have read a book on how to charm lady wolves,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a proud man,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were Cliffs Notes involved.\u201d</p><p>God help me, I actually giggled as he swayed me around the floor. The rest of the night was like that. Clay made me feel comfortable, more comfortable than I think I\u2019d ever been with a guy. He kept me talking so much I hardly noticed we were dancing. He was light on his feet and managed to step out of the way if I was on my way to stepping on his toes. He didn\u2019t even break his stride when I tried to lead a time or two, just went with the flow.</p><p>I know he noticed when I tried to subtly brush my nose along his collar, but he was too polite to say anything. He smelled like citrus and sage. And I pulled him a little closer, so I could hold that pleasant, distracting scent in my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It surprised me when I looked up and realized we were among only a few stragglers left at the party. Everyone but Mo, Cooper, Evie, Buzz, and Nick had headed home. Nick was standing at the bar, drinking a beer, and trying very hard to make it look as if he was talking to Cooper and not watching us. Cooper wasn\u2019t making any pretenses. He was watching Clay like a hawk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s later than I thought,\u201d I said, laughing and suddenly realizing that my feet were killing me.</p><p>\u201cI could give you a ride back home,\u201d Clay offered. On hearing this, Nick and Cooper both stood and not so subtly moved closer to us.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate it, but I rode with my mom. And she\u2019s at Cooper\u2019s watching the baby. I need to drive her back tonight. But I\u2019ll walk you to your truck,\u201d I said, frowning at Cooper as we passed on our way to the door.</p><p>I slipped into my coat but slipped out of my too-tight shoes, grateful for the soothing, biting cold of the pavement as I walked outside with him. This was the part of the night that I was sort of dreading. So far, Clay had been sort of perfect. And if he was a dud in the kissing department, I was going to be right back to fantasizing about blue eyes and dusky Viking lips. I couldn\u2019t have that.</p><p>\u201cThanks for putting up with all this,\u201d I said, jerking my head toward the disheveled bar and what I\u2019m sure was my brother\u2019s face pressed against the picture window like one of those suction-cup Garfield dolls. \u201cI know I sort of put you through the wringer.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It was kind of nice to see you out of your element. I had a good time with you tonight, Maggie,\u201d he said, leaning toward me so I had the choice to close the remaining space.</p><p>I took a little nerve-bolstering breath and kissed him, nipping at his bottom lip with my teeth. He moaned a little and worked his fingers into my hair, pulling me closer. He tasted like whiskey and cinnamon. It was nice, warm, and sweet and stoked a pleasant little fire in my belly. It wasn\u2019t fireworks and snowflakes, but it was a cozy burn. He leaned back, keeping his arms laced around my waist.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, smiling and tilting his head, \u201cI was thinking we might go to Burney to see a movie this week? It\u2019s a drive, but there\u2019s a new action movie opening up. Bomb squads and terrorists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how much I love bomb squads and terrorists,\u201d I said with a little laugh. \u201cHow could a girl resist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I throw an extra-large bag of Twizzlers into the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d I told him. \u201cTwizzlers are fifth- or sixth-date material. You have to start out slowly, with Goobers or Sour Patch Kids.\u201d</p><p>Clay chuckled. \u201cI thought presenting a girl with Goobers was tantamount to a proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess movie candy is governed differently in Canada. Your country\u2019s all peculiar,\u201d I said as he climbed into his truck.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, I know, funny bacon, inability to pronounce all the \u2018o\u2019 sounds.\u201d</p><p>I waved as he started the truck and pulled away. I was still sort of smiling as I came back through the saloon door. And my sister-in-law was making her \u201ctrying not to comment\u201d face. She was trying hard to cover it up, fussing with Tupperware containers of leftovers and wiping down the already-clean bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked Cooper.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d he said, watching her bustle back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m still working on the whole \u2018my sister\u2019s a grown-up, and it\u2019s normal for her to date\u2019 thing. Why do you think I\u2019m still drinking?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to be clear, I don\u2019t like either one of them. It\u2019s in the guy code. \u2018Thou shalt despise any man who wants to nail your sister.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coping well,\u201d I noted.</p><p>His lips twitched as he raised the beer bottle to his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m seething on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>I placed a hand over Mo\u2019s as she swept by with a damp rag. \u201cWhat is going on, Mo? What\u2019s got you all OCD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d she said, wincing a little.</p><p>I looked around. Nick had disappeared like Wet Wipes on a porn set. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left,\u201d she said hesitantly, which was a weird look for Little Miss Resolute Face. \u201cWhile you were outside. With Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I realized that meant he probably saw me kissing Clay, all snuggly against the side of Clay\u2019s truck. My stomach felt sort of ripply and cold. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep him from leaving. I was afraid he would interrupt whatever you had going out there with Clay, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to keep him away from the door. I thought throwing myself at him and dragging him back inside would send an upsetting mixed message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I would be upset by that,\u201d Cooper dead-panned. \u201cThe only person I want you throwing yourself at is me.\u201d Mo smiled at him in that gross, lovey-dovey, cartoon-eyes way that didn\u2019t exactly help my icky stomach.</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cLook, it\u2019s no big deal. Nick and I, we\u2019re trying to be friends. He knew I was here with a date. It\u2019s not like I got all wound up when he was dancing with Saint Darby, the Animal Rescue Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re OK with this?\u201d Mo asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you called her Saint Darby, the Animal Rescue Princess,\u201d Mo said. \u201cIt expresses a certain amount of latent hostility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to shrink my head, hippie spawn,\u201d I snapped at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019re expressing direct hostility,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is more your speed, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Moonflower,\u201d I shot back, using the super-secret, never-to-be-spoken-in-public legal name bestowed on her by her hippie parents.</p><p>\u201cThat was too far,\u201d she growled. \u201cSee if I ever help you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted as she stormed toward the coat rack. \u201cIf you consider pulling my eyelashes out by the root help, you can keep it!\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>I Need to Find New Places to Hide Pepper Spray</p><p>I HUFFED OUT A BREATH through my muzzle as my paws hit the ground. I turned to see that Clay had cleared the fallen fir tree right after me.</p><p>He gave me a triumphant little wolfy grin and leaped ahead of me. I barked and chased, falling into step with him. Clay had insisted on taking me running after another grueling pack meeting, and I couldn\u2019t help but be grateful that he knew exactly what I needed. The pack structure had been somewhat unsettled over the past week.</p><p>Somehow, my abandoning Lee in the middle of a patrol to chase after Nick\u2019s scent was some sort of final straw for Uncle Frank. He went from quietly grumbling about how I wasn\u2019t doing what he would do in this situation to straight-out questioning my ability to lead. Frank told the uncles that maybe he voted for the wrong alpha candidate. Maybe having a woman for an alpha wasn\u2019t such a good idea. Maybe they should consider my first year on the job a \u201cprobationary period,\u201d during which I was failing miserably. After all, there had been attempts on my life and destruction of pack property in my first few months on the job. It had taken Cooper years to get into that much trouble.</p><p>Still, I\u2019d stayed true to my word and let Nick study the valley. We started out with short visits, introducing him to my aunts as a cultural anthropologist studying communities in remote rural areas. It raised a few eyebrows, but with Cooper\u2019s endorsement and my own, Nick was soon charming his way into kitchens. He was stuffed with cookies and roast hare, while he asked innocuous questions about how the ladies of the pack spent their days. What were their favorite recipes? How often did they get to visit friends outside the valley? How did they meet their husbands? He never mentioned werewolves or packs or mates, but I gathered that he was picking up information about our other nature, here and there. He could see things that the average human couldn\u2019t, just because he was open to it.</p><p>Nick had this engaging way about him when he was interviewing that kept people talking. He asked questions, kept a funny running commentary. It was subtle without being sneaky or manipulative. Hell, he found out things about my relatives that even I didn\u2019t know. For instance, I had no idea my uncle Louis once ran away to Canada to try to join a carnival . . . although when I thought about it, it made a certain amount of sense.</p><p>I found myself accompanying Nick on these visits, telling myself that I was just keeping an eye on the outsider and learning more about my own pack history. But more than anything, I just wanted to watch him work.</p><p>Of course, Nick\u2019s presence in the valley was another bone for Uncle Frank to pick. I was playing too fast and loose with the pack\u2019s secret, he said. I was wasting time that should be spent looking for a mate. I thought about storming into his toolshed and giving him the verbal ass-whipping of a lifetime, maybe in front of a few of the uncles if I could manage it. But then I realized that probably wouldn\u2019t serve much purpose, other than making Frank madder and ramping up his screwball campaign to undermine my authority.</p><p>Instead, I took a page from my mother\u2019s book. When we were kids, Mom didn\u2019t punish us often. If she had, I would have been grounded from birth to, well, pretty much now. But when she did lower the hammer, the dread of waiting while she considered our \u201csentence\u201d was almost worse than the punishment. So, I asked one of the kids to drop by Uncle Frank\u2019s on their way to school and ask him to come by my office around noon, giving him a good, solid, four-hour window in which to soil himself.</p><p>Uncle Frank had built up a healthy reserve of bluster when he came through my office door that afternoon. But I could smell the sweat on his palms and hear the little hitch in his pulse. I didn\u2019t bother looking up from the ledgers I was scribbling until he was standing right in front of my recently replaced desk, like a kid being called to the principal\u2019s office.</p><p>I finally leaned back and gave him a thin smile, gesturing for him to sit down.</p><p>\u201cUncle Frank,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m told you have some concerns about how I\u2019m running the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I have \u2018concerns.\u2019 I have a heap of concerns. It\u2019s like the whole family\u2019s gone loco. First, your brother runs off and marries God knows who. You let him live a full hour\u2019s run away from the valley. Now you\u2019re letting some human waltz around the valley like he\u2019s one of us, asking questions he doesn\u2019t have any business asking, while you make calf eyes with Billie\u2019s nephew. And let\u2019s not even talk about what a bad alpha candidate he is. You keep tarting around like you are, and we\u2019re ripe for another takeover. Other packs will perceive us as weak. Bad enough that we have a female alpha, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you not to finish that sentence. Know your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my place,\u201d he shot back. \u201cI\u2019m your elder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your alpha.\u201d I gave him a hard stare, which he returned . . . for about a second.</p><p>He snorted dismissively and shifted his eyes down, a reluctant act of submission. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t acting like any alpha I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re running around with these no-accounts when my nephew is just waiting for Cooper to finish negotiating for your paw. Lee is a leader. He can make this pack strong again. Our alpha is being attacked on our own territory, for pity\u2019s sake. We need his pack\u2019s protection if we\u2019re going to survive. It\u2019s the only choice that makes sense. And if you weren\u2019t so pigheaded and prideful, you\u2019d agree to mate with him. We don\u2019t know anything about this Clay or his pack. Hell, we already know Billie\u2019s gene pool carries some crazy. Why take the risk of passing it along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, Uncle Frank,\u201d I growled. \u201cBillie\u2019s pack. Just like you and me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frank snorted again. \u201cMaybe she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs,\u201d I said. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m alpha, I decide who\u2019s pack and who\u2019s not, something you need to keep in mind. I\u2019m going to say this once. Whoever I date, whoever I mate with, is none of your business. And you will not sit around gossiping about my love life like some little old woman. I don\u2019t care if you have a dozen nephews you think would be a good match for me. Keep your opinions to yourself. All of your opinions.\u201d</p><p>He shot up, placing both hands on my desk in an attempt to loom over me. \u201cAnd if I said I don\u2019t want to live in a pack where my opinion\u2019s not welcome?\u201d</p><p>I did my best to look bored, picking up my pen and scribbling a note on my ledger. \u201cI would remind you that you\u2019re free to leave the pack anytime. And if you push me much farther, I\u2019ll give you an extra nudge out the door.\u201d</p> <p>A boot up the ass could be considered a \u201cnudge,\u201d right?</p><p>He stood, his nose in the air. \u201cI know where I\u2019m not wanted. I\u2019ll just go stay with Lee\u2019s pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be for the best.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, Uncle Frank had enough sense to act as if it was his idea to move. He wanted to save face, so he told everybody how much better life was over in Lee\u2019s pack. Better housing, better hunting, more wolves. He made it sound like some swanky werewolf retirement resort, but I don\u2019t think many of my relatives bought it.</p><p>And after a nearly appropriate cushion of time passed, we could laugh about Uncle Frank\u2019s defection. I happened to pass by as Pops and Uncle Jay were playing checkers at the community center one afternoon and heard Jay say, \u201cFrank\u2019s mouth has been writing checks his butt couldn\u2019t cash for years. Glad somebody finally called him on it. If I had to hear one more story about his idiot nephew, I was going to bite him myself.\u201d</p> <p>A bit later, someone hung a bottomless \u201csuggestion box\u201d in my office, situated so the suggestion slip would fall through the slot, right into a wastebasket. Such was life in the pack. If something good happened, we were smart-asses. If something bad happened, we were smart-asses. If we weren\u2019t all that emotionally healthy, at least we were consistent.</p><p>Behind me, Clay caught the scent of rabbit on the trail. He yipped to let me know he was going to chase it north. I barked back, wishing him luck. Heading in the opposite direction, I ducked under the brush, venturing to the very edge of the valley\u2019s boundaries.</p><p>I sat at the end of the crescent, watching the wind play over the fir trees, like an annoying uncle\u2019s hand ruffling the valley\u2019s hair. I phased, eager to feel the weak rays of sunshine on my bare human skin. The breeze had a bite to it, although it wasn\u2019t cold enough to make a werewolf shiver. We tend to be a bit impervious to the cold.</p><p>It was so blessedly quiet up there, more peace than I\u2019d enjoyed in weeks. Sometimes I forgot what my life was like before potholes and cranky seniors took up all of my time. The days when I could run whenever and wherever I wanted. If I wanted, I could sleep until three in the afternoon, and nobody would blink an eye. I loved my pack. And I was happy that I could provide some stability after so many years of turmoil. But every once in a while, I missed my downtime.</p><p>I closed my eyes, inhaling the scent of pine and smoke curling from the pack\u2019s chimneys. And slithering under the current of the breeze, I smelled the floral, obnoxiously clean scent of fabric softener.</p><p>Someone was there. And I was naked.</p> <p>Hearing the softest of footfalls behind me, I turned. But the dark shape was on me before I could see. A black nylon bag was wrapped around my head and knotted behind my neck as I kicked and struggled. The smell of fabric softener was overwhelming, clogging my nostrils with the burning chemical scent of false flowers. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I tried to focus on the man behind me. I stomped on his bare foot, making him grunt. I could feel jeans rubbing against my bare legs, but he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt. He stretched at least a foot taller than me, pressing me against his solid body as he dragged me back from the rock outcropping.</p><p>The guy\u2019s hand was pressed over my mouth, through the material, and the other hand wandered to my chest. His fingers skittered greedily across my breast, pinching the nipple. I bit down on his hand, hard. He yowled, wrenching his hand away. I bucked my head back. I hoped to catch his face, but I guess I just hit his collarbone. The impact against his chest loosened his arms. I slung an elbow back, catching his face this time, cracking the bridge of his nose. \u201cOof!\u201d He huffed out a harsh breath and dropped me.</p><p>\u201cFucker!\u201d I shouted, my voice muffled by the material as I kicked out toward the noise. I think I must have clipped his knee, because his weight shifted toward the ground. I tugged at the bag, but he\u2019d managed a pretty decent knot at the base of my neck, and the material was too slick to get a grip on. Struggling and ripping at it would only disorient me and possibly send me stumbling off the rock face. I stayed still, listening for any noise that could tell me where he was. But I heard nothing. He knew what I was doing, tracking him, and he was staying as still as the stone under our feet. Why? Why not just push me off ? Why\u2014</p><p>Oh, screw this. I phased, but my neck was actually thicker in wolf form. With the bag knotted so tight, I couldn\u2019t wriggle out of it, no matter how I scraped my head against the ground. Plus, the material was so tight at my throat I could barely breathe. I\u2019d pass out after a few minutes, and the last thing I needed was to be unconscious around this dirtbag. Growling in frustration, I phased back to human. From nowhere, a fist slammed into the side of my face. I was knocked to my knees but swung wide at my eye level. I\u2019m guessing I nailed the guy right in the crotch, given the way he yelled.</p><p>Gently tugging at the bag to loosen the knot, I nudged my foot left, feeling sharply ridged pebbles prickling at my skin. I kicked them soundly, listening as they tumbling over the edge into the air. I kicked some right and then behind me, and each time, I heard the same descending noise. The cliff face was behind me. I advanced forward and was rewarded with another punch to the eye. His breath hot and moist against the skin of my shoulders, he wrapped his arms around my waist and dragged me away from the cliff. I didn\u2019t struggle; no use in throwing him off balance and over the edge.</p><p>When his body relaxed, I assumed we were safely away from the cliff. I pushed my feet from the ground, throwing my weight back against him. He stumbled and fell. I threw my elbow hard into his ribs. His hands wrapped around my neck, twisting the material, tightening it. I kicked wildly, catching his knees and not much else. I coughed, my head pounding as the bag constricted around my throat.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d He froze, the tension in his hands bleeding away as the voice echoed across the trees. I gasped, drawing huge lungfuls of air through the material.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, where are you?\u201d</p> <p>Without warning, the weight of my attacker\u2019s body disappeared. There was a beat of silence, the hiss of a zipper, and then a growl.</p><p>He\u2019d phased. I could hear his footfalls as he ran away on four paws.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d It was Nick\u2019s voice, getting closer. I sat up, my fingers plucking frantically at the knotted hood. It loosened, but I couldn\u2019t get it untied. I tore at it now, desperate to breathe clean, unscented oxygen.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, what happened?\u201d</p><p>With a few quick pulls, the hood was untied and yanked from my head. I blinked, blinded by the light as I sucked in air. Nick\u2019s hands were on my face, his eyes wild with worry. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been crying until he swiped his thumbs across my wet cheeks. Exhaling a ragged breath, he brushed kisses along my brow, my cheekbones, my eyelids. My hands clutched at his jacket, pulling him to me as I tucked my face into his neck.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not hurt,\u201d he demanded, stroking my tangled hair. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re OK.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I was afraid to speak, afraid my voice would crack and I would start sobbing like a little girl. He held me in his lap, close against his chest. I decided to overlook this blatant violation of the \u201cjust friends\u201d agreement and laid my head there, listening to his heartbeat and waiting for my own to slow. I needed him, much more than I cared to admit. I needed Nick Thatcher, fancy degrees, geek obsessions, and all.</p><p>This was a problem.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Who did this to you?\u201d he asked, his voice softer now. \u201cI thought I saw a wolf running away, a big gray one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was running. Clay took off north, after a rabbit. I was just sitting there, and the next thing I know, there\u2019s a bag over my head and some guy\u2019s feeling me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling you up?\u201d His eyebrows rose, and I saw cold fury seep into those blue eyes. For the first time, I was a little afraid of what he could be capable of. He was just smart enough to murder someone and get away with it. I pressed a hand to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cJust enough to piss me off and get bitten for his troubles. Then I pissed him off, fighting back, and he was trying to strangle me with what looks like a cheap garment bag,\u201d I said, tossing the overscented bag aside, next to a discarded pair of torn, muddied jeans. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted to hurt me seriously. Otherwise, he would have just tossed me off the cliff. I think he wanted to . . . take me? Or maybe just scare me. He kept trying to choke me, to drag me away. He only ran off when you yelled out for me. What are you doing up here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in town, trying to talk to your Pops\u2014who does not like me, by the way\u2014and I heard you\u2019d been up here with Clay since lunch. You were gone so long, I thought maybe someone should check on you.\u201d</p><p>I would have teased him about being worried, but it seemed cruel, given the way he was holding me\u2014as if I would break or float away at any moment. Instead, I eased away from him, putting an invisible wall of space between us. He recognized the gesture for what it was, and the tenderness leeched out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou said Clay ran north?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, about twenty minutes ago. He\u2019s probably miles away by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think he doubled back so he could wrap a bag over my head?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would that be such a crazy idea? You haven\u2019t known him for very long. He has mechanical experience and would probably know how to fix someone\u2019s brakes so they\u2019d fail at the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, Clay wasn\u2019t carrying jeans or a bag while we were running. And second, why would he want to hurt me? What would be his end game? Clay\u2019s a part of my pack. He and his sister are taking care of my aunt Billie. He\u2019s practically family. And besides, we\u2019re dating.\u201d I paused, shuddering. \u201cThat came out wrong. He\u2019s been living with us for the better part of a year. If he was going to try something, he\u2019s had dozens of opportunities to hurt me while we were alone. Movie dates, long runs, drives to Grundy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I get it,\u201d he snapped irritably. \u201cYou spend a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is, why wait so long to pull some clumsy, half-assed attempt? Besides, he wouldn\u2019t want to hurt me, unless he\u2019s some sort of date-\u2019emand-murder-\u2019em werewolf serial killer.\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned as if he were considering it as a theory.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t coming from a jealous place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s coming from a jealous place!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true. Look, just talk to someone you trust about what happened today. Tell your pack members and see whether they think Clay could have been involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll tell the pack I was caught off-guard and nearly choked to death by a strange werewolf. That will really inspire some confidence in my ability to lead. Uncle Frank was already calling for some sort of alpha recall. Do you really think I should tell them that I can\u2019t defend myself, much less them? For all we know, this guy could be some weirdo rogue male looking to claim a mate caveman-style. He\u2019s probably run off to look for the next pack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick clearly didn\u2019t follow this line of logic, which was unsurprising, since even I was having a hard time with it. \u201cOr he could come back and catch one of the other females by surprise. You\u2019ve got to tell somebody, Maggie. Cooper, Samson, somebody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pushed to my feet, trying to brazen my way through the fact that I was bare-ass naked. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this myself. And if anyone finds out, I\u2019ll know it was you who told them. And then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, no one will be able to find my body, yadda, yadda.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to come up with new threats,\u201d I muttered, picking up the jeans. Like the bag, it reeked of fabric softener. I could probably track him, but at the moment, I didn\u2019t feel quite strong enough to confront the guy who tried to choke me with cheap luggage. Plus, Nick would probably follow me, and that could get ugly. I grunted, tossing them off the cliff. \u201cIf he comes back, he\u2019s not going to be able to find his pants.\u201d Nick gave me a questioning look. I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s about the small victories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking back with you,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Clay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t give a shit about Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I sighed as he wrapped his jacket around my shoulders and we started back to the valley. \u201cSo Pops doesn\u2019t like you, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he does not,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI asked him if I could keep him company while he worked in the shop, and he shut the door in my face. Actually, he shut the door on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he likes everybody. Even Mo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently, he draws the line at humans who are \u2018sniffin\u2019 after\u2019 his granddaughter,\u201d Nick said, in a spot-on impersonation of Pops. \u201cHis exact words.\u201d</p><p>I laughed weakly. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the person who didn\u2019t have a door shut on her face.\u201d</p><p>11</p> <p>Karma Is One Organized Wench</p><p>I GOT MY FIRST GLIMPSE of Nick\u2019s spider-monkey powers about a week later, when I found him gallivanting through the freaking treetops without so much as a harness, clinging to the branches by the goodwill of gravity.</p><p>I thought I was imagining that flash of red jacket a good thirty feet off the ground from a distance, a sort of signal flare against the patches of white and green. Pops had told me that Nick and Samson were headed in this direction with a bunch of Nick\u2019s hightech gear earlier in the day. While he didn\u2019t seem thrilled to see Nick in the valley again, he seemed to approve of whatever Nick was planning to do . . . which he said I would have to see for myself.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to see much of Nick or Samson lately. I spent every spare minute patrolling the perimeters, since I couldn\u2019t explain why my packmates would suddenly need to step up patrols. I did ask Clay to join me most of the time, mostly to see if he would try to come after me while we were alone. He was fun and easy to talk to, and he did not, in fact, try to kill me. I like that in a man. And since he didn\u2019t try to murder me, I let him take me to that bomb-squad movie. A box of Sour Patch Kids and a few interesting pecks on the lips had the aunts scheduling a spring wedding for us.</p><p>Despite Nick hinting, nudging, and downright pleading, I\u2019d yet to tell anyone about the \u201cbagging\u201d incident. I occasionally woke up from nightmares, clawing at the nonexistent bag over my face, but I hadn\u2019t told anyone about that, either.</p><p>Instead, I was devoting a lot of energy to ensuring the pack\u2019s safety. I checked the brakes on every vehicle in the valley. Hell, I checked the village\u2019s cistern to make sure there was no tampering with the water supply. But nothing. Every once in a while, one of us would catch the scent of a strange wolf near the border of our territory but never close to any of the buildings. And I never caught another whiff of fabric softener outside the laundry room.</p><p>Every day that passed without incident put me more on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. And now I was waiting for my favorite paranormal investigator to drop.</p><p>I thought that surely someone with multiple graduate degrees would know not to put that much distance between himself and terra firma. Particularly when the wind chill was somewhere near \u201cguaranteed frostbite\u201d and the branches were slick with snow and ice. But as I drew closer, I found him propped against an alarmingly thin pine branch, wiring a black plastic box against an even less stable-looking branch at least three stories up. My idiot cousin was napping in a little burrow he\u2019d hollowed out in the snow at the tree\u2019s base.</p> <p>Nick had a black cannonball-shaped helmet on and weird metal cleats clamped over his boots. They seemed to be shoved into the bark of the tree, giving him a toehold. But the idea that a flimsy piece of metal was the only thing holding him up there was making my stomach pitch to my knees.</p><p>\u201cNicholas Thatcher, what in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing up there?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m almost done, Mags. I\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question!\u201d I yelled, finally waking Samson.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Samson mumbled.</p><p>\u201cSome spotter you are,\u201d I grumbled, kicking at Samson\u2019s shins. Samson made a halfhearted attempt at an obscene gesture and seemed to be considering continuing his nap.</p><p>\u201cLook out below!\u201d Nick yelled, depositing his tool belt near my feet. He yanked his cleats out of the bark and turned, facing the tree trunk. He dropped suddenly, and I let out a scream, before realizing that he was just hopping down to the next branch. He carefully and methodically chose each movement, mapping a route toward the ground. In my head, his descent was on fast-forward, and every branch looked as if it was ready to snap. Frankly, I was ready to snap.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Nick\u2019s cheeks were flushed pink with excitement and the cold wind. He looked so happy and sweet . . . and the moment his feet touched the ground, I smacked his shoulders until my hands hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell were you thinking, Nick Thatcher?\u201d I growled as he dodged my fists of fury. \u201cAre you trying to kill yourself ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m glad I have the helmet on.\u201d He grunted as he put his hand on my forehead and held me a safe swinging distance away. Samson snickered and scratched his belly, stretching his arms lazily over his head. \u201cMaggie, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal overreaction, Midget,\u201d Samson told me. \u201cI watched him like a hawk the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watched your eyelids the whole time,\u201d I shot back as Nick rifled through the duffel bag at the base of the tree. \u201cAnd you, I count on you to be the adult in this weird-ass buddy comedy, Nick! How could you trust your \u2018not dying in a plummet from a tree\u2019 to Samson? What were you even doing up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Nick said, clicking a little black remote that looked like a garage-door opener. A little red light on the remote switched on . . . and I was left considerably unimpressed. Then Nick brought out a little portable TV and showed me a video feed that focused on my mother\u2019s front door. He toggled a switch on the TV, and the screen showed the front of my office, then the school, the north perimeter, the east and south boundaries of the packlands.</p><p>\u201cThis one will show the western view of the valley,\u201d he said, pointing up at what I now realized was a security camera. He pulled out a map of the valley, with orange circles marking where he\u2019d placed the cameras. \u201cThey\u2019re on full power right now, but I\u2019m switching them over to thermal-sensor mode. They\u2019ll only pick up a feed when a warm body passes. So we don\u2019t end up with two hours\u2019 worth of windy tree-branch footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it was a tree branch that cut the brakes on your truck,\u201d Samson said, tenting his fingers and arching his brow at the wavering tree limbs supervil-lain-style.</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t cover the whole valley. And it might take a few weeks to work out all of the kinks, but I thought it could help, right?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I felt really bad about hitting him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone owes someone an apology,\u201d Samson sang under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. Nick beamed at me. \u201cThis is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hear Mom calling me!\u201d Samson announced, scrambling to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDid that seem sort of abrupt to you?\u201d Nick asked, staring after Samson as he ran toward home.</p><p>Without Samson there as a buffer, Nick suddenly seemed too close. What little emotional space I\u2019d been able to put between us had sort of been shredded by the whole naked-assault-victim vulnerability thing. I stepped away and took the portable monitor. \u201cSo, show me how to work this.\u201d</p><p>Nick was in full professor mode, taking fifteen minutes to explain how the little monitor could bounce among the various feeds and wirelessly upload clips to my office computer. I thought I was going to have to start fanning my face to keep from bursting into flames. Curse his sexy brains!</p><p>Using the toggle thing, he scanned past the signal coming from my mom\u2019s front door and did a cartoonish double-take. \u201cWhat the?\u201d</p><p>Nick squinted at the screen, aghast at the image of what appeared to be a dozen or so of my male cousins, lined up in front of my house with their pants around their ankles and their bare asses aimed directly at the camera. There were enough full moons to orbit Jupiter.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have shown Samson where the cameras are,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow did he organize that so quickly?\u201d Nick asked, nodding toward Samson\u2019s naked rear at the end of the butt-cheek chorus line.</p><p>\u201cWell, when properly motivated, Samson can do just about anything. We\u2019re fortunate that his main interests are food and pranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I can see grabbing one or two guys, but so many? He could take over the world,\u201d Nick marveled.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cAs long as the world\u2019s governments could be cowed into submission by a bottomless army, yes.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cWell, there\u2019s an image that will never leave my head. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I can.\u201d</p><p>FULL-BLOWN WINTER CLOSED in on the valley like a fist. The temperatures dive-bombed below freezing, putting us all in instinctual panic mode. And even though we spent the better part of the year preparing our houses, putting up food, winterizing our vehicles, I still ended up scrambling around, helping my aunt Doris patch a weak spot on her roof, helping Samson with last-minute runs to the bulk warehouse store in Burney for toilet paper and batteries. Clay and I took a day trip to a big pharmacy in Burney, where we could stock up on Billie\u2019s meds. When the snow blew in and covered the valley in a fluffy white blanket and I finally had a chance to stop and breathe, I sort of collapsed and slept for two days.</p><p>Weeks passed, the holidays came and went, and even with the relative quiet, I was scared to relax into the season, to give myself downtime. I used pack morale as an excuse. Werewolves tend to get sort of restless when we\u2019re boxed in. Little disagreements over a poker game or the last buffalo wing can turn into full-on duels to the death if you\u2019re not careful. So, I spent a good portion of my day sending my family members on random errands, finding some weird chores that needed to be done, or sending them on extra patrols around the perimeter. I organized checkers tournaments, darning bees, Scrabble nights. I basically became the pack\u2019s cruise director.</p><p>The pathways between Grundy and the valley were kept warm. Mom worried too much for Mo to drive the baby from Grundy, so she phased every few days so she could run over and visit Eva. Neither snow nor sleet nor an act of God would keep my mother from snuggling that fuzzy-headed baby.</p><p>Eva seemed to be on some sort of mission to work her evil/cute baby magic on me. Ever since she\u2019d started toddling around on those chubby little legs, she\u2019d been targeting me, the least enthusiastic baby person in the room. I think she enjoyed the challenge, which proved that we were related. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eva would tug on my pants leg until I picked her up. And then she\u2019d basically stare me down with those big blue-gray eyes of hers, daring me not to snuggle her. It was like facing down a tiny, diapered mastermind.</p><p>And of course, I caved. I snuggled her. I babbled. I read her Where the Wild Things Are until I was hoarse. I actually found myself watching my language. Shudder.</p><p>Every once in a while, I\u2019d bury my face in the talcum-powder-scented fluff on her head and have a little \u201cmaybe I am ready for a baby\u201d twinge. And then I would slap myself. Because my smart-ass karma combined with my genes might create some sort of evil superbaby. I just wasn\u2019t ready. Imagine baby-proofing for that.</p> <p>Being around Nick so much wasn\u2019t exactly helping my hormone surges. He\u2019d bought a snowmobile, so he could visit every other day. He\u2019d stopped the interviews, but he still liked hanging out with Samson and Pops, whom he was determined to win over. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing with his research, but Nick told me he was working on something that wouldn\u2019t result in me kicking his ass, so I was happy.</p><p>Mom was already a fan, but he met some resistance from some very unfriendly uncles. But I think that was more traditional \u201cwe don\u2019t want you sullying our little girl\u201d hazing than anything else. Clay usually made some excuse to get out of their card games, but I think that was mostly because of the \u201cI want your woman\u201d vibe Nick was still giving off.</p><p>Nick stayed in Samson\u2019s guest room most nights, which had me worried. Samson seemed to think of him as some sort of human chew toy. For instance, just the other night, I\u2019d come home to find Samson in my mother\u2019s living room, holding Nick upside-down in some half-nelson wrestling hold.</p><p>\u201cHey, Midget, Nick won\u2019t tell me whether he has sisters. I figure, he\u2019s pretty, he would have to have pretty sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick man, Samson,\u201d Nick said, his face reddened by the sudden flow of blood to his head.</p> <p>\u201cBut you laughed, so what does that make you?\u201d</p><p>Nick deadpanned, \u201cHumoring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamson, put him down!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s so light and portable,\u201d he said, jiggling a bemused Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wonder why we don\u2019t introduce humans to our pack\u2019s secrets, this is why,\u201d I told Nick.</p><p>Samson jostled Nick again to get his attention. \u201cOK, Dr. Werewolf Whisperer, you told me you could get out this. Now, the rules are: One, no punching me in the junk. And two, see rule one. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is not healthy.\u201d I sighed, shaking my head. \u201cEven for werewolves, this is messed up.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned at me, bent at his waist, and did some weird finger-strike thing against the back of Samson\u2019s kneecaps. Samson yowled and dropped to his knees, bringing Nick\u2019s head precariously close to the floor. Nick stopped short of cracking his skull by catching himself with his hands. He sprang to his feet and put Samson in a headlock.</p><p>I think Samson was more shocked than strong-armed.</p><p>\u201cNever fuck with a guy who worships at the altar of Vulcan martial arts,\u201d Nick told my cousin as he administered a merciless noogie.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you Vulcan-nerve-pinched him?\u201d I barely suppressed the grin that threatened to split my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Samson exclaimed, shaking Nick off like a troublesome Pomeranian. Nick was flung ass-over-teakettle onto the couch. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me how to do that sometime,\u201d Samson said before he wandered into the kitchen looking for food.</p><p>Nick hopped up from the couch. He was warm and slightly sweaty. I could feel the happy thrum of his heartbeat under his skin. I cleared my throat and stepped back from him before I did anything drastic. \u201cYou in one piece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun. I never had a big brother growing up. I always wanted to be hung upside-down by my ankles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI worry about you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cGuess who\u2019s been invited to guest-lecture at University of Alaska\u2019s Anchorage campus?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cMo?\u201d I suggested. \u201cThey have a great culinary department there.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMe. They\u2019ve asked me to lecture on shape-shifting creatures and their prevalence in northwestern American tribal culture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn academic terms, I\u2019m pretty sure that was supposed to get me all hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I want you to come with me. We can snowmobile as far as the highway and then drive in. We can go to a movie or some of the bookstores. There\u2019s a restaurant I wanted to try. I just think it would be sort of cool to get you all to myself for a little while.\u201d Then he added hastily, \u201cAs a friend. We can spend time together without things getting all naked and confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have we ever been able to spend time together without one of us getting naked or confused?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always hope, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>It sounded awesome. Seeing Nick in his element. Going somewhere where I wasn\u2019t known, so I could relax a little. Soft hotel sheets and a certain bespectacled hottie . . . enjoyed separately, of course. And I was on the verge of saying \u201cYes, yes, take me now, yes,\u201d when \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d came out of my mouth instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, but I can\u2019t leave right now. I know nothing has happened in a while, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK for the alpha to go waltzing off on what will be seen as a sexy weekend with someone who is not her boyfriend, when there are maddeningly vague threats on the horizon.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to say \u2018sexy weekend\u2019? I was going to be all noble and selfless and understanding until you said \u2018sexy weekend.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>I snickered at him.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. You have to take care of your responsibilities. I respect that. I just got excited about it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to go. I just wouldn\u2019t feel right about it,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe Samson would go with you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, sort of glum, and pushed my hair behind my ears. Samson yelled at him from the next room, threatening to kick his ass at Halo. \u201cBig Brother is waiting for you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I could get him to go after some kids from my high school?\u201d Nick asked as he led me to video-game Valhalla. \u201cI wasn\u2019t bullied, really, but I\u2019d just like to see the looks on some of the obnoxious jocks\u2019 faces when a ten-foot-tall werewolf came barreling at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some unresolved issues, don\u2019t you, Nick?\u201d</p><p>I tried not to mope in general, but the days leading up to Nick\u2019s departure were a little gloomy. Even Clay noticed that something was a little off with me, suggesting that we sneak away to try to find the parts to salvage my old truck. I agreed and tried to force myself into a brighter frame of mind. No one likes a sulky alpha wolf. I\u2019d chosen this job. I\u2019d campaigned for it. I wasn\u2019t going to get all whiny now that there were certain sacrifices involved, such as not getting to go on a road trip with my cute \u201cplatonic\u201d friend.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even the distance or losing a few days with Nick. I just hated the idea that I was going to miss something important to him. I mean, friends cared about that sort of thing, right?</p><p>I think I\u2019d scared him with my drive-time estimations, because he was leaving a few days before his lecture. The day before he was due to leave, I got a little anxious. What if he didn\u2019t come back? What if he got into an accident on the long drive? What if he met someone in Anchorage who didn\u2019t scoff at Doctor Who or occasionally leave him with bite wounds?</p><p>And so I was piling through the waist-deep snow on four paws.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called as I came through the kitchen door. I shrugged into an oversized flannel shirt he kept hanging by the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still packing!\u201d he called from his room. \u201cThere\u2019s sodas and sandwich stuff in the fridge. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d On my way past his kitchen table, my elbow caught on a stack of books and knocked them onto Nick\u2019s open laptop. I chuckled at his screensaver, a picture of evil bearded Kirk and Spock, smirking at each other. I bumped the keyboard as I was gathering them up, and a Word document popped up on the screen.</p><p>It was a title page for something called \u201cThe Werewolves of Crescent Valley.\u201d I arched an eyebrow and sat at the table with a thump. The document was more than a hundred pages long, and it wasn\u2019t just notes. Nick was writing a freaking book about us! There were pages and pages about our origins, our social structure, how the pack broke tradition by installing me as alpha.</p><p>Hurt, hot and acidic, burned through my chest. He\u2019d promised. He\u2019d promised me that he understood, that he couldn\u2019t tell anyone about us. And here he was writing a frigging book? Who had he shown this to? Did he plan to publish it? The whole damn thing was dedicated to me, by the way. \u201cTo Maggie, without whom this wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately for Nick, I read that just as he came through the kitchen door. And he was met by a very large book thrown at his head. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhat the?\u201d</p><p>He ducked and, with impressive speed, dodged several flying objects as he crossed the room and grabbed my arms.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you!\u201d I yelled, fighting my way out of his grasp and slapping his chest. \u201cWhat the hell were you planning on doing with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour book, you asshole! The freaking book that meant more to you than keeping your word to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014the only thing I\u2019m writing now is a history of your pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we not having the same conversation?\u201d I growled. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m writing that for your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a book together for Pops. I was going to bind it myself, so no one would even see it. I was hoping it would, you know, soften Pops toward me. And if he hated me a little less, you might stop fighting me so hard on the \u2018being crazy in love with you\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I huffed out a breath.</p><p>Nick\u2019s cheeks flushed. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about you. I\u2019ve barely been in contact with the outside world since I got up here. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can check my e-mail accounts, my phone records, anything you want. Your family, they were exactly what I was hoping for, Maggie. Yeah, you\u2019re the academic find of a lifetime. You could make my career, after I proved to the world that I wasn\u2019t nuts. But your family, for the most part, has been kinder to me than the people who raised me. I can\u2019t expose them. I can\u2019t put them in harm\u2019s way. You don\u2019t do that to people who have been good to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of measurable skills, as far as your grandfather\u2019s concerned. I figured this would be the one thing I could do for him that no one else could. I wanted to show him that I\u2019m serious about you. I wanted to show you how much I love you. And I do love you,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know whether you love me yet. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re human or a werewolf or a yeti, I love you.\u201d</p><p>The overwhelming rush of warmth and love through my chest nearly knocked me to my knees. That was it. I had this strange moment of crystal clarity in which I knew I loved him right back. Everything outside our circle of two was sort of blurry and inconsequential. I\u2019d never be happy without him. I\u2019d never want anyone else. My hands slipped up to his chest to steady myself as I spluttered, \u201cW-well, that\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his lapels and crushed my mouth to his. He hummed against my lips, slipping his hands into my hair and pulling me closer. I pushed him toward the bedroom door. He turned his head, seeing where I was heading, and raised his eyebrows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pushed the jacket back from his shoulders and untucked his shirt while he struggled with my buttons. I shrugged out of the shirt and tossed his belt over my shoulder, slipping my hand under his waistband. Nick lifted me and carried me to the bedroom, to his bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, cupping his hand around my jaw as he settled his weight over me. I quirked my eyebrows, peering down at the grip I had on his manly bits. He laughed. \u201cOK, then.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to be nervous. I didn\u2019t know how this would feel, but it couldn\u2019t be bad. Werewolves had very healthy attitudes toward sex. Hell, sex was one of the primary winter activities in the valley. Which was why we had so many babies every spring.</p> <p>Babies.</p><p>I arched off of him long enough to dangle off the bed and grab for his nightstand. Nick nibbled along the curve of my spine, biting at my hip as I rooted around for the long string of condoms I found there. I turned back to him, giving him a speculative look. He smiled sheepishly. \u201cI had high hopes.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and helped him ease out of his pants. He guided my hands as we slipped on the condom. I expected him to, well, get right to it. But he pushed me back onto the mattress, kissing down my bottom, hitting all of the places I loved best, the valley between my breasts, the hollow of my belly button. His fingers were already deep inside me, stretching and teasing me, while his thumb worked little circles around my clit. His lips closed around my nipple, flicking and teasing it with his tongue.</p><p>He rolled onto his back, pulling me with him. \u201cThis might hurt a little,\u201d he said, smiling up at me, concern reflecting back at me in those blue eyes. \u201cIt might be better if you were running things.\u201d</p><p>He helped me position him near my entrance, and I sank down over him, hissing as I stretched. It was more pressure than pain, a strange alien sensation that disturbed more than it hurt. I stayed still for a second, waiting for my body to adjust around him. I tried not to overthink, but damn, it was a lot of stuff to process. The stretching and pulling sensations deep inside. The way his hands wrapped around my waist. Nick looking up at me, his expression so happy, so adoring, that I couldn\u2019t help but smile at him. I moved just a little bit and gasped at the friction it produced.</p> <p>\u201cSlow,\u201d he whispered, kissing my neck. \u201cGo slow.\u201d</p><p>My first couple of movements were awkward as I searched for the right angle. He lifted my hips and thrust up gently, helping me find a rhythm. His hand slid up my neck, rubbing his thumb along my jaw. I leaned into his touch, and he pulled me down to kiss him. He nibbled along the line of my chin, my throat. He pressed his teeth against my collarbone and nipped a little harder.</p><p>I rose on my knees and slid down just a little harder, huffing out a little moan. I rose a little higher and did it again. I paused to absorb the strange, hot lightning sensation that shot through my stomach. That was nice. I pushed up with my feet, riding so high that Nick almost slipped out of me. He groaned in protest until I slammed my hips down on his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural.\u201d He sighed, sitting up and wrapping his arms around me as I rode him. He slid his hand between us and stroked my clit.</p><p>I giggled again until I felt my inner muscles tighten, clenching around him. I shrieked at the first pulse, clutching at his shoulders. Nick lay back, pulling me down and rolling over. He hitched my legs over his hips, pulling me up so my ass rested on his thighs. He gave one good, hard thrust, spreading me wide for him, and I yelled out. He was thrusting upward, hitting some wonderful place that made me want to squeeze my thighs together and lock him there. I tensed again, and the wave was longer, better. A rush of heat seemed to radiate up through my chest, making the blood roar in my ears. The pulses were coming quicker, more intense. Everything seemed to seize up at once, and I was screaming his name.</p><p>I must have yelled some other, dirtier stuff, because Nick answered with a yell of his own and was coming with me. He laid his head against my heart, panting against my skin and listening to its beat. I threaded my fingers through his hair and pulled him closer.</p> <p>I tried to find some tiny bit of regret inside myself but couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d chosen Nick. There was no going back now. I stroked my fingers along his cheek. \u201cThis might hurt a little,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He blinked dreamily at me. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and prayed that I was making the right choice. I sank my teeth into his shoulder as gently as possible, just breaking the skin. He yelped but gritted his teeth and took it like a man. I licked the wound and nuzzled his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have warned me?\u201d he asked, frowning down at the thin trail of blood dripping down his chest.</p><p>\u201cSorry. You would have tensed up. It would have hurt more,\u201d I told him, handing him a tissue. \u201cBut we\u2019re mated now. There\u2019s no escape for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot looking for one,\u201d he said, dabbing at the wound. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Physically, I was great. Relaxed and dandy. But I was a little worried. While I\u2019d refused any detailed descriptions during Mama\u2019s birds-andthe-beasts talk, the one thing I did ask was how she was sure she and Dad were mated. She said she \u201cjust knew,\u201d and when I gave her an irritated look, she added that she felt complete, whole, happy with her choice. But frankly, I\u2019d felt that way for a while, so how could I tell if there was a difference?</p><p>\u201cIs something supposed to happen?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I propped myself up on my elbow. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should bite me again?\u201d</p><p>I gently touched my fingertips to the edge of the wound on his neck, which was raw and red. \u201cI think I got you pretty good the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said, kissing me. \u201cPersonally, I am willing to do that over and over until we come to some conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that confidence again.\u201d</p><p>He climbed out of bed, muttering about finding his drawers, and I noticed the faint white scar on his butt.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>Nick was back on the bed in a flash. \u201cWhat? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI claimed my mate with a bite to the ass!\u201d I cried, pressing my face to the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ass. I bit it, months ago!\u201d I moaned as he pried my hands and the pillow off my face and made me look at him. \u201cAnd ever since then, I\u2019ve felt this weird protectiveness . . . and possessiveness toward you. And I\u2019ve been calmer, with the exception of the whole possible werewolf intruder thing. I\u2019ve been happy, content. I\u2019ve been mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d I exclaimed, gesturing at his matrimonially marked ass.</p><p>\u201cBut if that were true, if all it took was a bite, werewolves would find themselves accidentally mated to random people all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the bite, it\u2019s about the intention,\u201d I said. \u201cThe werewolf magic sort of does the rest.\u201d I thought back to the day I bit him. I\u2019d been angry because he thought I was Mo. I wanted to show him that I was the woman, the animal, he was looking for. And I was staking my claim, marking my territory. Permanently. My stupid instincts made my decision for me. I could have spared myself all that angst over Clay versus Nick. \u201cOh, this is bad . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so bad?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt just means we arrived at our destination a little early. I think it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can never tell Samson, do you understand? If he knows I accidentally claimed your glutes, I will never live it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, it will be OK. This is a good thing. You chose me. And I love you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. We can\u2019t tell Samson or Cooper or Mo. Or my mom.\u201d</p><p>His tone was exasperated as he kissed my forehead. \u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShutting up.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled my throat and traced the curves of my collarbone with his fingertips. \u201cSo, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . thanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything you might want to express to me in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are . . . awesome?\u201d I suggested. He leveled me with eyes that contained no amusement whatsoever. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve never said it before. OK, if feeling like your heart\u2019s been ripped through your chest, jammed back, and scrambled around means you\u2019re in love, it\u2019s possible that one day I could be in love with you. \u201c</p><p>He quirked his lips. \u201cWell, that was . . . descriptive, while still remaining vague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will say that I don\u2019t want to be without you. The idea of you leaving makes me want to throw up. When you\u2019re not around, I feel empty and nauseated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d he crowed. \u201cSo you admit it! I have a profound effect on your stomach . . . Speaking of which, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a terrible segue.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me pointedly. \u201cI was thinking, what if you went and found some werewolf who didn\u2019t gross you out entirely and you mated with him? You could have as many babies with him as you wanted. As long you came home to me every day, I think I could live with that.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him long and hard. \u201cJust the fact that you\u2019re willing even to consider that means I couldn\u2019t possibly go through with it. First of all, it wouldn\u2019t exactly be fair to the random werewolf I picked. He wouldn\u2019t be able to have babies with the female of his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could pick a gay werewolf who wouldn\u2019t want a female\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came up with this scenario pretty quickly,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a creative thinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I groaned, burying my face in my hands. I laughed and shook my head. \u201cOK, second, it wouldn\u2019t work anyway, because I chose you, I marked you. Remember? No substitutions, no take-backs. My body won\u2019t accept, uh, contributions from anyone else. You\u2019re my mate, for better, for worse. Human or werewolf. You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms around me. \u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019m going to ask you to marry me, sometime soon. I know this is sort of a good moment, what with the successful deflowering and biting and all. But I didn\u2019t want to do it when you were expecting it. And I didn\u2019t know whether you wanted an engagement ring or not. I didn\u2019t see any of the women in the pack wearing them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and was amazed at how easily I accepted the idea after a lifetime of sneering at happy married couples Then again, engagement is sort of a bump in the road, compared with lifelong bonding through a bite on the ass.</p><p>\u201cRings slip off too easily when we change,\u201d I told him. \u201cMost of us have our bands tattooed on our fingers. But if that\u2019s too much for you, some of the women accept necklaces as a sign of betrothal. The chain has to be sturdy and long enough to wrap around our necks in either form.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much on needles.\u201d I wiggled my eyebrows. \u201cI like stones with some color to them. Don\u2019t get me a door-knocker-sized diamond. Just a little stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d</p><p>I grinned up at him, pushing the blond strands of hair out of his eyes. \u201cBlue. I\u2019m awfully partial to blue.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Some Orphans Have All the Luck</p><p>I WOKE UP, THANKFUL TO be in my human form.</p><p>I was in Nick\u2019s bed, snuggled up on his blankets. I could smell him all over me, as if I\u2019d been rolling around on him all night. I smiled, stretching across the bed and its cozy, nestlike arrangement of pillows. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been more comfortable.</p><p>I sat up, propping myself on my elbows, listening for sounds of him moving around the house. Through the bedroom door, I felt a weird tension coming from the living room. I threw on one of his T-shirts and padded toward the sound of his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know exactly why not!\u201d Nick was in a shirt and tie, complete with a tweed jacket, pacing back and forth with the cell phone clutched against his face. He noticed me standing there and froze as the person on the other end of the line seemed to be whining at him. He gave me an embarrassed shake of the head and then shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t care if you end up \u2018evicted,\u2019 which we both know is code for \u2018dealer is going to beat me up.\u2019 I don\u2019t owe you a fucking dime. If we\u2019re going into debts, let\u2019s talk about the money Dad sent over and over to help you \u2018move home\u2019 that never seemed to get your ass on the bus. Or how about the shit you took from my apartment when you just had to sleep on my couch for a week? Trust me, I\u2019ve paid back whatever you spent on my miserable childhood twice over.\u201d</p><p>With my supersensitive hearing, I could hear the tenor of the caller\u2019s voice change from helpless sobs to a vicious stream of curses.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, go ahead and call the press. Tell your fake fucking sob story to whoever will listen. I don\u2019t give a shit. Hell, people will probably feel sorry for me. Game subscriptions will go up by the thousands.\u201d</p> <p>He clipped the phone shut and roared, tossing it across the room, where it bounced off a steer skull and landed on the counter with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it was a bad phone,\u201d I said, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cLook at it, lying there, all superior. The phone had it coming.\u201d</p><p>He swooped in on me, claiming my mouth with a ferocity that took my breath. \u201cYour family,\u201d he said, his hands trembling at my cheeks. \u201cDo you know how lucky you are to have that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes. Now, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d He sat down and sighed, his head slumping forward. I straddled his lap, pushing his hair out of his face. \u201cSame old song and dance. She\u2019s living in Nashville. When she\u2019s sober, she wants to be the next big country star. She\u2019s behind on her rent. She just needs a measly thousand to make it until the end of the month. Doesn\u2019t see why I\u2019m being so unreasonable and stingy when I have so much. She had to chase her dreams, and she did me a favor, leaving me with my dad. She couldn\u2019t help it if he turned out to be a drunk. And she did send me a birthday card that once. And she would hate to have to resort to selling her story of an impoverished mother of a gaming magnate to survive. To tell about how she bought me my first computer secondhand at a yard sale, sob sob. I don\u2019t even write the code for the damn game. But she doesn\u2019t realize that. She doesn\u2019t take enough of an interest in what I did, just how much money I made.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t fathom that. Until Eli\u2019s betrayal, I\u2019d never experienced family members turning on each other. It was a foreign concept to want to suck resources away from a pack member. Of course, in the pack, if you needed money, it was practically in your pocket before you could even ask. We took care of our own. And if some people tended to mooch more than others, we just accepted it as part of their personality and teased them about it.</p><p>I stroked my hand down his cheek. And he looked up at me with his baby blues, begging for some sort of acceptance, comfort. I kissed his forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. People like that, you can\u2019t make them go away by giving them what they want. They\u2019ll only come back for more,\u201d I told him. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t need her. You have a new family. We\u2019re not exactly normal, but once you\u2019re ours, you\u2019re ours for life.\u201d</p><p>I tipped my forehead so it was touching his. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said in a voice that had my heart breaking.</p><p>I covered it by stroking his arms, gently rotating my hips over his. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s very naughty of you to dress this way right before you leave town,\u201d I purred as his pulse quickened and his breath grew ragged. His hands slipped under my shirt and traced frantic little patterns on my back. \u201cYou did this on purpose to provoke me,\u201d I murmured against his mouth as I unzipped his pants, sliding my hand under his waistband and wrapping my fingers around his hard, hot length. \u201cThis is like the nerd version of answering the door in Saran Wrap.\u201d</p><p>He gently eased me back onto the couch, settling his weight over me as I pushed his jacket from his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to have a baby right away. And I\u2019m fine with that. I don\u2019t think we should stop using birth control anytime soon. But we can, say, lessen our chances by participating in activities that aren\u2019t as chancy but just as satisfying.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as he eased out of his jeans and kicked them off. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling that you have charts showing the fertilization risks of various sex acts hidden behind the couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying we should test a few theories,\u201d he said, rolling off the couch and settling in front of me on the floor, stroking his fingers along my instep.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, touching you with my hands doesn\u2019t count as sex, so there\u2019s no danger there,\u201d he said. He wiggled his eyebrows, ghosting his fingertips along my shoulder, up my chin, and over my lips. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count as sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going with Clinton\u2019s rules?\u201d I asked, just before catching his thumb with the edge of my blunt front teeth and biting down gently. He trailed his fingertips between my breasts, over my belly, and through the wisps of dark hair between my legs. He traced the outlines of my sex, dipping the very tip of his finger just inside me, barely brushing his thumb across my clit. My head thumped back against the table behind the couch as my hips shot up off the couch.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so mean,\u201d I moaned.</p> <p>Chuckling, he kissed across my hips, biting gently on the little bumps of my hipbones, before nibbling his way down my thighs, to my knees.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no danger in kissing you,\u201d he said, running his lips along the little bone in my ankle, brushing them lightly over my shin, tickling my knee with his beard. He grinned at me, balancing his chin on my kneecap. \u201cNo matter where I do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I arched my eyebrow skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d he insisted, kissing my kneecap again and pushing me back against the cushions. He spread my thighs, settling between them. He pressed soft, hot little kisses along the smooth skin, his beard leaving a little ticklish trail in its wake.</p><p>\u201cEven if I kissed you, say, here.\u201d He kissed the juncture of my leg and thigh, nibbling the sensitive skin that stretched as I held this weird yoga pose. \u201cTechnically, that\u2019s not sex.\u201d</p><p>His breath puffed hot and moist over me, and I bucked up toward his mouth. Seriously, he wasn\u2019t going to . . . yes, he was.</p><p>He smirked up at me and slid his tongue from the very lowest point to the top, dipping and twirling his tongue across my clit. My head dropped back, thwacking against the table behind the couch. I knew I should be seeing stars, but I didn\u2019t care. All that mattered were the shapes he was drawing against me with the tip of his tongue. As soon as I thought I found the pattern, I lost it to the spiraling pressure coiling in my belly like a snake.</p><p>I closed my eyes and melted into him. Hearing those words and feeling his teeth pinch lightly over my clit sent me reeling right over the edge into a dark tunnel of screaming, pulsing sensation. My eyelids snapped shut as I howled out my release and fell into soft, sweet oblivion.</p><p>I felt Nick slide up onto the couch and pull me against him. I pressed my face into his chest and hummed happily. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, that was dangerous. I think I\u2019ve gone blind. Which is too bad, because I was planning on reciprocating.\u201d Nick gently nudged my eyelids with his fingertips. I popped them open. \u201cOh, there we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a problem solver,\u201d he said as I kissed my way down his chest. I stopped, my ears perking at a soft noise outside. I cocked my head toward the door. \u201cHey, is your door unlock\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cooper stuck his head in through the front door and called, \u201cHey, Nick, you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped at the sight of me lying at eye level with Nick\u2019s navel, both of us buck naked. He clapped his hand over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d he exclaimed, stumbling into the door frame and smacking his head into the wall. \u201cSo sorry! I\u2019m just going to go . . . gouge out my eyes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot he was coming over,\u201d Nick groaned as Cooper turned a corner and continued whacking his forehead against the wall. \u201cYou were naked, and I lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole leaving early thing was sort of a smokescreen. I\u2019ve been talking to Cooper whenever I go into the saloon. He was worried about you not having a truck. And since I sort of played a role in its destruction, I wanted to help you replace it. We were going to go look at dealerships in Burney before I drove up to Anchorage. Surprise . . .\u201d he finished weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to buy me a truck, just like that?\u201d I asked, my heart doing that weird fluttering thing again. \u201cAnd you were wearing your professor duds to cover your trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wanted to look respectable at the dealership,\u201d Nick said, all defeated and puppylike. \u201cI was going to make it look like Cooper found some older model for a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d I rose on the balls of my feet and kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly sweet but unnecessary. I have money of my own saved up. It\u2019s not like I pay Mom rent or anything. And Clay thinks he might be able to save my old truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to be the one to break up this little love fest, but could you two go put on some clothes, please?\u201d Cooper demanded.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Nick threw me some sweats and a T-shirt.</p><p>Cooper finally uncovered his eyes. \u201cLook, I like you, Nick. I\u2019ve seen the way you are with my sister, and I approve. The love of my life is a human and an outsider . . . and an incredible smart-ass. So, who the hell am I to judge who Maggie chooses? And considering the fresh bite I see on your neck, I know you\u2019re mated and not doing anything wrong. But right now, I\u2019m trying to control my brotherly instincts to kill you . . . just give me a minute, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Nick said, wisely stepping away from my brother and bracing himself behind the breakfast bar.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, Mags, would you mind telling me why you\u2019re here at this hour? Without going into specifics, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick and I are putting on a puppet show, Coop,\u201d I responded dryly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lord, don\u2019t let that be a position I haven\u2019t heard of,\u201d Cooper said, shuddering.</p><p>13</p><p>Damn You, Milton Bradley</p><p>NICK HAD TO LEAVE for his lecture, though I managed to talk him out of the truck purchase so we could spend the extra day . . . um, talking. Cooper was happy to leave us alone before we could start another conversation.</p><p>And because my brother is basically a gossiping old woman, nobody was surprised when I returned to the valley and announced that Nick and I were mated. In fact, the aunties had already arranged a potluck supper in our honor when Nick returned a week later, which was a little embarrassing. Nothing says family closeness like a \u201cCongratulations on Doing It\u201d dinner.</p><p>I can\u2019t say every member of the pack was thrilled with my choice. An aunt or two sniffed at another Graham taking a chance with the family wolf genes. And a few of my cousins took bets on how long it would last before Nick\u2019s body turned up in a gulley somewhere, which was sort of mean.</p><p>Pops\u2019s contribution was to shake Nick\u2019s hand, level him with that inscrutable gaze, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough for her.\u201d</p><p>It was times like this that I wished I wasn\u2019t Pops\u2019s favorite granddaughter. But Nick, who was managing not to fold like a cheap card table under Pops\u2019s unrelenting grip, simply smiled and said, \u201cI know that, sir, but no one is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pops sniffed and sauntered toward the beer weenies. I gave Nick a wink to let him know he\u2019d handled that very well.</p><p>And at the end of the night, as much as it pained me, Nick went to sleep at Samson\u2019s house. Because as evolved and open as my family was, the idea of having sex under my mother\u2019s roof really creeped me out. It was bad enough having the first \u201cpost-game\u201d conversation with my mom. After I made the mating announcement, she took me aside and asked me if I \u201cwanted to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>I sprang up from my chair, suddenly very keen to know whether the top drawer of my filing cabinet was locked. \u201cGod, no!\u201d</p> <p>Mom seemed perplexed. \u201cI don\u2019t know why not. It\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. My first time with your father was fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I don\u2019t want to hear about your honeymoon hijinks, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, it wasn\u2019t on our wedding night. We took care of that a long time before we got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmygod!\u201d I howled. \u201cWhy would you tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were already mated. Your dad had claimed me. Why wait until the wedding when we wanted to have kids right away? Honey, what are you doing?\u201d she said as I rifled through my desk drawers.</p> <p>\u201cLooking for something to gouge out my eardrums.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious that Nick and I were going to have to make some sort of separate living arrangement soon. Obviously, I couldn\u2019t move too far away. There was no way we could stay at his place in Grundy. Sure, I\u2019d been relieved that despite my dire sense of foreboding, I came home to find nothing had happened while I was gone. Still, I needed to be among my packmates, to help with the everyday management of the valley. And it helped to have some semblance of authority in their midst. I\u2019d worked too hard for their respect and trust to walk away now.</p><p>But the idea of a separate address, where we could be alone at the end of the day, was definitely appealing. I mulled it over for a few days, trying to find a way to fit it into the conversation that wouldn\u2019t make me sound like a demanding potential wife. Mom saw this as some sort of sign of maturity, that I was actually taking his feelings into account.</p><p>The problem was that there were a limited number of houses in the valley, and all of them were occupied at the moment. Houses were passed through family lines, like everything else in the pack. And there hadn\u2019t been a new house built since the early 1980s. Then again, we didn\u2019t get a lot of new arrivals here in town. Alicia and Clay were the last people to move to the valley since my mother had arrived.</p><p>Speaking of Clay, he seemed to be spending less and less time in the valley. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was because of my choosing Nick or because the garage was keeping him that busy. When I realized how little consideration I\u2019d given him during the whole mate-choosing thing, I felt a pulse of guilt constrict my chest. Even if we weren\u2019t committed or exclusive, he deserved more than that. I kicked myself for not ending things with him before taking any sort of step with Nick. But sometimes life is messy and complicated, and you just don\u2019t have time to pencil things into your schedule, such as \u201cDump perfectly nice werewolf suitor before getting naked with human sweetie.\u201d Clay skipped the pack dinner, and he didn\u2019t seem to want to talk to me or Samson, and I couldn\u2019t blame him. And because I didn\u2019t want it to fester, I ended up cornering him down in the work shed one afternoon as he tinkered with a chain saw.</p><p>Overall, it might not have been my brightest idea.</p> <p>After I stepped into the shed, Clay gave me the silent treatment I so richly deserved for a few moments. But before long, his lips were twitching, and he gave me crooked little grin. \u201cSo . . . Nick, huh?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced and gave him a sheepish little smile. \u201cI should have talked to you about it first. It just sort of happened. If you want to kick my ass over it, I\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m disappointed. But sometimes the heart just wants what it wants, right? Who am I to get in the way of my alpha\u2019s true love?\u201d His voice was tight, but he covered by looking over the chain saw parts and selecting a few gears for cleaning.</p><p>I asked, \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>He tossed me a rag and some mineral oil. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>And that was pretty much it. We basically broke up without really hashing it out. And considering how guilty I felt without talking it to death, I can only imagine how bad a prolonged discussion would have made me feel. So, silence is a method I wholeheartedly endorse. It left things sort of unsettled, but Cousin Teresa suddenly seemed much happier.</p><p>To top the guilt sundae off, Clay\u2019s occasional absences meant that Alicia was more frazzled than usual, and Billie seemed to be getting worse. The doc had to prescribe stronger sedatives for her, as her once occasional \u201cepisodes\u201d were becoming an almost-daily event. The day I came home, Billie had wandered out onto Main Street in her housecoat, screaming that there was a \u201credheaded bitch\u201d trying to run her house.</p><p>While the high school kids got a kick out of the sweet, level-headed auntie who used to knit them Christmas stockings cursing like a sailor in the middle of the street, this latest bout made me wonder whether we needed to find a better situation for Billie. There was no such thing as a werewolf nursing home, but there must be some way to make her more comfortable.</p> <p>I was sitting on my front porch, mulling over calling Billie\u2019s great-nephew Matthew, the alpha of her home pack in Canada. I rarely spoke to Matthew, who was sort of hyper and always seemed to have some huge project going that inhibited his ability to return phone calls. And he still didn\u2019t know how to work his voice mail. It was sort of an ADHD werewolf\u2019s double whammy. He still hadn\u2019t responded to several messages I had left months before, thanking him for sending Clay and Alicia. But his pack was bigger than mine and located closer to urban areas. Maybe he had a suggestion (or twenty) on how to help his auntie.</p><p>I closed my eyes and tilted my head back against the sturdy pine rocking chair. It was late February, and the weather would be cold for another few months, but the sun was setting, and it was comfortable to sit outside for a while. I closed my eyes and lifted my face to the dying rays of sunlight, stretching and yawning.</p><p>Somehow, in the midst of all this, I was pretty damned content. Probably the happiest I had been in my short, surly life. I\u2019d claimed a mate. I felt the same need for Nick, for the comfort of his presence, than I did before. Nick and I were still working on the whole \u201cexploring\u201d issue. It helped that we were basically chaperoned by my entire family and couldn\u2019t get away with much. I think I was learning far more about what I liked than what Nick liked. Because it turns out guys like everything. Orgasms are like pizza or a Dolph Lundgren movie; even when they\u2019re not great, you still enjoy yourself.</p><p>I was perfecting my oral skills, although I think the whole \u201cmy girlfriend has wolf teeth\u201d thing made him a little nervous. And my man could play \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d guitar riffs with his tongue if he wanted to, so overall, we were both pretty happy.</p><p>Of course, given all that happiness, I really should have seen this next thing coming.</p><p>My ears perked up at the sound of shuffling footsteps moving toward me. My eyes snapped open, and I saw Samson stumbling toward the porch. He was naked, which meant he\u2019d just come in from a run. His expression was pinched, as if every step hurt him. He missed a step and stumbled onto the porch, clutching his side.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d he whispered, gripping his side.</p><p>I yawned again. \u201cHa ha, Samson, I\u2019m not falling for that again. It was a sick joke when you pretended to be chain-saw-massacred on Halloween, and it\u2019s a sick joke now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>\u201cSam . . . Sam?\u201d The wind changed directions, and the smell of his blood finally made it to my nostrils. \u201cMom!\u201d I yelled, scrambling next to him. My knees hit the boards with a thud. I rolled him over and found a quarter-sized hole just under his ribs. My hands were red and wet as the blood welled over the fingers pressing against his wound.</p><p>Mom came out onto the porch. She gasped, falling to her knees beside me.</p><p>\u201cCall Dr. Moder!\u201d I yelled. \u201cNow! Better yet, just run down the street to the clinic. Now, Mom, please!\u201d</p><p>I tore off my jacket and threw it over him. I pressed my shirt to his side to stanch the bleeding. There was so much of it, and the slick coppery smell was starting to turn my stomach. If the bullet hit something vital, something Dr. Moder couldn\u2019t handle, we were going to have to get him to a real hospital. There would be questions I couldn\u2019t answer, reports that wouldn\u2019t be safe for us to file. And what if we couldn\u2019t get him there in time? He\u2019d lost so much blood. How much more could he have?</p><p>\u201cSam, please hold on, OK? Just keep breathing. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods,\u201d Samson whispered. \u201cShot me. No smell.\u201d</p><p>I shushed him. \u201cOK, OK, just save your breath.\u201d</p><p>I kept watching the wound, hoping that the bullet would be pushed out by his natural healing ability. The wound was growing smaller, but the little lead round seemed lodged inside. I heard Mama\u2019s footsteps thumping up the street as she practically carried Dr. Moder to us. Sensing Mom\u2019s growing panic, the doctor told her to fetch a blanket and towels from inside the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d Dr. Moder asked, dropping her massive medical bag next to me as she kneeled down. She sounded a lot calmer than I felt. I guess she\u2019d seen a lot worse from us over the years. I just don\u2019t remember feeling this frantic when Cooper got his head stuck in a stair railing.</p><p>Up and down the street, I could hear doors opening, my family coming out of their houses to see what the ruckus was. For a second, I considered sending them into the woods to look for the shooter. But that could result in more werewolves with gunshot wounds. Or a hunter with wet pants.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know who was running with Samson today?\u201d I yelled. A few of my relatives shook their heads. \u201cEverybody go inside!\u201d I barked. \u201cDo a head count. Figure out who\u2019s not here. Don\u2019t come out until I come to you.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, doors snapped shut, although I could still see a few of my aunts silhouetted against their windows.</p><p>After slipping on a latex glove, Dr. Moder probed the wound with her fingertip while I cringed. She pulled out a huge bottle of hydrogen peroxide and poured it into the wound. She pulled out a plastic-wrapped scalpel and forceps.</p><p>\u201cI think the bullet probably missed his organs, but I need to open him up to make sure.\u201d</p><p>I made an embarrassing squeaking noise. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do this right here? On my front porch?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Moder\u2019s teeth were on edge as she said, \u201cThe bullet\u2019s pretty deep. If I wait any longer, to give him anesthesia or get him to a sterile room, the wound will heal over, and I\u2019ll have to open him up again to get it out. He stands less chance of infection and will heal faster if I get it now. Trust me, your cousin Wayne\u2019s been shot by enough grumpy locals that I would know. Just try not to breathe too much on him.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth, blowing a breath out through my nostrils. I handed her the scalpel, which she used to widen the wound, dipping the forceps past the bloody ring of tissue and rooting around.</p><p>OK, I could handle a lot, but this was pretty gross. I tried to think of it as a game of Operation. And the only consequence of Dr. Moder screwing up would be a buzzing sound and Samson\u2019s nose lighting up red.</p><p>Samson\u2019s hand twitched as Dr. Moder\u2019s instrument gripped the bullet. I threaded my fingers through his, willing the tears gathering at the corners of my eyes not to fall. How could this have happened? Other than my dad and Cousin Wayne, no one in the pack had been shot in years. We\u2019d learned to shy away from any signs of hunters.</p><p>At this point, I didn\u2019t care if it was just some dumb-ass tourist who wanted a scary trophy for his den. I wanted to rip him limb from limb. But Samson needed me here now. And I was doing well not to phase on the spot and start howling like a lunatic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Moder pulled the bullet free, and I blew out a breath. The little hole in his skin was closing, pink and healthy and shiny, as Dr. Moder poured more antiseptic over it. Samson groaned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him to the clinic,\u201d Dr. Moder said. \u201cMaybe call a few of the bigger cousins, \u2019cause it will take all of them to cart his heavy butt. And we\u2019re going to need anyone with his blood type to come down to the clinic and donate. He\u2019s lost a lot of blood. Come on, Maggie, let go of him and get moving.\u201d</p><p>I shot an incredulous look at her. She put a light hand on my shoulder and shook me gently. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, Mags. He\u2019s going to be fine. You can let go of his hand.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at our joined, stained hands, and gripped tighter.</p><p>Dr. Moder frowned. \u201cOr . . . maybe not.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT FEW hours were among the longest of my life. I did a head count and was ridiculously grateful to find everyone accounted for, except for Clay, who had stayed late at the garage where he worked. I questioned my relatives. I called Nick, who didn\u2019t understand my sudden need to check up on him while he was working from his place in Grundy. And even more confused when I told him to stay there until I came for him.</p><p>As I walked into the clinic, I felt as if I was moving through molasses. I felt helpless. I didn\u2019t know what to do. And I hated it. No wonder Cooper ran from the responsibilities of running the pack. This feeling sucked.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d I called softly. I poked my head into the sole treatment room at the clinic. Shirtless and swathed in gauze, Samson was propped against a pile of pillows, with a full gallon of Mom\u2019s chicken noodle soup and a full pan of Mo\u2019s triple chocolate brownies in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cI think you scared everybody pretty good,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d he said, chewing happily. \u201cThere\u2019s two more batches of brownies in the office. Mo was panic-baking. She and Cooper are going to stay the night. Cooper was, er, a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>Some small voice in the back of my head balked at the idea of having Cooper and his family here. He\u2019d brought them right into our mess. If there was still someone out there with their sights trained on the pack, Mo and the baby were in the crosshairs now. But of course, if I tried to send them away, Mo would just swing at me with some heavy piece of kitchen equipment. I made a mental note to search the clinic for tranquilizer darts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re OK,\u201d I told him, pinning his eyes with my own. I wanted him to understand that I was having a rare moment of absolute seriousness. And of course, he responded by grinning at me through the chocolate like a toddler.</p><p>\u201cThat said.\u201d I paused and then smacked the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking running alone? After I specifically told every member of the pack to use the buddy system,\u201d I demanded. \u201cNo one had any idea you were out or where you were. What if you hadn\u2019t made it back home? You could have bled out, in the woods, alone. Leaving behind the biggest fucking corpse the bears had ever seen. It took pints from me, Cooper, and Mom to get you up and going again. Pops tried to donate, and it took four of the uncles to keep him from sticking the needle in his own arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie\u2014\u201d Samson started, before I smacked him again. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest to prevent further smacking. \u201cSorry, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got restless,\u201d he admitted. \u201cClay is my running partner. And he said he couldn\u2019t make it out today because he was working late. Sometimes you just have to phase and go, you know? I was just running along the edge of the valley. I heard a weird popping noise, then another, and wham, I felt like I\u2019d been hit by a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was a hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a hunter probably would have collected my carcass as I lay bleeding on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. An accident, maybe?\u201d I suggested, knowing I was grasping at straws at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, oops, I took my high-powered rifle, looked through the scope, and happened to fire at the bear-sized wolf in my crosshairs?\u201d he suggested. \u201c\u2019And then I fired again, because I missed the first time?\u2019 \u201c</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a good theory,\u201d I snarled at him. \u201cForgive me for trying to grasp at any possibility besides members of my pack being picked off by an unseen but well-armed menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Midget, I will admit, there is a pattern of shit that\u2019s happened in the last few months. Your truck brakes. Your office. Strange wolves sniffing around the borders. Hunters getting all trigger-happy . . . though who could blame them for wanting such a fine trophy as yours truly. But there\u2019s no reason to circle the wagons and get all paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you call me a hysterical female, I am not above pulling the plug,\u201d I deadpanned, reminding myself that it was a good thing Samson didn\u2019t know about the bag incident.</p><p>He yawned. \u201cWe\u2019ll just do what we always do. We\u2019ll keep an eye out. We\u2019ll keep the youngsters close to home. No one goes out alone, using my little incident as a painful example. But until some rogue werewolf trots down Main Street and declares war, I say we relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your solution to everything.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAnd so far, it\u2019s worked out great for me. Up until getting shot.\u201d</p><p>There was a light knock at the door. Alicia stuck her head in and gave me a sheepish little smile. I glanced from her to Samson, who was staring at her with a completely smitten, stupid expression, and back again.</p><p>My lips twitched, but I maintained my neutral face.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d I said, hopping up from the bed. \u201cDid you hear from Clay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019ll be home as soon as he can,\u201d she said, her gaze never leaving Samson. \u201cYour mom came over to watch the boys and Billie. She knew I wanted to stop by and bring this, uh, Jell-O.\u201d She put a very full Tupperware container on the little roll-away table.</p><p>I eased toward the door. \u201cYeah, she knows how much Samson loves Jell-O.\u201d</p><p>Truth be told, Samson hated Jell-O. He said food should only twitch if it\u2019s recently deceased. And maybe covered in barbecue sauce. But he really liked Alicia, that much was clear.</p><p>I wandered out of the clinic, pondering this new development. Alicia was a good match for Samson. I mean, she was used to wrangling dangerous preschoolers. Although Alicia\u2019s previous mating meant that Samson would never have children of his own, he was good with Paul and Ronnie, who seemed to view him as sort of a man-sized jungle gym. And he would get all of the benefits of having sons without the cranky pregnant wife, two A.M. feedings, and diapers.</p><p>I jogged to my office, sat at my desk, and fired up my computer. When he installed the cameras around the valley, Nick had hooked a wireless transmitter into my modem to record anything the cameras picked up to my hard drive. I\u2019d expected the activity to escalate after the incident on the cliff. But so far, we\u2019d mostly gotten footage of elk prancing around the tree line as if they owned the place. But when I opened up the video cache folder on my desktop for that night\u2019s feed, I found . . . nothing.</p><p>There was a clip of a young bear cub wandering on the southern ridge the day before, which I\u2019d found on my daily check of the folder. That was it.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d expected. A clip of some Elmer Fudd lookalike waving at the camera and showing ID?</p><p>I sat back in my office chair, chewing up my lip. My mom was probably wondering where I was. And Nick had already texted me five times, demanding a less cryptic phone call. I couldn\u2019t seem to bring myself to face either of them.</p><p>I sprang up from the chair. What if the cameras weren\u2019t working? Some of the units on the south side of the valley hadn\u2019t deposited a video in the cache folder. It couldn\u2019t hurt to go check, right? It was something to do, and I was itching for something to do that didn\u2019t involve talking or emotions.</p><p>I dashed out of my office and jogged up the slope behind the clinic, shrugging out of my jacket and boots. My feet slipped through the patches of tough dead grass, the edges of each blade pricking my ankles. I closed my eyes and breathed deep, searching for a trace of Samson\u2019s blood on the breeze. My face naturally inclined north, to one of Samson\u2019s favorite napping spots in the valley. A patch of dirt he\u2019d dug out on the north lip of the crescent. Nothing. I faced south and caught the faintest scent of rust. I followed it on human feet, silent and swift, my braid bouncing against my back as the scent grew stronger. There was a trail there, worn through the trees by generations of paws.</p><p>I skidded to a stop when I recognized the shiny black patch of blood on the ground. Samson\u2019s paw-prints hadn\u2019t gone any farther, as if he\u2019d come running along and stopped suddenly before he was hit. Had he heard a noise? I couldn\u2019t smell any sign of a human or a wolf nearby. I looked up at the bare, imposing limbs overhead. There was nowhere to hide. And there was no camera in sight. Was that blind luck on the shooter\u2019s part? Or did he know where the cameras were?</p><p>Samson would have seen a human standing close. The shot must have come from a distance, which could have meant a skewed shot from the game preserve. But there were so many trees. What was the probability of a hunter shooting wild and then the bullet making it all the way through the forest without hitting anything but Samson? I\u2019d say it ranged from no freaking way to none. This was the work of our fabric-softener-loving friend.</p><p>I sat on the ground and considered the possibilities. And then I realized that I was just a few yards from the spot where I\u2019d claimed Nick with that ill-conceived bite. He\u2019d been sitting a short distance from where Samson had been shot.</p><p>There was a crushing tightness in my chest, leaving me unable to draw in air. I could see Nick in my head, sitting alone on that ridge, scribbling in his little notebook. The wind was playing with his gold hair, and he was pausing every few minutes to shove his glasses back up on his nose. Suddenly, there was the loud crack of a rifle shot, and Nick slumped to the ground, a patch of red blooming on the chest pocket of his shirt. The notebook fluttered out of his hand as blood trickled over his lips. He was unable to move, unable to call for help, unable to do anything but stay there and die. Because of me, because he was too close to me.</p><p>Unlike Samson, my mate would not be capable of transforming into a giant wolf and defending himself. I would spend the rest of my life worrying about Nick. I mean, the man had wandered into the path of rogue werewolves and been involved in a serious motor-vehicle incident just since meeting me. I would worry about him getting sick, getting shot, getting caught in the crossfire of whatever weird pattern of phenomena was circling around the valley. Mo had barely survived her ordeal, and that was with just one crazed werewolf after her. What if a whole pack came after us?</p><p>As long as Nick was close to me, he\u2019d be in some form of danger.</p><p>I thought I could regulate that paranoia. I thought I could handle the constant anxiety. Hell, when I found out that my brother had abandoned Mo in an effort to protect her, I tracked him down, called him a lot of anatomically detailed names, and threatened to rip his head off. But now, the idea of Nick loving me somehow getting him killed had me throwing up in a mossy bank near the tree line. This was definitely a case of \u201cit\u2019s different because it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait and think this through. I had to stop it now. I had to get Nick to leave now. If I let it go on any longer, it would hurt that much worse. Sure, I was basically kissing my life good-bye. No babies. No Nick. No sex. But at least he would be alive. I stumbled toward the woods, toward Grundy, not bothering to tear off my clothes so I could transform. I burst into my wolf state, leaving a trail of scraps in my wake. I ran faster than my four paws had ever carried me, following Nick\u2019s scent across the miles that protected him from my crazy-ass life. I found him on his couch, typing on his laptop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grinned at me as I came through the door, and I felt as if I was going to throw up again. He set aside his work and opened his arms to me. \u201cHey, are you OK? No more shorthand messages without follow-up; they make me nervous.\u201d When I didn\u2019t dive into his embrace as usual, his brow furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Nick,\u201d I said, smiling at him and giving my best \u201cbad news\u201d face. \u201cThis whole thing has been a lot of fun. But I think you\u2019re taking all this way too seriously. It\u2019s time for you to move on.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s face flushed, then went bone white. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, trying to seem exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to find some other pack to pester. I mean, we had some good times, but I think we both knew this wouldn\u2019t work out in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re mated now, you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it up!\u201d I said, adding a sarcastic little laugh for good measure. \u201cLike human girls who tell the guys who take them home from bars that they \u2018never do this sort of thing.\u2019 Weres feed that whole \u2018mated for life\u2019 line to humans all the time. It makes you feel special.\u201d</p><p>He was staring me down, searching my face for some sign of the lie. And I was this close to folding. Fortunately, Friday-night card games with Pops and Samson had given me a pretty steady poker face. I gritted my teeth and stared right back. Nick\u2019s eyes narrowed. My lips tightened into a thin little line. And suddenly, he was grinning like a loon.</p><p>That I had not expected.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling a Lassie on me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he crowed, laughing.</p><p>Now my exasperation was genuine. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling a Lassie on me,\u201d he said again. \u201cIt\u2019s like some old episode of Lassie when Timmy thinks Lassie\u2019s about to be taken away and shot by some old mean farmer for eating chickens. Timmy tells Lassie he hates her and throws rocks at her so she\u2019ll run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you high right now?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to hurt me so I\u2019ll leave. You want to get me out of the way so . . . what, so I won\u2019t get hurt? What\u2019s going on, Maggie? Why are you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I want you to leave because I want you out of my face,\u201d I shot back.</p> <p>\u201cNot true. You love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I scowled as his little dimples winked at me, and he said, \u201cCan\u2019t live without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to harp on this, but you do know I\u2019m capable of killing you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should move in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re such a pain in the ass,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cA pain in the ass that you\u2019re madly in love with,\u201d he said.</p><p>I gave him my best death glare. He gave me that damn smile again, and I folded like a frigging accordion. I groaned as he wrapped his arm around me.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, baby, tell me what has you so wound up,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re Maggie Fucking Graham. You\u2019re not afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d I admitted, tapping my forehead against his collarbone. \u201cLosing you scares the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamson was shot today,\u201d I murmured into his shirt. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be OK, but we couldn\u2019t find who did it. And of course, Cooper came running, bringing Mo and the baby with him. And I started thinking about how stupid that was, because he could be bringing his family right into the whirlwind. I\u2019m not any better than he is. I\u2019m worse, because I want you close to me. And I can\u2019t protect you. I can try, but nothing I do can guarantee that you\u2019ll be safe. I can\u2019t keep anything from happening to you. It would be so much better for you to get as far away from me as you can. \u201c</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cDamn it. It was worth a shot.\u201d I looked up at him, my eyes pricking hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody else. I can\u2019t be with anyone else.\u201d He pulled me close, and I murmured into his neck, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>He poked my shoulder. \u201cWho was right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you try to do to push me away. I don\u2019t care what comes along. I\u2019m here. If you think I\u2019m going to back down now, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to love me out of spite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cAh, spite, the stuff of fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Wedding Belled</p><p>INSTEAD OF ME DRIVING Nick away, he ended up driving me back home, with a truckload of his stuff. He was moving in with Samson, he said, until Samson was back on his feet and we could build a house between Pops\u2019s place and Mom\u2019s. I didn\u2019t even have to ask; he just knew that was what he needed to do. He said he would start calling construction companies as soon as possible, so we could break ground when it thawed.</p><p>Oh, and apparently, we were getting married that summer.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t get down on one knee, but he pulled me into his lap and looped a little sapphire pendant around my neck. He reiterated his whole \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d plan and told me that if I ever tried to protect him by sending him away again, I would have two fights on my hands\u2014from the perceived danger and from Nick.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019re always going to be deliriously happy,\u201d he said as his fingers worked the chain\u2019s catch at the nape of my neck. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be together, and that\u2019s a lot more than some people have. So, Margaret Faith Graham\u201d\u2014he stopped when I growled at the mention of my middle name\u2014\u201ccut it out, your mom told me\u2014would you please stop being so stubborn and agree to marry the man who will love you until the day he dies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mumbled, fingering the pretty blue stone. I liked the way it sparkled, a quiet sort of shine that seemed to give off deeper flashes of cobalt within. He could have given me the Hope Diamond, and I wouldn\u2019t have been happier. \u201cI will stop jerking you around. It\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompted, cupping his hand to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYes, I will marry you.\u201d I sighed, slipping my arms around his neck. Suddenly, I shifted back and poked him in the chest. \u201cBut I\u2019m not wearing a froufrou princess dress.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows quirked, and he tilted his head. \u201cI\u2019d be fine with what you\u2019re wearing right now.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at my naked body. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>When we got home and told my family our somewhat bizarre proposal tale\u2014minus the nudity\u2014Mo suggested listening to my grand plans in my head to make sure they make sense before I act. I suggested she take a long walk off the nearest cliff. Then, of course, when she and Mom realized we had about five months to plan a wedding, the squealing began.</p><p>Oh, my God, the squealing.</p><p>Mo got on the phone with Kara, and there was more squealing, in stereo. Kara said she would come over with an armload of bridal planners the next day.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, we can\u2019t plan a wedding now,\u201d I said, grasping at any straws that kept me away from the words \u201cmanipedi.\u201d \u201cSamson just got shot. We have a problem with intruders. Nick and I can just go off to Anchorage one weekend and have a courthouse thing.\u201d</p><p>Mo and Mom looked at me as if I\u2019d just suggested shaving baby Eva\u2019s head and piercing her eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy either way,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet.\u201d Cooper chuckled. \u201cYou think you have a vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a vote?\u201d Nick asked. Cooper handed him a beer, clapped his hand down on Nick\u2019s, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYour best bet is just to sit back, relax, and wait for the cake.\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned. \u201cDo I at least get a vote on the flavor of the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>DO YOU KNOW how annoying it is to suspect something but not be able to do anything about it? I didn\u2019t know if these \u201chappenings\u201d were a focused effort to harass my pack or someone with a really lame sense of humor. I didn\u2019t have a suspect. I couldn\u2019t even give a description beyond \u201csmells like flowers.\u201d There was no interpack police agency. There was nothing to do, other than contacting Alan to complain about hunters getting too close to the border between the nature preserve and the valley.</p><p>Oh, and I finally told the pack about the \u201cbagging\u201d incident, which, along with Samson\u2019s shooting, helped them realize exactly how serious the problem was. Cooper and Samson had the decency to wait until the rest of the pack was gone before lighting into me for not telling anyone. Mom was so angry I thought she was going to try to take me over her knee. Instead, she hugged Nick and thanked him for helping her idiot daughter.</p><p>Signs were posted. We expanded the perimeter into the preserve. We patrolled in threes. No one left the confines of town by themselves. Whenever possible, the kids were kept inside, which was driving the parents and Teresa insane.</p><p>I was running myself into the ground. I was coming to depend on Nick more and more, which scared the hell out of me. When I came home and collapsed after all-night patrols, he was the one who dragged me into my room and tucked me in. He made sure there was food nearby when I woke up. On more than one occasion, he bathed me, but that was more recreational than anything else.</p><p>My deranged sister-in-law, she kept plying me with wedding magazines and books on how to be a beautiful happy fluffy princess bride. I think she saw it as some helpful way to take my mind off the pack\u2019s troubles, which was woefully inaccurate. I wanted to elope. In fact, I spent several days campaigning diligently for a chapel in Vegas. But Mom and Mo convinced me that it would be a shabby move for the alpha to run off and get married without the pack being able to see it. Plus, it would be a nice gesture to invite other packs to the wedding. Mo actually used the words \u201cpolitical maneuver.\u201d Sometimes that woman scared me.</p><p>I\u2019d never been one for change. I liked my routine. I liked knowing what to expect. But now, I\u2019d changed my plans, my expectations, by choosing someone completely outside the realm of what I expected, and I had change coming out the ying-yang. It was as if I\u2019d opened a little door and the whole world was opening up.</p><p>I was still on the fence about to whether that was a good thing.</p><p>So, I did what I could to maintain normalcy and escape the house, which included regular visits to see Billie. Alicia was also looking a little the worse for wear lately, and she appreciated it when she could step out of the house to take a walk or do . . . whatever it was that she did with Samson. I tried not to think about it.</p><p>\u201cAlicia!\u201d I called as I came through Billie\u2019s door. \u201cMy mom made a blueberry pie. It\u2019s Billie\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>My ears pricked up as I closed the door behind me. There was an odd stillness to the house. No TV blaring cartoon songs from the next room. No thunder of little running feet. The only sound was the dryer running in the utility room. The rusty scent of dried blood spiraled out of the kitchen, raising the hairs on my arms. The instinct to change, to defend, was overwhelming. I had to force myself to stay in my human shape.</p><p>I dropped the pie, breaking china and splattering purple goo over my boots. I inhaled deeply, searching for some sign of an intruder.</p><p>I crept on silent feet toward the table where I used to sit and eat Lucky Charms on the mornings after Eli slept over at our house. Mom would send me to Aunt Billie\u2019s for sleepovers, so Billie wouldn\u2019t get lonely. I wanted to be that little girl again, in the Smurf nightshirt, with nothing to worry about but which cartoon to fit into her Saturday-morning schedule. Time seemed to stop in my head, and I couldn\u2019t force myself to approach the source of that rust smell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, screw that, I was Maggie Graham. I wasn\u2019t scared of anything.</p><p>Squaring my shoulders, I strode through the front room to the kitchen. Flour was spilled across the counter. A jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread sat open near the stove, with sticky slices strewn on the floor. I stepped around the corner and saw faded pink slippers on still, splayed feet. Billie was on her side, wearing her favorite blue plaid housecoat. There was a kitchen knife just out of her reach, by her right hand. Her hair was matted with red. The corner of the counter near the fridge was crusted with dried, brick-colored blood.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I murmured. \u201cOh, no. Aunt Billie, no.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped to my knees. I clasped her wrist in my fingers but found no pulse. The body was still warm, but her eyes were open, fixed on the ceiling. There was no spark. There was nothing to be done for her.</p><p>I laid gentle fingers on her eyelids and closed them. I leaned over, my forehead almost touching her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She\u2019d hit her head. That much was clear. Had she passed out? Tripped? Pushed? Where was Alicia? Why wasn\u2019t someone with her?</p><p>I kneeled there for what felt like hours. I heard chatter from just outside the back door. Alicia was leading the boys up the stairs. I ran for the door. \u201cKeep the boys outside,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Alicia blanched at my tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Billie . . .\u201d I said, glancing down at the boys, who were clamoring for juice and SpongeBob.</p><p>The color drained from Alicia\u2019s face. \u201cNo. I just left for a few minutes. I took the boys out to play. The weather was so nice for once. And she was taking a nap. I thought it would be OK.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on her shoulder and offered her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cShe must have gotten up. She was in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Alicia seemed to be gasping for air as tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I squeezed her shoulder and shook it gently. \u201cYou took good care of her, Alicia. Why don\u2019t you take the boys to my mom\u2019s? I\u2019ll stay here. You call Dr. Moder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should stay\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlicia, you did everything you could for her. Let me take it from here. That\u2019s my job. Get the kids away from here. You don\u2019t want them to see this.\u201d</p><p>Alicia nodded, robotically leading the boys down the front steps. Dropping to my knees, I sat next to Billie and waited.</p><p>I SAT AT my desk, staring into space. I kept waiting for tears or sweet, clarifying anger. But I was numb. My brain had shut down all emotional responses in some sort of survival mode. All I could do was list the dozens of things I needed to do.</p><p>I needed to call Matthew, Billie\u2019s great-nephew. I needed to go through Billie\u2019s papers and try to figure out what accounts needed to be closed, whether she had a will. We needed to plan the service. Mom had stepped in to pick the music and the flowers. Samson and Clay had volunteered to make the casket, which was a pack tradition. We used a were-owned funeral home to sign off on the arrangements, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about the state looking too closely at death certificates.</p><p>Dr. Moder had taken the body to the clinic. She said Billie had hit her head against the corner of the counter with enough force to break her neck. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, the fall also cracked Billie\u2019s skull, causing a hemorrhage that would have been fatal. The only good news was that the broken neck most likely prevented any suffering. The doc couldn\u2019t tell me how Billie had fallen, but given the state of the kitchen, she\u2019d probably been in the middle of an episode and either lost her balance or passed out. As much as I wanted to blame Billie\u2019s death on some unseen intruder, Dr. Moder said it was more likely that she\u2019d simply fallen hard enough to do that sort of damage. As strong as we are, our bones can only stand up to so much as we age.</p><p>I made a mental note to pick up some calcium supplements for Pops.</p><p>Suddenly, all of the weird occurrences seemed silly by comparison. I felt indulgent and paranoid for trying to find hidden dangers while missing out on the real threat Billie posed to herself.</p><p>For the fourth time in an hour, I picked up the phone to call Matthew. As alpha, it fell to me to inform Billie\u2019s kin of her passing. These were the rare times when my job sucked ass. I\u2019d left three voice-mail messages, but by now, I knew the best method was to keep calling until he picked up. This time, in a near-miraculous show of cell-phone mastery, Matt managed to pick up before it went to voice mail. He chattered from the other end of the line about births and matings in his own pack, physically incapable of letting someone else enter the conversation until he had to take a breath.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Matt, I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but Billie is gone.\u201d Blunt, yes, but necessary if I wanted to shut him up for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what happened, but it looks like she fell and hit her head in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line, the longest pause I could remember while talking to Matt. He sighed and gave the expected platitudes about long life and Billie being in a better place. We talked about the funeral, made arrangements for a contingent from Matt\u2019s pack to stay in houses around the valley. Matt had clearly been expecting this call for a while, because he seemed to have the end planned out. He loved logistics, which was part of why he was a pretty effective pack leader. Handling the mundane details seemed to help. I could handle busy work.</p><p>As the call was winding down, Matt said, \u201cMaggie, I hope you know how much I appreciate you taking care of Billie in her last months. I know it was difficult, but deep down, I\u2019m sure she really appreciated being able to stay in her own home.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and felt just a tiny bit of the weight on my chest wiggle loose. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t take all the credit. Clay and Alicia did most of the work.\u201d</p><p>Another long pause from Matt. Two in one phone call, which was unprecedented. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay and Alicia,\u201d I repeated. \u201cRenard. Your cousins? Billie\u2019s nephew and niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMags, I have fifty-six first cousins alone, and none of them is named Clay or Alicia. And Billie was an only child. Where did these people say they were from?\u201d</p><p>The office door opened, and Clay stepped inside, an amiable grin stretched across his face. All of the blood in my veins seemed to flutter and freeze.</p><p>The phone was hanging heavily against the side of my face. I took in a breath, jittery from shock and rage and the knowledge that I had actually kissed this guy. I\u2019d given him the benefit of the doubt when Nick suggested that he could have been the one on the cliff, when I considered the damage to my brakes and his mechanical know-how. I believed he wasn\u2019t capable of it because of the way he took care of Billie.</p><p>I steadied my voice and tried to loosen up enough to smile back at the son of a bitch. \u201cOK, that\u2019s great news. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Matt noted the suspicious lift in my tone. \u201cMaggie, are you OK?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll tell Mom you called. Dinner on Thursday,\u201d I said. \u201c \u2019Bye, Coop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie\u2014\u201d Matt\u2019s voice was cut off with a click as I dropped the receiver onto the cradle.</p><p>Clay gave me a subdued little half-smile. \u201cDinner on Thursday? Is it wrong to hope for a doggie bag? Because Mo can make a mean . . . well, pretty much anything.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. The relaxed expression on his face was what killed me. He\u2019d been lying to us for months, and it didn\u2019t seem to bother him in the slightest. He\u2019d lived with my aunt, in her house, living off the pack\u2019s goodwill, for months and seemed to have every intention of continuing. And he wasn\u2019t even nervous.</p><p>I sprang over the desk. Clay\u2019s eyes widened briefly before I gripped his collar and slammed him into the wall. But as I snapped and growled, he just looked amused.</p><p>\u201cI knew we should have left when Billie died.\u201d He sighed, shoving back at me but not moving me. He didn\u2019t seem perturbed by this, as if I wasn\u2019t this close to ripping his throat out. \u201cAlicia said it would look suspicious if we just ran off now. I think maybe she got too used to living in one place. And she liked the old lady. She wanted to stick around for the service. My sister\u2019s a sentimental girl, never could cure her of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d Clay said, tilting his head and grinning nastily. \u201cI know we\u2019re not dating anymore, but I hoped we could still be friends.\u201d I sneered at him and swiped my fingernails down his cheek. He didn\u2019t even register the welts of blood I left on his face. \u201cNo? Well, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>He shoved me again, sending me flying over my desk this time, tumbling into the far wall. He\u2019d phased and lunged for me. I shot up to my feet and ran at him again, phasing on the fly. Our wolfen bodies collided, and his teeth scraped my throat. I turned, yanking my exposed fur out of his mouth, and landed on two human feet. He phased to human again, and I head-butted him, the thickest part of my forehead cracking his nose. He grinned. And punched me right in the mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was sort of hoping we could avoid all this cloak-and-dagger shit. You\u2019re a pretty girl, and you can be downright tolerable sometimes. I thought maybe you and I could get married, you could make me the alpha male, and I could bring my family in, no questions asked. But you\u2019re just so damned stubborn, aren\u2019t you, Maggie? You have to do things the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Papers and books scattered around the room as we pounded on each other in wolf and human forms. But despite several opportunities, he didn\u2019t strike any serious blows. He just kept slapping me around and phasing, wolf to man and back again, and honor sort of dictated that I phase, too, to keep us on the same footing. The exhaustion of the constant shifting combined with being smacked around was draining and demoralizing.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t figured it out, have you?\u201d He sneered, standing over me. \u201cWell, that\u2019s disappointing. You know, you\u2019re not a very smart girl.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my desk chair and threw it at him, catching his shoulders and knocking him to the ground. I lunged, kicking him in the ribs and knocking him onto his back. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little hurt that you didn\u2019t notice the resemblance,\u201d he spat, dribbling blood onto the tile floor of the office. \u201cEverybody in my pack told me I looked just like my dad. Of course, you and your brother killed those people.\u201d</p><p>I stared down at him, analyzing the sandy hair, the light brown eyes. When I\u2019d seen that mouth, it had been twisted into a feral snarl. The eyes had been sharp and too bright, burning with hate and desperation. I felt my arms drop to my sides, the shock leeching all of the energy out of my limbs.</p><p>I was a dumb-ass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jonas\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis one and only heir,\u201d Clay said, pushing to his feet. \u201cYour time here is over. I\u2019ve seen enough to know that you\u2019re not strong enough to hold on to the valley. It\u2019s time for a new pack, a stronger pack, to take over. You have three days to clear your ragged excuse for a family out of our new home. Otherwise, people will start getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are already getting hurt.\u201d I grunted.</p><p>He smiled, his teeth tinged an awful red. \u201cNo, this is minor damage. I mean, really, truly hurt. Throats ripped out. Paws missing. How\u2019d you like to walk out of your cozy little house to find your mother, your grandfather, one of those little brats, dead and cold on your doorstep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to provoke me?\u201d I demanded, shoving at his shoulders. \u201cYou are not this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I am!\u201d he shouted, shoving me back.</p><p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t change what happened\u2014\u201d When he looked vaguely bored, I slammed his head against the wall. He snarled, and I grabbed his chin, forcing him to look me in the eye. \u201cListen to me. I am sorry for what was done to your pack, but you will not threaten my fucking family and make it sound like a Sunday picnic, do you hear?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leered at me and threw one last upper cut to my chin. I stumbled over the wreckage of my office furniture and nearly landed on my ass. Fine, I landed on my ass, but after that whooping, I needed a rest.</p><p>\u201cThree days, Maggie. And then I bring the rest of my pack home, whether you\u2019re here or not. It\u2019s Old Home Week, and we plan on throwing a hell of a party.\u201d</p><p>Clay disappeared, so quickly I didn\u2019t even have time to reply, and Samson came running. I assumed that Matt had managed to call him as soon as I hung up on him. It was nice to know Matt could operate his phone when he was in a jam . . . or that someone else had dialed for him.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he? What hurts?\u201d Samson demanded. \u201cDo we need Doc Moder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay\u2019s gone.\u201d I sighed, sitting up slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone chasing after him. Who knows how many he\u2019s got in his \u2018pack\u2019?\u201d My ears rang as Samson helped me into a sitting position. He kept checking me over for wounds until I had to slap his hands away. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine!\u201d I moaned, clutching my head in my hands. \u201cThough I wouldn\u2019t say no to a new skull. Look, I don\u2019t want to explain this more than once, so could you round everybody up and bring them to Mom\u2019s? I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, gently pulling me to my feet. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re OK to walk?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he sprinted for the door. \u201cHey, Samson?\u201d He stopped and poked his head back through the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re an awesome second. I don\u2019t care what anybody says.\u201d</p><p>He winked at me. \u201cTry not to get your ass kicked on the walk home.\u201d</p> <p>He ducked out the door before he could see the rude gesture I was making.</p><p>15</p><p>Homecoming</p><p>I CHOSE TO LIMP HOME quietly, using buildings and vehicles as cover. Not to protect my dignity but to keep the pack from suffering another blow. OK, it was to protect my dignity.</p><p>How could this have happened? How could I have been so blind? They knew so much about Billie, about our pack. I kept calling Matt to check them out, but he never returned my calls, and after a certain amount of time, when Alicia and Clay hadn\u2019t killed us all in our sleep, I just sort of took for granted that they were legit. And sure, maybe I trusted them a little more because they had the boys with them, and I like to think that a mother to two toddlers couldn\u2019t be completely evil. I was new to being alpha. I was kind of overwhelmed. I appreciated all the help I could get.</p><p>Ugh, that was a bunch of rationalization crap. I\u2019d dropped my guard, and now I was paying for it.</p> <p>Billie had tried to tell me that she didn\u2019t know them, that I\u2019d let strangers into her house. But I\u2019d chalked it up to her illness. Had she had moments of lucidity? Had she woken up in her own home, frightened, surrounded by strangers? I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever forgive myself for that.</p><p>Mom found me lying on the couch in one of Nick\u2019s old Star Wars sweatshirts with a steak pressed to my face. She hadn\u2019t seen me this bloody for a couple of years, so it sent her into a bit of a panic. I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds, and the next thing I knew, Nick was there, looking stricken and pushing my hair away from my battered, healing face.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, baby, you\u2019re scaring me. Please, wake up, talk to me,\u201d he begged. His shirt was smeared with my blood, as if he\u2019d gathered me to his chest while I was out. \u201cJust let me know you\u2019re OK.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wincing when the action made my head spin. I closed my eyes again and awoke to more people, simultaneously trying to hug me and demand answers from me. Who hurt me? Where were they now? And on and on and on until\u2014</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d I bellowed, just so they would shut up enough to let me sit up and get a word in. My ears rang with the volume of my own voice, and I had to close my eyes to keep from throwing up. Nick pulled me up, gingerly pressing my back against his side. I winced, knowing that even with werewolf healing abilities, I was going to be bruised all to hell. Mo brought me a mug of Mom\u2019s special herbal tea, which I accepted with no intention of actually drinking it.</p><p>\u201cClay did this,\u201d I said, using the towel Mom handed me to dab at my healing lip. \u201cHe\u2019s long gone by now. And so, I would imagine, are Alicia and the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would Clay do this?\u201d Cooper demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still confused about that myself. I thought he was OK with you mating with Nick,\u201d Samson said, his lips pressed into a tight little grimace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say my not dating him probably ranks lower on my list of offenses than, say, Cooper and I killing his whole damned family. Clay is Jonas\u2019s son, all grown up.\u201d</p><p>Cooper sat down heavily on the couch, looking stunned.</p><p>\u201cWait, so that means Alicia . . .\u201d I heard Samson curse and throw a chair across the room, apparently just now realizing that the girl he considered a possible mate was also a possible homicidal maniac. I made a mental note to feel bad for him as soon as my brain unscrambled.</p><p>\u201cAll this time, I knew there was something familiar about him, something that made me uneasy,\u201d Cooper said, his face paper-white. \u201cI just thought it was the typical big-brother reaction to your first boyfriend. I can\u2019t believe I let that psycho get so close and not even recognize him for what he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s a well-informed psycho,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he got his background information on the pack, but he knew just enough about us to make his story plausible. I\u2019m assuming that he\u2019s behind the truck brakes and my office and shooting Samson. Because when I think back on those days, I don\u2019t ever remember seeing Clay near the valley, which seems odd.\u201d</p><p>Cooper wondered, \u201cIf he was going to try to stage a coup, why would he wait such a long time? None of this makes any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all coups follow a rigid code of conduct.\u201d I snorted, groaning when that made my skin, lip, and nose burn. \u201cI think at first, Clay just wanted to gather information on us. And then, after sticking around for a while, I don\u2019t know, maybe they started to like us. Alicia became fond of Billie, and Clay said he hoped that I\u2019d choose him as a mate, and we could skip the whole dramatic-takeover thing. And when it became clear that I was becoming interested in Nick, I think Clay started playing all those tricks to make me think I needed someone like him around, someone like me. Instead, I just leaned on Nick. Now that they\u2019ve been discovered, they have no choice but to go on the offensive.\u201d I pressed the compress to my face and moaned. \u201cI should have seen this. I feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged but didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>Nick glared at him. \u201cLike you handled your first attempted coup any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI handled it OK,\u201d Cooper mumbled defensively. \u201cIt was the aftermath that sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerritorial disputes are not all that uncommon in the animal kingdom,\u201d Nick told me, in that \u201chot for teacher\u201d tone I knew was supposed to make me feel better. \u201cAll life is basically a competition for resources. A cuckoo instinctually knows to lay eggs in other birds\u2019 nests, so their eggs can hatch faster than the host birds\u2019. The cuckoo chick grows faster. In most cases, the chick evicts the eggs of the host species, and the baby cuckoos suck up all the food and nurturing. Cicada-killer wasps sting and paralyze insects twice their size and weight, drag them back to their dens, and lay their eggs in the cicadas\u2019 heads so the newborn wasps can eat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this is Alicia and Clay\u2019s version of paralyzing me and laying eggs in my head?\u201d I asked, dumbfounded. Nick rolled his eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m not good with metaphors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, let me get this straight,\u201d Mo said, holding up her hands. \u201cAlicia and Clay are Jonas\u2019s kids.\u201d She continued, \u201cClay\u2019s the alpha of whatever half-grown pack was left behind when Cooper killed all of the adults. Sorry, babe, but it\u2019s the truth. And Alicia is his slightly-scary-in-a-quiet-way second in command?\u201d Mo shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re the bizarro version of Cooper and Maggie.\u201d</p><p>When we glared at her, she rolled her eyes and huffed. \u201cI said \u2018bizarro.\u2019 It means the opposite. It\u2019s not an insult!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got your back,\u201d Nick assured her, giving her the nerd fist-bump. Mo preened. Cooper and I shared a commiserating \u201cwe chose them, we did this to ourselves\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019ve been waiting all this time, for what, to do what their parents couldn\u2019t? To move into the valley, like it was some sort of Promised Land? Were they just gathering information this whole time?\u201d Mo asked. \u201cHow could they do that? I mean, if they hated you that much, how could they live with you for almost a year? How could they stand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got enough patience, enough will, you can stand just about anything,\u201d Mom suggested thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong that I feel a little sorry for them?\u201d Mo asked, cringing. \u201cI mean, yes, their tactics are obviously questionable, but to be fair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe killed everyone they loved,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cEven if they started it, we finished it in a really bloody way. And I get it. If somebody killed members of my family, nothing would stop me from ripping them apart. I\u2019m not going to say I feel sorry for them, given what they\u2019ve done. But I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Samson asked.</p><p>\u201cClay said he\u2019s bringing his pack here in three days to \u2018evict\u2019 us. We either stand and fight, or everybody moves to Cousin Lee\u2019s packlands, which I really don\u2019t consider an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote \u2018stand and fight,\u201d Samson declared.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shocker,\u201d Mo muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a democracy, Samson,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maggie, you can stop this,\u201d Nick told me. \u201cBreak the cycle. Try to talk to them, figure out a peaceable solution. Otherwise, in ten years, Paul and Ronnie are going to come looking for Eva and our kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m supposed to what? Go to a mediator? Family therapy? Wolves don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t talk things through. We don\u2019t share our feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you don\u2019t think I understand the kind of pressure you\u2019re under,\u201d Nick told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right, I\u2019ll never understand what it\u2019s like to have a whole extended family depending on me, to be responsible for all those people. But I do know what it\u2019s like to have a family that either can\u2019t take care of you or doesn\u2019t care to. I know what it\u2019s like to have a family that\u2019s more interested in taking from you. Your pack, they\u2019re good people. They didn\u2019t know who I was and, after a few rough patches, took me in. Stop underestimating their capacity for kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur capacity for kindness is what got us into this,\u201d I shot back, regretting again the ease with which Clay and Alicia had been accepted.</p><p>\u201cYou think we should let them move in?\u201d Cooper said incredulously. \u201cTell me, Doc, in all your years of studying animals, have you ever seen two herds or whatever able to merge and share living space peaceably?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re going to have to appeal to their more human sides,\u201d Nick retorted.</p><p>\u201cOpen our hearts and our homes to the children of a bunch of psychos who tried to murder us?\u201d Cooper scoffed. \u201cThis is the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think maybe Alicia would still want to date me?\u201d Samson wondered.</p><p>Cooper pointed a finger at Samson. \u201cI stand corrected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever underestimate the excitement of sex with the crazy,\u201d Samson said, wincing when Mo smacked the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Tilt-A-Whirl and a scary movie all in one.\u201d</p><p>Mom covered her face with her hands and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m not even in the room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK, everyone stop picturing Samson\u2019s upsetting sex life,\u201d I told them. \u201cI need some time to think. Samson, I would really appreciate it if you stepped up patrols, starting now. Keep it quiet; just gradually increase the number of runners and the frequency. Nobody goes out without at least two partners.\u201d</p><p>Samson phased on his way out the door and set up a summoning howl.</p><p>\u201cI could swear I asked him to keep it quiet,\u201d I grumbled, leaning back against Nick.</p> <p>\u201cSamson was never one for subtlety,\u201d Mo said, bringing me a bowl of my mom\u2019s chicken noodle soup. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soup\u2019s a good start,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Mo leveled that bizarrely calm gaze at me. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>As Cooper warned her that any violent acts on her part would be over his cold, dead body, I wondered whether Mo had always been so cool under pressure or if living through so much of our pack drama had given her such strong nerves. Still, I told her, \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fight.\u201d</p><p>She huffed, \u201cOh, right, Cooper and I will just trot on home and let you handle this. Because if Clay\u2019s pack runs you off, they\u2019ll just stop at the valley, right? They won\u2019t come after me or my family be cause we\u2019re connected to you. They won\u2019t be threatened by the presence of a strong male wolf in their territory. The same wolf who, you know, killed their dad. They\u2019ll just ignore my family, my baby, except for the obligatory \u2018new neighbor\u2019 Bundt cake they\u2019ll be bringing over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Mo, stop making sense.\u201d I muttered around a mouthful of soup. \u201cNo, no, I can\u2019t let you get involved. The best thing for you to do would be to take the baby to Grundy and stay there until the coast is clear. Or better yet, go to Washington. Go visit your parents.\u201d</p><p>Cooper snorted.</p><p>Mo was aghast. \u201cFirst of all, Samson\u2019s wanting to date Alicia makes more sense than me going to visit my parents. Second, this is it for you, Mags. This is the defining moment in your leadership of the pack. And it\u2019s your chance to change things. You can\u2019t keep the dead-liners out of pack business anymore. Or us humans, for that matter. You\u2019re our family. This is our home, too. What are we supposed to do? Send you off into a fight with this bunch of wackos, sit on our hands, and wonder whether you\u2019re coming home or not? It\u2019s not fair, Maggie. I can help. Nick can, too. You can\u2019t exclude us anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re going to stand on the battlefield with a fire extinguisher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelped me kick your ass,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kick my ass, you just bruised it a little.\u201d</p> <p>Mo smirked, winked at Nick, and dragged Cooper into the kitchen with Mom. I leaned my aching temple against Nick\u2019s shoulder and rolled my options over in my head. I\u2019d charged into fights before, but I\u2019d never led. And I\u2019d never been so frightened\u2014but not for myself. Every face in the pack hovered at the edge of my brain, the feeling of responsibility, of obligation, dragging me under rushing black water. I would never be strong enough. I would never be fast enough to protect all of them. Some of us probably wouldn\u2019t survive this, and knowing that made me want to throw up.</p><p>Sometimes being a leader really sucked.</p><p>16</p><p>Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli</p><p>ONCE MY FACE HEALED up to something that didn\u2019t resemble a recalled eggplant, I called a pack meeting and instructed members to bring all of their family members\u2014even the dead-liners. After I convinced them that I was not kidding and they went back home to retrieve said dead-liners, I laid everything on the line for those who hadn\u2019t been invited to pack meetings until now, every weird coincidence and hinky feeling I\u2019d had since Clay had moved into the valley. And when I dropped the bomb about Clay and Alicia\u2019s dubious family connections, two of my uncles literally wolfed out and chose to destroy a couch to express their anger.</p><p>The reaction was a sort of venting by proxy for the other pack members, and by the time Uncle Jay and Uncle Rob were trying to digest spring coils, my relatives looked a little bored.</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen at every pack meeting?\u201d Mo asked Evie. Having never attended a pack meeting before, Evie shrugged.</p><p>Nick was grinning like an idiot. \u201cThis is the coolest thing I have ever seen!\u201d</p> <p>I buried my face in my hands for a second and contemplated chlorinating my gene pool before wedging myself between the furry idiots and shaking them by the napes of their necks until they phased back to human.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d I told them both as they shuffled back to their seats and looked as sheepish as two wolves could. \u201cSo, do we have that out of our systems?\u201d</p><p>Rob and Jay refused to meet my gaze. I outlined what I considered to be a pretty damn reasonable plan. Able-bodied adults, wolf and dead-liner alike, would stay in the valley. My mom and the older aunties would take the kids, even self-proclaimed badass teenagers, and split them between Cooper\u2019s and Nick\u2019s places for the next few days.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we go to the mattresses, right?\u201d Jay said, his white teeth gleaming. Evie rolled her eyes. For Jay, all situations related somehow to The Godfather.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we try to talk to them,\u201d I countered.</p><p>Jay\u2019s face fell into a contemplative frown. \u201cI did not expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they killed Billie!\u201d Uncle Rob protested.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. But from what Dr. Moder said, Billie could have tripped and hit her head. Which is sort of my point. If we rush into this, rush into judgment, rush into action, we\u2019re going to find ourselves even more vulnerable and screwed up than we were after Cooper left, and we all know how that turned out. Sorry, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged.</p><p>I added, \u201cWhat if we say, \u2018Fuck it, we\u2019re going to kill them all\u2019? Say we chase them down, and we find that their pack is twice the size of ours. Or that they\u2019ve set some trap that we\u2019ve walked right into? What happens then? We\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever took you for a coward, Maggie.\u201d Jay snorted and then turned white after the look I gave him.</p><p>\u201cOK, fine, we go after them with both barrels. We\u2019ll lose a couple of our pack and take down a few of theirs. And in a few years, their kids are going to show up and what? Fight our kids for what we did? We\u2019re going to leave our kids to make this same choice? What would you want them to do?\u201d</p><p>Rob, whose little girl was two and as wolfen as kids could be at that age, shrank down in his seat at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying we won\u2019t end up fighting them anyway, but we at least have to try to figure out what\u2019s going on in their heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we talk to them?\u201d Rob said, as if it was the first time he was hearing the concept.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Jay prompted.</p><p>\u201cThen we go to the mattresses.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>ONE OF THE uncles must have tipped Uncle Frank off about the coming \u201cinvasion.\u201d Lee called to volunteer his packmates, but I told him to stay home and keep safe. Sure, the extra bodies would have been handy, but we were less likely to get Clay\u2019s pack\u2019s respect if we ran tattling to another pack for backup. Plus, the situation was likely to escalate too quickly if Lee was around, posturing and growling.</p><p>Lee was pretty smug about the whole \u201cClay\u2019s a traitor\u201d thing. He went on and on about how you \u201cjust didn\u2019t know who you could trust these days\u201d and how Uncle Frank had never liked Clay anyway.</p><p>But we actually had a conversation that didn\u2019t end in my threatening him, which I took as progress. Until a few seconds later, when he started making noises about taking me out for a movie as soon as the snow cleared, you know, if we survived the inter-pack war thing. And then he followed that charming invitation up with \u201cWho knows what could happen when you and I are in a dark room?\u201d And I threw up in my mouth a little bit.</p><p>\u201cLee, I\u2019m mated now,\u201d I said in a clipped, businesslike tone, remembering that Uncle Frank hadn\u2019t been around for the \u201cbig announcement\u201d about Nick. And I doubted that any of my packmates wanted to call Uncle Frank and listen to the bitch-storm that would follow if they told him about my formal mating to a human. \u201cI would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t make comments like that. And by appreciate, I mean I will restrain myself from shoving your head up your own ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, mated?\u201d Lee shouted. \u201cBut Clay\u2014why wasn\u2019t I told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t told because it was none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if it\u2019s not Clay, who is it?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s not that human, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now, Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the human!\u201d Lee shrieked petulantly as I set the phone down on the cradle.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is why I haven\u2019t let Mom send out the wedding invitations yet,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>THE NIGHT BEFORE Clay\u2019s \u201cdeadline\u201d was hectic. I\u2019d underestimated the amount of persuasion, strong-arming, and, finally, begging it would take to get the aunties out of the valley. None of them wanted to miss the fight. None of them wanted to be left, as Mo said, sitting on her hands, wondering if we would come home. And my mom was the ringleader of the rebellion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re asking this of me,\u201d Mom growled as I shoved her inside Mo\u2019s truck, where Eva was blowing bubbles in her own spit.</p><p>\u201cMom, look at Mo.\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou think it\u2019s easy for her to pack her daughter into her car seat and watch Eva blow bye-bye bubbles, not knowing how this is all going to turn out? But at least she\u2019s handling it with some dignity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you didn\u2019t hear the argument she and Cooper had earlier. I\u2019ve never heard Mo cuss that way before. I thought she\u2019d blister paint. I think you\u2019re a bad influence on her.\u201d</p><p>I was really sorry I\u2019d missed that. Cooper and Mo had several blow-ups over Mo\u2019s decision to stay at his side. Cooper tried to appeal to her motherly instinct and the possibility that Eva could be left without either parent. Mo countered that that was far less likely to happen if she was covering Cooper\u2019s back. And around and around they went, until Cooper was blue in the face and Mo was threatening him with a large frying pan if he tried to force her into the truck. It didn\u2019t stop him from trying. And now he had a pan-shaped bruise on his back. We considered it a draw.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cMom, if you get into the truck right now and we all survive this thing, I will let you plan the wedding, from bottom to top, without any arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll even let you do that stupid white-dove-release thing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at me. \u201cWell played, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>After a little more prodding, Mom finally got into the truck and led the caravan of kids and aunts out of the valley. I looked around at the clenched, determined expressions on the parents\u2019 faces as they waved good-bye to their departing children. And I felt a little twinge of emptiness.</p><p>Mo snickered and slipped her arm around my shoulders. \u201cYou know, for the alpha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d I warned her.</p><p>\u201cNot that many people listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be such a bitch sometimes,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She smiled sweetly at me. \u201cI\u2019m becoming more and more like you every day.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Cooper shuddered.</p><p>I MANAGED TO talk everyone into a sundown curfew. The larger, younger of us were running alternating patrols along the border to watch for an early ambush. I did a door-to-door check to make sure everyone was tucked away safely for now. As I slumped toward Mom\u2019s house, exhausted to my bones, Rob and Jay kept yelling lines from 300 at my back, which made me think they weren\u2019t taking the whole Gandhi approach very seriously. It felt like lights-out at a particularly violent summer camp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mo and Cooper had agreed to stay at Samson\u2019s for the night. It struck me as sort of crappily ironic that our first night alone in the valley was so dark.</p><p>Nick had cooked, or at least warmed up something Mom left behind. Without speaking, we settled on the couch. I took his face between my palms and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cIs this the part where you tell me it\u2019s my duty to sleep with you because you\u2019re going off to war and you could be killed?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat is so wrong,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut yes, it would be a nice gesture.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into his lap, sliding his hands along my ribs</p><p>\u201cAre you scared?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be stupid not to be,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled that you\u2019re going to be there, but given the Lassie conversation and Mo\u2019s cast-iron-pan antics, I know it\u2019s a waste of breath to try to push you out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019m not trying to make this some dramatic good-bye moment. I just want to tell you now, while it\u2019s quiet and we\u2019re not facing certain ass-whooping, that I love you. I\u2019ve never loved anyone the way I love you. I\u2019m going to love you until the day I die.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cWow, you will do anything to get laid, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThanks, I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he told me, kissing me.</p><p>He pushed my shirt over my head, pulling my hair from its ponytail and letting it fall around us in a dark, shiny curtain. He took his time, touching me with an aching slowness that built a searing heat in my belly. His kisses consumed my breath, my fear, my worry. I eased his zipper down, and he moaned as my hand slipped around him. He pushed up from the couch, with my legs still wrapped around his waist, and carried me down the hall.</p><p>We\u2019d never managed to make it to my room, in a bed, with the lights off before. It was sort of decadent and naughty, getting naked in the room where I used to have Smurf curtains. He trailed kisses from my neck to my belly button, taking the time to nip lightly here and there, leaving little marks behind. I tugged at his shoulders, bringing him back to eye level, so I could thread my fingers through his hair while he settled between my thighs.</p> <p>When he reached for the condoms in my night-stand, I stopped his hand. His eyebrows arched. I\u2019d told myself that I would know when I was ready, and I did. I wanted a baby with Nick. There were things in life I still wanted to do\u2014school, travel, leading my pack. But I didn\u2019t think Nick would let me get out of doing them. In fact, he\u2019d probably drag me to whatever pipe dream I was shying away from if he spotted any backtracking on my part.</p><p>\u201cI consider it a hopeful gesture,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe might get pregnant, we might not. We might get through tomorrow only to get smooshed by a semi next Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst declaration of hope ever,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, detailed forecasts of my possible male-pattern baldness?\u201d</p><p>I snickered. \u201cThe point is, I love you, and I don\u2019t want to put any more restrictions on however much time we have left together, whether it\u2019s hours or decades. I don\u2019t care what tomorrow brings, as long as I have you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed me, then slipped inside me without a barrier between us, skin on skin. I sighed at the warm intrusion as his fingertips traced the lines of my face. He rocked into me, and we settled into a soothing, gentle rhythm. This was different, quiet, better. And when we both were sated, he pulled my back against his chest and held me without speaking. And somehow I managed to fall asleep.</p><p>THE MORNING ROLLED in quietly, leaving us restless and edgy. I didn\u2019t know what I expected\u2014Clay and Alicia leading a parade of tanks down Main Street, maybe. And when the strange pack seemed to coil out of the trees like mist, I thought I was seeing things. There were thirty or so of them, fewer than half of what we had gathered against them. They were so young, a handful of them as old as me, with the rest in their late teens. They all had that lean, ragged, wary look of someone who\u2019s had to survive. I wondered where they\u2019d been while Clay and Alicia spied on us. How close had they been all this time?</p><p>The kids were trailing behind, holding on to the hands of a few older ladies, including Ronnie and Paul, who were waving at us. I realized then that Jonas had probably done the exact thing we\u2019d done, all those years ago. He\u2019d left the kids with the older women, while he marched off to conquer their \u201cnew home.\u201d And he\u2019d never come back. I thought of my mom, taking care of dozens of kids, waiting for news. And my throat grew a little tight.</p><p>I felt the pack align behind me, watched as my packmates guarding the borders paced them on four paws as they entered our territory. A chorus of growls sounded behind me, and I felt several of my packmates phase as Clay sauntered toward me. I held up my hand, and the sounds faded to a dull, constant grumble. The light glinted off his light brown hair, and he grinned that same crooked smile at me, but it was hollow, a stupid boy\u2019s ploy to try to cover the fact that he was scared shitless.</p> <p>When Jay and Ron, who were part of the escort, sniffed a little too close, I made a little warning growl, and they backed off immediately. Yes, they were excited and twitching for a fight, but these were the situations where you had to listen to your alpha if you wanted to get out unscathed. I felt my fear and my anger subside a little. This wasn\u2019t the snarling, hate-filled foe I was expecting. They were a bunch of scared kids.</p><p>Clay stopped just a few feet in front of me, and I was struck by a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. He looked so much like his father now, minus the crazy eyes. Clay gave me a hard stare, and I returned it.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked him, my head tilting.</p><p>Clay looked a little startled at my light and conversational tone. Not at all like my more recent threats to \u201cend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why we\u2019re here, I just can\u2019t believe you were dumb enough to stick around.\u201d</p><p>My voice so low only he could hear me, I said, \u201cClay, I think we both know what\u2019s going to happen if I give an order for my pack to take yours. Please don\u2019t make me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not giving me a choice,\u201d he whispered, glancing over his shoulder. His jaw was so tense I could hear his teeth grinding.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk privately?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, so you can drag me off to the woods and let one of your uncles rip my throat out?\u201d he said loudly enough so the rest of his pack could hear.</p><p>I growled. \u201cClay, stop being a jackass,\u201d I snarled. \u201cYou bring your second, I\u2019ll bring mine.\u201d Samson stepped forward and gazed longingly at Alicia, which was not appreciated by one of the younger males in Clay\u2019s pack. I added loudly, \u201cAnd everyone here will behave themselves like good boys and girls!\u201d</p><p>Uncle Jay, wolfed out and ready to go, huffed and rolled his canine eyes.</p><p>I led Clay to a little clearing behind the clinic, with Samson and Alicia trailing on our heels. The farther we got away from Main Street, the more Clay\u2019s shoulders seemed to sag. By the time we reached our destination, he looked liked a haggard old man.</p><p>\u201cOK, this is just us here, and when we leave, no one\u2019s going to know what was said, right Samson?\u201d Samson was busy giving Alicia moon eyes. \u201cSamson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>I looked across the clearing to see Alicia giving him the same stupid look. I rolled my eyes. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we go any further, I have to ask, did you hurt Billie?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not just talking about at the end. Did you ever lay a hand on my aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have hurt Billie,\u201d Alicia insisted, her eyes welling up with unexpected tears. \u201cWe actually liked the old lady, no matter how many butter knives she threw at me. She reminded us of our own aunties. And she had these moments, I think, when she knew we weren\u2019t who we said we were, but she knew that we were taking care of her. I always thought of those as her good days.\u201d</p><p>Clay shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a lot of things, but I wouldn\u2019t hurt a defenseless old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened the day she died?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Alicia wrung her hands a little bit, looking more at Samson than at me. \u201cWhen I left, she was napping, I just wanted to take the kids out for a breath of fresh air. I just wanted to get out of the house for a few minutes. I wasn\u2019t even gone that long, just long enough for Paul to need a fresh pull-up. I came back, and you were there, and she was dead.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Samson, who seemed relieved. And although I didn\u2019t quite trust his skewed judgment on the subject, I found I believed her. Why would they lie at this point? They didn\u2019t have much to lose. If anything, Clay would have used killing Billie to provoke me into a fight when he was outed.</p><p>\u201cOK, and I want honesty here, what about the brakes on my truck? Or the break-in at my office? Or me getting my head bagged that day we went for a run together? Or Samson getting shot?\u201d</p><p>Alicia shook her head. \u201cHonestly, no. We were just as surprised by all that as you were. The sneakiest thing we did was tell our packmates where the video cameras were planted, so they could sniff around without being seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came here to watch you, to try to find a way in,\u201d Clay said. \u201cThat was all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering your dad tried to kill my whole family, I have a hard time believing that.\u201d</p><p>He shot back, \u201cWell, your brother did kill my entire family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was provoked!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve considered that?\u201d Clay yelled back. He took a steadying breath. Several inquiring howls drifted up from the valley. \u201cLook, I see my Dad\u2019s mistakes. What he did was wrong. But he was still my dad. Do you know what happened after your precious brother killed my father? We\u2019d been drifting around for months, nomads, before Dad finally decided to make a move on your valley. There were only three old women left to take care of us. Our parents were supposed to come back, take us to our new home. We went to bed, feeling like it was Christmas Eve. When we woke up, everything was going to be different. No more sleeping in the woods. No more bathing at campgrounds, when we were lucky. No more shifting around without a home. And it was different, all right. We woke up, and my aunt Sarah was crying. She didn\u2019t know what had happened. She and Aunt Linda waited and waited for my parents, for the other adults to come back. But they never did. I was too young to join the fight but old enough to know that we\u2019d been screwed out of what was ours. That my mom and dad were dead, and I couldn\u2019t let that go unpunished. Aunt Linda tried to convince me that it was time to forget, to move on. When she died, I found letters from my dad to Eli, plans for the new pack they were setting up.</p><p>\u201cSo I contacted our good friend Eli. I told him I was going to blow his whole \u2018man of the people\u2019 thing wide open. I wanted to meet him, but he kept putting me off, said he had an ailing mother to care for. It made it hard for him to find time. Your brother killed him off before we could meet up, so he wasn\u2019t of much use. But thanks to his letters, it was easy to tell you some nice story about being Billie\u2019s long-lost relatives. You were so willing to let us step in, to let us take care of Billie. It was disappointing, really. I thought you\u2019d put up more of a fight. I thought you\u2019d be less trusting. But we moved right in. Hell, you practically rolled out a red carpet. And we stayed, and we stayed, and hell, I even started to like it here a little bit. And the whole time, I kept going back to my pack and telling them to be patient; just a little longer, and we\u2019ll have the home we always deserved. And then Billie died, and it all went to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did you come back now?\u201d I asked him, scanning his pack. \u201cYou knew how many of us would be here. Why would you come back, knowing that we could destroy you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clay threaded a handed through his hair, leaving it disheveled. He looked tired and scared and much younger than he was. \u201cI\u2019d spent so much time talking it up, I couldn\u2019t not bring them here. I already have a couple of cousins who think that I shouldn\u2019t be alpha, considering the fuck-up my Dad made of the position. If I backed out, I would lose any authority I had. There was no way out of it. And now I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t go back to them now and tell them that the story we\u2019ve been surviving on for years was a load of crap. That we\u2019re not even going to try to fight for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to fight. You could have a home here.\u201d</p><p>Clay stared at me as if I\u2019d grown a second head. He scoffed. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re just going to let us waltz in and join you? Sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe would. Don\u2019t make the same mistake Jonas made, Clay. Take the offer,\u201d Samson said, his gaze never leaving Alicia.</p><p>Clay\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper offered Jonas a place in the valley. He offered your pack a home, and Jonas refused,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Samson insisted. \u201cAnd you can ask any member of the pack who was there. Cooper only acted when Jonas threatened to kill Maggie right in front of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe threatened to kill you as leverage?\u201d Clay\u2019s face paled. \u201cBut you were just a kid, just a few years older than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been desperate, to do something like that,\u201d Alicia said, her lip trembling. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have accepted an offer to share, Clay. You know that. He was a proud man, too proud. He wouldn\u2019t have accepted help. He wouldn\u2019t have accepted letting his packmates see him as weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to let my packmates see me as weak?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying maybe we should think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a way out of this, Clay,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can avoid another bloody scene if you would just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you would trust me enough to let us live here,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou\u2019d watch me like a hawk every minute. No pack can work with two alphas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d kick your ass at the first sign of you trying to take over, true. But who says it couldn\u2019t work? Most packs have an alpha couple. We\u2019ll still have an alpha male and an alpha female. We just won\u2019t be, you know, together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop giving me reasons why this wouldn\u2019t work!\u201d I cried. \u201cThe way we live is changing; we have to change with it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the ideal situation or that there\u2019s not going to be a lot of resentment and hurt feelings we\u2019re going to have to get over, but what other choice do you have? Both packs need fresh genes. You need a place to call home. We can make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to explain this to them?\u201d Clay said, nodding toward the packs.</p><p>\u201cIt will be our first official joint alpha duty,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Clay gnawed on his lip and looked at my outstretched hand as if it was a coiled snake.</p><p>\u201cClay, stop being an ass and say yes, already,\u201d Alicia said, giving Samson a long, meaningful look.</p><p>\u201cPlease, make the better choice,\u201d I said. \u201cBe a better leader, a better man, than our predecessors.\u201d</p> <p>Clay huffed a breath and put his hand in mine. \u201cOn a trial basis. That\u2019s all I\u2019m willing to promise.\u201d</p><p>All of the tension drained from my body as if a plug had been pulled. I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask. It\u2019s going to take some work, but we can do this, Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we at least tell my pack that I beat you bloody and then we arrived at a compromise?\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>The Monkey Man Swingeth</p><p>I WALKED INTO NICK\u2019S KITCHEN, exhausted and drained by yet another conversation with Clay about how we could merge the two packs. I closed my eyes and took a moment to appreciate the blessed silence of the house.</p><p>It took a while to sort out the whole \u201csorry my brother killed your dad\u201d mess, but I felt I could trust Clay. He wasn\u2019t a terribly aggressive guy. He didn\u2019t want attention or recognition. He just wanted what was best for everybody in his family, which I considered the mark of a good leader. Being able to respect him made working with him a lot easier.</p><p>It might have been more awkward if Cooper was still living in the valley. Cooper and Clay were cutting each other a pretty wide berth. As open-minded as Clay seemed, I doubted that patricide was a basis for the two of them to be BFFs. We were fortunate that so little time had passed. Blood feuds could take generations to take root in a pack. With so few of our kind remaining, we couldn\u2019t afford that sort of pride and vengeance. Clay understood that, where Jonas had not.</p><p>As happy as I was that we were working toward tentative peace, I still had a pit of nagging worry that would surface when I least expected it. Something felt unsettled. To help build the trust between us, Clay had accounted for every member of his pack and their whereabouts surrounding the dates when my truck crashed, my office was trashed, Samson was shot, and Billie died. Dr. Moder had ruled the death accidental on Billie\u2019s death certificate, but she couldn\u2019t make a determination one way or the other. It\u2019s not as if we could send the remains to a medical examiner.</p><p>The loose threads were still worrying me. I was missing something, and I hated that. But between the chaos of discovering who Clay and Alicia were and trying to keep our two packs from brawling, I was too exhausted to try to figure it out. I needed quiet. And a house that sheltered fewer than a dozen people. Samson had agreed to keep an eye on things for me long enough for a surprise visit to Nick\u2019s place.</p><p>Nick was in the final phases of packing up to make room for the next renter. There were boxes strewn all over the living room. The wires for Nick\u2019s DVD player were hanging forlornly from the entertainment center. Several taped cartons near the door were marked \u201cBooks that should not be thrown away upon penalty of junk-punching.\u201d</p><p>I sincerely hoped Samson was the one who wrote that.</p><p>I shut the door, closed my eyes, and reveled in being able to hear myself think.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I called when I was centered, stripping out of my jacket. \u201cYou would not believe my day. I was actually glad to get away from the valley for a while.\u201d</p><p>I kicked off my boots, which were caked with mud from the recent thaw. \u201cMo would probably say that\u2019s a sign of personal growth or some shit. But I think it just proves how sexy you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>The silence of the house hit me full-force. The rooms were empty. It wasn\u2019t just that Nick wasn\u2019t responding. He wasn\u2019t there. I couldn\u2019t hear him breathing. I smelled blood, just the faintest trace of it. It was Billie all over again.</p><p>I looked back at the kitchen door, which had been unlocked. The front door was unlocked, too. There were no signs of a struggle, no forks and knives thrown on the floor, no torn pillows. I stumbled into the living room, the bedroom, terrified of what I might find. \u201cNick!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>I forced myself to still, to focus on deep breaths, to pull the scents around me into my head and process. Some instinct was pulling me outside, toward the mountains behind the house. I ran out, following the faint scent of blood, trying to gauge how fresh it was, how much there was.</p><p>When the trail disappeared into the woods, I phased without bothering with my clothes, leaving a cloud of scraps in my wake. He\u2019d been dragged. I could see the gouges his feet had made in the softening dirt. But who was doing the dragging? There was no other scent, just . . . dryer sheets.</p><p>For years to come, the smell of April Fresh was going to make me gag.</p><p>I followed the trail up the north face of the ridge, toward the outcropping of rocks that overlooked the town. Nick had talked about rappelling there a few times but had never made the trip.</p><p>Please, please, please, I begged. I can\u2019t lose him now. Not now. Please.</p><p>The scent was getting stronger, the higher I climbed the trail. And the trees were getting thinner, meaning that I was getting closer and closer to the rock face. I could hear Nick\u2019s heartbeat, strong and steady, through the trees.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t scared. This was a good thing. Nick was calm. And if he was calm, the situation might not be as bad as I thought.</p><p>I burst through the tree line to see Nick lying on the muddy ground. He wasn\u2019t calm; he was unconscious.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I yelled as I phased to my feet. \u201cLee, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Lee had dropped Nick\u2019s limp body dangerously close to the edge of the cliff. He had a rappelling harness strapped on Nick\u2019s body. The harness was tethered to a tree a few feet away. Lee was rubbing the belay rope back and forth over a sharp rock, fraying it, so that when he tossed Nick over the side, the stress on the damaged fiber would snap.</p><p>\u201cIt has to look like a climbing accident,\u201d Lee told me, his tone like that of someone explaining how to tie a fishing lure. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody connecting his death with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLee, just step away from Nick,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice calm. Cautiously, I stepped toward Nick, but Lee\u2019s head snapped up. I froze.</p><p>Even in my gut-churning panic over Nick\u2019s proximity to the cliff, I couldn\u2019t process what Lee was doing. Why? He\u2019d always seemed so puffed up and harmless. I hadn\u2019t seen. I didn\u2019t want to see. How could someone betray me like this again? It almost hurt worse than Eli\u2019s betrayal, because it was so random and needless.</p><p>Lee looked up at me, confused, and frowned. \u201cThis has to stop, Maggie. I\u2019m going to help you tidy this one last mess up, but then I expect you to clean up your act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Lee?\u201d I tried stepping closer, my palms upraised in a submissive gesture, but he stepped in front of Nick, cutting me off. He was so close to the edge. All it would take was the slightest push or movement, and he\u2019d plummet off the rocks. I whimpered a little, shaking away the image of Nick\u2019s body broken on the ground. I had to focus on Lee, make him move away, use some sign of dominance to remind him who the fuck he was dealing with.</p><p>But at the moment, my hands were shaking so badly I didn\u2019t feel like Maggie Fucking Graham. I felt like throwing up.</p><p>\u201cOverall, I think I\u2019ve been pretty understanding about your little quirks,\u201d Lee said, snapping me back to reality. \u201cBut really, a human?\u201d His face flushed, darkened; his eyes narrowed. \u201cDid you think I was going to sit by and let you humiliate me like that? Do you know what it was like for me, when members started whispering and snickering about my girl\u2014my future mate\u2014carrying on with a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLee\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying my name like that!\u201d Lee hissed. \u201cLike I\u2019m crazy! Like you\u2019re trying to talk me down from a ledge. You don\u2019t even know what I\u2019ve done for you. You never appreciate how hard I\u2019ve tried. You never see me. It\u2019s always about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust explain it to me,\u201d I said. \u201cBaby, please, I\u2019m sorry. Just explain what I did, and I\u2019ll apologize.\u201d My voice shook as I called him \u201cbaby,\u201d probably because it made me gag. But it seemed to calm him, to make him a preen a little, as if this was how he wanted the conversation to go. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never turned to me,\u201d Lee said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, stepping back, leading him away from the cliff.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to turn to me!\u201d Lee yelled, pounding his chest with his fist. \u201cI thought that if you could get off your damn high horse long enough to ask me for help, we might finally connect. But you always ran to Cooper or Samson. You never had time for me. And I thought maybe if Samson wasn\u2019t there, in the way . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take a shot at Samson?\u201d I asked. He nodded. I groaned. \u201cAnd the brakes on my truck?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought if I came along and helped you, it would be a good ice breaker. But the lines failed before I expected them to. I was waiting at the halfway point, waiting for you to pass by so I could follow. But you never showed. I doubled back, and I found your truck. I found you with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned on Nick. \u201cWhat else?\u201d I barked, demanding his attention. His head swung toward me, his eyes sharp and indignant. I softened my voice. \u201cWhat else don\u2019t I know about? I just\u2014I need to know what I owe you, Lee. Please. I just want to make it up to you. Every single thing you did. I owe you. Did you set fire to my office?\u201d</p><p>He sneered, nudging Nick hard with his foot. \u201cYeah, I thought it would be a good chance for us to spend time together. I called you up, offered my pack as backup for patrols. I wanted to show you how helpful I could be, how considerate. I made sure I was partnered up with you. But no, you took off, the first chance you got. You ran to him! I followed your scent to his house. I saw the two of you on his couch\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I stepped closer, and Lee tensed. I moved sideways, drawing Lee a step away from Nick. I forced the corners of my mouth up. \u201cWhat about the cliff ? Please explain to me what you were trying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show you how much you needed me. I figured I\u2019d scare you, show you how easily you could get hurt. I\u2019d rough you up a little and pretend to chase off the guy who was hurting you. That\u2019s why I put the bag over your head. To keep you from seeing me. And then he came running after you and ruined everything again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rubbed yourself with dryer sheets to try to cover up your scent, right?\u201d I interjected as he turned his gaze on Nick. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t recognize it? That was pretty smart. Tell me how you came up with that idea.\u201d</p><p>Lee must have picked up on the undercurrent of tension in my voice, because he shook his head and returned his attention to the rope. \u201cNo. You\u2019re just trying to find something wrong with me. Like you always do, you\u2019re trying to find some reason not to be with me. You drive me crazy, don\u2019t you see that? If you\u2019d just settled down with me, I wouldn\u2019t have done all these crazy things. I never would hurt Samson or you or Billie\u2014\u201d He bit down on the last word, as if he could keep it from escaping.</p><p>My mouth wouldn\u2019t seem to work right. \u201cBillie?\u201d tumbled from my lips in a mangled gasp.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d Lee cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. Uncle Frank told me how you thought so much of Clay, like you were ready to make him your second. I went into the house to try to get some dirt on him, something to get you to stay away from him. Billie came downstairs and freaked out. She said I didn\u2019t belong in her house, and she came after me with a kitchen knife! The crazy old bat almost nicked me. I pushed her back, and she fell and hit her head on the counter. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a sick old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault!\u201d Lee yelled. He glared at Nick. \u201cNone of this would have happened if he\u2019d just stayed away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried, putting myself between them. Lee grabbed at my arms, shaking me. \u201cThis is my fault, not Nick\u2019s. Don\u2019t punish him for something I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault. You messed everything up,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate, mine! I\u2019m supposed to be the one who helps you lead. I\u2019m supposed to be the one you have babies with. This is all your fault!\u201d</p><p>I shoved Lee away, putting some ground between him and Nick. \u201cAccording to who? When have I ever even implied I feel anything for you?\u201d</p> <p>The sudden change in attitude seemed to shock him. He sneered. \u201cYou think you\u2019re too good for me? You let him touch you. You\u2019d be lucky to have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just let him touch me,\u201d I said, licking my lips. \u201cHe had every little piece of me. I chose him. I mated with him. I could be carrying his pup for all you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou selfish whore!\u201d</p><p>He phased on the fly and leaped at me. I jumped, blocking his body from colliding with Nick.</p><p>I thought of all the times I let my own fears, my stupid insecurities, my dumb-ass pride push me away from the only person I\u2019d truly loved. And I pushed back. I pushed and I shoved, digging my paws into the dirt, scrambling for purchase.</p><p>Lee huffed, battering his head against my flank, trying to throw me off balance. He seemed to give up, turning on his heel and cowering away into the trees. I didn\u2019t drop my guard. I\u2019d seen Lee do this any number of times when he was roughhousing with my brothers. He\u2019d act hurt or submissive and pretend to slink away, only to turn and suckerpunch his opponent. I braced myself for his coming strike.</p><p>He didn\u2019t disappoint, turning suddenly and lunging, springing at me full-force. I pushed up, phasing to my feet and shoving my hands against Lee\u2019s belly. I pivoted, throwing his weight over my shoulder. He yelped as his rear paws slid over the edge of the cliff, his front paws scrabbling over the dirt, catching Nick\u2019s legs. He dug, trying to pull himself up, but all he was doing was dragging Nick over with him. I grabbed Nick\u2019s arms, digging my heels into the ground. Between Lee\u2019s weight and Nick\u2019s, I could hardly hold them. Seeing that I held on to Nick, Lee bit down on the leg of Nick\u2019s jeans. His eyes were defiant, daring me to let him die, knowing that it would mean losing Nick, too.</p><p>I snarled at him, grunting as I threaded my arms under Nick\u2019s and yanked with all my strength. I\u2019d managed to pull Nick\u2019s knees up onto solid ground when I heard the sound of fabric tearing. Lee\u2019s wolfen eyes widened as the waistband separated from the pockets of Nick\u2019s jeans, and the denim lifeline he was counting on started sliding down Nick\u2019s leg. Lee scratched and scrambled, but he was fighting a losing battle with gravity. His paws were still frantically clawing for a grip as he slipped over the rock face. He howled as his body hurtled toward the ground. I shuddered when the howl abruptly ended.</p> <p>I gave in to the need to relax my arms for just a second, to ease the screaming muscles. It took that brief instant to realize what a huge mistake it was, as Nick\u2019s weight shifted, and his legs slipped over the edge. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d I grunted, desperately scrabbling my left hand over the dirt to grip the end of the fraying climbing rope. As the dead weight of Nick\u2019s torso pulled him away from me, I wound the rope around his wrist.</p><p>The rope slipped through my hand, burning and biting into the flesh of my palms as Nick free-fell. The elastic rope stretched under Nick\u2019s weight as he dropped. The loop closed around Nick\u2019s wrist and held him suspended as he flopped against the rock face. \u201cOw!\u201d I heard him yelp. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick!\u201d I yelled, leaning over the edge. The loose knot Lee had tied around the tree slipped open and let Nick drop again. He was now a good fifteen feet below me, hanging over the open maw of the mountain.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d I shrieked as the looped cord tightened around my hands again, tearing my skin. The bleeding wounds on my palms made the rope slippery. I couldn\u2019t keep a good grip on Nick\u2019s lifeline.</p><p>He squinted up at me, confused, angry . . . well, mostly confused. \u201cMaggie, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to calm down, OK?\u201d I shouted. \u201cThat rope is frayed, and I don\u2019t think I can hold you. I need you to find a good grip and climb up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing what?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cYour monkey-man skills!\u201d I yelled. \u201cJust shut up and climb, damn it! I\u2019m losing my grip!\u201d</p><p>I felt the tension on the rope slack slowly. I peered over the edge to see Nick curling his fingers around a rough knob of rock. He let go of the rope entirely, digging his fingers into a divot. He found a foothold and pulled up. His eyes locked with mine as his hand stretched toward another hold. His grip faltered, and his right hand slipped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me! Look at the rocks! If you fall to your death because you were being all moony and sentimental, I\u2019m going to kick your ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be a bit of a moot point, since I\u2019ll be dead!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, he focused on finding the right place, the right hold. Again and again, until he was within an arm\u2019s reach. I tucked my arms under his shoulders, yanking him up as his legs gave one last push.</p><p>I buried my face in Nick\u2019s neck as he landed on top of me. He huffed, \u201cHow do you find time to yell at me, even when I\u2019m dangling over my certain death?\u201d</p><p>I clutched his face in my hands, looking him over for signs of permanent damage. I kissed his cheeks, his nose, his mouth, and clutched him close to the point where he had difficulty breathing.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t just inadvertently killed a distant cousin, I would have found Nick\u2019s nearly bare ass and lost boots sort of funny. He\u2019d been pantsed by a falling werewolf.</p><p>OK, that was sort of funny.</p><p>I started giggling, recognizing even as the laughter bubbled from my lips that it was a hysterical response. But damn it, I\u2019d nearly lost my fianc\u00e9 to a secret stalker, whom I\u2019d been too blind to recognize, and the only thing that had saved said fianc\u00e9 was really old jeans and his ability to channel Spider-Man.</p><p>Nick groaned.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d I sniffed, pushing his bloodied hair away from the gash in his forehead.</p><p>He looked down and saw the frayed belt loops ringing his waist, belt buckle still intact. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing any pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, laughing as tears streamed down my cheeks, splattering onto his face.</p><p>He winced as he tried to sit up. He thought better of it and lay back down. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. So much. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you, loving you and doing stupid, girlie romantic crap until the day I die.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, patting my head. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, pressing my lips to his forehead.</p><p>He closed his eyes and rested his chin on top of my head. \u201cSo . . . what happened to my pants?\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Going to the Chapel, \u2019Cause I\u2019m Obviously Crazy</p><p>I HAD TO LOVE THIS guy.</p><p>Otherwise, I would not be standing here in this stupid clearing, wearing this stupid, foofy white dress, waiting for my brother to walk me down a makeshift aisle.</p><p>There was a light dusting of snow on the ground, which Mo assured me gave everything a sort of \u201cfairy-tale quality.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest. I didn\u2019t care much. I just wanted to be married.</p><p>I walked down the aisle. Clay, who was standing awfully close to Teresa, waggled his eyebrows at me. I waggled mine right back.</p><p>Clay and I were a lot more comfortable as co-pack leaders than we ever were dating. And it was a damn good thing, because between the online college classes I was taking and the honeymoon Nick had planned, I was going to need him to keep an eye on things for a while. I\u2019d never been farther than Seattle, and now I was going on a honeymoon. I had no idea where we were going. All Nick would tell me was that we would start with a ferry ride to Bellingham.</p><p>A few of Clay\u2019s younger packmates snickered at my Cinderella getup, earning them a smack on the back of their heads from Alicia. I winked at her. Blending the two packs hadn\u2019t been easy. For one thing, we didn\u2019t have room for everybody. We had to bring in a bunch of trailers for temporary housing, which were hideously expensive thanks to the difficulty involved in moving them to the middle of nowhere. Thank you very much, fianc\u00e9 with unlimited financial resources.</p><p>Nick was also paying a huge crew of construction workers secret double overtime to finish the dozen or so new houses we needed for the new-arrival families. And then, of course, there was the jealousy over the newbies getting brand-new houses while some of our people had been living in the same cramped places for more than forty years. So when the crew wasn\u2019t completing new construction, they were doing renovations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick said he didn\u2019t mind footing the bill, that the money was going to make us a lot happier than it could make him alone. And since we were getting married, it was going to be half mine anyway. Besides, he said, it wasn\u2019t as if he was getting nothing out of the deal. With the presentation of the newly bound pack history to Pops, my grandfather had finally, grudgingly accepted Nick as my mate. And he\u2019d agreed to share as much of the area\u2019s folklore as he could remember. Nick\u2019s entire career could be spent in the valley, taking down the folk tales and lore as told by my grandfather and publishing them as just that, folklore and wild tales.</p><p>While the big issues of housing, hunting, and pack structure were sort of easy to work out, it was the little things that caught us off guard, like what to serve at the village\u2019s Christmas dinner (ham versus turkey) or whether to watch the American Hockey League or the NHL on the community center TV. There were a few false starts and more than one dispute that ended in the two packs fighting it out in the middle of Main Street. But fortunately, the newcomers were younger and looking for the kind of guidance from the elder generation that they\u2019d been lacking for so long. They tended to revere and dote on the older members of the pack, which was kind of nice.</p><p>Alicia and Clay were going to move out of Billie\u2019s place, but by the time they\u2019d decided to pack up, it just made more sense for them to stay there. Plus, it seemed that Alicia and Samson might be heading up the aisle themselves pretty soon. And Teresa and Clay had already declared their mating. They were just nice enough to wait another month to have their own ceremony. We were all about compromise.</p> <p>Still, I didn\u2019t want to test Alicia\u2019s patience or generosity of spirit by making her a bridesmaid. Instead, I inflicted that on Mo and Kara . . . because it amused me to see them in matching baby-pink dresses with huge bows on their asses.</p><p>I stumbled a little over my hem, snapping me out of my musings and back to the present as Cooper caught my elbow and subtly righted me. Even though Mo and Mom had let me keep the dress pretty simple, I was having a hard time maneuvering in the full-length skirt. I had, however, let Mo strap me into some of that fancy miracle lingerie she loved so much, because I wanted to see Nick\u2019s eyelids flap like window shades later. I only hoped that shimmery lip goop Kara had smeared on me an hour before would last long enough to make Nick\u2019s face all sparkly for the photos. I had to find the bright spots somewhere.</p><p>Nick had been worried about the ceremony. His buddy Dane, the best man, had posted our engagement announcement on the video game\u2019s Web site. I assumed it was to prove to the fan boys that one could have both games and a sex life. The announcement got a lot of traction on the Internet. Nick was convinced that his mom would show up to cause trouble. He, Cooper, and Clay were discussing increasing security around the valley for the wedding, until I pulled him aside and asked, \u201cHave I ever mentioned that we have very, very distant cousins in Kentucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we do. And I asked them to drop by and visit your mother in Nashville. Just to talk to her, convince her that the loving, selfless thing to do would be to stop harassing you and let you move on with your life. I just wanted her to know that you\u2019re part of a family now and have people watching out for you. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be calling again anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>Other than subtly threatening my future mother-in-law, I was far more interested in planning our life after the wedding than in the actual wedding, which, according to the one bridal Web site I was willing to admit to looking at, was a good sign. I was enrolling in a few online classes at U of Alaska Anchorage. I hadn\u2019t mentioned it to Nick yet, but I was sure he\u2019d be thrilled and would probably help me if I had any problems. I foresaw a lot of study sessions that ended up with us being naked.</p><p>And then, of course, Mom found my brochures, which I\u2019d stashed under my mattress like dirty magazines. When I confessed my interest in taking a few classes, she burst into tears. I immediately said that I was just holding the brochures for a friend. Then Mom sniffled and said she was so proud, which I have to admit was a new thing for me. I swore her to secrecy, because given the level of crap I gave Cooper over wanting me to go to college, I didn\u2019t think I could live through the epic \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making me do this,\u201d I whispered after Cooper had handed me off to Nick. \u201cWe could have gone to Vegas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I was probably the only bride to scowl at her husband while being led to the altar. (Well, the only non-mail-order bride, at least.) But when Nick turned with me toward Pops, who oversaw the vows as the oldest member of the pack, I was grinning like a big, happy idiot.</p><p>I tried to think of some other words to describe my state. But big, happy, and idiot seemed to sum it right up. I would probably learn fancier words when I started those college classes. Nick clasped my hand in his, and I mentally calculated exactly how many hours stood between us and boarding the ferry to Washington. Nick was finally going to visit my happy place, in the less sexual sense of the word.</p> <p>Surely, normal brides did not have these thoughts as their grandfathers/officiants began reciting the wedding vows.</p><p>I grinned up at Nick, and he winked at me. We turned toward Pops with joined hands. I was going to see the world, a little bit at a time. But for right now, I was where I was needed, and loved. </p> </body></html>"]
