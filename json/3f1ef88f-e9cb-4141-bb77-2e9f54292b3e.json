Covering my mouth to muffle my hacking cough, I turned away from the warm breath against my ear. I had shown up here tonight for one reason: to see Preston Drake. Wasn\u2019t it just my luck that when he finally decided to notice I\u2019m alive, I started coughing up a freaking lung?</p><p>Preston\u2019s amused chuckle as he patted my back didn\u2019t help my humiliation any. \u201cSorry, Manda, I didn\u2019t know my presence would get you all choked up.\u201d</p><p>Once I was able to speak again, I turned around to face the guy who had been making a grand appearance in my late-night fantasies for a couple of years now. All the primping I\u2019d suffered through so that I looked irresistible tonight was pointless. Preston was grinning at me like he always did. I amused him. He didn\u2019t see me as anything more than the innocent little sister of his best friend, Marcus Hardy. It was clich\u00e9. How many bad romance novels had I read about the girl falling hopelessly in love with her brother\u2019s best friend? Countless.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me.\u201d I wanted to explain my sudden burst of coughing.</p><p>Preston tipped a bottle of beer to his lips and took a drink while keeping his eyes cut toward me. \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t my sexy-as-hell voice whispering in your ear that caused your momentary lack of oxygen?\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was probably it. But the guy knew he was beautiful. I wasn\u2019t going to add to his ego. Crossing my arms over my stomach, I struck a defensive pose. I never knew how to talk to Preston or what to say to him. I was so afraid he\u2019d look me in the eye and know that I closed my eyes at night and imagined doing very bad things to his body.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Manda,\u201d he said in a low, husky voice as his eyes lowered to my breasts. I\u2019d worn a low-cut white blouse tonight, and a really good push-up bra, in hopes of at least getting Preston to see that my body was all grown up. Besides, I knew he had a thing for boobs. It was obvious by the girls he dated. . . . Well, he didn\u2019t really date. He just screwed them. My boobs were not big, but a good push-up bra and the right position and they weren\u2019t too bad.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real nice shirt you got on.\u201d</p><p>He was really looking at me. Or at them\u2014but they were a part of me, so it was the same thing. \u201cThank you,\u201d I replied in a normal voice that betrayed the fact I was breathing a little faster now.</p><p>Preston took another step toward me, closing the small area that had separated us. His eyes were still directed at the cleavage I had pushing up in full view. \u201cMaybe wearing a shirt like that ain\u2019t real smart, Manda.\u201d His deep voice caused me to shiver. \u201cAw hell, girl, don\u2019t do that. No shivering.\u201d</p><p>One large hand touched my waist. His thumb brushed against my stomach and gently pushed the hem of my shirt up. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 since four, sweetheart. You need to push me away and send me packing, \u2019cause I don\u2019t think I can stop this on my own.\u201d</p><p>Small whimper. Oh, yes. Should I start begging now?</p><p>Preston lifted his eyes to meet mine. His long, pale blond hair that girls everywhere wanted to get their hands in fell forward over one of his eyes. I couldn\u2019t help it. I reached up and tucked the loose strands behind his ear. He closed his eyes and made a small, pleased sound in his throat.</p><p>\u201cManda, you\u2019re real sweet. Real fucking sweet, and I\u2019m not the kind of guy you\u2019re supposed to let get this close.\u201d His voice was almost a whisper now as his eyes bore into mine. I could see the slight glassy look that confirmed he\u2019d had too much to drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl. I can decide who I let get close,\u201d I replied, shifting my hips so that he had a better view directly down my shirt if he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, see, this is where I think you might be wrong, \u2019cause untouched little bodies like yours, all fresh and sweet, shouldn\u2019t tempt guys who are only looking for another hot fuck.\u201d</p><p>Something about hearing Preston Drake say \u201cfuck\u201d out of those full, pink lips of his was a major turn-on. He was too pretty. He always had been. His lashes too long, his face too sculpted and you add that in with his lips and hair, you get one lethal package.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not as untouched as you think,\u201d I said, hoping he didn\u2019t detect the lie. I wanted to be one of those bad girls he didn\u2019t mind taking in a back room up against a wall.</p><p>Preston lowered his mouth to barely graze the skin on my shoulder that was revealed by the shirt I\u2019d chosen. \u201cYou telling me that this sweetness has been played with?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cCome take a ride with me,\u201d he asked close to my ear as his teeth pulled gently on my earlobe.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Preston moved back and nodded toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>That probably wasn\u2019t such a good idea. If Rock, Dewayne, or any other of my brother\u2019s friends saw us leaving together, they\u2019d stop anything from happening. And I wanted something to happen. Alone time under the covers thinking about Preston Drake was getting old. I wanted the actual man. I wonder why Preston hadn\u2019t thought about our exit. Did he want the guys to stop us? I glanced over at their usual table, and Rock wasn\u2019t paying us any attention. Dewayne winked at me, then went back to talking to some girl.</p><p>I looked back at the bartender. \u201cI have to pay my tab first.\u201d</p><p>Preston nudged me toward the door. \u201cI got your tab. You go get in my Jeep.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Yes. I wanted to go get in his Jeep. This would also have us leaving separately. Nodding, I hurried for the door, thinking I may have just won the lottery.</p><p>Glancing around the parking lot, I searched for Preston\u2019s Jeep. When I didn\u2019t see it out front, I headed for the back of the building to see if he\u2019d parked back there. Most people didn\u2019t because there were no lights around.</p><p>Stepping into the darkness, I wondered if this was smart. A girl really shouldn\u2019t be out here by herself at night. Maybe I should just go back to the part of the parking lot were it was well lit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you back out on me now. I\u2019m already going half mad thinking about this.\u201d Preston\u2019s hands came around my waist and pulled me tightly up against his chest. Both of his hands slid up and covered my boobs, squeezing them, then tugging on my top until it was low enough that he could feel the exposed skin of my cleavage.</p><p>\u201cSweet God Almighty, real ones feel so damn good,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take a deep breath. Preston\u2019s hands were touching me. I wanted him to touch more. Reaching up, I undid the buttons on my shirt and let it fall open. I found the front clasp of my bra and quickly unfastened it before I could back out. We were in the middle of a very dark parking lot, and I was being a complete slut.</p><p>\u201cDamn, baby. Get your ass in my Jeep,\u201d Preston growled as he pushed me forward a few more steps, then turned me left by directing my hips. His Jeep appeared in front of us. I was pretty sure we couldn\u2019t do this in a Jeep.</p><p>\u201cCan we, uh, do this in here?\u201d I asked as he turned me around to face him. Even in the dark his light hair stood out. His eyelids were lowered, and those long lashes of his almost brushed his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDo what, baby? What is it you wanna do? \u2019Cause showing me these pretty titties has me going a little crazy.\u201d He pressed me back up against his Jeep as he lowered his head and pulled one of my nipples into his mouth and sucked hard before flicking it with his tongue.</p><p>No one had ever kissed my boobs. The immediate explosion that went off in my panties as I cried his name hadn\u2019t been on purpose. My head was pressed back on the Jeep window, and my knees had completely given out. Preston\u2019s hands holding firmly to my waist had kept me from ending up a heap on the gravel.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Preston growled, and I started to apologize when his hands cupped my butt and he picked me up. I grabbed his shoulders and wrapped my legs around his waist, afraid he would drop me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked as he stalked deeper into the parking lot. Had I made him mad?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting your sexy ass back here so I can strip off your clothes and bury my dick into that tight little pussy. You can\u2019t go do shit like that, Manda, and expect a guy to control himself. It don\u2019t fucking work that way, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>He was going to \u201cfuck\u201d me. Finally. Not exactly what I wanted him to refer to it as when we finally did it, but Preston wasn\u2019t one for roses and candlelight. He was all about the pleasure. I knew that already.</p><p>Preston reached out and opened a door behind me. We stepped into a dark and slightly chilly room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked as he sat me down on a box.</p><p>\u201cOutside storage unit. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve used it before.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d used it before? Oh.</p><p>I could hardly see him, but I knew from the shadow of his movements that he was taking off his clothes. First his shirt. I wanted to see his chest. I\u2019d heard from girls giggling about it around town that he had one of the tightest, most ripped stomachs they\u2019d ever seen. Rumor was, even Mrs. Gunner, the wife of one of the city council members, had slept with Preston. I didn\u2019t believe that, though. He was just too pretty to have sex with someone her age. I heard a crinkle and started to ask what he was doing when it dawned on me\u2014he\u2019d opened a condom wrapper.</p><p>His hands started running up the insides of my legs, and I didn\u2019t care so much about Mrs. Gunner or the other rumors I\u2019d heard about his sex life.</p><p>\u201cOpen up.\u201d His husky demand got the desired effect. I let my legs fall open. His hand slipped right up to the edge of my panties. With one finger he ran down the center of my warmth. \u201cThese panties are fucking soaked.\u201d The approval in his voice eased any embarrassment I might have felt from a comment like that.</p><p>Both his hands reached up and slipped my panties down until they were at my ankles. Preston knelt down and slipped each of my high heels through the holes. Then he stood up and leaned over me. \u201cI\u2019m keeping these.\u201d</p><p>My panties?</p><p>\u201cLay back,\u201d Preston said as his body came over mine.</p><p>I reached back to make sure that the box was large enough for me to lie all the way back. \u201cYou got plenty of room, Manda. Lay back,\u201d Preston repeated.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him to change his mind or possibly sober up, so I did as I was told. The cardboard was sturdy and full of something firm and heavy, because we didn\u2019t even put a dent in it.</p><p>Preston\u2019s mouth lowered to mine and I prepared myself for our first kiss, when he stopped. His lips hovered over mine only for a second before he moved away and began kissing my neck. What had just happened? Did my breath smell bad? I\u2019d just had a peppermint inside the bar.</p><p>The little licks and nibbles he was making along my collarbone made it hard for me to think too clearly about it.</p><p>Then his hips lowered and both of his hands shoved my skirt up around my waist. I didn\u2019t have too much time to prepare myself before he was pressing against my entrance.</p><p>\u201cTight, fuck, fuck, it\u2019s so tight,\u201d Preston whispered, and his body trembled over me, making the sharp pain between my legs a little more bearable. \u201cI can\u2019t hold back, Manda. Fuck it . . . I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Pain sliced through me, and I screamed and bucked underneath him. He was cursing while saying my name as he slid in and out of me. The pain slowly started to ease, and I felt the first tremor of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAHHH, holy shit,\u201d Preston cried out, and his body jerked over me. I wasn\u2019t sure what exactly had just happened, but from the small moans coming from him, he enjoyed it.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t move anymore and the hard length inside of me began to go away, I realized it was over. Preston pushed himself back away from me and slowly pulled out of me as he muttered more curse words. He moved, and from what I could see, he was putting on his shirt. Already?</p><p>I sat up and pushed my skirt down. The fact that I was on display suddenly mattered. When I heard the zipper on his jeans, I quickly fastened my bra and started buttoning my shirt.</p><p>\u201cManda.\u201d His voice sounded sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to ask him what for, because what we\u2019d just done I\u2019d completely asked for, when he opened the door and walked off into the darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter One</p><p>Three months later . . .</p><p>Preston</p><p>The bottom step was rotten. I needed to put fixing that on my priority list. One of the kids was going to run down them and end up with a twisted ankle\u2014or worse, a broken leg\u2014if I ignored it. Stepping over it, I walked the rest of the way up the steps to my mother\u2019s trailer.</p> <p>It had been a week since I\u2019d stopped by and checked on things. Mom\u2019s latest boyfriend had been drunk, and I\u2019d ended up taking a swing at him when he\u2019d called my seven-year-old sister, Daisy, a chickenshit for spilling her glass of orange juice. I\u2019d busted his lip. Mom had screamed at me and told me to get out. I figured a week was enough time for her to get over it.</p><p>The screen door swung open, and a big gap-toothed smile greeted me.</p><p>\u201cPreston\u2019s here!\u201d Brent, my eight-year-old brother, called out before wrapping his arms around my legs.</p><p>\u201cHey, bud, what\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, unable to return the hug. My arms were full of groceries for the week.</p><p>\u201cHe brought food,\u201d Jimmy, my eleven-year-old brother, announced, and stepped outside and reached for one of the bags I was carrying.</p> <p>\u201cI got these. There\u2019s more in the Jeep. Go get \u2019em, but watch that bottom step. It\u2019s about to go. I gotta fix it.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy nodded and hurried off toward the Jeep.</p><p>\u201cDid you get me dose Fwooty Pebbles I wyke?\u201d Daisy asked as I stepped into the living room. Daisy was developmentally delayed in her speech. I blamed my mother\u2019s lack of caring.</p><p>\u201cYep, Daisy May, I got you two boxes,\u201d I assured her, and walked across the worn, faded blue carpet to set the bags down on the kitchen counter. The place reeked of cigarette smoke and nasty.</p><p>\u201cMomma?\u201d I called out. I knew she was here. The old beat-up Chevelle she drove was in the yard. I wasn\u2019t going to let her avoid me. The rent was due. I needed any other bills that may have come in the mail.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sweepin\u2019,\u201d Daisy said in a whisper.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t keep the scowl off my face. She was always sleeping. If she wasn\u2019t sleeping, she was off drinking.</p><p>\u201cThe dickhead left her yesterday. She\u2019s been holed up pouting ever since,\u201d Jimmy said as he put the other groceries down beside mine.</p><p>Good riddance. The man was a mooch. If it wasn\u2019t for the kids, I\u2019d never show up at this place. But my mom had full custody because in Alabama as long as you have a roof and you aren\u2019t abusing your kids, then you get to keep them. It\u2019s some fucked-up shit.</p><p>\u201cYou bought free gaddons of milk?\u201d Daisy asked in awe as I pulled out all three gallons of milk from a paper bag.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I did. How are you gonna eat two boxes of Fruity Pebbles if you don\u2019t have any milk?\u201d I asked, bending down to look her in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cPweston, I don\u2019t think I can dwink all free,\u201d she said in another whisper. Dang, she was cute.</p><p>I ruffled her brown curls and stood up. \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll have to share with the boys, then.\u201d</p><p>Daisy nodded seriously like she agreed that was a good idea.</p> <p>\u201cYou bought pizza rolls! YES! Score,\u201d Jimmy cheered as he pulled out the large box of his favorite food and ran to the freezer with it.</p><p>Seeing them get excited over food made everything else okay. I\u2019d gone weeks with nothing but white bread and water when I was their age. Momma hadn\u2019t cared if I ate or not. If it hadn\u2019t been for my best friend, Marcus Hardy, sharing his lunch with me every day at school, I\u2019d have probably died from malnutrition. I wasn\u2019t about to let that happen to the kids.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to get out. You caused enough trouble \u2019round here. You run off Randy. He\u2019s gone. Can\u2019t blame him after you broke his nose for nothin\u2019.\u201d Momma was awake.</p><p>I put the last of the cans of ravioli in the cabinet before I turned around to acknowledge her. She was wearing a stained robe that was once white. Now it was more of a tan color. Her hair was a matted, tangled mess, and the mascara she\u2019d been wearing a few days ago was smeared under her eyes. This was the only parent I\u2019d ever known. It was a miracle I\u2019d survived to adulthood.</p><p>\u201cHello, Momma,\u201d I replied, and grabbed a box of cheese crackers to put away.</p><p>\u201cYou bribing them with food. You little shit. They only love you \u2019cause you feed them that fancy stuff. I can feed my own kids. Don\u2019t need you spoilin\u2019 \u2019em,\u201d she grumbled as she shuffled her bare feet over to the closest kitchen chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pay rent before I leave, but I know you have some other bills. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>She reached for the pack of cigarettes sitting in the ashtray in the middle of her small brown Formica table. \u201cThe bills are on top of the fridge. I hid \u2019em from Randy. They made him pissy.\u201d</p><p>Great. The electricity bill and water bill pissed the man off. My mother sure knew how to pick them.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pweston, can I have one of dese now?\u201d Daisy asked, holding up an orange.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Come here and I\u2019ll peel it,\u201d I replied, holding out my hand for her to give it to me.</p><p>\u201cStop babying her. You come in here and baby her, then leave, and I\u2019m left to deal with her spoiled ass. She needs to grow up and do shit herself.\u201d Momma\u2019s bitter words weren\u2019t anything new. However, watching Daisy flinch and her eyes fill up with tears I knew she wouldn\u2019t shed for fear of getting slapped caused my blood to boil.</p><p>I bent down and kissed the top of her head before taking the orange from her and peeling it. Confronting Momma would only make her worse. When I left, it would be up to Jimmy to make sure Daisy was safe. Leaving them here wasn\u2019t easy, but I didn\u2019t have the kind of money it would take to go to court over it. And the lifestyle I\u2019d chosen in order to make sure they were okay and taken care of wasn\u2019t one that the courts would look favorably on. There wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell I\u2019d ever get them. The best I could do was come here once a week and feed them and make sure their bills were paid. I couldn\u2019t be around Momma more than that.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Daisy\u2019s next doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d I asked, wanting to change the subject and find out when I needed to come pick her up and take her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s last week. Why don\u2019t you call the doc yourself and find out, if you\u2019re so damn worried about it. She ain\u2019t sick. She\u2019s just lazy.\u201d</p><p>I finished peeling the orange and grabbed a paper towel, then handed it to Daisy.</p><p>\u201cTank you, Pweston.\u201d</p><p>I knelt down to her level. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Eat that up. It\u2019s good for you. I bet Jimmy will go out on the porch with you if you want.\u201d</p><p>Daisy frowned and leaned forward. \u201cJimmy won\u2019t go outside \u2019cause Becky Ann lives next doowah. He tinks she\u2019s pwetty.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I glanced back at Jimmy, whose cheeks were bright red.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Daisy, why you have to go and tell him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the language with your sister,\u201d I warned, and stood up. \u201cAin\u2019t no reason to be embarrassed \u2019cause you think some girl is good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s in a different one\u2019s panties ever\u2019 night. Just like his daddy was.\u201d Momma loved to make me look bad in front of the kids.</p><p>Jimmy grinned. \u201cI know. I\u2019m gonna be just like Preston when I grow up.\u201d</p><p>I slapped him on the back of the head. \u201cKeep it in your pants, boy.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy laughed and headed for the door. \u201cCome on, Daisy May. I\u2019ll go outside with you for a while.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back at Momma as I finished putting away the food, then retrieved the bills from the top of the fridge. Brent sat silently on the bar stool, watching me. I would have to spend a little time with him before I left. He was the middle one, the one who didn\u2019t push for my attention. I\u2019d sent the other two outside knowing he liked to have me to himself.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s new?\u201d I asked, leaning on the bar across from him.</p><p>He smiled and shrugged. \u201cNothing much. I wanna play football this year, but Momma says it costs too much and I\u2019d be bad at it \u2019cause I\u2019m scrawny.\u201d</p><p>God, she was a bitch.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Well, I disagree. I think you\u2019d make an awesome corner or wide receiver. Why don\u2019t you get me the info on this and I\u2019ll check into it?\u201d</p><p>Brent\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cFor real? \u2019Cause Greg and Joe are playing, and they live in the trailers back there.\u201d He pointed toward the back of the trailer park. \u201cTheir daddy said I could ride with them and stuff. I just needed someone to fill out the paper and pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on ahead and pay for it. Let him get hurt, and see whose fault it\u2019ll be,\u201d Momma said through the cigarette hanging out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they have coaches and adults overseeing this so that it is rare someone gets really hurt at this age,\u201d I said, shooting a warning glare back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me raise the sorriest bunch of brats in town. When they all need bailed outta jail in a few years, that shit is all on you.\u201d She stood up and walked back to her room. Once the door slammed behind her, I looked back at Brent.</p><p>\u201cIgnore that. You hear me? You\u2019re smart, and you\u2019re gonna make something of yourself. I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>Brent nodded. \u201cI know. Thank you for football.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and patted his head. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now, why don\u2019t you come on outside and walk me to my Jeep?\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Marcus, my older brother, was mad at me. He was convinced I was staying home instead of going to Auburn like I\u2019d planned because of Mom. I wasn\u2019t. Not really. Well, maybe a little bit. At first it had been for completely selfish reasons. I\u2019d wanted to get Preston Drake to notice me. Well, three months ago I\u2019d gotten my wish for about forty minutes. Since then he hadn\u2019t looked my way once. After several pitiful attempts to get his attention, I stopped trying.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was a little too late to decide I wanted to go to Auburn instead of the local junior college. I was almost relieved I couldn\u2019t go away, though. My mom was dealing with the betrayal and desertion of my dad. He now lived an hour away with his new young girlfriend and their child.</p><p>Leaving home meant leaving Mom all alone in this big house. If I hadn\u2019t made the decision to stay and try to get Preston\u2019s attention, I\u2019d be leaving today for Auburn. Mom would be crying and I would be sick to my stomach with worry. She just wasn\u2019t strong enough to be left alone just yet. Maybe next year.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t live here forever, Amanda,\u201d Marcus said as he paced in front of me. I had come outside to the pool with the new copy of People magazine hoping to get some sun, but Marcus had shown up. \u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to have to let Mom learn to cope. I know it\u2019s hard. Look at me, I\u2019m still stopping by four to five times a week just to make sure she\u2019s okay. But I don\u2019t want you giving up your dreams because you feel responsible for our mother.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d managed to keep my not going away to Auburn a secret from him until today. Normally, he was so wrapped up in his world with his fianc\u00e9e, Willow, and his online courses to keep up with what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cI know this, but maybe I just wasn\u2019t ready to leave home. Maybe this is all about me. You ever think of that?\u201d</p><p>Marcus frowned and rubbed his chin hard, which meant he was frustrated. \u201cOkay. Fine. Say you don\u2019t want to go away just yet. Have you considered maybe going in January? Getting your feet wet with college while at home, then venturing out?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I laid my magazine in my lap. I might as well give up on reading it until he\u2019d gotten this off his chest. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, because that is stupid. I can go an entire year here, then transfer next year. It works for me. I know people here, and I want to be here for the wedding. I want to help Willow plan it. I don\u2019t want to be four hours away missing all this.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hit him below the belt. Anything to do with his wedding and he went all soft. Marcus stopped his endless pacing and sat down on the end of the lounge chair beside me. \u201cSo this is really about you wanting to stay at home? You\u2019re just not ready to leave yet? Because if that is really the case, then I\u2019m good with that. I don\u2019t want you going off if you\u2019re not ready. Sure as hell don\u2019t want you going to Auburn. But if this is what you want\u2014you want\u2014then I\u2019m happy. I just don\u2019t want what Dad did to take away any more of our lives than it already has.\u201d</p><p>He was such a good guy. Why couldn\u2019t I be infatuated with a good guy like my overprotective, loving brother? There were guys out there like him. I\u2019d met a few. Why did I have to be hung up on a male slut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is all about me. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded, then slapped my foot before standing back up. \u201cGood. I feel better now. Since you\u2019re not moving away today, you\u2019re invited to the engagement party the guys are throwing for me and Low.\u201d</p><p>Guys? \u201cWhat guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the guys. Rock, Preston, Dewayne\u2014well, the truth is, mostly Trisha is throwing it and the guys are all planning the alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she need help?\u201d I asked, thinking how ridiculous it was that I was asking in hopes that I would be thrown together with Preston in some part of the planning.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure she does. Why don\u2019t you give her a call?\u201d</p><p>I would do that. Today. \u201cOkay, cool. When is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Friday night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Preston</p><p>\u201cWhere do I put these large paper balls, and what the hell are these, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Trisha, the only other female who\u2019d managed to get one of my friends to tie the knot, glanced back at me from her perch on top of the ladder and laughed. \u201cPut the box of lanterns on the table over there beside the flowers,\u201d Trisha instructed me before turning back to tying ribbon from the ceiling.</p> <p>When I\u2019d agreed to help with this party for Marcus and Low, I\u2019d thought that meant I was chipping in for the beer. Not carrying shit and hanging it up all day long. Trisha had demanded we all be here at eight this morning. She\u2019d barely given us a break for lunch. The next time one of my dumbass friends got engaged, I wasn\u2019t making the mistake of offering to help again.</p><p>\u201cFive more boxes in the truck, Preston. What\u2019re you standing around for?\u201d Rock asked as he walked in behind me and dropped a box on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find a way to get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Rock chuckled. \u201cGood luck with that. My woman ain\u2019t letting anyone free until we\u2019ve got this thing looking just the way she wants it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warning that Trisha was a party-decorating Nazi would have been nice.\u201d</p> <p>Rock slapped my back. \u201cNope. Then it\u2019d just be me and Trisha. I wanted y\u2019all to suffer through it with me.\u201d</p><p>Fine. Five more boxes, and then I was finding a way to sneak out. I followed Rock back outside to the truck. A familiar little Mercedes coupe pulled into the drive. What the hell was Amanda doing here? She was supposed to be safely tucked away at college by now. I wouldn\u2019t have come to the Hardys\u2019 beach condo if I\u2019d thought there was a chance she could be here. Damn it. The girl was driving me crazy. She\u2019d started flirting with me heavily about three months ago. And she hadn\u2019t let up. I wasn\u2019t someone she needed to be flirting with. My life was too fucked up for the likes of an innocent like Amanda.</p><p>Her car door swung open, and out came a very long tanned leg. I stopped. I was weak where she was concerned. After a very vivid dream about what she\u2019d feel like and taste like, I\u2019d been closing my eyes and pretending like every other woman I ended up fucking was Amanda. I was sorry scum for doing it, but . . . ah, hell . . .</p><p>Amanda stood up, and the tiny little red shorts she was wearing made those long legs that ended in a pair of red heels look endless. Fuck, I was going to get a boner. I\u2019d been thinking about those legs wrapped around me for three months too long. If she\u2019d treat me like the creep I was, then it would be easier to ignore, but she didn\u2019t. She smiled and batted her long eyelashes and flipped her blond hair over her shoulder. Even the few nights she\u2019d managed to get drunk at Live Bay, the local club, the innocence pouring off her was a major red flag.</p><p>\u201cGet a box!\u201d Rock yelled at me as he pulled out another one of the boxes from the truck. I didn\u2019t make eye contact with her. I couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d smile, and I\u2019d be an ass trying to get her to go away. Ignoring her worked better. I didn\u2019t like to see that sweet little flirty gleam in her eyes suddenly turn to hurt when I opened my mouth and spewed lies. I\u2019d seen it too many times this summer. I was staying the hell away from that. My heart couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>Grabbing a box, I headed back to her daddy\u2019s condo. It was set directly on the beach, and a perfect spot for tonight\u2019s party. The patio opened up to the condo\u2019s pool\u2014we had reserved it for a private party.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Preston.\u201d Amanda was beside me.</p><p>She was relentless. \u201cManda, aren\u2019t you supposed to be off at college by now?\u201d Please, God, let her be leaving and getting far away from my dirty mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying here this year. I decided I wasn\u2019t ready to leave home just yet.\u201d</p><p>Well, fuck me. She was staying here? No! I needed her to leave before I did something stupid. Like hauling her ass into the nearest bedroom and stripping off them red shorts, then tasting every last inch of her.</p><p>\u201cGonna have to grow up sometime, Manda. Can\u2019t stay at home with Mommy forever.\u201d I was a prick.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to glance over to know Amanda had stopped walking beside me. I\u2019d done it again. All I ever managed to do was say things to hurt her feelings. I needed to leave it like this, just go inside and pretend like we hadn\u2019t even spoken. But I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I stopped and turned to look back at her. She was standing there with her hands clasped tightly in front of her, making her tits push together and\u2014holy fucking shit! She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra under that flimsy little shirt she had on. You could see her nipples poking through the fabric. What was she doing? She didn\u2019t need to dress like that.</p><p>\u201cManda, go put on a bra. I know your boobs aren\u2019t that big, but that shirt requires a bra.\u201d</p> <p>Her big green eyes welled up with unshed tears. It was a punch to the gut. I hated that every word I said to her was cruel, but I needed her to stay away from me. She had no idea exactly who I was. No one did, really. I was many different things to many different people. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even know who the hell I was anymore.</p><p>She ducked her head, and long blond hair fell over her shoulders. She crossed her arms over her chest and walked briskly past me and into the condo. I set the box down at the door, then turned and headed out to my Jeep. I couldn\u2019t stay here. I needed to go beat the shit out of something before I lost it.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I was done. No more. I couldn\u2019t continue to try to make Preston like me. He acted as if I was still his best friend\u2019s kid sister and he hadn\u2019t screwed my brains out behind a club. This was just hurting me more and more. It was past time I moved on. Let this one go. He\u2019d just let me know how lacking my body was. I would just put the memory of how I lost my virginity away. Forget about it and never look back. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like I could ever share the experience with anyone. It was humiliating enough just to know I\u2019d sent him running. He hadn\u2019t even kissed me. The idea of kissing me had repulsed him that much.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to face anyone just yet. I ran up the steps instead of going into the living room, where everyone was getting ready. Sadie White, my best friend, would be here tonight. I wouldn\u2019t be alone in this crowd of people. Closing the door to my bedroom in my dad\u2019s place, I pulled my phone out of my purse and called Sadie.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told her everything. She had no idea I\u2019d given Preston my virginity in a storage unit like some cheap slut. I was too ashamed to tell her that part of the awful truth. But she did know he had flirted heavily with me and we\u2019d gone out to his Jeep and made out a bit before he walked off and left me.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice was happy and cheerful. Jax, her rock-star boyfriend was in town. She was always on cloud nine when he came to visit. He was here this time to pack her up and move her off to California. I was trying not to think about that.</p><p>\u201cI know you and lover boy are packing you up and all, but I wanted to make sure you\u2019re coming tonight.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been able to mask the hurt in my voice. She was going to pick up on it.</p><p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s wrong, Amanda?\u201d I could hear the concern in her voice.</p><p>Swallowing through the lump in my throat, I gripped the phone tightly and tried real hard to control my emotions. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be alone. With . . . everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sadie sighed. \u201cIs this about Preston? I swear I want to kick his butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It . . . okay, well, maybe it is. But it\u2019s my fault. I should have stayed away from him. I knew he was like this.\u201d Maybe I hadn\u2019t known he would actually screw me and walk away, never to be nice to me again. But I had known he was a player. This was his brush-off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. You won\u2019t be alone. In fact, you\u2019ll have a date.\u201d</p><p>I stopped blinking back tears and waited for an explanation of her last statement. What did she mean by \u201ca date\u201d? Was she sharing Jax? No . . . that made no sense.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Sadie cleared her throat, then covered the phone with her hand, and I heard her muffled voice. I waited patiently for her to stop her private conversation and clue me in.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s the thing. Jason, Jax\u2019s brother, is here too. You met him about six months ago, remember? He was at the birthday party I threw for Jax at the beach house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember Jason. He\u2019s hard to forget.\u201d He looked a lot like Jax. He just had a quieter demeanor. I\u2019d had to talk to him that night because he didn\u2019t say a whole lot.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s been asking about you. I knew you were hung up on Preston, which I can\u2019t really figure out. He\u2019s cute and all, but he\u2019s a man whore. Jason mentioned you again today.\u201d</p><p>Jason Stone, younger brother to the world\u2019s biggest teenage heartthrob, liked me? \u201cUh, well, um, okay. I think. I mean, really? Jason? He dates models and stuff. I saw him on Teen Heat last week with Kipley McKnowel. I can\u2019t compete with that. I\u2019ve seen her makeup commercial.\u201d</p><p>Sadie laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s airbrushed in that commercial. She\u2019s really not that fabulous in real life. I met her. Trust me. Besides, he was with her that one time. He said she was missing intelligence. He wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason Stone . . . really?\u201d I was just having too hard a time comprehending this. I\u2019d just recently gotten used to Jax Stone randomly showing up at my house on Sadie\u2019s arm. Now to actually go on a date with his brother?</p><p>\u201cYes, really. I take it that you\u2019re interested.\u201d Sadie\u2019s amused tone made me smile. Maybe this was what I needed to get over Preston. He didn\u2019t want me. I needed to face that.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Yeah, I mean, if he\u2019s sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are clueless, Amanda Hardy. Just because you can\u2019t get the attention of a guy hell-bent on sleeping his way through the United States doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t gorgeous and smart and extremely appealing to any guy with two eyes and a brain. Trust me. \u2019Kay?\u201d</p><p>The heaviness in my chest eased some. The ache was still there, but the hope that I could move on and stop getting hurt by Preston was a relief. I still couldn\u2019t believe it was going to be with Jason Stone. Tonight didn\u2019t seem so bad anymore.</p><p>\u201cI trust you. Now, what do I wear?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Preston</p><p>I\u2019d ignored the few calls from Rock I got after I\u2019d sped out of the condo like a man running for his life. He would have to get over it. I couldn\u2019t explain. I would just pitch in more money than I\u2019d originally intended to make up for bailing on helping them set up. Staying that close to Amanda and not going after her and falling on my knees and begging her to forgive me for the stupid shit I said would have been impossible. I hated to see her hurt. I hated doing it. I was a shithead. But I couldn\u2019t let her near me. She was too sweet and innocent.</p><p>Closing my Jeep door, I took a deep breath before heading toward the condo. The music was already pouring out the windows, and the parking lot was filling up. I\u2019d come a little early so I could slip Rock some money so he\u2019d get over the fact that I\u2019d left him high and dry earlier.</p> <p>Before I reached the door, it swung open and Rock stepped out. His frown looked more concerned than pissed. Shit.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d were the first words out of his mouth.</p><p>I reached into my back pocket and pulled out a couple of hundreds. \u201cHere. Take this. It\u2019s my part for the party. I had some shit come up earlier and I had to run.\u201d</p><p>Rock reached out and took it, but he didn\u2019t put it in his pocket. He held it between his fingers. \u201cYou fucked up with some shit and can\u2019t get out of it?\u201d</p><p>What? Wait . . . did he mean drugs? \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p> <p>Rock\u2019s eyebrows lowered, and he pointed the money I\u2019d given him at me. \u201cThen where the hell do you get the cash you never seem to run out of? \u2019Cause I know where you come from, boy, and it ain\u2019t an inheritance.\u201d</p><p>This was not the first time I\u2019d dodged this question. But it was the first time I\u2019d had to deal with it sober. \u201cIt ain\u2019t drugs, Rock. Now put the shit in your pocket and let me inside.\u201d</p><p>Rock shifted on his feet, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou know if you need help getting out of anything, I got your back. Right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had my back since we were kids. He was also the only friend I\u2019d ever had over to my trailer growing up. I\u2019d just had him over the one time, though. Momma had been high as a kite and throwing the few dishes we had across the kitchen because I\u2019d forgotten to pick up her empty bottles of whiskey and throw them away the night before. I could still see the look of horror in Rock\u2019s eyes that day. It had been the first and last time I let someone come over.</p><p>I nodded, stepped around him, and headed inside the door. He slapped my back as I passed, and I knew we were okay.</p><p>The place looked amazing. Those paper balls were hanging from the ceiling, and it looked pretty damn good. Flowers in vases wrapped with white lights were everywhere. It wasn\u2019t too incredibly packed yet, but I knew everyone would be here soon enough. I scanned the room quickly for any sign of Amanda. She wasn\u2019t here yet. I had time to get a drink and find a female to latch on to before she showed up.</p> <p>There were several stations with bartenders outside on the patio and around the pool. I made my way out there. Fresh air and a shot of Cuervo would be nice.</p><p>\u201cYou bailed on me. I should push you in that pool,\u201d Trisha said threateningly as she walked toward me.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I gave Rock some money to make up for my running off. Something came up. I had to go.\u201d</p><p>Trisha rolled her eyes. \u201cCheap sluts aren\u2019t an emergency. They\u2019re a dime a dozen.\u201d</p><p>Let her think I\u2019d run off to get laid. It was better than the truth. That I\u2019d run off because Amanda Hardy was so fucking under my skin I couldn\u2019t think straight. She\u2019d been the only thing in my head while I\u2019d relieved some tension in the shower before I left for the party.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me in. I might get naked and get this party started,\u201d I replied with a wink.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d she replied, and walked off.</p><p>I stopped at the first drinking station when I saw Dewayne, another of my best friends since elementary school. Me, Rock, Marcus, and Dewayne had been close since the day we\u2019d all been suspended in the second grade for fighting on the playground. It had formed a bond that I\u2019d never take for granted. I\u2019d needed a family. They\u2019d become that for me.</p> <p>\u201cIf it ain\u2019t the pussy king,\u201d Dewayne said. \u201cI show up to help out, and your ass is already run off. \u2019Course, I wasn\u2019t surprised. I\u2019d have been more surprised if you\u2019d actually stayed and worked all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. You lazy ass, I know you didn\u2019t stay all day,\u201d I replied with a grin, and looked over at the young guy in a tuxedo standing behind the bar. \u201cI need a shot of tequila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready hitting it hard, huh? Damn.\u201d</p><p>I started to respond when Dewayne\u2019s eyes widened and he let out a low whistle. I followed his gaze and almost swallowed my damn tongue.</p><p>Amanda was here. Wearing a short, clingy white dress. Her long tanned legs looked even longer with the bronze high-heeled sandals she was wearing. Her silky blond hair was curled and pulled up on her head, while several curls had fallen loose and grazed her bare neck and shoulders. Ah, hell.</p><p>\u201cIs she with Jason Stone? Fuck, I hope not. Marcus is gonna be pissed.\u201d Dewayne\u2019s words slapped me in the face. I tore my eyes off her and looked to see whose arm she was holding on to. Jax Stone\u2019s brother was smiling down at her, saying something. He was making her laugh. She was gazing up at him like he was fascinating. Fuck. A red haze settled over my vision, and I started to move. A hand clamped down on my arm and jerked me back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Dewayne\u2019s hard tone surprised me. What was I doing?</p><p>\u201cI, he, she . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back at Dewayne. I couldn\u2019t explain that asinine answer. Instead, I turned to the bartender. \u201cMake that a double, and keep \u2019em coming.\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Jason was everything Preston wasn\u2019t. He was polite. He liked talking to me. He made me feel attractive. He didn\u2019t say hurtful, mean things. He wasn\u2019t scanning the crowd looking for a female to haul off and screw. He was with me. Completely. It was nice. I liked feeling wanted.</p><p>So why did I keep looking back at Preston? He was drinking heavily already, and Marcus and Low hadn\u2019t even arrived yet.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d Jason asked from beside me. I tore my gaze off Preston and turned it back to my date.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Unless you do,\u201d I replied. I really didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near the bar in front of us. Far away from Preston was best.</p><p>\u201cDid Trisha do all this? She did a fantastic job. This place looks magical. Very romantic,\u201d Sadie said in awe as she and Jax came up beside us. He\u2019d been stopped at the door, and the request for autographs had begun. I needed to find Trisha and have her put a stop to that. A lot of the people here were accustomed to Jax coming around, but this would be new for some guests and I knew it got to Sadie.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she worked on it all day. She directed and we followed,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Sadie grabbed my arm and tugged me close to her. \u201cPreston is looking this way. He doesn\u2019t appear to be happy. We need to move,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I agreed. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go down to the beach and see what Trisha decided to do under the tent she has out there. I know they are playing music and that\u2019s where the dance floor is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait. Marcus and Low are here,\u201d Sadie said, pointing back toward the door we\u2019d come out of. They were inside talking to guests. We needed to go speak to them before we escaped to the beach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go say hello first,\u201d I replied, looking up at Jason to see if he was okay with this.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get the big brother thing over with. That way I can be less nervous.\u201d The amused tone in his voice didn\u2019t take away the serious expression in his eyes. He was nervous. Marcus was pretty good about letting me date as long as he approved. He didn\u2019t breathe down guys\u2019 necks or embarrass me.</p><p>\u201cHe will be nice. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d believe her. Your last name is Stone,\u201d Jax drawled.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it. You know he has moved on from that. Look at him. He\u2019s infatuated with Willow,\u201d Sadie replied.</p><p>Once upon a time Marcus had been crazy about Sadie. That was how I knew her. But Jax Stone had been the only guy ever to win Sadie\u2019s heart. Marcus never even stood a chance. When Willow had come into his life, I\u2019d been so happy for him. She was just as gorgeous on the inside as she was on the outside. They\u2019d had a major hurdle to get over thanks to our father and Willow\u2019s sister, but they\u2019d loved each other enough. More than enough. I wanted that one day too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be happy when he\u2019s married. Maybe with a kid or two,\u201d Jax replied. The crooked smile on his face assured everyone he was kidding. Well, maybe a little bit of that was true. Jax was incredibly possessive of Sadie. He didn\u2019t like any guy getting too close. Marcus had gotten too close once.</p><p>Sadie laughed and kissed his cheek. Thanks to the stiletto heels she was wearing, she didn\u2019t have to stand on her tippy toes. \u201cI\u2019m moving away with you tomorrow. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>Jax raised an eyebrow at her question. \u201cYou really want me to answer that with an audience?\u201d</p><p>Sadie blushed and ducked her head, causing Jax to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see Marcus. These two are only going to get more disgustingly sweet the longer we stand here,\u201d Jason said, leading me past Sadie and his brother.</p><p>Marcus and Low were standing under the white lights that Trisha and I had strung together earlier and wrapped around several of the paper lanterns in the center of the main room. The smile on Marcus\u2019s face made me tear up. I loved seeing him this happy. I loved that he\u2019d found Low. If anyone deserved a happily ever after, it was my bighearted older brother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he isn\u2019t going to take a swing at me?\u201d Jason asked with his mouth very close to my ear.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Come on.\u201d</p><p>As if he could hear the whispering, Marcus lifted his eyes to meet mine. The smile on his face froze as he shifted his gaze from me to Jason, but only for a moment. The sincerely happy expression returned as he made eye contact with Jason. Apparently, he approved.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t expecting you to show up with a date,\u201d Marcus said as we stopped in front of him and Low.</p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute thing. Jason saved me from coming here alone,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cOr your sister agreed to go out with me, and I took the opportunity and ran with it,\u201d Jason replied.</p><p>Marcus smirked and nodded. \u201cI just might like you.\u201d</p><p>Low held her hand out to Jason. \u201cI\u2019m Willow, and it is very nice to meet you. If you are lucky enough to get Amanda on a date, then you must be a great guy.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook Low\u2019s hand, then glanced over at me with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on getting up the nerve to ask for a while now. Tonight was my lucky break.\u201d</p><p>Really? He\u2019d been interested in me for a while? Wow. I hadn\u2019t expected that. He was Jason Stone. He was splashed all over the news, and gossip magazines loved him.</p><p>\u201cWell, we are glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Willow assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Marcus asked, taking a step forward, his attention directed outside.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Rock growled, running by us and toward the doors leading out to the pool. Marcus took off after him. What in the world was going on?</p><p>Then I saw Dewayne standing between Preston, who was leaned up against the bar with an amused grin on his face, and some guy who was yelling at Preston and pointing at him over Dewayne\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>I started to follow Marcus. Something was wrong. Was Preston starting a fight? Why was he doing this? And why the heck did I care so much?</p><p>\u201cWait, don\u2019t go out there, Amanda,\u201d Low called out as I started after my brother. I wanted to run outside and ignore her, but I was leaving Jason behind too. Sadie\u2019s big eyes met mine, as she and Jax had stopped just behind Jason and me to give their congratulations to Marcus and Low. I needed to give all of them a reason why I needed to be outside. I needed to see if Preston was okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. They may need me.\u201d It was the best I could come up with before running after Marcus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Preston</p><p>This was not the kind of shit I needed right now. I\u2019d been focused on drinking Amanda Hardy out of my system tonight. That\u2019s all I wanted to focus on. That and her legs. Damn, her legs.</p><p>Then something like this happens. Not what I was in the mood for.</p> <p>\u201cTell him you didn\u2019t touch his mom, Preston,\u201d Dewayne demanded from in front of me. He was acting like my fucking bodyguard. I could take the guy. I didn\u2019t need someone to protect me.</p><p>\u201cTell. Him,\u201d Dewayne repeated.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do that. Me and the guy threatening to beat my ass both knew I couldn\u2019t deny it. He\u2019d caught me with his mom last week. I could remember his face. Couldn\u2019t remember his mom\u2019s face but did remember the fury in his eyes. I\u2019d seen it one too many times.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Rock asked as he and Marcus ran out and also stood between me and the guy. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell the guy his dear mom had paid me very well for that Sunday afternoon roll around her sheets. I wasn\u2019t into older women. I used them. That was it. They had cash, and I fulfilled their fantasies. The dude wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the truth, though.</p><p>\u201cTrying to stop a fight,\u201d Dewayne explained as both Rock and Marcus stood beside him, blocking me even more from the angry son of one of my clients. This was just another reason I needed to start demanding that I not handle business in clients\u2019 houses. This shit happens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Marcus asked, glancing back at me.</p><p>I shrugged and took another shot of tequila.</p><p>\u201cGuy says Preston slept with his mom, and he\u2019s out for blood,\u201d Dewayne explained.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Rock mumbled, and shot a warning glare back my way.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Preston. Explain that ain\u2019t the case,\u201d Dewayne demanded again.</p><p>I was getting tired of that. I hadn\u2019t spoken up yet. Had they not figured out that there was truth to this? Did they want me to lie to the guy and piss him off more? This guy and I had made eye contact that day as I\u2019d pulled my jeans back on and headed out his mother\u2019s bedroom door while she made excuses to her son. I hadn\u2019t stayed around to deal with the drama. I just got the hell out.</p> <p>\u201cYou got the wrong guy,\u201d a voice interrupted. \u201cHe\u2019s mine. He wouldn\u2019t be sleeping with someone\u2019s mom when he has me to come home to. So back off. I don\u2019t want to hear any more of this.\u201d</p><p>What the fucking hell?</p><p>Amanda walked around the wall of guys standing guard in front of me and crooked her finger my way. \u201cCome on, baby. Let\u2019s go. This guy\u2019s confused you with someone else, and you\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>Had I passed out? Maybe I\u2019d had more shots than I intended.</p><p>\u201cManda, what the hell\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Marcus. I got this,\u201d she snapped, cutting off her brother\u2019s angry question.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Preston. Now.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t question her. I set down my shot glass and stood up, then walked over to her. What was she doing? She slipped her hand around my waist and steered me away from the angry son and my friends.</p> <p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d she said, and led me through the crowd and toward the stairs leading up to the bedrooms. Probably not the best idea. I didn\u2019t need to have Amanda Hardy anywhere near a bed. Especially as drunk as I was at the moment. But then again, maybe this was all a drunken dream. Which meant I could strip her hot little body of this clingy, sexy-ass dress and kiss all the places my dreams haunt me with at night.</p><p>Amanda opened a door and pushed me inside a pink-and-white bedroom with ruffles on the bed and a white teddy bear resting against the pillows. Hell, yeah. This was hot. Amanda naked on that bed. Fuck, I was hard.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d She shoved me toward the bed and then backed away from me. Not the best dream I\u2019d ever had.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and glared at me from across the room. Sexy. As. Hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? This is Marcus\u2019s engagement party. You can\u2019t go picking fights. What is wrong with you? Is everything a joke to you? Life\u2019s just one big party for you, isn\u2019t it? Well, wake up! You have friends down there who love you. They stand up for you even when they know you probably did screw that poor guy\u2019s mom.\u201d She stopped and shook her head in disgust. \u201cGod, please tell me she wasn\u2019t married.\u201d Then she put up her hand to stop anything I might say in reply. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell me anything. I don\u2019t want to know. Just stay in here. Sleep it off. Don\u2019t ruin this night for Marcus and Low. They deserve to be happy. Marcus loves you, Preston. Don\u2019t do something stupid to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands to her side and let out a sigh. She was disappointed in me. This was a good thing. Maybe she was even disgusted with me. That would be even better. I needed her to stop flirting. I needed her to stop making me want things I couldn\u2019t have. Because, dammit, I wanted her. So very bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a date that I\u2019ve run out on to save the testosterone party down there from throwing down one big ugly fight. All because you can\u2019t keep your pants up around a female.\u201d She dropped her eyes as she said the last part, and her cheeks flamed red. Did the idea of me having sex embarrass her?</p><p>She turned and walked back to the door. Her perfect round ass swayed under the thin material of the dress, mocking me with what I couldn\u2019t ever have. What I\u2019d never be good enough for.</p><p>\u201cHe better be good to you,\u201d I said just loud enough for her to hear me if she was really listening. She stopped. She\u2019d heard me.</p><p>Slowly she turned back around and stared at me with a confused expression. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked, studying my face like it had all the answers she needed.</p><p>\u201cIt means that I don\u2019t give a shit who his brother is. If he hurts you, I\u2019ll hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Amanda let out a short, hard laugh and shook her head. \u201cReally? Really, Preston? You care if Jason hurts me? Because I find it very hard to believe that you care about my feelings at all.\u201d Then she spun around and walked away, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I would not cry. And I would stop this stupid shaking. There was a very hot, attractive, somewhat famous guy downstairs waiting on me. He didn\u2019t make me feel cheap and unwanted. Taking a deep breath, I straightened my shoulders and smoothed the wrinkles out of my dress, then walked back down the stairs. Scanning the crowd, I found Jason immediately. He was with Sadie and Jax. They were all probably talking about me. I\u2019m sure Sadie was explaining my performance with Preston.</p><p>Speaking to guests as I made my way through the crowd, I kept a permanent smile plastered on my face. No one would know that what I\u2019d just done had been for anyone else but Marcus. I\u2019d never let them see I had any feelings for Preston. My pride would keep me safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I was worried that if I didn\u2019t step in and help, we\u2019d have a fight on our hands, and I don\u2019t want anything to ruin tonight for Marcus and Willow,\u201d I explained once I got to Jason, before anyone could say anything.</p><p>Jason was frowning, but it was a concerned frown. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. You did a good job ending things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you locked him in a room so he can\u2019t come out,\u201d Sadie said. She was annoyed. I could hear it in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is locked up. Hopefully passed out by now,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to ask this\u2014did the guy really sleep with someone\u2019s mom?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>Jax reached over and punched Jason in the arm. \u201cDude. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her brother\u2019s best friend. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. He may be one of Marcus\u2019s best friends, but I\u2019m aware he has issues. And yes, Jason, he probably did. You would be hard-pressed to find a female here Preston hasn\u2019t slept with.\u201d</p><p>Sadie\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and I realized what I\u2019d said. I was venting. I needed to watch my mouth. My mom always said \u201cLoose lips sink ships.\u201d She was right. I needed to be more careful what I spewed from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we going to go down to the beach and check out the tent and band?\u201d I asked, needing to get everyone\u2019s mind off what I\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were,\u201d Jax replied, reaching for Sadie\u2019s arm and leading her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea to me,\u201d Jason agreed, and offered me his arm. I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm, and we all headed outside.</p><p>Marcus was standing with Willow in his arms, talking to Dewayne, Rock, and Trisha pretty intensely when we walked back out the doors. Cage York, Willow\u2019s best friend, and his girlfriend, Eva, had arrived too. They must\u2019ve been getting filled in on the situation. Cage and Preston play baseball together, so they\u2019re pretty tight.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Amanda,\u201d Marcus called out to me. I was hoping he\u2019d forget what I\u2019d just done, but apparently he wasn\u2019t going to. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to say, but I didn\u2019t feel right letting Jason hear them talk about Preston. He wasn\u2019t here to defend himself, and I\u2019d already bashed him enough.</p><p>\u201cLet me go reassure my brother that Preston is fine, and then I\u2019ll meet y\u2019all down there.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>If Marcus frowned any harder, the crease in his forehead was going to crack. Not a good sign. \u201cDon\u2019t scold me. I got him out of here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to stick your nose into any of Preston\u2019s crap. He has issues you need to stay miles away from. I get that you were trying to help save the party, but I don\u2019t like you stepping in to help Preston out. We got it. You stay away from his messes.\u201d</p><p>I may have an absent father for the most part, but I have Marcus to make up for it. Where my daddy ignores me, Marcus hovers over me. I love him, I really do, but I don\u2019t like being told what I can and can\u2019t do. It was time he backed off a little. I\u2019m eighteen years old.</p><p>\u201cShe made a smart move. Lay off and give her a little credit.\u201d Cage stepped over and defended me. Like that would help. Marcus tolerated Cage because of Willow. He didn\u2019t exactly care what his opinion was.</p><p>\u201cListen. I saw a way to help, and I did. Not a big deal. I didn\u2019t go have a heart-to-heart with Preston. So back off. I\u2019m a big girl now.\u201d I shot Marcus a tight smile, and then left him standing there before he or any of the other guys could speak up. I had a date waiting on me. I wasn\u2019t going to waste another minute talking about Preston Drake.</p><p>A hand shot out and grabbed my arm, and I glanced back to see it was Dewayne who\u2019d stopped me, not my brother. What was his deal? Was I now going to get a lecture from him, too?</p><p>\u201cPreston talks when he\u2019s drunk. He talks a lot. About a lot of shit. You know what I mean? Keep your distance. I love him, but he ain\u2019t good for you.\u201d Dewayne\u2019s low voice almost sounded like a rumble, but I heard every word. He\u2019d spoken low enough that Marcus and the others couldn\u2019t hear him. I felt my face heat up, and I jerked my arm out of his hold.</p><p>What did Dewayne know about me and Preston? Could he possibly know about that night? I\u2019d thought it was my secret. Apparently not. My stomach turned, and I prayed I wasn\u2019t about to get sick. It was bad enough knowing Preston had taken my virginity in a storage building on a bunch of boxes and then walked away, leaving me there alone. But knowing that someone else knew of my shame was even worse.</p><p>I had to force myself to keep from running as I walked swiftly through the crowd. I didn\u2019t smile and pretend like everything was great. The dark beach up ahead on the outskirts of the tent and lighting was my goal. Hiding away for a few minutes while I got a grip on things was necessary.</p><p>I could hear Sadie call my name from somewhere up ahead, but I pretended like I didn\u2019t hear her. I ran for the sand and the shadows.</p><p>I just needed a moment.</p><p>Tears burned my eyes, and I tilted my head back and blinked into the ocean breeze in an attempt to dry my tears before they ruined my face. The small sliver of hope I\u2019d had that Preston had felt something for me was now completely extinguished. He had told someone. A moment that I wanted to remember yet wanted to wash my memory of at the same time wasn\u2019t as private as I\u2019d thought. Preston had talked about it, while drunk. God, I hated him. How could I have been so crazy about him when he has no redeeming qualities? I was the biggest idiot on the face of the earth.</p><p>\u201cAmanda?\u201d Jason\u2019s concerned voice startled me. I hadn\u2019t expected him to follow me out here. Although we\u2019d met before, this was really our first time together without a crowd around us. I wanted to be alone. Not pretending for my date.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I blinked away my tears and turned to face Jason. \u201cHey, sorry. The crowd and everything got to me. Fresh air and a quiet moment seemed like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d check on you. I can go if you want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Yes. I wanted to be alone. But I couldn\u2019t be rude. Jason had been really understanding so far tonight. I hadn\u2019t been the best date. It was time to suck it up and get over myself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you came out here. You can enjoy the quiet with me.\u201d I smiled up at him. It was odd how similar he looked to Jax. He didn\u2019t have the rocker swagger that Jax did, though. He was more polite and studious, almost.</p><p>\u201cI like hiding from crowds. It\u2019s been my thing since crowds became an issue with my brother\u2019s fame.\u201d The grin on his face was really cute.</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. You don\u2019t appear to be as outgoing as Jax.\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled. \u201cNo. Not even a little. Jax was always the one who liked an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you leaving with Jax and Sadie when they move her to LA?\u201d It was still hard for me to accept the fact that Sadie was leaving. I was going to miss her so much.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Classes start next week for me, too.\u201d</p><p>Jason would be going to college in California too. That was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t feel guilty for using him to get over Preston. Not that it was working.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think I\u2019m ready to go back to the crowd now. You want to dance?\u201d I asked, deciding it was time I stopped hiding at my brother\u2019s engagement party.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Preston</p><p>You can\u2019t leave a guy to \u201csleep it off\u201d when he\u2019s barely had anything to drink. A few shots of tequila does not a drunk Preston make. I lay back on the bed and stared at the white ceiling fan slowly spinning. Letting everyone around me think that I was just living from one party to the next had always been easy. It covered up the truth. I liked pretending to be carefree. It had always been better than the truth.</p><p>Letting Amanda Hardy think I was as shallow as I\u2019d convinced her I was hurt like a son of a bitch. I didn\u2019t want to see the disappointment and disgust in her eyes. The only thing that kept me from blurting out the truth while she went on and on about my sucky behavior was the fact that the truth was worse.</p> <p>Reaching over, I picked up the white teddy bear lying beside my head and held it up to my nose. It was Amanda\u2019s. It smelled like her. This was her sorry-ass father\u2019s condo, but this had to be Amanda\u2019s room. Staying in here wasn\u2019t going to be possible. I\u2019d just think about all I couldn\u2019t have. I placed the bear back in its spot and stood up.</p><p>Marcus was my best friend. Sure, there was a group of us, but Marcus was the one I loved the most. He\u2019d always seemed to know more than I wanted him to, but he never said anything. Instead of asking me questions like Rock had when we were kids, Marcus had brought me an extra lunch every day. He never mentioned it. He just did it. When I\u2019d been bruised from one of my mom\u2019s boyfriends\u2019 drunken fits, Dewayne and Rock had asked why. Marcus had changed the subject and then slipped into the school office to get me an aspirin that he\u2019d casually placed in my hands without explanation.</p><p>The guys were my family, but Marcus was my brother. Blood didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d cared when no one else had known there was something to care about. I had to let this fascination I had with his sister go. I also needed to get downstairs and celebrate with him. He\u2019d found someone worthy of him. Being locked away and sulking over Jason Stone showing up with Amanda was unfair. Marcus didn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>I walked down the stairs and into the living room. As I entered the room, Willow smiled at me and motioned me over. She was surrounded by guests, but her attention was on me. I could see the concern in her eyes. If anyone understood my life even a little, it would be Willow. She\u2019d had a suck-ass family tree too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d she replied, with a smile to let me know she was glad I\u2019d returned.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I figured things had time to cool off. I didn\u2019t want to miss tonight. I\u2019m sorry about earlier.\u201d I stopped at that. I couldn\u2019t explain any more to her.</p><p>Willow shrugged one shoulder. \u201cNo worries. I think the guys were just worried about that guy causing a stir. He was a friend of a guest. He\u2019s been escorted out.\u201d</p><p>I reached behind her to the bartender and grabbed a beer. It was safer than the tequila shots.</p><p>Willow raised an eyebrow. \u201cEver heard the saying \u2018Liquor before beer, never sicker\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I tipped the bottle to my lips, took a swig, and grinned. \u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s liquor before beer, never fear.\u201d</p><p>Willow laughed. \u201cGuess you\u2019d know this better than anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been drinking before he was old enough to shave,\u201d Marcus drawled as he came up behind Willow and wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>Willow tilted her head back, and I watched as Marcus bent his head to capture her mouth with his. They were so fucking sweet it made me sick. It also made me jealous as hell. I would never get that. I could never love like that. Ever.</p><p>\u201cGlad you came back down to the party. I knew you weren\u2019t drunk when Amanda took you up there,\u201d Marcus said, once he\u2019d released his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured I\u2019d given the guy time to leave or calm down.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded. \u201cI walked him to the door. Trisha said she was sorry. She told Krit he could bring a few friends. That was one of them.\u201d</p><p>Krit was Trisha\u2019s brother and the lead singer in a band. He didn\u2019t normally have the best crowd surrounding him, and he traveled with a posse.</p><p>\u201cWell, Krit\u2019s friends have gotten classier. That guy was the son of a neurosurgeon in Mobile.\u201d</p><p>Women always talked. They told me about their husbands and how they were neglected. I didn\u2019t need to hear an excuse as to why they hired me, but they always felt like they had to give me one. It had been my first time with that woman. Normally, I kept my client list small. I had the usuals, but she\u2019d been a friend of a client, so I\u2019d agreed.</p> <p>\u201cSo you did sleep with his mom?\u201d Marcus asked. The disbelief wasn\u2019t there. He knew. He always knew.</p><p>I sighed and took another drink of my beer. Of course I did. I wasn\u2019t going to answer this, though. Not tonight.</p><p>\u201cListen, either you dance with your girl, or I\u2019m going to,\u201d I said, shooting Willow a grin. She knew I was kidding, but I loved getting Marcus all riled up.</p><p>\u201cBack off, lover boy, or I\u2019ll be the one kicking your ass,\u201d he replied in an amused tone.</p><p>\u201cDancing sounds like fun. I want to go see Amanda and her new friend, too. I saw them walk down there,\u201d Willow replied.</p><p>My somewhat good mood vanished. I wouldn\u2019t be going down to the dance floor. I couldn\u2019t handle that. I\u2019d want to dance with her just to see if she felt as good as I knew she would.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with a Stone. Pisses me off. She don\u2019t need to get mixed up in that world. He might not be a rock star, but he is awfully close to it,\u201d Marcus snarled.</p><p>Willow laughed and slapped his arm. \u201cHe seems like a nice guy. Don\u2019t judge him because of his family.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to argue that, yes, you should judge him because of his family, but I kept my mouth shut. I couldn\u2019t show any concern. Marcus would catch on, and he\u2019d be shoving Amanda at Jason Stone. There was no way he\u2019d ever agree to let his little sister near me, and I couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being good,\u201d Marcus replied. \u201cBesides, he leaves to fly off to LA soon, I\u2019m sure. This is just a friendly thing. Amanda doesn\u2019t seem real interested. Which is good, because he ain\u2019t flying my baby sister out to LA with him. I\u2019ll let her go five hours away, but that is as far as I\u2019m allowing her to go.\u201d</p><p>Willow sighed. \u201cShe\u2019ll need room to breathe soon enough, Marcus. You can love her and care about her while you stand back and let her make her own decisions. She isn\u2019t the little girl you took care of all your life. She\u2019s a big girl now. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>Marcus bent down and kissed Willow\u2019s head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about family tonight. I just want to hold you in my arms. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I gave them a small good-bye wave with my beer in hand and watched them walk toward the doors leading outside.</p><p>I could leave now and they\u2019d never know. That way, I wouldn\u2019t have to drink until I no longer cared about Amanda and Jason Fucking Stone.</p><p>\u201cHey, sexy. Why haven\u2019t you called?\u201d The cooing sound came from behind me, and I glanced back over my shoulder to see a familiar-looking brunette.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the asshole who never calls,\u201d I replied with a wink.</p><p>She giggled and closed the space between us. Large fake rack. Big brown eyes. I\u2019d screwed her before. She was a Jackdown groupie\u2014I\u2019d hooked up with her at the club one night while Jackdown was playing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the forgiving type,\u201d she whispered in my ear and then moved in front of me, slipping her hands in the back pockets of my jeans. \u201cReal forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I asked, taking a drink and watching her. She\u2019d been one of those who knew exactly what she was doing. But then, typically band groupies were talented in the sex department. They had to be to keep the interest of guys who had new girls throwing themselves at them every night.</p><p>\u201cYou come here tonight with Krit?\u201d I asked, looking around for Trisha\u2019s younger brother.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m friends with Trisha, and I went to school with Willow,\u201d she explained, and slipped her other hand over the crotch of my jeans. \u201cI came here looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Sure she did. She came looking for action, and I was the first one she\u2019d found who she was interested in. I wasn\u2019t an idiot. \u201cWhat do you have in mind? You might just convince me if you can make it sound real good.\u201d She was going to have to be a talented dirty talker to get me interested. My mind was still focused on Amanda Hardy. I needed the distraction.</p><p>She stood on her tiptoes and pressed her mouth to my ear. \u201cCome back to a room with me, and I can remind you just how talented my mouth is.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Yeah. She was the one. I remembered her. She had one big-ass mouth. I\u2019d never even fucked her. She\u2019d just sucked me off. I could close my eyes and pretend.</p><p>I reached down and grabbed her hand. \u201cI think that sounds like a real good idea.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at me as I led her through the crowd. I couldn\u2019t take her upstairs. It felt wrong. We were going to the bathroom. This wouldn\u2019t take long. Not with the image I had locked away from the dirty dreams I\u2019d been having of Amanda.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>My feet hurt from these heels I\u2019d been determined to wear. Jason was a great dancer, and he had made me forget other things and laugh. Willow and Marcus were cuddled up with each other at the corner of the dance floor, talking. I loved seeing them like that. I wouldn\u2019t go interrupt them to tell them bye. I\u2019d more than likely see Marcus tomorrow anyway.</p><p>\u201cThis was so much fun,\u201d Sadie said as she and Jax walked up to us. They had danced most of the night too. Someone came up and asked for Jax\u2019s autograph, and I heard Jason sigh. It had eased up earlier, but I guess now that we looked like we were leaving, people were anxious to get close to him before he was gone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was. I haven\u2019t had this much fun dancing in a long time,\u201d Jason agreed. I could feel his eyes on me, and I glanced up at him and returned his smile. I\u2019d been really good about not worrying if Preston was asleep in my room or if he was back at the party. But now we were about to walk back through the condo, and I was concerned about what I might find.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a day of packing tomorrow, or I\u2019d say we should stay and close the place down,\u201d Sadie said in a wistful tone. I knew she was excited about moving close to Jax.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to get out of these heels anyway,\u201d I assured her. I was more than ready to go home.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jax said as he handed the picture he had just signed back to the guest.</p><p>Jason and I led the way down the candlelit path leading back to the condo from the beach. His hand held mine and it was nice.</p><p>When we reached the doors to the condo, I took a deep breath, hoping I wouldn\u2019t see Preston. Praying he was asleep.</p><p>The party was still going strong inside the condo too. I spoke to several people as we passed by, and waved at those too far away. Just before we reached the front door, I saw in the corner of the room the shaggy blond hair that was impossible to miss. His back was to everyone else, and from the hands on his shoulders I could tell he had someone in front of him backed into that corner. My stomach twisted, and I tightened my hold on Jason\u2019s hand, then picked up speed. Getting out of here was suddenly very important. I didn\u2019t want that image in my head.</p><p>Just as I was about to turn my head away, Preston glanced back over his shoulder and our eyes met. The glassy look in his eyes was one that I was all too familiar with. His attention shifted from me to Jason, and then he winked at me. What was he doing?</p><p>I glared at him in return and opened the door, then stepped outside. He was such a jerk. A stupid, sexy, hard-to-get-over jerk.</p><p>The ringing of the telephone woke me up. Rubbing my eyes, I rolled over and reached for the cordless phone beside my bed. Mom had to be gone somewhere. She rarely let the phone ring more than three times.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you still sleeping?\u201d Marcus asked on the other end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up, sleepyhead. It\u2019s after ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm, whatya want?\u201d My eyes were still heavy. I\u2019d been up all night talking to Sadie. She\u2019d left early this morning for LA. It would be months before I saw her again.</p><p>\u201cI need a favor. I hate to ask you, but I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, I covered my yawn. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you aren\u2019t crazy about Preston after what he did at the party, but he\u2019s my best friend, and I need your help.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open wide, and I slung my legs over the side of the bed. I was instantly alert.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied, wanting him to get on with it.</p><p>\u201cHe is passed out on my sofa. He showed up at our apartment late last night and said he was a bastard and a few other things, then walked over and curled up on the sofa and went to sleep. Anyway, Low is gone to get Larissa, and I\u2019m at work. Can you go over there and get him up and gone? I don\u2019t want Low to have to deal with him. She\u2019ll have Larissa, and, well, you are probably going to have to throw water on him and help him get home. She can\u2019t do all that and take care of Larissa, too. I tried waking him up before I left, but he wouldn\u2019t budge and I was running late.\u201d</p><p>Explaining to my brother the reasons why I didn\u2019t want to do this would be bad. That was a secret that he\u2019d never know. I would do this for him one last time. That was it, though. After today, I was keeping my distance. I was. I meant it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll get him up and gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and frowned at it. Going to see Preston was a bad idea. However, I couldn\u2019t leave Willow there to handle him while she had Larissa to take care of.</p><p>Larissa was the daughter of Willow\u2019s sister and my father. My dad\u2019s affair with Willow\u2019s sister had almost destroyed Marcus and Willow when they\u2019d found out. It was bad enough that our dad was cheating on our mom, but to find out that he also had another child\u2014it had been really tough to deal with. Willow\u2019s sister was hard to like. For everyone. Including Willow. She\u2019d mistreated Willow for years. But Larissa was innocent in all this.</p><p>Willow was like a mother to Larissa. She was little and would want my attention too. I hadn\u2019t seen her in a couple of weeks. I missed her sweet face. I could get rid of Preston, then hang out with Willow and Larissa awhile.</p><p>I dialed Willow\u2019s number to let her know I was going to be at their apartment when she got back with Larissa. Once I was done, I got out of bed and decided I\u2019d forgo a shower and just pull my hair up. I didn\u2019t want to impress anyone, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Preston</p><p>\u201cGet up\u201d followed by a hard slap to my arm broke into my warm, happy dreams. The same sexy voice that had been begging me, \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d was now yelling at me. Shaking my head to clear it, I slowly forced my eyes open.</p><p>Amanda was glaring down at me with a glass in her hands. She stuck her hand into the glass, then flicked cold water at my face. What the hell?</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I croaked out, moving my arm to cover my face from any more attacks.</p><p>\u201cTrying to wake you up,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She was annoyed and she was gorgeous. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. No makeup. Nothing. She was perfect. I wanted to stare up at her very perfect body and face, but I was afraid of her tipping the entire glass of water over my head.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Preston. Get up,\u201d she begged. I liked that sound. Moving my arm away, I smiled up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou could always come down here,\u201d I replied, unable to stop myself.</p> <p>Her eyes flew open and then instantly narrowed. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t poured this entire glass of ice water on your head is because Marcus loves this old couch. But I\u2019m about to not care.\u201d</p><p>I sat up quickly. As sexy as she looked standing there all pissy, I didn\u2019t want ice water thrown at me. \u201cI\u2019m up, sweetheart. Why don\u2019t you put that glass down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now get on your shirt and leave. I saw your Jeep downstairs. You don\u2019t need a ride. Bye,\u201d she replied, then spun around. Her cute little ass was barely covered by those cutoff jean shorts. I was weak, and I\u2019d just been woken up by the star of my very naughty dream. I jumped up and wrapped my arms around her waist, pulling her back against my chest. Mmmm, she felt real good.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what are you doing?\u201d she asked in a flustered tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I was going to apologize. I didn\u2019t need to apologize, dammit\u2014I needed her to hate me. But she smelled so good and her bottom was pressing back against my morning hard-on, and I couldn\u2019t let her go without making sure she didn\u2019t hate me for being an ass the other day.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked in a cautious tone.</p><p>\u201cI was an asshole the other day. I shouldn\u2019t have talked to you that way. I don\u2019t want you to be so angry at me. I was having a bad day, and I took it out on you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I was the one begging now.</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh, and her chest rose and fell under her snug-fitting T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cThose titties are actually real nice. They\u2019re real, and I\u2019m betting they\u2019re soft and feel like fucking heaven.\u201d Shit, why\u2019d I say that?</p><p>Amanda stiffened in my arms. I should let go of her and move away. It was the right thing to do. I\u2019d apologized, and we needed to leave it at that. I was in her brother\u2019s apartment. I had an appointment with a client in three hours. Amanda was too sweet for me to touch.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>I could slide my hands up her stomach and cup her tits right now. She was going all relaxed in my arms. Leaning in to me. Ah, so good. NO!</p><p>I dropped my hands and stepped back. Amanda\u2019s posture went stiff. She didn\u2019t look back at me. I stood there trying to think of something to say, but nothing came to me.</p> <p>\u201cGet on your shirt and leave. Willow and Larissa are on their way back. Marcus wanted you gone before they got here,\u201d she said in a flat voice before walking away. I watched her until she walked into the guest bedroom and closed the door behind her.</p><p>I sank back down on the couch and dropped my head into my hands. Why did I keep doing this? I had to remember she was off-limits. Why did she have to come to me so easily? Didn\u2019t she know better than to get close to boys like me? She didn\u2019t need to let me touch her\u2014she needed to fight me off. But, damn, knowing she would welcome my touch was driving me fucking insane.</p><p>I looked around the room for my shirt and found it folded on the end of the sofa. Willow must have done that. I slipped it on, then felt in my pockets for my phone and my keys. Only my phone was there. My keys were probably in the Jeep. I should just go. Not say anything. Just go. She was right to hide from me.</p><p>I moved my feet to walk to the door and ended up heading for the room that Amanda had gone into. I just couldn\u2019t leave it like this.</p><p>\u201cManda,\u201d I called out, and knocked once before opening the door.</p><p>She was sitting on the bed with her legs folded up underneath her, staring out the window. She didn\u2019t turn and look back at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, stepping into the room.</p><p>She shrugged and kept her gaze fixed on the window looking out over the water.</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to talk to me now?\u201d I asked, taking a few more steps closer to the bed.</p><p>\u201cOur conversations don\u2019t typically end well,\u201d she replied.</p><p>And that was all my fault.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond right away. I watched her as she sat there. The late-morning sun was shining through the window, making her already perfect face look even more angelic. How did I always mange to hurt her? She didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt. Her dad had ripped her world apart this past year. She needed friends. People who would love her and not continually hurt her. Why couldn\u2019t I do that?</p><p>\u201cThis time you have nothing to be sorry for,\u201d she said. \u201cI got too close; you moved away. I got the hint. Not really a big deal. I\u2019m fine. Now just go.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. She really didn\u2019t understand guys at all.</p><p>\u201cManda, I backed away because I was letting something happen that shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re too good for me. You realize that, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m fucked up. My life is one screwed-up mess. As much as I\u2019d like to touch you\u2014because, baby, you\u2019re all kinds of irresistible\u2014I can\u2019t. I will never be good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Finally she turned her head and met my pleading gaze. I needed her to understand this. I\u2019d let her play this game too long, and I\u2019d enjoyed the hell out of it. Having her flirt with me had been something I looked forward to and dreaded at the same time.</p><p>\u201cFine. You don\u2019t want to be good enough for me, then you will never be. I deserve someone who wants to be what I need. It isn\u2019t like you will be my only crush. You were just my first. You taught me a lot about guys.\u201d She stood up and walked over to me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I deserve more. So much more than a guy who won\u2019t even kiss me while he\u2019s sliding in and out of me. I\u2019m good enough to be a quick fuck, but I\u2019m not good enough to kiss? Got it. Lesson learned.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was she talking about? We hadn\u2019t had sex. I would not forget having sex with Amanda Hardy.</p><p>\u201cBye, Preston. We\u2019re done here. Conversation over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda, what are you talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, interrupting me, and a little voice started calling out, \u201cMana! Mana! Are you?\u201d Larissa and Willow had returned.</p><p>Amanda walked past me and into the living room.</p><p>My head was spinning. What the fucking hell was she talking about?</p><p>\u201cHey you, pretty girl. I missed you,\u201d Amanda cooed.</p><p>\u201cMartus at work,\u201d Larissa told Amanda.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d</p><p>Larissa lifted her green eyes, and she found me standing back, watching them.</p><p>\u201cPweston here,\u201d she replied happily, and clapped her hands.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think through the spinning in my head to carry on a conversation with the kid. I had to get out of here. I wasn\u2019t going to get answers with Willow standing here between us.</p><p>\u201cHey there, gorgeous. You have fun with Manda and Low today, okay?\u201d I told her, then smiled at her as she waved at me.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Willow, for the sofa. Sorry I showed up here. It wasn\u2019t a good night,\u201d I explained.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell her that I\u2019d been to check on my brothers and sister and found out my mom had been gone for two days and they\u2019d been left alone at night. I\u2019d had to go hunt her down and threaten her with jail if she didn\u2019t get back home. She hated me more and more each day. But at least she was home now. I\u2019d also made sure Jimmy had a cell phone that he could keep hidden in his room so he could call me the next time something like this happened.</p><p>I\u2019d ended up drinking too much at the bar because I\u2019d been mad at myself for not going and checking on the kids sooner. I was turning out just like my mom. I had to stop drinking so damn much.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. It\u2019s always open if you need it,\u201d Willow replied.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said again, then headed for the door. I didn\u2019t look back at Amanda. She was done with me. Finally I\u2019d managed to push away the one female who may have actually given a shit. But what had she meant about \u201clesson learned\u201d? I needed the answer to that.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>\u201cThe tension was so thick I could cut it with a butter knife. What the heck was that all about?\u201d Willow asked, after the door closed behind Preston. I didn\u2019t want to tell her any of this. She would never understand, anyway. Then there was the chance she could slip up and tell Marcus, which would be horrible. As hurt and as angry as I was with Preston, I didn\u2019t want Marcus to hate him. Marcus was one of the few people who Preston had to turn to. I didn\u2019t like the idea of him being alone.</p><p>\u201cHe was pissed I woke him up with cold water. We argued. Y\u2019all came back in the middle of him being grumpy.\u201d</p><p>Willow didn\u2019t look like she believed me, but she nodded anyway. \u201cOkay. I won\u2019t pry. But let me just say that Preston is dangerous. He is adorable and sweet and fun loving, but something about him is dark. He has had a bad past. I know because he grew up down the road from me. I think he may have had things worse than I did. Just be careful about that, okay? You\u2019re still young, and you have been sheltered from so much. It isn\u2019t my business, but just be careful.\u201d</p><p>There was no need for this warning. But I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, what are we girls gonna do today?\u201d Willow asked, smiling down at Larissa.</p><p>\u201cSwim!\u201d Larissa cried out happily.</p><p>\u201cSwim it is,\u201d Willow agreed.</p><p>I would have to borrow one of Willow\u2019s swimsuits. I started to ask, when my cell phone started ringing in my purse. I walked over to the table where I\u2019d dropped my purse when I walked in, and pulled my phone out. Glancing down at the screen, I sighed when I saw Preston\u2019s name. What was he doing?</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said in the most annoyed tone I could manage.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find my keys. They aren\u2019t in the apartment or in my Jeep. Can I have a ride?\u201d</p><p>Dang it. When was I going to get some space from him? He was everywhere. I couldn\u2019t get over this thing I had for him if I was always having to be near him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, and hung up.</p><p>I looked back at Willow, who was standing there watching me. \u201cHe can\u2019t find his keys. I\u2019m going to drive him home. I\u2019m sure he has a spare set there.\u201d</p><p>Willow chewed nervously on her bottom lip. I knew she didn\u2019t like this, but then, neither did I.</p><p>\u201cWell, be careful. I\u2019ll let Marcus know you had to give him a ride.\u201d</p><p>I understood that innocent warning. It wasn\u2019t meant for me, but for Preston. I bent down and gave Larissa a kiss on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later. Save some water for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwim,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Smiling down at her, I headed for the door and downstairs. Maybe after I got him home I could put some distance between us.</p><p>Preston was leaning up against the passenger-side door of my car. He had on his Oakley sunglasses, and his arms were crossed over his chest, making the muscles flex. Why, oh why, did he have to be so freaking beautiful?</p><p>Even though I couldn\u2019t see his eyes through the dark lenses, I knew he was watching me. I could feel it. And unfortunately, I liked it. Or at least my body did.</p><p>\u201cSorry about this. Someone must have taken them so I wouldn\u2019t drive. Don\u2019t know who, though.\u201d</p><p>I unlocked the doors with my remote. I didn\u2019t have to talk to him if I didn\u2019t want to. I was giving him a ride only.</p><p>Sliding into the driver\u2019s seat, I buckled up and ignored him while he got in beside me. The black leather was warm already from the sunshine. Reaching over, I turned on the seat vents to cool them down. My dad may not be good for a lot of things, but he sure came in handy when I needed a car. His owning several Mercedes dealerships assured me that I\u2019d have the best when it came to vehicles.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean upstairs about not kissing you while I, uh, did other things?\u201d</p><p>What kind of game was he playing? Did he really want to relive this with me?</p><p>\u201cExactly what you think it means, Preston. You were there. You should know.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at me. I didn\u2019t glance over at him. I focused on driving.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be asking if I wasn\u2019t as confused as fucking hell right now.\u201d</p><p>How was he confused? I had been very specific. He hadn\u2019t kissed me once while we had sex. That was pretty dang clear.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to rehash this. It happened. We were acting like it didn\u2019t up until just now, so let\u2019s go back to that. M\u2019kay?</p><p>I tightened my hold on the steering wheel and turned into the traffic. Neither of us said anything for a few moments. Maybe he\u2019d decided to grant my request.</p><p>\u201cManda, are you telling me that we . . . had sex?\u201d</p><p>The disbelief in his voice was my first clue. Well, maybe it was the first clue that I\u2019d picked up on. I had missed the other clues. The ones where he didn\u2019t explain or frowned like I was crazy. But slowly it was dawning on me. He didn\u2019t remember!</p><p>If the humiliation could get any worse, it just did. He had forgotten we\u2019d had sex. I\u2019d given the jerk my virginity like an idiot, and he\u2019d been with so many girls he couldn\u2019t remember me. Wow. I thought I was over this rejection, but this new knowledge caused a lump in my throat. How could he?</p><p>\u201cManda, answer me, please. Before I force you to pull this car over and look at me.\u201d Preston\u2019s voice sounded panicked. Why? Didn\u2019t he forget girls he\u2019d screwed all the time? I was now one of many.</p><p>\u201cI just want to take you home and leave. Let\u2019s not talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Preston growled beside me, and threw his head back against the headrest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s a memory. Shit.\u201d</p><p>A dream? What was he talking about? Now I was confused.</p><p>\u201cManda, please tell me I didn\u2019t . . .\u201d He stopped and swallowed loudly, then took a deep breath. \u201cPlease tell me I didn\u2019t . . . I didn\u2019t have sex with you in a storage room. On boxes.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t exactly tell him that. So I didn\u2019t respond. I kept on driving.</p><p>\u201cFuck me!\u201d Preston roared, and balled up his hands into fists on his legs.</p><p>\u201cI already did that. Didn\u2019t end well,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Please don\u2019t say that.\u201d The emotion in his voice surprised me. Was it that big a deal that we\u2019d had sex? It hadn\u2019t been very memorable for him, obviously. So why was he having a breakdown about it now? I was the one who should be upset. Not him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d I replied as I pulled into the parking lot of his apartment building.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a dream,\u201d he said in a low voice. His head was still back on the headrest and his eyes were closed tightly. I felt a little sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell Marcus. If I was going to tell him, I would have done so by now.\u201d I was reassuring him. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I hated seeing him so upset.</p><p>Preston opened his eyes and looked at me. \u201cI\u2019m not upset because I think you\u2019re going to tell your brother.\u201d He let out a ragged sigh. \u201cBut I guess you\u2019d think that of me. Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have sex with different girls every night. I was one of them one night. Maybe just the first one that night. Who knows?\u201d The bitterness in my voice couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Preston\u2019s expression looked tortured. \u201cManda. I was drunk. Very, very drunk. I woke up the next morning and thought it was all a dream. I\u2019ve actually relived it many times in my dreams since then. I never realized I\u2019d . . . God, I can\u2019t believe I took you to a storage unit behind a bar.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair in frustration.</p><p>Okay. I couldn\u2019t take this anymore. He was beating himself up over this, and it was partly my fault. I\u2019d been the idiot, to go outside with him and allow what had happened to happen. I could have put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cI could have stopped it. I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t going to tell him that I\u2019d been fantasizing about having sex with him for years. That was the one piece of this secret I could keep to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you let me do that? You deserve so much more than that.\u201d He paused and stared at me intently. \u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t your first time.\u201d</p><p>Did I lie here? Or did I tell him the truth? Lying would make us both feel better. Or at least, it would make him feel better. I would think about it all the time.</p><p>\u201cI chose to do it. I wasn\u2019t drinking. I was completely sober that night, and I chose to let it be you.\u201d</p><p>Preston slung the car door open and got out. I sat there and watched him as he paced in front of the car. He ran his hands through his hair several times, and I caught myself wishing I could do that. I loved the way his hair felt. That night might be something I regret later in life when I meet the guy I marry, but right now I couldn\u2019t make myself regret it. I had a really good memory of Preston. Even if he hadn\u2019t kissed me and he\u2019d walked away and left me when it was over.</p><p>I sat in the car and watched Preston deal with this information more dramatically than I\u2019d expected him to. When he finally stopped pacing and looked at me, I opened the car door and got out.</p><p>\u201cI was your first. That night. I took your virginity in a shitty storage unit on a bunch of boxes.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. He was just stating the facts.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I was completely trashed?\u201d</p><p>No. I hadn\u2019t known that. I\u2019d known he had been drinking, but apparently I hadn\u2019t known he had been drinking that much. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again. That\u2019s it. I swear. I\u2019m done.\u201d He put both hands on the hood of my car and hung his head. \u201cI can never tell you how sorry I am. You should hate me for the rest of your life. That is no way for you to have lost your innocence. Damn, Manda. Someone needs to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be mad at him. Not when he was like this. I closed my door and walked over to stand beside him. Tentatively, I touched his shoulder. \u201cI wanted it to be you. I realize now that in order for it to be you, the way it happened was the only way it would ever happen. I think I\u2019m okay with it now.\u201d</p><p>Preston lifted his head and looked at me. \u201cWhy me? Why would you pick me?\u201d</p><p>The raw emotion in his voice was the only reason I decided to be honest. \u201cBecause I trusted you. I wanted you. I\u2019d wanted you for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>Preston shook his head and stood up. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Manda. You do not want me. Do you understand? I am not for you.\u201d</p><p>That hurt. I forced myself to nod. I got it. He didn\u2019t want anything to happen between us. I needed to move on.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I managed to say firmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be able to forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him say that hurt even more. He was much more upset about this than I would have thought. I\u2019d known he didn\u2019t want to cross any lines with me, but I\u2019d just realized how sincere that desire was. He truly never intended to allow anything to happen with us. It was a painful realization.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. I got what I wanted. It\u2019s over,\u201d I told him, then turned and walked back to my car. I was moving on from this now. This was my closure.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to stop me. He just stood there and watched me drive away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Preston</p><p>It was off-season for me. Other than workouts, I was free after classes. Last year I\u2019d started partying early every day. This year things would be different.</p><p>I pulled up in front of the youth football fields. According to the paperwork I\u2019d filled out for Brent to play, his practices would be here every Tuesday and Thursday from five thirty to seven.</p> <p>I made my way over to the side of the fence where parents were sitting on lawn chairs and watching. When I finally got to play baseball, parents had always shown up for our practices too. My mom, of course, never came. I knew she\u2019d never come to Brent\u2019s practices or his games. I didn\u2019t want him to feel as unwanted as I had. I could change that for him. I could be here. Cheering him on. He wouldn\u2019t know that kind of rejection and loneliness.</p><p>When I got to the gate, I watched the boys warming up and doing stretches and tried to figure out which little guy was Brent. Little boys in football pads and helmets all look the same.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look old enough to have a son out there. You must be someone\u2019s big brother,\u201d an older female voice said from behind me.</p><p>I glanced back over my shoulder to see someone\u2019s mom smiling up at me from her chair. She was close to forty, but she was dressed like she was in her early twenties. I could tell from her inexpensive, snug-fitting clothing that she couldn\u2019t afford me. Besides, I wasn\u2019t working right now. I was here for Brent.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. My brother is playing this year,\u201d I replied. Women her age hated it when I called them \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d It made me smile. She\u2019d back off now.</p> <p>I turned back to the field just as the coach called out, \u201cGo get water.\u201d</p><p>The boys pulled off their helmets and came running over to the fence where the large containers of water were lined up.</p><p>Brent\u2019s eyes locked with mine, and he paused before a big smile broke out on his face. He passed the line for water and came straight for me.</p><p>\u201cPreston! You\u2019re here.\u201d The excitement in his voice made my heart ache a little.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m here. You\u2019re practicing. I didn\u2019t want to miss this.\u201d</p><p>Brent\u2019s chest puffed up. \u201cI get to play running back. Coach said I got speed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah, you got speed. You\u2019re related to me.\u201d</p><p>The toothy grin on his face just got bigger. \u201cI gotta get water and get back out there. You gonna be here until I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d had any other plans I\u2019d have canceled them. The hopeful look on his face was impossible to ignore.</p><p>\u201cYep. You and me are gonna go get a big fat cheeseburger when this is over, and then I\u2019ll take you back home.\u201d</p><p>Brent whooped, then waved before running over to the water line. He kept glancing over at me to make sure I hadn\u2019t moved. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re related to Brent Carey?\u201d The surprised tone in the woman\u2019s voice behind me didn\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p>My protective instincts kicked in, and I turned around to look at her. \u201cYes, I am. He\u2019s my little brother,\u201d I replied, daring her to say anything about him. I didn\u2019t care if she was a woman. I wasn\u2019t going to let her catty, gossiping mouth say or do anything to hurt Brent.</p><p>\u201cOh, well. It\u2019s just that no one ever comes around for him. Not at school or anything. I didn\u2019t realize he had an older brother.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t deserve an explanation. But dammit, I didn\u2019t want her talking about my family. I knew what it was like to have the mothers of the other kids talk about you and your family. It hurt. Kids shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that.</p><p>\u201cHe does\u201d was my only reply. I turned my attention back to the field. Brent was watching me as he got into position. I was going to ignore the snide comments from idiots who had nothing better to do than talk about other people.</p><p>For the next hour and a half I watched Brent practice. He was good. Better than good, and his coach was right. The kid was fast. He needed some gloves if he was going to be handling the ball that much. We\u2019d go get those tonight.</p><p>After we purchased the receiving gloves and Brent was one happy kid, we made our way to the Pickle Shack. This was the one place in town to get a good burger. That, and I knew Brent liked the arcade games inside.</p><p>I followed Brent inside and told the hostess we needed a table for two.</p><p>\u201cA booth okay?\u201d she asked, batting her eyelashes at me.</p><p>The girl was maybe sixteen. Damn, they learned young. I nodded, and she spun around and strutted toward a booth in the corner. I fell in step behind Brent, but my feet stopped when my eyes locked with Amanda\u2019s. She was sitting at a large curved booth with three other girls and two guys. I hadn\u2019t seen her since she\u2019d left me in the parking lot of my apartment building three days ago. I\u2019d thought about her endlessly but I had kept my distance. Seeing her here was a jolt. The time away from her had almost helped me deal with what I\u2019d done, but looking into her pretty green eyes now, I knew I\u2019d never get over it. She was so damn sweet, and I was the world\u2019s largest ass.</p><p>\u201cYou coming, Preston?\u201d Brent asked, shaking me out of my trance. I tore my gaze off Amanda and made my way to our booth. I wanted tonight to be about Brent. I didn\u2019t need images of Amanda\u2019s hurt expression haunting me. I also didn\u2019t need to see her sitting so close to some dipshit who wasn\u2019t good enough for her. I didn\u2019t know him, but I knew he wasn\u2019t good enough. No one was.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re they?\u201d Brent asked, looking at me curiously, then back at the booth where Amanda was now studying her drink and twisting her straw nervously.</p><p>\u201cUh, no one,\u201d I replied, opening my menu.</p><p>\u201cThat pretty blond girl keeps looking at you,\u201d Brent said, a little too loudly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I glanced over at her again. Brent was right. She was looking at me. A small smile tugged at the corner of her very full lips. I hadn\u2019t kissed those lips. She didn\u2019t understand why, but I did. Even drunk, I\u2019d known some things were too good for me. Those perfect lips were off-limits to someone like me. I didn\u2019t deserve to get a taste. I wished to God I\u2019d been that smart about the rest of her body. Instead, I\u2019d taken her completely. I had dreams to prove it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend\u2019s sister,\u201d I explained, and shifted my attention back to my menu.</p><p>\u201cWhich friend?\u201d Brent asked curiously. I wanted to tell him to drop it, but I didn\u2019t want to upset him. He was sensitive about things like that. Our mother being an uninvolved parent made him careful who he trusted. Normally, he was quiet. With me he talked. I liked that.</p><p>\u201cMarcus Hardy. You haven\u2019t met him.\u201d</p><p>Brent nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you talk about Marcus before. Momma says he has lots of money. Does that mean she has lots of money too? \u2019Cause she\u2019s really pretty, and I think she likes you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Kids were way too observant. \u201cYeah. She has money, but you\u2019re wrong about liking me. She actually doesn\u2019t care for me that much.\u201d</p><p>Brent let out a sigh. \u201cIt stinks being poor. The pretty girls never like you.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. I hated hearing him say something like that.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get older, it won\u2019t be about money. Right now girls listen to what their mommas tell them. That won\u2019t always be the case.\u201d</p><p>Brent frowned, then looked back over to the table where Amanda was sitting. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna leave with that guy. He\u2019s whispering in her ear, but she\u2019s still watching you.\u201d</p><p>It was real hard to ignore her when Brent was giving me a detailed description of what she was doing now. I looked over at her, and she was standing up with the group she\u2019d been sitting with. The guy\u2019s head was bent and he was saying something awfully close to her ear, but Brent was right. Her attention was focused on me. And I liked it. No use in denying it. I loved the hell out of it. I wanted her attention. I wanted her to want me, because I sure as hell wanted her.</p><p>She shook her head to whatever the guy said, and then told him bye. I was relieved. The idea of her going anywhere with some guy alone made me ill. I knew what he was wanting. I didn\u2019t blame him, but I sure as hell didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Amanda started toward us. Shit.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming over here,\u201d Brent announced in awe.</p><p>I was a little surprised too. I hadn\u2019t expected her to actually acknowledge me. She wasn\u2019t wearing shorts tonight. All those legs were covered up by a pair of very snug jeans. Didn\u2019t help. It only fueled my imagination.</p><p>\u201cHello, Preston,\u201d she said, smiling at me. The nervous look in her eyes was the only thing that gave away the fact that this hadn\u2019t been an easy decision. She looked over at Brent. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Amanda.\u201d</p><p>Brent beamed up at her. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Brent. Preston is my big brother.\u201d</p><p>A softness touched Amanda\u2019s smile. The tightness from her nerves was now gone. Well, damn. Having her see anything redeeming about me was not a good thing. I needed her to want to stay away from me, because God knew I wasn\u2019t strong enough to tell her no.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Brent. I can see the resemblance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brent asked, surprised.</p><p>Amanda laughed, and it made my heart rate pick up. \u201cYes, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sit with us?\u201d Brent asked, scooting over to give her some room to sit down.</p><p>Amanda shifted her eyes to me, and I could see the uncertainty there. \u201cI . . . um . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d both like you to join us if you want to,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>She smiled and slid into the booth beside Brent.</p><p>\u201cHave you already eaten?\u201d Brent asked, shoving the menu into her hands. He was anxious to get her to stay. It was pretty damn funny. The kid had good taste.</p><p>\u201cI might eat a dessert. I\u2019ve already had a burger and fries,\u201d she replied, smiling over at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool,\u201d Brent said, taking the menu back to look at it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop looking at her. She was so close. I\u2019d had three days to let it sink in that the hot, intense dream I kept having about Amanda was very real. I\u2019d touched her. I\u2019d been inside her. All I could think about now was how I wanted to do it again sober. I wanted to kiss her and make sure she knew just how much I wanted her. I wanted to hear those sexy sounds that had been haunting my dreams clearly so I could remember them when I was alone.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked, breaking into my thoughts about how much I wanted her naked and under me again.</p><p>\u201cGood. I guess. I\u2019ve been thinking about things.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and shifted my eyes to Brent, who was reading the menu, before looking back at her.</p><p>\u201cMe too. I\u2019m sorry about how things came out.\u201d</p><p>Why was she sorry? I was the only one who should be sorry. \u201cManda, you have nothing to be sorry about. That was all on me.\u201d</p><p>A small grin tugged at the corner of her lips. Could they be any sexier? \u201cMaybe. But I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a cheeseburger,\u201d Brent announced, handing the menu to me. I needed the reminder that we had an audience. I\u2019d almost said something Brent didn\u2019t need to hear.</p><p>\u201cGood choice. It\u2019s what I always get,\u201d Amanda told him.</p><p>\u201cPreston brought me here once before and I had a cheeseburger. It was good. But I had to share my fries with Daisy \u2019cause she forgot to ask for some and wanted some once I got mine. It was annoying.\u201d</p><p>Amanda glanced back at me. \u201cWho\u2019s Daisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little sister. Preston treats her like a baby. She ain\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Amanda\u2019s face softened. She liked that.</p><p>\u201cPreston has a thing for females. I\u2019m sure his little sister is no different,\u201d Amanda told Brent.</p><p>Brent nodded. \u201cYeah, I know. Momma says he\u2019s got a different girl every night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Brent.\u201d I stopped him before he could get too out of hand. Brent grinned and ducked his head. He knew what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Amanda stifled a laugh, and her eyes twinkled with amusement as she looked at me through her long lashes.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Brent was adorable. He was Preston\u2019s Mini-Me. I listened to him tell me about football practice and how his first game was coming up. Preston had signed Brent up and paid for him to play football this year, and Brent was extremely grateful. Something that small was a big deal to him. It made me wonder just how bad off Preston\u2019s family was. I knew he\u2019d grown up on the rough side of town, but I didn\u2019t know exactly how bad it was.</p><p>\u201cSo, can you come to my game next Saturday?\u201d Brent asked, breaking into my thoughts. I hadn\u2019t been expecting an invite. Peeking over at Preston, who was watching me closely, I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. I didn\u2019t want to let Brent down, but I also didn\u2019t want Preston to think I was using his brother to get to him. I didn\u2019t want to get to him again. I\u2019d done that. It hadn\u2019t ended well.</p><p>\u201cUm, well, I\u2019d love to come to your game. If that\u2019s okay . . . with everyone. . . .\u201d I trailed off, waiting for Preston to tell Brent why this wouldn\u2019t be okay.</p><p>\u201cCool, yeah, it\u2019s fine. Preston will be there too. You can sit with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bud, that\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t pressure Manda into anything. I\u2019m sure she has plans.\u201d</p><p>There was the excuse I was waiting on Preston to throw in the path. I watched as Brent\u2019s face fell, and I didn\u2019t care anymore what Preston wanted. If he was worried about me coming there for him, then he could get over it. I wasn\u2019t turning down Brent\u2019s innocent invitation just to appease Preston.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Can I bring a friend? He likes football too.\u201d I had no idea who I was bringing, but it felt like the right thing to say at the moment. Letting Preston know I didn\u2019t plan on coming to see him or sit by him was my main goal. I\u2019d find a \u201cfriend\u201d later.</p><p>\u201cYeah! Cool. Bring whoever you want.\u201d Brent\u2019s eyes lit up. I could ignore the adult Preston, but the little boy who looked so much like him, with innocent hope in his eyes\u2014I couldn\u2019t turn that down.</p><p>A short snippet of \u201cWanted\u201d by Hunter Hayes played on my phone, alerting me to a text message. I needed the small distraction. I pulled my phone out of my purse and looked down to see Jason Stone\u2019s name on the screen.</p><p>Jason: Can I call you?</p><p>The reminder I needed that getting near Preston Drake was a bad idea. Jason was a good idea. He was safe. I glanced up at Preston. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you two to your dinner. I\u2019ve got a call to make, and I need to get home. I have an early class in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s forced smile didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Why was he annoyed? I turned my attention to Brent. \u201cI\u2019ll be at your game. Have Preston text me the details,\u201d I told him.</p><p>His big grin was worth the uncomfortable situation he had put me in.</p><p>\u201cI will. See ya then,\u201d Brent replied.</p><p>I nodded and slid out of the seat. I waved bye to both of them and headed for the door. Once I was outside, I texted Jason.</p><p>Me: Yes.</p><p>My phone rang just as I was buckling my seat belt.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not disturbing you, am I?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d More like giving me a good reason to get the hell away from Preston.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. How were your first two days of classes?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out onto the almost deserted road. During the summer you couldn\u2019t get out on this road this time of night. It would take hours to get a couple miles. But all the vacationers had gone home for the new school year. Although the weather was still warm, the crowds were gone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been good so far. Tomorrow may change things, though. I\u2019m taking calculus, and I am getting supernervous about it. What about you? Are your classes going well?\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled into the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve had two classes so far, and I hate them both. Maybe tomorrow will be better. But calculus first year? Really? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>Math was my thing. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m a math person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What\u2019s your major?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cUm, I\u2019m having a few arguments with my parents about that. I\u2019ll get back to you on it.\u201d Weird. His parents were arguing with him about his major? \u201cThe reason I called wasn\u2019t to bore you with talk about our courses. I was wondering if maybe you\u2019d be free anytime in the next month?\u201d He ended his question with an amused chuckle.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah . . . I think I have some openings in my schedule,\u201d I replied, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThen my next question is, how soon would your schedule be opening up? I was thinking of flying down . . . soon.\u201d</p><p>This was the right thing to do. Jason liked me. He wasn\u2019t pushing me away and giving me warnings. \u201cHow about next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Preston</p><p>Calculus. Why the hell did I agree to calculus? Passing this class would be a miracle. Keeping my grades up was part of the deal with my scholarship. If I failed a class, then I lost it. I couldn\u2019t lose this. If I played this season the way I played last season, I should have my next two years at a state college covered. I had to pass this one class first. I\u2019d been putting it off. It was time I faced it.</p><p>Walking into the room, I did a quick scan for a desk close to the front. Instead, my eyes found Amanda. She was laughing at something another girl was telling her, while some guy was leaning on her desk looking directly down her shirt while laughing along with whatever the other girl was saying. The douche.</p> <p>Amanda was close enough to the front. A few girls called out my name as I walked toward her, but I ignored them. I kept my focus on Amanda. Her eyes lifted to meet mine as I made my way to her. The smile on her lips faltered. She was trying to keep her distance because she was smart. I was the asshole not allowing it. I should be letting her run, but every little inch she pulled back I confused her. I was a shithead. This realization wasn\u2019t going to keep me from sitting beside her, though. The other guy needed to back the fuck off. His eyes were looking places they hadn\u2019t been invited. Manda needed a damn bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cHey, Preston,\u201d the brunette who had been making Amanda laugh greeted me first. The cooing tone of her voice was familiar. She was interested. She knew what I was like, and she was still willing. I got that a lot. I managed a small smile and nodded, but I didn\u2019t take my eyes off Amanda\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey, Manda,\u201d I said as I took the seat on the other side of her.</p><p>\u201cPreston. Uh, hey.\u201d Her nervous reply was expected. She didn\u2019t want me near her. I couldn\u2019t blame her or take offense.</p><p>\u201cYou taking calculus first semester of college? I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019ve been putting it off.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda shrugged a shoulder. \u201cI like math.\u201d</p><p>Calculus was not math. It was a fucking science experiment gone wrong. I started to reply when the guy standing beside her cleared his throat. I glanced up at him with an annoyed snarl. Why was he still standing there?</p><p>\u201cYou took my seat,\u201d he said.</p><p>Now, that made me smile. \u201cThen I guess you should have been sitting in it.\u201d</p><p>I turned my attention back to Amanda, whose bright pink cheeks told me this was embarrassing her. I didn\u2019t want to do that, either.</p><p>\u201cI may need help. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re good with numbers,\u201d I told her, leaning back and getting comfortable. The guy started to say something else, and I cut my eyes back his way in a silent warning. I wasn\u2019t moving, but I\u2019d sure as hell move his ass.</p> <p>He let out a loud sigh and moved away. Smart boy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Preston?\u201d Amanda whispered as she leaned over toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean, Manda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Why are you sitting here? I thought we\u2019d agreed to keep our distance. After . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to keep my distance. I might not get to have her again, but I liked being near her. She made me happy. She made the darkness not seem too smothering. \u201cI want to be friends,\u201d I explained, watching her chew her bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cHow can we do that?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>I had no idea. All I wanted to do was cuddle her up and keep her. That wasn\u2019t an option, though. \u201cWe just do.\u201d</p><p>The worried look in her eyes made me feel guilty. I was asking her for something that she wasn\u2019t ready for. But I needed it.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you want,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>The professor walked in and started talking, so our conversation was over. For now.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at me during the entire class, and I had a problem looking at anything but her. Was the memory of what we\u2019d done going to drive me insane? Normally, once I slept with a girl and I was over any attraction, I moved on. But something about Amanda was holding me. Was it because I was drunk and the memories are so blurry?</p><p>Once class was over, Amanda stood up quickly, grabbed her books, and shoved them into her backpack. She was in a hurry to get away from me. Not what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou have another class?\u201d I asked, standing up and stretching.</p><p>Amanda looked over at me and her eyes zeroed in on my lower stomach. I lowered my arms slowly and my shirt covered back up the patch of skin she\u2019d been checking out. The appreciative gleam in her eyes had me wanting to strip the damn shirt off. If that was what it took to hold her attention, I\u2019d do it.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2014uh\u2014no. Not right now,\u201d she stammered as she pulled her backpack up higher on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWant to go get some coffee? I didn\u2019t have time for any this morning.\u201d</p><p>Amanda glanced back at the door, and the girl who\u2019d been talking to her before class stood waiting on her. \u201cI was going to the library, but I wouldn\u2019t mind some caffeine first,\u201d she replied, looking back at me.</p><p>Yes. She had caved easy enough. \u201cCan we go alone? I wanted to talk to you about some things.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit, and I could see the understanding. Did she want to pretend it hadn\u2019t happened? I wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me go tell Kelsey I\u2019ll meet up with her later.\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Why was I doing this? I deserved the Stupid Award. But then again, how was a girl supposed to tell those pretty blue eyes of Preston\u2019s no? It was impossible. When he set out to get your attention, he was insanely hard to ignore. He hadn\u2019t made peace with what had happened between us. I knew that was what all this was about. He needed to feel okay with everything. He and Marcus were close. He probably felt guilty. The sooner I eased his guilt, the sooner I could get my distance. This friends thing was not what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t friends with girls. He had friends. Lots of friends. None of them were female.</p><p>Once we got outside the math building, I grabbed Preston\u2019s arm and pulled him away from the crowd and underneath an oak tree. There was no need for us to go get coffee and pretend. It would only give him a chance to get more under my skin than he already was.</p><p>\u201cListen, I know what\u2019s bothering you. I get it. This is about Marcus. So whatever you need me to do to ease your conscience so you can go on with your happy-go-lucky self, just tell me. Let\u2019s not pretend that we\u2019re going to be friends. Because honestly, I can\u2019t be your friend. It would never work.\u201d</p><p>Preston stood silently staring at me while my little \u201cclearing of the air\u201d became a full-blown rant. I hadn\u2019t meant to get carried away, but I had. Just looking at him and feeling my body get all excited by his nearness made me mad. What did the guy have to do to me to make me hate him?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Marcus. I wish to hell it was. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d Preston reached out and put a hand on my waist and pulled me closer to him. Oh my. Not what I was expecting. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you, Manda. I try. I try all the damn time, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wow. My knees were a little weak.</p><p>\u201cI want to be near you. I can\u2019t seem to keep away.\u201d</p><p>Double wow. I couldn\u2019t form words at the moment. A strand of his pale blond hair was falling in his eye, and I wanted to tuck it behind his ear. To touch it. But I didn\u2019t. He pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cCan we be friends? Will you forgive me for that night?\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cfriends\u201d was back again. I hated that word. I had never been friends with anyone who made my heart race and my body tingle. How could I even manage that kind of relationship?</p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>His hand slid behind my back and settled on the curve above my bottom. Friends didn\u2019t stand like this. He wasn\u2019t doing a very good job with this friends thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good. I promise. I\u2019ll be the best damn friend you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d His voice had lowered into a husky whisper. I shivered from the sexy sound.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, I\u2019m gonna have to work on that,\u201d Preston added. \u201cFeeling you shiver. I like it. I\u2019m gonna want to feel it more.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and tried to control the emotion in my voice. \u201cFriends don\u2019t get this close, Preston,\u201d I said, and I started to take a step back when he pulled me tightly against him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Manda, they don\u2019t. But I can\u2019t stop wanting you close. Can we be close friends?\u201d He asked, lowering his head until his warm breath tickled my ear. Closing my eyes tightly, I grabbed his arms to keep myself steady. What was he doing? \u201cI like you close. Real close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your fucking mind?\u201d Cage York\u2019s voice broke the spell I\u2019d fallen under, and I found the power to shove away from Preston.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Cage,\u201d Preston snarled, turning his heavy-lidded eyes from me to Cage.</p><p>\u201cAnd let you get the shit beat out of you? \u2019Cause if you touch her, not one of those buddies of yours is gonna have your back when Marcus kills you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said to back the hell off.\u201d</p><p>Cage smirked and shook his head. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna do that. You can go find another fuck buddy. Amanda is off-limits. You hurt her, then you hurt Low. I can\u2019t let that happen. So you see, this gets personal.\u201d</p><p>Cage had always been protective of Willow. They\u2019d grown up together and were best friends. Marcus had issues with it sometimes, but over time he had started accepting it more and more. Especially since Cage had fallen in love with Eva.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends. Leave this alone.\u201d Preston turned to face Cage. This wasn\u2019t looking good.</p><p>\u201cCage, he\u2019s right. We are just friends. Let it go. We aren\u2019t and will never be anything more than friends. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Cage shifted his eyes from Preston to me. The concern and disbelief in his eyes as he met my pleading gaze was hard to miss. He didn\u2019t believe either of us. But this really wasn\u2019t his business.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cage drawled. \u201cBut I\u2019d make sure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>Cage gave me one last nod, then turned and headed for the math building we\u2019d just exited.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is one of the many reasons our being friends might be a problem. Everyone knows you aren\u2019t friends with girls.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like we could tell them that he\u2019d already bagged me and was over it.</p><p>\u201cCage York is the last person on earth either of us needs to take advice from. Sure, I\u2019ve never been friends with a girl before, but there has never been anyone I wanted to be friends with. You\u2019re different. I want to keep you close.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to do the right thing here. I was going to do the stupid thing.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Friends it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s face broke into a big grin that made my stupid decision seem brilliant in the moment.</p><p>\u201cCan we go get that coffee now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Lead the way,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Several girls looked our way as we walked across the street to the campus coffee shop. Preston did a real good job of ignoring them. I\u2019d known him long enough to know he normally didn\u2019t ignore it at all. He typically measured them up with one quick glance and decided he was interested or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you drink?\u201d Preston asked as he walked us over to a table inside in the back corner.</p><p>\u201cOne of those icy coffee things. Anything mocha.\u201d I hadn\u2019t tried the coffee options out here yet, so I didn\u2019t have a specific order.</p><p>\u201cGot it. The girliest drink they have,\u201d he replied with a wink, and turned to head to the counter to order. There weren\u2019t a lot of people inside. Several were outside under the umbrellas, but inside it was almost empty.</p><p>My phone played, alerting me to a text message. Pulling my phone out, I glanced down to see Kelsey reminding me that we had study group for economics tonight. When a class came with a built-in tutor to help you get through it, then you knew you were in trouble. I intended to make every study group the tutor offered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called an Ice Rageous, for future orders,\u201d Preston said as he set a drink in front of me that was topped with whipped cream and caramel.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied as I watched him sink down into the seat across from me.</p><p>\u201cYou can also order \u2018girlie drink\u2019 and the guy behind the counter knows what you mean.\u201d The teasing tone of his voice made me laugh. I\u2019d never really had an actual conversation with Preston that didn\u2019t involve pre-sex or drama. This was nice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Preston took a drink of his coffee and leaned forward on his elbows, watching me. \u201cWhy do I make you nervous, Manda?\u201d</p><p>Why did he make me nervous? How was I supposed to answer that? Maybe because I\u2019d had a crush on him for years, I\u2019d given him my virginity, and he was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. Well, I mean, you do, but we\u2019ve never really talked before. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>Preston set his cup down, but his eyes never left my face. \u201cThen why did you go outside with me at the club? I can\u2019t let that go. I keep going back to the fact that you went out there with me. Why?\u201d</p><p>If we were going to be friends, I needed to be honest with him. At least mostly honest with him. I was working on getting over him, so that wouldn\u2019t be an entire lie.</p><p>\u201cI had a crush on you. I\u2019d had one for years. I wanted to be the one you took home that night. That didn\u2019t happen, exactly. We made it to your Jeep, and then you hauled me off to the storage shed. I got over my crush after that night.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly true, but close enough. He didn\u2019t need the gory details. Or to know that I still used him as inspiration at night when I needed to feel him again. I wasn\u2019t sharing that piece of info either.</p><p>\u201cYou had a crush on me?\u201d he repeated, and muttered a curse. \u201cManda, I\u2019m so sorry. I wish I\u2019d been sober.\u201d</p><p>I laughed for the first time since we\u2019d started this uncomfortable conversation again. \u201cHad you been sober, I would still be living in my fantasy world that one day you\u2019d look at me and want me too. That night finally rid me of that delusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured out you were too good for me that night.\u201d The tight, pained look in Preston\u2019s eyes confused me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I figured out that I am never going to be \u2018that girl\u2019\u2014the kind you\u2019re attracted to. I\u2019m okay with that now.\u201d</p><p>Preston reached out and took my chin in his hands, and lifted my face until my eyes met his. \u201cThere are a lot of things that I\u2019m not. But trust me when I tell you I\u2019m more attracted to you than is safe for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda, hey!\u201d someone interrupted us. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while. And Preston Drake, let go of Marcus\u2019s little sister before I slap you for her.\u201d Jess, Rock\u2019s cousin and the town slut, pulled out the chair on the other side of Preston.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cLeave, Jess,\u201d Preston said in an annoyed tone as his hand left my face.</p><p>\u201cTsk-tsk, touchy, touchy. Cool down, lover boy. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree with this one. She ain\u2019t your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. We\u2019re friends,\u201d he snapped. leaning back in his chair and taking a drink of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped coming to Live Bay and drinking with me, Amanda. Wondered what happened to you. We had a few fun nights,\u201d Jess said, grinning at me with a wicked twinkle in her eye.</p><p>Back this summer after Preston had left me in that storage room, I\u2019d done everything I could to get his attention, including drinking and partying with Jess. But one night when a guy had gotten a little too out of hand and Dewayne had showed up and beat his face in\u2014that had been my last night out with Jess. It had been the wake up call I\u2019d needed. I wasn\u2019t that kind of girl. I never would be. And no amount of partying was going to get Preston to look at me again. He\u2019d had his fill.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you going off to college? Auburn or some crazy shit like that?\u201d</p><p>The main reason I wasn\u2019t going was sitting across from me listening to every word I said. \u201cYeah, I was. But I didn\u2019t want to miss the wedding planning for Marcus and Willow. And my mom still needs me. She isn\u2019t ready for me to leave her just yet. Especially with Marcus getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure about that?\u201d Jess asked with a knowing look on her face.</p><p>I\u2019d probably told her something I shouldn\u2019t have one of the nights I drank too much. Dang it. I hadn\u2019t thought about that. Maybe my little secret wasn\u2019t as secret as I\u2019d thought. I was no better than Preston. Dewayne knew something. Now Jess. Crap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d I replied with a forced smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done with the twenty questions, Jess, we were talking about calculus. You can leave now,\u201d Preston said, setting his cup down on the table. His long tanned fingers wrapped around the cup made me think of the other things I\u2019d felt those hands do.</p><p>\u201cCalculus my ass,\u201d Jess replied, standing up. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally go sniffing back around where you\u2019ve already been.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s annoyed frown transformed into a furious glare, and he slowly stood up. \u201cWhatever the hell you think you know, you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t care who your cousin is. Friend or not. You won\u2019t repeat any of it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jess raised her eyebrows and met his glare with one of her own. \u201cI\u2019d never repeat a word. But not because your sorry ass threatened me\u2014because I like Amanda. That\u2019s the only reason. \u2019Cause, Preston Drake, I\u2019d love to see you hung up by your balls.\u201d Jess swung her gaze to me and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya around, Amanda.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but I was afraid to say anything else. I\u2019d obviously told Jess about Preston and me. This was humiliating. Who else had I told while I\u2019d had my few weeks of drunkenness?\u201d</p><p>Jess spun around and strutted out the door. It took all my courage to look at Preston again. He was studying his coffee cup. Guess he was wondering who all I\u2019d told too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you won the loyalty of that one. She\u2019s a mean bitch,\u201d Preston finally said, lifting his gaze to meet my anxious one.</p><p>I shrugged. I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d managed that either. But we\u2019d bonded over vodka. Weird but true. \u201cJess is misunderstood. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Preston chuckled. \u201cNo, Manda. Jess is a conniving, manipulative slut. She doesn\u2019t make friends with females. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I replied, needing to defend her.</p><p>Preston raised one eyebrow and twisted his cup around in his hands as he held my gaze. \u201cWe\u2019ll agree to disagree. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He let out a weary sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t know those drunk episodes of yours this summer were with Jess. I thought those two times I found you and took you home were flukes. It was your attempt at rebelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were my attempt at rebelling. I figured out pretty quick it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I knew he wasn\u2019t ready for this answer. Giving him something else to feel guilty about wasn\u2019t what I wanted. Instead, I shrugged, reached for my drink, and took a sip through the straw.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it wasn\u2019t because of what I did. . . .\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to lie to him, but this was one of those instances when lying was the best policy. \u201cNo, Preston. It had nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>The relief on his face made me glad I\u2019d lied.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any more classes today?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t. I was going with Willow to pick out bridesmaid dresses, and we were taking Larissa with us to find her a flower girl dress. \u201cNo, this is my easiest day of the week.\u201d</p><p>Preston tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got to head to the gym to work out with the team, but later you want to do something? Maybe help me figure out what the hell we did in class today? I\u2019ll buy you a meal.\u201d</p><p>He was really determined to do this friends thing and get free tutoring out of it too. As much as I\u2019d like to spend time with him, I knew it was bad. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m going with Willow and Larissa to pick out bridesmaid dresses and Larissa\u2019s flower girl dress.\u201d</p><p>Preston titled his head to the side, and the blond hair that brushed his shoulders drew my attention. He looked like one of those airbrushed models in a magazine. No guy should be that perfect-looking. It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cWhat about after? Stores close at six. You should be free then.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I\u2019d probably be home even earlier than that, but I had to have some self-preservation. \u201cYes, but I have an economics study group tonight,\u201d I said, slipping my purse back up on my shoulder. I needed to head to Willow and Marcus\u2019s to pick her and Larissa up. And I needed to get out of here before Preston convinced me to forgo my good sense.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. He leaned back in his chair and stared up at me with those sexy you-know-you-want-me eyes of his.</p><p>With a firm nod, I said, \u201cSee you around,\u201d before walking swiftly to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Preston</p><p>As much as I\u2019d wanted Amanda to take me up on tonight, I was glad she\u2019d shot me down. Thirty minutes after she\u2019d left me in the coffee shop, I\u2019d gotten a call from a client. This one was single, in her mid-forties, and had had enough plastic surgery to look like she\u2019d just turned thirty. She owned a few upscale salons and was in town on business. I never had advance notice with her, but she paid well, so when she called, I went. Funds were low because I\u2019d just paid my mom\u2019s rent. Plus I\u2019d had to cover the initial payment for Jimmy\u2019s braces.</p><p>Walking into Live Bay, where I knew at least one of my friends would be, I decided that after doing what I\u2019d just had to do, a drink was called for. This didn\u2019t used to bother me. I could go entertain a paying MILF with no problem. But when Amanda surfaced this summer in my dreams, I\u2019d had to start playing a role. Sex for money was suddenly dirty. It was wrong. I had a fucking conscience I hadn\u2019t asked for, all thanks to a pair of pretty green eyes and full, all-natural lips.</p> <p>I stopped by the bar and picked up the shot of tequila waiting on me. They knew me well around here. We\u2019d been coming to this place since before it was legal for us to drink. Small coastal towns didn\u2019t have a lot of entertainment. Live Bay was it.</p><p>Dewayne was at our table watching me as I walked over to them. Cage had Eva in his lap, whispering in her ear, completely blind to anyone other than her. Ever since she\u2019d shown up at Live Bay and sung him that song a few weeks back, they\u2019d been all over each other. You rarely saw one without the other. Cage watched her every move like she was the most fascinating thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you were gonna show up tonight,\u201d Dewayne said as he lifted his beer and saluted me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Where else is there to be?\u201d I didn\u2019t let the frustration come out through my words. Or at least, I didn\u2019t think I did. However, the way Eva turned her head and stared at me curiously made me question that.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re here,\u201d Cage said with that knowing gleam in his eyes. He wanted to see me with anyone except Amanda. Although Cage hadn\u2019t been one of our crew while growing up, since we were now teammates and his best friend was about to be a married-in member of the group, Cage kind of just fit. He was a part now. He also knew that my screwing around with Marcus\u2019s little sister was off-limits. Pissed me off that he could just freely be with who he wanted. No one and nothing standing in the way.</p> <p>\u201cYou look down,\u201d Eva said, still studying me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I replied, looking over at Dewayne. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. I figured Trisha would want to be here tonight since Jackdown is playing.\u201d Trisha rarely missed her brother\u2019s performances. She\u2019d practically raised Krit, so they had more of a mother-son relationship than a sibling one. She was like the proud parent.</p><p>\u201cKeep wiggling like that, and we\u2019re gonna have to leave,\u201d Cage growled as he took a nip at Eva\u2019s ear. She giggled and stood up.</p><p>\u201cThen come dance with me.\u201d She held out her hand, and he went willingly. They were a little too much for me right now. I didn\u2019t need to see that shit.</p><p>\u201cCan Cage be any more pussy whipped?\u201d I grumbled, taking the shot of tequila the waitress had set down in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s pissy tonight. Don\u2019t tell me you got the hots for Eva now,\u201d Dewayne drawled.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even look over at him. He was trying to goad me. It was his thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about Manda?\u201d I could remember some drunken ramblings one night after I\u2019d been with Amanda, but I wasn\u2019t sure what it was I\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cMore than I wanted to know,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I looked over at him. \u201cI need to know what that is, Dewayne. I did something, and I can\u2019t remember it clearly.\u201d</p><p>Dewayne shook his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s best you only have those sketchy memories. No use in reminding you.\u201d</p><p>I slammed my glass onto the table. \u201cTell me what I said, dammit.\u201d</p><p>Dewayne leaned on the table with his elbows and glared at me. \u201cNo. You were drunk as shit. I don\u2019t want to remember it. She\u2019s like my little sister, you stupid fucker. She should be the same to you. How you could do something with her like some cheap slut I am still trying to wrap my head around. I know you got issues. But that ain\u2019t an excuse. She looks at you in a way that can only mean you can hurt her. You have hurt her, and she still looks at you with that wistful, dreamy look of hers. It makes me so mad I could beat the shit out of you. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with her, D.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell him more than that because I couldn\u2019t accept it. There was no way I\u2019d ever be able to have anything more than a friendship with her, but I needed him to know she wasn\u2019t like the others.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But she\u2019s sweet. She\u2019s good. She\u2019s also innocent. Back off before Marcus figures out there is a reason he should put a bullet in your head.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t back off completely. I needed her friendship. I wanted to be near her. \u201cWe\u2019re friends now. That\u2019s something he\u2019ll have to accept. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends? Bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect him to believe me. Why should he?</p><p>Amanda</p><p>By the time I left the study group, it was after nine. Today had been busy and somewhat successful. We\u2019d found a flower girl dress. However, the bridesmaid dresses hadn\u2019t been so easy to find. We had another day planned next week to go to Mobile to see if we could find something there.</p><p>I noticed a familiar Jeep parked in the driveway. What was Preston doing? Mom was at home. I\u2019d talked to her already once tonight. Had he been sitting there long?</p><p>I pulled up beside him and got out. I had to get him out of here before Mom saw him. She would have a fit if she saw me hanging around with Preston Drake. He was okay as one of Marcus\u2019s friends, but that was all. She had never let it be a secret that she wasn\u2019t a fan of his.</p><p>Preston was grinning when I got close enough to make out his face. The top to his Jeep was off, and he was leaned back with his head turned in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally home,\u201d he said. There was no slur to his voice, so he wasn\u2019t drunk. That was a good thing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for a ride with me\u201d was his response.</p><p>I glanced back at the house. Mom\u2019s bedroom light was off, and that normally meant she\u2019d taken her sleeping pill already. But he didn\u2019t know that. \u201cMom is expecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs asleep,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>Sighing, I shifted my feet and stayed a good foot away from him and his Jeep. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s late and I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to spend time with you. I missed you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He missed me? Really? \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is probably one of the worst ideas I\u2019ve ever had. Please come with me,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>I was a female. How was I supposed to ignore that? \u201cFine. But just a short ride, and then I need to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>I walked around the Jeep and climbed in. I\u2019d never made it into his Jeep the last time he\u2019d asked me to take a ride with him. When I looked over at him, he was staring at the door I\u2019d just closed and his eyes moved to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d He swallowed loudly. \u201cDid you have an orgasm up against my Jeep that night?\u201d</p><p>He was remembering more and more of our night together. I doubted we\u2019d be done talking about it anytime soon. The more he remembered, the more he was going to want to ask me about it. Then I\u2019d have to relive it.</p><p>I turned my head to look outside before answering. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt was off,\u201d he replied slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Preston, it was. Can we please not talk about this?\u201d</p><p>Preston shifted the Jeep into reverse, and we backed out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just . . . pieces keep coming back to me, and I just remembered you clearly coming for me while I had you pressed up against the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>I would not be embarrassed. I would not.</p><p>\u201cNo one had ever done those things to me before. It was a given that I was going to get off easy,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cI was just kissing your tits. No one had ever done that before?\u201d The surprise in his voice made me wish I\u2019d stayed at home. Getting in this Jeep had been yet another bad move.</p><p>\u201cSubject change, please.\u201d</p><p>Preston didn\u2019t say anything else. He drove to the public beach that was deserted this time of night and pulled down onto the gravel parking lot just before the sand starts. The moonlight on the waves was always something I loved to watch. It was romantic, and as many times as I\u2019d wished I could sit and watch it with Preston, I didn\u2019t want to right now. Romance and Preston had to be kept completely separate.</p><p>Preston opened his door and came around the front of the Jeep, then opened my door. He held out his hand. \u201cCome watch the waves with me, Manda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cJust for a few minutes. Please?\u201d</p><p>Giving in, I placed my hand in his and let him help me out of the Jeep.</p><p>I left my sandaled heels on the floor and got out barefoot. Preston closed the door to the Jeep, then stared at it before looking at me. The heavy, hooded expression in his eyes told me what he was thinking. Knowing it was turning him on only made my pulse rate pick up. I couldn\u2019t help the fact that I wanted Preston to want me. To at least be attracted to me.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, reaching for my hand and threading his fingers through mine. We walked out to the sandy shore until Preston found a spot close enough for us to see the waves clearly but far enough back that we wouldn\u2019t get wet.</p><p>He tugged me down with him until we were both sitting.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here, Preston?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wanted to come out here to think. It\u2019s where I think best. And I wanted you to be with me.\u201d</p><p>My traitorous heart skipped a beat. He could say the sweetest things. I just needed to remember he could also say some of the meanest things. His mouth was dangerous. In many, many ways.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to the side and grinned over at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the answer to that question.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I did. I wanted it very much. \u201cLet me be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s grin turned into a sexy smirk, and he slid his hand across the sand until it was resting on my bare knee. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t get you out of my head. Normally, after I\u2019m with a girl, I move on. I\u2019m done. But you . . .\u201d He paused and glanced back at the water, breaking eye contact with me. \u201cYou\u2019re different. I still want you. I think about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. I was a goner. Those kinds of things coming from a player like Preston Drake would make any female melt. He wasn\u2019t playing fair. \u201cIt\u2019s just because you were drunk and don\u2019t remember it.\u201d I was reminding myself as much as I was him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Manda. The more I remember, the more I want you.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid up my thigh as he slowly slid it between my legs. I should be pushing him away. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to, though.</p><p>\u201cEvery night, Manda. Every damn night I dream about you. About how sweet you tasted. How incredible you felt. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>I stopped breathing as his hand slid further up my inner thigh. I was beyond the ability to form words. The last time, Preston hadn\u2019t said sweet, romantic things to me. He\u2019d just sent me outside and we\u2019d gone at it. This time he was pulling out all the stops, and I wasn\u2019t going to be able to ignore this.</p><p>\u201cWhere all did I taste you, Manda?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. I wasn\u2019t answering that question. I couldn\u2019t go there. Not with his hand almost at the edge of my shorts.</p><p>\u201cIf it was anything like my dreams, it was fucking unbelievable. I\u2019ve been trying real hard to stay away. Marcus would never be okay with this. And if you knew me\u2014the real me\u2014you\u2019d run. I\u2019m not what you think. I\u2019m so much worse.\u201d</p><p>That, I couldn\u2019t take. Hearing him degrading himself like that. So he slept around. A lot of guys did. He was sowing his wild oats. It was okay to do that. Most girls knew what they were up against with him.</p><p>\u201cStop it. I do know you. I\u2019ve been watching you for years. You\u2019re no worse than Cage, and look at him. He has Eva. She\u2019s madly in love with him, and she knows all about his playboy days.\u201d</p><p>Preston eased his fingers up the inside the leg of my shorts. \u201cStop me, Manda,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Stop him? How was I gonna do that? He had me panting with anticipation. How could I stop him?</p><p>I dropped my gaze to watch his hand disappear up my shorts just as the tips of his fingers grazed the silk of my panties. It had been awhile, so the immediate reaction of closing my eyes and letting out a moan from the pleasure was to be expected.</p><p>Preston was on top of me with both my hands pressed back above my head with one of his hands while the other one continued to tease me relentlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kiss you this time, sweetheart. I can\u2019t help it,\u201d he whispered as his mouth lowered and covered mine.</p><p>From the look on his face, I expected his kiss to be demanding. Instead, his soft lips were gentle. Almost like he was savoring me. His tongue slipped into my mouth and tangled with mine. Each caress had me bucking my body to get closer to him. I couldn\u2019t touch him. He had my hands still pinned back with one of his. So I kissed him back as wildly and freely as I could. Everything I felt for him came pouring out of me. The groan that vibrated his chest as he eased one finger inside the edge of my panties made my body tremble. I\u2019d only ever done things like this with Preston. I\u2019d only imagined him when I\u2019d fantasized about doing these things. It was always his face I saw.</p><p>\u201cManda, please, baby, tell me to stop,\u201d he begged in a deep, husky voice while he trailed kisses from my mouth to my neck, where he began licking and nipping the tender skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d I gasped out as his finger entered me easily against the wetness already there.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet. So wet. I shouldn\u2019t be able to touch you. I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d His tortured voice only turned me on more. I opened my legs more, and he sank down between them as his fingers eased in and out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking warm,\u201d he murmured as he kissed me down my chest, and he finally let go of my hands so that he could use his free hand to slide up inside my shirt. He chose that moment to start rubbing his thumb over my clit. I cried out and clung to both his arms. I was so close.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he bit out, and then he was gone.</p><p>My breathing was labored, and my body parts started screaming in protest. I wanted him back. Touching me.</p><p>\u201cNo! I can\u2019t do this. I shouldn\u2019t have started it.\u201d Preston was standing up when I opened my eyes. His face looked fierce, and he wasn\u2019t looking at me. Instead, he was focused on the dark sky.</p><p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d he said again, in a determined voice.</p><p>I pulled my shirt down and managed to sit up. I couldn\u2019t stand just yet. I\u2019d been about to explode when Preston moved away and left me cold. My body was trying to process this. What had I done wrong, anyway?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Manda. I shouldn\u2019t have touched you.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I slowly stood up, hoping my knees weren\u2019t too weak and could hold me. Once I was standing and sure I could do so without crumbling at his feet, I stared up at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Preston shook his head and started stalking back to the Jeep. I watched him for a moment before jogging after him. He was being so weird. I was beginning to think he might just leave me here. He went to his side of the Jeep, climbed in, then slammed his door.</p><p>The state of dazed confusion I\u2019d been in after he\u2019d brought me to the brink of an orgasm was fading, and anger was taking its place real fast. Who did he think he was? Why was I the idiot who kept coming back and letting him hurt me? I didn\u2019t want to get in that stupid Jeep with him. I walked right past it and headed up the boardwalk that led to the street. My house was about two miles from here. I could walk it. No problem.</p><p>\u201cManda, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d Preston\u2019s voice called out. I didn\u2019t look back. I just kept making my way to the road. He\u2019d go away eventually. I didn\u2019t need this. I didn\u2019t want this. I hated how he made me feel when it was over. The few moments of heaven were not worth the hell he put me through when he was done.</p><p>\u201cPlease come back. I can\u2019t let you walk home. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get to decide what I did. He didn\u2019t get to decide anything about me. Preston Drake had done nothing to earn any privilege in my life.</p><p>\u201cManda, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so damn sorry.\u201d The defeat in his voice had me slowing down.</p><p>I turned back and looked at him. He was outside his Jeep now, walking toward me. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to control myself with you. I\u2019m sorry. That was wrong back there. I had to stop it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Preston</p><p>\u201cIf this is so wrong, then stop. Stop trying to get close to me. You run hot and cold, Preston. I am so sick of it. I can\u2019t keep up with you. I don\u2019t want to anymore.\u201d The angry glare she\u2019d shot me when she walked past the Jeep was gone. Now Amanda just looked over it. She was tired of this. I couldn\u2019t blame her. I wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. I could never be what she wanted. She thought I was like Cage and the right girl could tame me. It wasn\u2019t about that. I didn\u2019t need taming. I needed fucking saving.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be free until I was out of college and got a job that would make me enough money to take care of my brothers and sister. Until then, I\u2019d never be free to touch someone like Amanda. She wasn\u2019t like the other girls I messed around with. They knew the score. They meant nothing to me. Manda was different. She made me feel things. Things I\u2019d prayed I\u2019d never experience, because acting on them would be impossible.</p> <p>\u201cJust let me take you home. I promise this won\u2019t happen again. I shouldn\u2019t have brought you out here. Having you close like this makes me forget the reasons why this won\u2019t work. We will never work.\u201d</p><p>Amanda spun around and started stalking back toward the road. Her tight little ass swung teasingly in those shorts of hers that were always too short and drove me crazy. I\u2019d been fantasizing about slipping my hand up a pair of her shorts for a couple of years now. Tonight that desire had taken over, and the craving to taste her.</p><p>\u201cManda, please don\u2019t do this. I said I was sorry. Just let me give you a ride. You don\u2019t even have to talk to me. Besides, you\u2019re barefoot. You can\u2019t walk home barefoot.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, but she didn\u2019t turn back around right away. Instead, she placed both her hands on her hips and stood there in the darkness. She was thinking about it. I couldn\u2019t blame her. I\u2019d hate me too. Toying with her like that was wrong. I could never do more than tease her. Because the cold hard fact was that the moment the call came in from a client, I\u2019d have to leave her, and there was no way I\u2019d be able to crawl out of her bed and into bed with someone else.</p><p>Finally Amanda turned around and walked slowly back to the Jeep. She didn\u2019t meet my eyes. She didn\u2019t even look my way. She kept her eyes down as she passed me and opened the passenger side of the Jeep and climbed in.</p> <p>I walked over to the driver\u2019s side and got in. Glancing over at her, I thought about explaining myself. Maybe just telling her the truth. I needed to tell someone. Would she understand?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Preston. Just drive,\u201d she replied, as if she\u2019d read my mind. I cranked the Jeep and pulled out onto the dark street. She was right. We\u2019d said enough.</p><p>We rode in silence the two miles back to her house. I parked in her driveway, and she opened the door and got out, taking her sandals with her. She didn\u2019t look back at me or even tell me good-bye. The close of the door was hard and firm. That was her way of telling me that whatever we had been attempting was over.</p><p>Swallowing against the sudden lump in my throat, I turned my Jeep toward home. I wouldn\u2019t cry over her. I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d never had her, not really. She didn\u2019t know me. She\u2019d never accept the truth about me. It was better this way. Pretending like I could have her in any way was just a form of torture I didn\u2019t need. I had my family and my baseball career to focus on. Amanda Hardy was a distraction that could make me lose it all.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of this one?\u201d Willow asked as she stepped up onto the small platform in front of the wall of mirrors in another gorgeous white wedding dress. I thought she looked like every guy\u2019s fantasy. All her long red hair and her cleavage pouring out of the top of the sleeveless dress. She was the kind of girl who could make any guy change his ways. I was missing that sex appeal. I had the cute little girl-next-door thing going for me. I didn\u2019t have the sexy goddess thing Willow did. It was no wonder my brother had become like a panting dog at her feet the moment he met her.</p> <p>\u201cI love it. You\u2019re fabulous in it. However, I am still a fan of the one two dresses ago. I like the way it\u2019s short in front and shows off your legs but long in the back. It\u2019s a sexier dress. This one would make my mother very happy, but it covers up too much. You have the body. Flaunt it on your wedding day.\u201d</p><p>Willow blushed, and I was reminded of yet another reason my brother loved her. She was so completely blind to the fact that she was gorgeous. Every time you complemented her, she would get all red faced like she didn\u2019t believe you or know how to handle it.</p><p>\u201cI liked that one too. I was just worried the short front was too much. Your mom wants us to get married in the church. Can I wear a short dress like that?\u201d</p><p>My mom was having way too much input in this wedding. Willow had no mom to weigh in, and her older sister wasn\u2019t an option in helping her decide anything about the wedding. The fact Tawny was living with my dad and their kid made it weird. Besides, Willow and her sister weren\u2019t very close.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to get married on the beach. I think that is the perfect dress for a beach wedding.\u201d</p><p>Willow twirled one of her long strands of hair around her finger. \u201cWell, I do. But your mom really wants us married in a church. I didn\u2019t want to upset her. She\u2019s had so much to deal with already. And Marcus doesn\u2019t care. He just wants to get married.\u201d</p><p>Willow was going to have to learn to stand up to my mother, or Mom would run all over her. Mom loved to plan and be in charge. Willow was so eager to please her that she would let her. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.</p><p>\u201cIf you want a beach wedding, then have a beach wedding. This isn\u2019t my mother\u2019s wedding. She doesn\u2019t get to plan this. I\u2019m not letting her plan mine, I can tell you that right now. You cannot let her start controlling your decisions. She\u2019ll do it about everything. Heck, she\u2019ll even name your kids for you. This is your life. Marcus is yours. Not hers. He\u2019s a big boy now, and he is yours. You make the choices. That dress was gorgeous on you. Marcus will love it. Have your beach wedding and wear your rocking-hot dress.\u201d</p> <p>Willow smiled and bit down on her bottom lip, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t do what others want me to on my wedding day. It\u2019s about Marcus and me. No one else.\u201d</p><p>I felt a swell of pride in my chest that I\u2019d convinced her to go with her heart. Do what she wanted. I nodded and sat back down in my chair, and I crossed my legs to wait while she went to put back on the dress we\u2019d both loved.</p><p>My phone played the short tune to let me know I had a text message. I reached into my purse and pulled it out.</p><p>Jason: Instead of me coming there this weekend, what would you say to dinner in NYC?</p><p>What was he talking about? Had he accidentally texted me when he\u2019d meant to text someone else? I live nowhere near New York City.</p><p>Me: I think you texted the wrong person :)</p><p>That was awkward. Especially since he had mentioned coming to see me this weekend. He must have made plans with more than one girl.</p><p>Jason: I\u2019m positive that I texted exactly who I meant to text. I don\u2019t normally offer to ask my brother for his jet to take girls on dates. Only for the really special ones.</p><p>Oh. He wanted to fly me to New York City for dinner? Really? What did I say to this? I knew Sadie had done this kind of thing all the time last year while she was finishing up high school in Sea Breeze while Jax toured the states. But Jason and I had been on one date. This seemed kind of like a big deal for a second date.</p><p>Jason: The silence is not promising.</p><p>Me: I was just surprised. I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Jason: \u201cYes\u201d would be a really good option.</p><p>I laughed at his quick response. I really liked this guy.</p><p>\u201cWho has you smiling down at the phone like that?\u201d Willow asked with a grin on her face as she walked back out of the dressing room in the dress that I knew was meant for her.</p><p>\u201cJason Stone,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Willow wiggled her eyebrows. \u201cDating a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t really a celebrity. Just the fact that he\u2019s related to Jax.\u201d</p><p>Willow laughed and stepped up onto the platform in front of the mirrors. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say being the brother of the world\u2019s favorite rock star makes him a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>Me: Can I think about it?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to just say yes. Sure, I was mad at Preston about the other night at the beach. He and I hadn\u2019t crossed paths since then, but I just couldn\u2019t get him out of my head. Once the anger faded, I remembered his sad face. The hopelessness in his eyes. Those things had me wanting to hunt him down and ask him why.</p><p>Jason: Of course. Let me know when you\u2019re ready.</p><p>Me: Thank you.</p><p>\u201cSo, what is it he\u2019s saying?\u201d Willow asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to go out with him again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you going?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. I wasn\u2019t sure. It all depended on Preston. Everything depended on him. If somehow I was missing something that I needed to know, I didn\u2019t want to just walk away without knowing the facts.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Not sure. I need to think about it.\u201d</p><p>Willow nodded. \u201cGood idea. Dating him will put you in a spotlight. I imagine that isn\u2019t always fun.\u201d</p><p>I knew from Sadie\u2019s experience it wasn\u2019t fun at all. She was still getting used to it. But I wanted to change the subject. We weren\u2019t here to discuss my love life. We were here to find the perfect dress for Willow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said, nodding to her image in the mirror.</p><p>Willow turned to look at herself. \u201cYes, I believe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus will be a puddle at your feet,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>Willow beamed at me. \u201cNow. We still need to find you the perfect dress. Do you think Jason would want to come? Should I send him an invitation for you?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. Would Jason and I still be talking then? It was very possible he would have moved on to another model by that point. I shrugged and straightened the train on the dress. It was covered in tiny pearls and weighed a ton. The fact that there wasn\u2019t much to the rest of the dress was made up for by the extravagance of the train.</p><p>\u201cSo do you or don\u2019t you?\u201d Willow asked.</p><p>I realized I still hadn\u2019t answered the Jason and the wedding question. Sadie and Jax were coming, so why not invite Jax\u2019s brother? Even if we weren\u2019t dating then, I was sure we\u2019d still be friends.</p><p>\u201cSure. Send him an invite.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Preston</p><p>Tonight Jackdown wasn\u2019t playing. It was a country night. Some country band from Tennessee was onstage. They were good with the cover songs they played, but their originals were pretty damn impressive.</p><p>Marcus sat back down with a beer. It was rare I got him without Willow these days. When he\u2019d called and wanted me to meet him at Live Bay for drinks, I\u2019d been surprised. Then he\u2019d explained that Willow and Amanda were out shopping for the wedding dress. That explained it. Marcus was rarely anywhere without Willow.</p> <p>\u201cYou seen Amanda around campus any?\u201d Marcus asked before taking a swig of his beer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We have calculus together.\u201d That was the only response he was getting. I didn\u2019t want to talk about Amanda with him. He\u2019d see through me real fast. Then he\u2019d beat the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cI would never tell her this, but I am so glad she didn\u2019t go off to Auburn. I want to enjoy this wedding planning stuff with Low, and I would have been worried about Amanda all the time. Not knowing if some guy was taking advantage of her or if she was safe. This way I can enjoy this time with Low and keep my eye on Amanda in case she needs me.\u201d I almost choked on my beer.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought about it being unsafe for her to be so far away at college. I\u2019d been so anxious to get her away from me, I hadn\u2019t considered Auburn might be dangerous for her. I was suddenly relieved she hadn\u2019t left. I might be bad for her, but I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt her. Shit. Now I wasn\u2019t going to be able to watch her go off next year. Why\u2019d he have to make me think about it?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you scowling about?\u201d Marcus asked, breaking into my thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cSorry. Just thinking about homework. I got shitloads.\u201d</p><p>Marcus chuckled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t found a few girls to get that handled for you yet? Preston Drake is losing his touch? Say it ain\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>Normally, I didn\u2019t do my homework. I got girls in my classes to do it. I\u2019d flirt just enough to keep them happy, and maybe screw around with them toward the end of the semester. I\u2019d been doing this since high school. The guys found endless entertainment in it. Especially when the semester ended and I had a hard time letting the girls down. It was drama I wasn\u2019t in the mood for this year. Ever since I\u2019d had my hands and mouth on Amanda\u2019s body, my thoughts had centered on her. It was hard to concentrate on anyone else.</p><p>\u201cCutting back on the drama this year,\u201d I explained.</p><p>Marcus let out a low whistle. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear that from you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell him all about the girl tying me up in knots. I\u2019d listened to him go on and on about Willow when she\u2019d come into his life. But now I had someone driving me crazy I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I couldn\u2019t get drunk in front of Marcus and spill my guts. Not if I wanted to live. He\u2019d kill me. I had no doubt.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Preston. It\u2019s been awhile. Where have you been hiding?\u201d A blonde with a really big pair of fake boobs sidled up next to me and ran her hand up my chest. Yeah. I\u2019d probably slept with this one. She had all the assets, and she was comfortable enough with me to touch me.</p><p>\u201cBeen busy,\u201d I said with a forced smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been missing you. Come dance with me,\u201d she purred in my ear.</p><p>I started to turn her down when I saw Marcus watching me. He was expecting me to say yes. That is what I would normally do. She\u2019d be an easy lay. She was hot enough. If I told her no, then Marcus would start asking questions. I didn\u2019t want him asking questions. He knew me too well. If I said anything to tip him off that I was tied up in knots over his sister, he\u2019d be furious. I had to dance with this girl. I didn\u2019t have to fuck her. Just dance with her. Act like my old self a little bit so no one questioned my sudden change. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like I had to be faithful to Amanda. I had no chance in hell of ever having a relationship with her. She would keep her distance now. I\u2019d pushed her too far the other night.</p><p>I stood up and rested my hand on her lower back, and I led her out to the dance floor before Marcus could notice I wasn\u2019t interested at all.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I followed Willow into Live Bay. Marcus had texted her and told her to have me bring her here. He was waiting on her and having drinks with Preston. Which was why I was going inside too. I just needed to see his face again before I said yes or no to Jason\u2019s text.</p><p>Preston was like a drug I couldn\u2019t seem to walk away from.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Marcus,\u201d Willow said, walking through the crowd toward the table they always occupied. No one was at the table other than Marcus, which was odd. Normally, one of the other guys was still here. I knew Preston was here. Marcus had just texted Willow. If he wasn\u2019t at the table or the bar, then he was with a girl. I refused to look out at the dance floor. Not yet. I needed to compose myself first.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d Marcus beamed at Willow and stood up to pull her into his arms. The kissing immediately started. I didn\u2019t really want to watch my brother stick his tongue in someone\u2019s mouth, so I took a seat and mentally debated whether or not I should scan the room for Preston. What if he had a girl up against a wall dry humping? Could I handle that? I mean, I had no claim on him, but would it hurt too bad? Yes, probably.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Marcus said, pulling back from his attack on Willow\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, but I have a dress I really think you\u2019re going to like,\u201d she replied, then glanced over at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would manage all this without Amanda. I\u2019m so glad she didn\u2019t go off to school.\u201d</p><p>Marcus turned his attention to me and winked. \u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, uh, talked about the wedding location today, and Amanda said I should have it where I wanted. Not to let your mother convince me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Marcus frowned and turned back to stare down at Willow. \u201cShe\u2019s right. This is our wedding. I thought you liked Mom\u2019s idea of the church, but if you don\u2019t, then tell me. We\u2019ll get married wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>That was my brother. He was perfect. Guys like him were very hard to find.</p><p>\u201cI really want to get married on the beach,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s done. I\u2019ll tell Mom to cancel the church, and we\u2019ll start looking at beach houses to rent.\u201d</p><p>Willow squealed and grabbed his face and began kissing him again. I turned my attention away from them and looked out at the dance floor. It didn\u2019t take long to find Preston. His blond hair always stood out. The almost naked girl he was dancing with also stood out. I knew I should look away, but I couldn\u2019t. I wanted to see him with someone else. I knew he treated me differently, but I wanted to see exactly how differently.</p><p>The girl ran her hands through his hair, and if he\u2019d let her, I was pretty sure she\u2019d hump his leg. They couldn\u2019t get any closer. When she pulled his head down to meet her lips, I jerked my gaze away. I would not watch that.</p><p>\u201cYou want a Coke, Amanda?\u201d Marcus asked, and I looked over at him and realized he and Willow were both sitting now and no longer kissing. I was more in the mood to leave, but I decided staying and watching Preston all over another girl might be just what I needed to get him out of my system.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone else?\u201d Willow asked.</p><p>Marcus nodded toward the dance floor. \u201cPreston is dancing. Dewayne is on his way. Rock and Trisha are hanging out at home. Cage and Eva are probably locked up in Cage\u2019s apartment, where they always are lately.\u201d</p><p>Willow laughed. \u201cLeave them alone. I love seeing Cage like this. He\u2019s so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, baby, I love seeing him obsessed with someone too. Makes me breathe easier.\u201d</p><p>Willow rolled her eyes.</p><p>As the song ended I glanced back up at the dance floor to see Preston walking toward us with the girl he\u2019d been dancing with following close behind him. At least he wasn\u2019t touching her. Normally, Preston had his hands all over the girls he played around with.</p><p>His focus was on me, and I was extremely grateful that Marcus\u2019s back was turned to the dance floor. The waitress placed a coaster and my Coke down on the table in front of me. I dropped my eyes from Preston\u2019s and took a sip of the cold soda.</p><p>\u201cHey, Low,\u201d he said once he got to the table. \u201cAmanda.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t lift my gaze to his. I simply replied with \u201cHello\u201d and kept drinking.</p><p>\u201cHey, Preston,\u201d Willow said cheerily. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you on campus yet. We must have no classes together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI want a beer,\u201d the girl said as she took the empty seat beside me. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jill.\u201d It took all my restraint not to shove her off the stool.</p><p>\u201cAmanda. It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I replied. The politeness was trained into me. My mother had drilled it into my head. I could feel Preston\u2019s eyes on me. He was watching me. Did he think I would be rude to her? Just because he\u2019d chosen her to screw tonight instead of me? I\u2019d have to dislike the entire town if that was the case. He\u2019d slept with most of the women in it.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re Marcus\u2019s little sister. I remember seeing you with Sadie White.\u201d</p><p>She knew Sadie? \u201cHow do you know Sadie?\u201d Because she was not the kind of girl Sadie made friends with.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her. I know of her. I\u2019m a huge Jax Stone fan.\u201d</p><p>That made more sense.</p><p>\u201cAmanda is dating Jax Stone\u2019s brother,\u201d Willow chimed in, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d the girl asked in a disbelieving voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really,\u201d I replied, shaking my head and wishing to God that Willow would shut up.</p><p>\u201cHe is trying real hard. He was texting her today and making her smile awfully big.\u201d</p><p>This was my cue to leave. I reached for my purse and didn\u2019t make eye contact with anyone.</p><p>\u201cJason Stone is still contacting you? Didn\u2019t he leave with Sadie and Jax?\u201d Marcus asked curiously.</p><p>Crud. I wasn\u2019t going to get away from this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still talking to Jason?\u201d Preston asked, surprising me. I hadn\u2019t expected him to pipe up in this conversation. Not with Marcus sitting here. I looked at Marcus to answer. I would not look at Preston. This was not his business.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in LA. He just wants to see if we might could see each other again sometime.\u201d</p><p>Willow covered up a laugh with a cough. I shot her a pleading look to please not say anything more. She understood and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to date you?\u201d that girl, Jill, said. \u201cHis picture is plastered all over the place with models and actresses.\u201d The disbelieving tone of her voice was grating on my nerves. I was well aware that I couldn\u2019t exactly compete with his normal choice in females, but surprisingly, Jason Stone liked something about me. Even if Preston Drake didn\u2019t want me.</p><p>\u201cI need to go. I\u2019ve got a paper to write, and I need to check in on Mom,\u201d I said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. Don\u2019t leave because of my big mouth.\u201d Willow sounded concerned.</p><p>I smiled at her reassuringly. \u201cReally, I didn\u2019t mean to come in and stay. I just wanted to say hello to everyone. Now Preston can have my seat.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t glance over at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for today. You were so much help, and I had so much fun with you,\u201d Willow said, standing up to hug me.</p><p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d I replied, and hugged her, then stepped back and made one big sweep of the table, including Preston, who was still standing on the other side of Jill, watching me.</p><p>\u201cBye, y\u2019all.\u201d I waved, then turned and headed for the door. I could not get out of here fast enough. This was a bad idea. I wouldn\u2019t be back here. Not for a while. Pretending like Preston wasn\u2019t a man whore was easier when I didn\u2019t have to witness it. Tonight was a reminder I needed but really wanted to forget.</p><p>\u201cManda,\u201d Preston\u2019s voice called out from behind me the moment I touched the handle on my car.</p><p>What was he doing?</p><p>I could act like I didn\u2019t hear him and open the door and get inside and drive away. Or I could see what had him running out here to talk to me. My decision making only gave him time to reach me. My escape plan was no longer possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, lifting my gaze to meet his.</p><p>He shook his head, and the sad, confused look was there in his eyes again. Dang it. I hated that look.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>This was about Jason. Really?</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I replied, and jerked my door open.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d Preston walked closer to me and blocked my entrance into the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I was growing impatient with him. He was back to his hot-and-cold thing again. I couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see him?\u201d</p><p>What was this? Did he want me to just want him? No one else? He liked having little innocent, stupid Amanda panting after him. Well, he could kiss my ass. I was over that. And I wasn\u2019t so innocent anymore, thanks to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Preston. I do. He likes me. He wants to be near me. He doesn\u2019t push me away.\u201d</p><p>Preston stepped closer to me, and his worried expression became a scowl. \u201cHow close has he got to you, Manda? Has he touched you?\u201d</p><p>This was not happening. I was dreaming this insanity. Preston was not getting possessive of me when he didn\u2019t even want me.</p><p>\u201cMove, Preston. I\u2019m done with this. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Preston grabbed my waist and pulled me up against him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be who you need me to be.\u201d</p><p>A few weeks ago I\u2019d have wanted to prove to him he could change. I\u2019d have believed I was the girl to change him. But I knew better now. He couldn\u2019t even enjoy touching me sober. I was not the one to change him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I get it. Now move. I want to go home.\u201d I pushed at his chest, but he didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI want to change. You make me want to change everything. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I let out a weary sigh before looking back up at him. \u201cI know. One day someone will come along and you\u2019ll change for her. She\u2019ll be the one you can\u2019t live without, and she\u2019ll be more important than anyone or anything else. When that happens, you\u2019ll change. I\u2019m just not her. Now please, just let me go home. We\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Preston gritted his teeth and shook his head as if to keep from saying something, then let out one long breath before stepping away from my car door and letting me get inside. He stood there watching me as I closed the door. I backed out of my parking spot, and he was still standing there watching me. Once I pulled out onto the road, I glanced into my rearview mirror and he was still there. A week ago I\u2019d have turned around and gone back to him. But I knew better now. He\u2019d only send me packing after he tried to make it work with me and couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Preston</p><p>Amanda was avoiding me, and I was going to let her. One of us needed to be strong enough to stop me from hurting her. She\u2019d realized this and was putting a major halt to any interaction between us. I didn\u2019t see her after she\u2019d left me standing there, watching her go at Live Bay, until calculus class the next week. When I\u2019d walked into the room, I\u2019d found her immediately. She\u2019d surrounded herself with people and was sitting toward the back of the classroom instead of the seat close to the front where she\u2019d sat last week.</p><p>Smart girl.</p> <p>I took a seat in the front and didn\u2019t look back at her. She\u2019d only distract me. The douchebag who\u2019d been looking down her shirt last week was behind her today. I wanted to check and make sure he wasn\u2019t leaning up behind her. He needed to keep his eyes to himself.</p><p>I was battling with myself over turning around and checking on her or keeping my attention on the board, when my phone vibrated in my pocket. I slipped it out and saw Jimmy\u2019s name flashing on the screen. It was the emergency phone I\u2019d given my brother. It was also after nine in the morning. He should be at school. Something was wrong. I grabbed my books and hurried out of the classroom.</p><p>\u201cJimmy?\u201d I answered as I stepped into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cMomma didn\u2019t come home last night, and Daisy has a real bad fever. She had one all night and I used cold rags on her head and gave her some Tylenol, but it keeps getting higher. She won\u2019t eat, and now she just cries real soft like.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I took off running for the parking lot.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, go get more cold rags and put them on her skin. Get her to sip on some ice water and tell her I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>I hated my mother. She had no redeeming qualities. If something happened to Daisy because of her neglect, I was going to kill her.</p><p>\u201cBrent, go get some ice water,\u201d Jimmy instructed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get more cold rags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon. Take care of her. Call me if she gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jimmy assured me, then hung up the phone.</p><p>I unlocked the Jeep and jerked the door open at the same time I heard Amanda calling my name. Glancing back, I saw her running after me.</p> <p>\u201cPreston, wait, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked in a panicked voice.</p><p>\u201cFamily stuff. I gotta go,\u201d I replied. I hated to run off on her when she was just being nice, but Daisy needed me.</p><p>I cranked up the Jeep, and the passenger-side door opened and Amanda jumped inside. Ah, hell.</p><p>\u201cManda, I don\u2019t have time for this. I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, you do,\u201d she agreed. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get out of my Jeep,\u201d I replied, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNo. You never get anxious or worried. Never. Something is wrong and you need help.\u201d She was right, but I was not taking her to my mother\u2019s trailer.</p><p>\u201cManda, please\u2014\u201d I was cut off by the ringing of my phone. Shit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, slamming the Jeep into reverse. I didn\u2019t have time to argue with a stubborn woman. My little sister needed me. This wasn\u2019t the time to worry about my pride. So what if Amanda saw where I grew up? Why did I care? It wasn\u2019t like I was trying to impress her.</p><p>\u201cShe sipped the water, then threw up,\u201d Jimmy said. The tightness in his voice told me he was scared. This was not something kids should have to deal with. Jimmy was having to be the adult at eleven, and it made me furious.</p><p>\u201cOkay, keep the towels cold and keep them on her. I\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we will,\u201d he replied, and hung up.</p><p>I dropped the phone in my lap and pressed the gas as I pulled out onto the road. \u201cPut on your seat belt, Manda.\u201d</p><p>I could see her buckle up out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who was that?\u201d She was starting to panic too.</p><p>\u201cIt was my brother. My other one. He\u2019s eleven. Daisy, my little sister, is sick, and my sorry-ass mother hasn\u2019t been home all night. Jimmy and Brent said she\u2019s really hot and she won\u2019t eat or drink. They just got her to sip some water and she threw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she replied. \u201cOkay. She\u2019s going to be okay. We need to get her to the hospital. She\u2019s got a fever, so the vomiting sounds like a symptom of the high fever. Give me the phone,\u201d Amanda ordered, reaching for it before I could hand it over.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCalling your brother,\u201d she replied as she chewed at her nails nervously.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jimmy, this is Amanda. I\u2019m a friend of your brother\u2019s. Listen, go to the freezer and get any ice you have. Go rub it across Daisy\u2019s forehead, her cheeks, her lips, and even up and down her arms. Cooling her down is real important.\u201d</p><p>I turned down the road that led to the trailer I hated so fiercely. The trailer not even Marcus had seen. I didn\u2019t bring people here. But right now I was extremely grateful Amanda had come after me and jumped in my Jeep. I wasn\u2019t as scared with her here. She was nervous. I could tell by the tone of her voice and the way she was biting her nails, but she was keeping it together. I didn\u2019t feel alone. For the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t feel alone.</p><p>\u201cGood job. Yes, it will melt fast \u2019cause she\u2019s hot. Keep it on her. No, it\u2019s okay, Jimmy. She\u2019s gonna be fine. We are almost there. We are going to get her to the hospital and get her the medicine she needs. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>A tightness in my chest came out of nowhere. As I listened to Amanda reassure my brother, I wanted to pull her into my arms and cry. How damn crazy was that? This girl was making me a nutcase.</p><p>I pulled up to the trailer and reminded myself that getting Daisy to the hospital was all that mattered. Having Amanda see this place didn\u2019t matter. She could think whatever she wanted.</p><p>Amanda flung the door open before I\u2019d put the Jeep in park and was running across the yard to the door of the trailer without waiting on me. I took off after her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t knock but went right in and called out Jimmy\u2019s name. He ran into the living room just as I got into the trailer. His eyes went from Amanda to me, then back to Amanda. \u201cShe\u2019s back here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Amanda didn\u2019t look around the place in disgust like I\u2019d expected. She didn\u2019t seem to notice anything other than Jimmy, who she hurried after.</p><p>\u201cHey, Amanda,\u201d Brent said as he looked up at us from his spot beside Daisy. He was icing her arms down just like Amanda had told them to.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brent. You\u2019re doing a really good job,\u201d she praised him, then walked over to the bed and touched Daisy\u2019s head. Daisy looked up at her with glassy eyes and whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Amanda assured her, and looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cGet her. Let\u2019s go,\u201d she said, standing back.</p><p>I picked her up and cuddled her up against my chest. She curled into me instead of lying limply in my arms, and that small fact helped ease my fear. She wasn\u2019t lethargic. That was good.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boys. You two go get in the Jeep,\u201d she instructed, and went ahead of me to open doors for us.</p><p>Once we got to the Jeep, Amanda moved Jimmy to the front. She crawled into the back, then held out her arms. \u201cGive Daisy to me. I\u2019ll strap her in with me and hold her. You can drive this thing faster than I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed. I gave her Daisy, who went willingly. She didn\u2019t know Amanda, but like the boys, she was willing to trust her completely. It was that angel\u2019s face of hers. It was impossible for anyone to look like Amanda and be untrustworthy.</p><p>I ran around the Jeep and climbed in. We were speeding toward the hospital in seconds.</p><p>\u201cHow long has she had a fever, boys?\u201d Amanda asked, looking back at them.</p><p>\u201cLast night she felt warm and said her throat hurt. I gave her some Tylenol and put her to bed. Then all night she tossed and turned and cried. Her skin just got hotter and hotter,\u201d Jimmy explained.</p><p>I was waiting on Amanda to ask why my mother hadn\u2019t come home. Or if they had tried to call her. But she didn\u2019t. Instead, she nodded. \u201cWell, the two of you did a really good job taking care of her. No one else could have done a better job.\u201d</p><p>If my little sister wasn\u2019t sick and curled up in her lap, I\u2019d grab Amanda\u2019s face and kiss her. She had no idea how much those boys needed someone to affirm them. They never got that from anyone but me. Her praising them meant more than she could know.</p><p>\u201cI shoulda called Preston sooner,\u201d Jimmy said with a defeated sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou did exactly what you thought you should. You took care of her until you realized she needed a doctor. That\u2019s all anyone else woulda known to do,\u201d Amanda told him.</p><p>I pulled the Jeep up to the door of the emergency room and parked. They could tell me to move if they wanted to, but I was getting Daisy inside first.</p><p>Amanda handed her to me, and I took her straight through the doors.</p><p>The nurse at the reception desk gave me the usual annoyed look I got when I showed up with one of the kids. I\u2019d been several times over the years.</p><p>\u201cSign in, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency. Her fever is really high,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the emergency room. Everyone in here has an emergency, I assure you. Now sign in please.\u201d The woman\u2019s bored tone infuriated me.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a doctor now. I can\u2019t put her down and sign her in\u2014she\u2019s too sick to stand.\u201d I tried not to snarl, but this woman was pushing me.</p><p>\u201cSign in,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>My blood started to boil.</p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d Amanda\u2019s voice interrupted the next words out of my mouth, which was probably a good thing.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all need to sign in and take a seat. He can\u2019t seem to understand that.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s hand wrapped around my arm in a silent warning, and then she turned and walked over to the nurse coming out of a set of double doors.</p><p>\u201cHello, Diana. Could you please go tell Dr. Mike that I\u2019m out here and I have a very sick little girl who needs to see him absolutely as soon as possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d The nurse glanced back at me holding Daisy and motioned me toward her. \u201cY\u2019all come on back with me.\u201d</p><p>Amanda flashed her a grateful smile. \u201cThank you so much, Diana. We\u2019re really worried about her. She\u2019s been running a high fever for the past few hours.\u201d</p><p>The nurse nodded and hurried to open back up the doors. Amanda walked over to me. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you. I\u2019m going to go check on the boys and get them settled in the waiting room, and then I\u2019ll head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t signed in or registered,\u201d the lady behind the counter, who was determined I was not getting back there, said as she stood up.</p><p>The nurse frowned at the woman. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll be sure to get the information we need. Amanda is Dr. Mike\u2019s niece.\u201d</p><p>For once in my life, I was thankful for Amanda Hardy\u2019s social status in this town.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told her before following the nurse back.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been so scared in my life. Keeping my cool wasn\u2019t a strong point for me. I normally broke down in a fit of tears when things got tough. But seeing Preston\u2019s panicked face had made something in me click. He needed me to be strong, so I was suddenly strong. It was the oddest thing. I knew he needed me, and I wanted to be there for him. Then I\u2019d seen Daisy and my own panic had risen, but I\u2019d managed to remain calm. Knowing they all needed someone to help them had made me act like an adult.</p><p>I left Jimmy and Brent in front of the television with sodas and bags of chips I\u2019d bought from the vending machine, then headed back to find Preston and Daisy.</p><p>Diana was waiting at the desk when I came by, signing some papers. I\u2019d gotten lucky that she had walked out of the doors just when I needed someone to recognize me. I\u2019d been going to church with Diana since I was a little girl. She\u2019d also dated my mother\u2019s much younger half brother back when they were in high school. Now they worked together. I teased Uncle Mike about it whenever I had the chance.</p><p>\u201cCome with me. We\u2019ve got her hooked up to an IV, and we\u2019re running tests already. Mike stuck his head in and looked her over on his way to stitch up a head injury. He\u2019s coming back, but from his quick look, he believes it is strep. A pretty bad case, but she\u2019ll be fine. We are waiting for the results of the strep test now. As soon as we know, we\u2019ll start the antibiotics via IV.\u201d</p><p>We stepped behind the curtain and found Preston pacing at the foot of the bed while Daisy slept peacefully. He stopped and looked at me. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I replied. \u201cUncle Mike thinks it\u2019s strep. She\u2019s going to be fine. Sit down and stop pacing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to check in. I need to go help set a bone,\u201d Diana said before disappearing behind the curtain that separated us from the rest of the patients.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you enough. You just . . .\u201d He paused and shook his head. \u201cTook over. When I saw her there in that bed, so fragile, I was terrified. But you handled everything. Then we get here and you get her the best service possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help. Emergencies typically aren\u2019t something I deal with well, but today I just knew we had to get her to a doctor. Luckily, I\u2019m related to one.\u201d</p><p>Preston stared at me a moment, and then a small smile touched his lips for the first time today. I was so happy to see that smile. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>My face grew warm and I ducked my head. I wasn\u2019t amazing, but hearing Preston say it like he meant it made me hope for something I knew I couldn\u2019t have. I\u2019d been there when he needed someone. He was feeling grateful. He didn\u2019t suddenly find me attractive and want me. Those were two different things, and I needed to keep that in mind.</p><p>The curtain pulled back and Uncle Mike stepped inside. His dark brown hair was cut short but did that messy thing in the front that only guys who looked like him at thirty-four could get away with.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my favorite Hardy.\u201d Uncle Mike beamed when he walked into the room. That was his favorite joke. Especially now that he hated my dad. He loved to tease Marcus about me being the favorite.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Mike. Is she gonna be okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Kid\u2019s got strep. Bad case of it. Needs constant supervision and care. She\u2019ll be fine after about thirty-six hours of antibiotic, but it\u2019s real important to watch her and keep fluids in her, as well as make her eat small amounts once she starts to feel like it. She is contagious, so you need to keep her away from the other kids if possible. Biggest threat is if they eat or drink from[LF60] the same dishes she used. Once she\u2019s had about twenty-four hours of antibiotics, she won\u2019t be contagious anymore.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then reached over and squeezed Preston\u2019s hand. His fingers laced through mine, and he squeezed back. Uncle Mike\u2019s gaze fell to our joined hands before he went back to looking at the chart in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting her prescriptions printed out right now. We want to keep her here a little bit longer to get the first round of antibiotics in her through IV before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. Thank you, Doctor,\u201d Preston replied.</p><p>Uncle Mike looked at Preston. \u201cShe yours?\u201d he asked, shifting his eyes to me, then back to Preston.</p><p>He thought Preston had a kid. No wonder he was acting weird about us holding hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. Well, yeah. Daisy is my little sister. I take care of her when my mom needs me to.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Mike seemed to relax a little. \u201cThat\u2019s awfully nice of you. Most guys your age wouldn\u2019t be so responsible with a younger sibling.\u201d</p><p>Preston didn\u2019t reply. This was making him uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t know a lot about Preston\u2019s mom, but I did know her trailer was filthy and she ran off and left her kids at home alone for days. That was enough to know that the kids relied on Preston a lot.</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing her so fast. I owe you one,\u201d I told him, walking over to give him a quick hug.</p><p>He pulled me up tightly against him and whispered in my ear, \u201cWatch out for that one,\u201d then dropped his arm and nodded one last time at Preston before walking outside our room and closing the curtain behind him.</p><p>I turned back to Preston. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d This time I smiled in relief and walked over to wrap my arms around Preston. He might not want me to, but I needed to hug him. He\u2019d been so upset, and now it was okay. I needed this hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>I stood in the doorway of my bedroom and looked at the two girls asleep on my bed. Amanda had fallen asleep reading to Daisy, and the book lay across her stomach. By the time we\u2019d gotten Daisy back here and I\u2019d tracked down my mom, Daisy was determined she was keeping Amanda. She\u2019d begged Amanda to stay, and when Amanda had gazed over at me for help, I\u2019d agreed that Amanda staying was a great idea. So Amanda had gone to pick up a few things, including several of her favorite childhood books, while Daisy took an afternoon nap.</p><p>It had given me time to call my mom and get the boys back to her while I kept Daisy. She hadn\u2019t even argued or come inside to check on her when she\u2019d shown up to get the boys. I hated sending the boys back with her, but I couldn\u2019t keep them. I\u2019d have to get a court order, and my mother was just vengeful enough to refuse me. Even if she allowed me to the boys were better off separated from Daisy while she was sick. Besides, I couldn\u2019t do this on my own. Momma may be the suckiest mother ever, but she was home a lot more than I was. Then when baseball season started up, I\u2019d be too busy to sleep, much less take care of kids. It was a no-win situation. I had to keep reminding myself that I\u2019d lived through my life with my mom, and I hadn\u2019t had a big brother watching out for me.</p> <p>Amanda\u2019s hands slipped and the book started to fall to the floor, causing her to wake up. She blinked several times, then turned her head to check on Daisy, who was curled up sleeping peacefully beside her. Amanda reached over and brushed the hair out of Daisy\u2019s face and checked her temperature with the back of her hand before slowly getting up. Her eyes found mine when she turned to walk to the door. She ran her hand through her hair in an attempt to tame whatever she\u2019d messed up, then smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cGuess I was tired too,\u201d she whispered as I stepped back and let her out of the room.</p><p>I closed the door behind her. \u201cYeah, Daisy kept you pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>Amanda chuckled softly. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweetie. I enjoyed spending time with her.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how much it had meant to Daisy. Amanda was the first adult female to give her any attention. \u201cThank you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have made it today without your help. She\u2019s never been that sick before. It was scary as shit.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda smiled up at me. \u201cAfter what I witnessed with you today, I am convinced you\u2019d have been just fine. Never would I have imagined that you\u2019d be such a stellar big brother.\u201d</p><p>The teasing lilt to her voice was sexy. Everything about her was sexy. And she had a small bag packed with her things so she could sleep over. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to control myself. I needed something from her. The emotions swirling inside me were taking over. Everything from attraction to gratefulness to relief. We\u2019d conquered something together today. I wanted to celebrate. With her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go get a shower and go to bed, if that\u2019s okay. Where do you want me to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Where I wanted her to sleep and where she was going to sleep were two different things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna make myself a bed on the floor in the bedroom. You can take the couch. Unless, of course, you\u2019re up for sharing the couch. Then I\u2019d be all in. I\u2019m a really good bed buddy.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s eyes went wide before she let out a giggle. \u201cAs talented as I\u2019m sure you are as a bed buddy, I think I\u2019ll pass. I can always take the floor in the bedroom if you want me to.\u201d</p> <p>The one night of my life I get Amanda to stay the night in my apartment, she would not be sleeping on the floor. I wanted her on my couch. Actually, I wanted her in my bed, but Daisy was kind of occupying that at the moment. I was going to make sure Amanda used one of my pillows, though. That way, I\u2019d have her scent for a while after she was gone.</p><p>\u201cNo, I insist. You\u2019re sleeping on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Amanda studied me a minute. I could see the concern and uncertainty in her eyes. She wanted to ask me something, and she couldn\u2019t decide if she was going to or not. I\u2019d stand here and let her think about it as long as she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cDid the boys get home okay?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>Not exactly what I wanted to talk about. I knew where this was headed. \u201cYeah, my mom came and got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they, um, I mean, uh, do you think they\u2019re gonna be okay . . . there . . . I mean . . . ,\u201d she stammered nervously.</p><p>I walked over to the couch and sat down, then looked back at her. \u201cThey have a phone. If they need me, they\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>Amanda frowned and took a step in my direction. \u201cDid your mom come up and check on Daisy?\u201d</p> <p>This was not a life that Amanda was going to be able to comprehend. Her dad may have screwed around and left them recently, but her life had been pretty damn privileged. \u201cNo, Manda. She didn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t care. There is no one on this earth I hate more than my mother. Is that what you were curious about?\u201d</p><p>My words had come out harder than I\u2019d intended them to. Amanda walked over to the couch and sat down beside me. \u201cPreston, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pry. I was just curious because Daisy never once asked about her mom or spoke of her today. That was odd to me. Growing up, when I was sick I always wanted my mom. I couldn\u2019t understand why she never asked for hers.\u201d</p><p>I laid my head back against the wall and tilted it so I could look at Amanda. She was worried and clearly upset. I was enlightening her about a world she didn\u2019t know existed, and that world wasn\u2019t even the worst part about me.</p><p>\u201cYou are the first woman to ever spend any time with Daisy. My mother is either drunk, asleep, or gone. Daisy is raised by Jimmy when they\u2019re home. I make sure the bills stay paid and the kids have food. Then, like you saw today, if someone gets sick, I handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, that makes my chest hurt,\u201d Amanda whispered, rubbing the ball of her hand over her heart. \u201cI want to go cuddle up to Daisy and hold her. No wonder Jimmy acts twenty instead of eleven.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and pulled her hand away from her chest. \u201cThey\u2019ll be okay. I am, and I didn\u2019t have any older siblings to help me out. I made it without anyone. Don\u2019t get upset over it. They aren\u2019t the only kids growing up in this exact same situation.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s eyes held unshed tears as she tried real hard to keep her bottom lip from quivering. Ah, hell. I\u2019d made her cry. I hadn\u2019t told her all that to make her cry. I\u2019d just answered her questions. I\u2019d let her into my screwed-up life a little. More than I\u2019d ever let anyone in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever told about the kids and my mom. I\u2019ve never even told your brother.\u201d</p><p>Amanda pressed her lips together tightly and nodded. She didn\u2019t respond. She was still trying very hard not to cry. Her soft heart couldn\u2019t handle this. If she even knew a little bit of what my mom had done to those kids and me, she\u2019d never be able to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said gently as I reached for her arms and pulled her against my chest.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Going willingly into Preston\u2019s arms probably wasn\u2019t real smart, but at that moment, I just didn\u2019t care. I needed to hold him. I couldn\u2019t go hold Jimmy and Brent, but I could hold him. And tomorrow I would give Daisy every second of my attention when I wasn\u2019t in classes. I might even skip them just so I could stay here. She\u2019d be going back to her mom soon. The idea of her being neglected was painful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I told you all this,\u201d Preston whispered against my hair as he held me tightly to him. I wasn\u2019t sorry. He\u2019d let me in. It was something I\u2019d wanted. However, when I\u2019d wanted in, I\u2019d had no idea I was going to find this out. Images of Preston over the years kept flashing through my mind. When I\u2019d met him, he\u2019d been a skinny kid with hair so long he kept it in a ponytail. Even in his faded jeans and worn-out T-shirt I couldn\u2019t help but think he was beautiful. But I\u2019d wondered why his mother let him look like that.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me. For letting me help today. I know I\u2019m reacting to this like the spoiled brat that I am, but I\u2019m trying to process it. I want to go take them all away from your mom and keep them close. Take care of them. Make sure they have proper haircuts and clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s chest rumbled with laughter, and I looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cProper haircuts and clean clothes?\u201d he asked, grinning down at me.</p><p>\u201cI keep remembering the first time I saw you. Your hair was ridiculously long, and your clothes were so worn out. It didn\u2019t take away from the fact that you were the most gorgeous boy I\u2019d ever seen, but still. . . .\u201d Oh, crap. Had I really just said that?</p><p>Preston titled his head to the side and studied me a moment. \u201cYou thought I was gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I started to pull back from his arms, but he held me firmly in place. \u201cAnswer me,\u201d he whispered, lowering his head so that his mouth was very close to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes. You know you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Preston slid a hand down my back until he had a firm grip on my waist, and then he pulled me up higher against his chest. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know that,\u201d he replied, reaching with his other hand to cup my face and brush his thumb over my cheekbone. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m trying to figure out why you want anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you since I was sixteen. Surely you know this. I wasn\u2019t very secretive about it. I\u2019ve never missed one of your baseball games, not even the away ones. I found any reason I could think of to throw myself in your path. Then when I did get your attention, you were drunk, but I didn\u2019t care. I was willing to take what I could get. Maybe I didn\u2019t know you were as drunk as you were, but I was just glad you weren\u2019t treating me like a little girl anymore. I was tired of having to fantasize about you. I wanted the real thing.\u201d</p><p>Preston went very still. Dang it. I\u2019d opened my mouth and said too much. He was going to shove me toward the bathroom now and go hide in his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou fantasized about me?\u201d</p><p>Really? Was that all he got out of what I\u2019d just said?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, rolling my eyes and trying to move away, only to be held in place with a tight squeeze of my waist from his hand.</p><p>Preston lowered his mouth until it was against my cheek. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about these fantasies? You know, so I understand better.\u201d His warm breath tickled my skin, and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Preston\u2019s hand slipped under the hem of my shirt until his fingers were brushing up against my bare stomach. \u201cI disagree. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a real good idea,\u201d he said before trailing kisses against the tender skin behind my ear down to my neck.</p><p>Forming thoughts while Preston\u2019s hand was slowly moving up my stomach and his mouth was nuzzling and taking small nips at my neck wasn\u2019t exactly easy. I couldn\u2019t remember what it was we were talking about.</p><p>\u201cSee, Manda, it\u2019s a really good idea. So damn good,\u201d he said just before his hand cupped one of my breasts.</p><p>Focus. I needed to focus. There was a reason this was a bad idea. I just had to think really hard.</p><p>\u201cTake this shirt off for me,\u201d Preston said in a harsh whisper. Then he pulled my shirt over my head and dropped it somewhere to the side of us. His eyelids were lowered, and it only made him sexier. I hadn\u2019t realized that was possible.</p><p>With one hand Preston reached around me and undid the hooks on my bra, then pulled it away. I\u2019d been with him like this before, but it had been dark outside. We weren\u2019t in the dark now, and Preston\u2019s words \u201cI know your boobs aren\u2019t that big\u201d came back to haunt me. I didn\u2019t have the cup size most of the girls he dated did. He liked big boobs. Mine were nowhere near what he was used to. I glanced around frantically for my shirt.</p><p>\u201cManda, don\u2019t.\u201d Preston ran his hand through my hair and turned my head back toward him. Then his mouth covered mine. The soft warmth of his lips as they nipped and tasted me made my insides turn to butter. I slipped both my hands around his neck and held him there, afraid he\u2019d realize I had small boobs or that he didn\u2019t want to do this again and push me away.</p><p>Letting out a low growl, Preston grabbed both my legs and pulled me completely onto his lap until I was straddling him. The pressure from his erection pressed against me sent shots of pleasure through my body.</p><p>I fisted my hands in his hair and continued to taste him and get lost in the connection I\u2019d been denied before. His teeth caught my bottom lip, and he bit down gently with a small tug. I trembled and pressed down harder on his arousal, causing us both to moan from the sensation.</p><p>Preston\u2019s hands ran up my thighs, and then they both went up to cup my breasts. Once again I was reminded how lacking I was in that department. I tensed and started to move back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Preston asked, pulling me closer even as I tried to pull away.</p><p>\u201cNothing. But . . . can I just wear my shirt?\u201d</p><p>Preston lowered his head, keeping his eyes locked with mine until his tongue darted out and licked over one of my nipples. Then he pulled it into his mouth, and my body betrayed me by shooting off fireworks. I grabbed his shoulders and held on as he continued to lavish attention on one breast, then the other one. The cries of pleasure coming from my mouth couldn\u2019t be helped. Preston\u2019s tongue had complete control of my body.</p><p>When the warmth from his talented administrations stopped, I opened my mouth to beg for more, but the snap on my blue jean shorts stopped me. Looking down, I watched as Preston unzipped my shorts, then ran his hand over the pink satin of my panties.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to put your shirt on, Manda?\u201d he asked, raising his eyes to meet mine.</p><p>My shirt? What? I was confused. . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, mesmerized by the way his long lashes brushed his cheeks as he stared at me with this hungry, intense gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted your shirt on. Why?\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah . . . my shirt. I\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>\u201cUm, my, uh, it was just that . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t want to say this. I didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I just wanted him to keep slipping his hand farther down my shorts. If I reminded him that my boobs were too small for his taste, this may not happen.</p><p>He cupped one of my breasts and ran his thumb over my nipple. \u201cThey taste as sweet as they look,\u201d he whispered in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathed, watching him touch me.</p><p>\u201cSo why would you want to cover them up?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let this go. Sighing, I tried to will his hands to slip farther down my shorts. It didn\u2019t work. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything else until I answered him.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re smaller than you like,\u201d I mumbled, ducking my head to hide the humiliation on my face from having to actually say that out loud.</p><p>Preston froze, and I mentally cursed. I knew it. He\u2019d stop now.</p><p>\u201cStand up, Amanda.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a request. It was a command.</p><p>He was sending me to take a cold shower. I crawled off his lap and stood up, crossing my arms over my chest. I would look for my shirt later. Turning, I started to head to the shower, when Preston grabbed my hips and pulled me back. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I glanced back at him. \u201cThe bathroom, to cool down.\u201d</p><p>Preston lowered his eyebrows and shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Did he want me to leave instead?</p><p>\u201cTurn around, Manda.\u201d The deep, authoritative voice sounded sexy, but I didn\u2019t want to turn around. I wanted to go hide in the bathroom. \u201cPlease, baby. Turn back around,\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>He knew how to work me. That was for sure. Slowly I turned back around, keeping my arms crossed over my bare chest. Preston reached down and tugged on my unzipped shorts until they were sliding down my legs. \u201cStep out of them,\u201d he told me, and I did without question.</p><p>He reached up from his relaxed position on the couch and tugged at my arms until they uncrossed and fell to my side. He cupped each breast with his hands and held them as if they were precious before looking back up at me. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking perfect. Everything about you. Your smile. Your laugh can brighten up my whole damn day. The way you care about people so much that you drop everything to help them. These sexy-as-hell legs of yours that have been giving me raging hard-ons for years. These perfect, round, soft tits with nipples that I swear taste like candy. And then there is this.\u201d He slipped a hand between my legs and ran his middle finger across the wet silk of my panties. \u201cFuck, baby. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d He groaned before covering his mouth to mine and kissing me hard and fast. Each thrust of his tongue made my knees weak. I knew what he wanted. I knew what I wanted, and the wild kiss only heightened my desire.</p><p>I reached for his shirt, grabbing handfuls of material, and pulled it up and over his head. I needed him naked too. I pulled back from our kiss and ran my hands over his chest so I could feel each defined muscle. The small jump in his pecs made me smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got about three seconds left of exploring, Manda. I can\u2019t take much more.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers down to the button on his jeans and undid it, then slowly unzipped them. Just as I started to tug on them, Preston picked me up and kissed me hard on the mouth, then threw me down on the couch. \u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d he growled as he covered me with his body.</p><p>I opened my legs. I could feel his erection pressed against me. Now we only had one layer of jeans between us. Preston ran his hand down my stomach and then slid his fingers inside my panties. When his fingertips reached their destination, I grabbed him and bucked against his hand. \u201cOhmygod, Preston,\u201d I panted.</p><p>He dropped his head to the curve of my neck and began sliding his fingers in and out of me. Each time they re-entered me, I moved against the pressure. My body was taking over, and all I cared about was the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he breathed against my skin. \u201cLet me make it feel good. I want you to come against my hand so I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>The naughty words sent me over the edge. I screamed out his name, but his mouth covered mine to muffle the sound. The pulsing had erupted into ecstasy, and my body was trembling underneath him. His fingers slid back out, and his body left me. Opening my eyes in a panic, I started to beg him to come back. But he wasn\u2019t leaving. He was taking off his jeans.</p><p>Watching Preston Drake strip was one of those things a girl would never, ever forget. His boxer briefs fell to the ground along with his jeans, and I swallowed . . . hard. Although we\u2019d had sex before, I\u2019d never actually seen him naked. I\u2019d never seen any guy naked. It was amazing.</p><p>Preston took both sides of my panties and pulled them down, then threw them to the floor with the rest of our discarded clothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he breathed in an awed voice as he stared down at me.</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d I replied, because it was the truth.</p><p>Preston smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to stop calling me things like \u2018gorgeous\u2019 and \u2018beautiful.\u2019 I\u2019m gonna get a complex. Why can\u2019t I be \u2018sexy,\u2019 or maybe \u2018irresistible\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re those things too. Trust me.\u201d I smiled up at him.</p><p>Preston held himself over my body while he looked down at me. \u201cThat night. In the storage shed. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for that. It\u2019ll never be like that again with us.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and tucked the hair that was hanging over his eyes behind his ear. \u201cBut it felt good. Really, really good. Better than any of the times I\u2019d fantasized about.\u201d</p><p>Preston froze. \u201cWhen you say \u2018fantasized\u2019 . . . do you mean you thought about me when you touched yourself?\u201d</p><p>My face was instantly hot, and I knew he\u2019d seen my blush and knew the answer. There was no use in denying it. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be able to get that image out of my head.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed me softly on the lips. \u201cI want inside you so bad. But if you want us to stop here, we will.\u201d</p><p>No stopping. I was desperate enough that I might tie him up this time if he tried to escape. \u201cI want you inside me too.\u201d</p><p>Preston bit his bottom lip and closed his eyes tightly. \u201cBaby, between you telling me you touch yourself while thinking about me and you saying you want me inside you, I may fucking blow before I even get inside you.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, I shifted my hips underneath his, wanting to feel him with nothing between us. \u201cMmmm, not yet,\u201d he said, and bent his head to kiss my lips. Then he went lower to kiss each nipple. He pulled each one into his mouth before kissing a trail down my stomach. When his hands touched the insides of my thighs and pushed them open farther, I stopped breathing. The first flick of Preston\u2019s tongue against my clit and I had to bite down hard on my bottom lip to keep from screaming out his name.</p><p>I reached down and grabbed handfuls of his hair as he continued to taste and lick. Knowing he was completely sober and doing this made it even better. My body began to tremble, and I knew I was close. I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from crying out.</p><p>Preston\u2019s mouth left me, and I was about ready to beg him when I heard the rip of foil and looked down to see him slipping a condom on. Oh . . . never mind. I wanted that more.</p><p>His eyes lifted to meet mine. \u201cThat was incredible. Nothing has ever tasted as good as you do.\u201d</p><p>The naughty talk was something he excelled at, I\u2019d decided. I was pretty sure he could bring me to an orgasm just by talking dirty in my ear. I wondered if he\u2019d try that sometime.</p><p>Preston lowering himself over me stopped my train of thought. He closed his eyes tightly as the tip of his erection met my entrance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he breathed out in a ragged whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Please,\u201d I begged, and lifted my hips.</p><p>Preston eased inside me slowly. \u201cSo tight. Fucking heaven.\u201d</p><p>When he was completely inside, we both let out moans. He was inside me. I wanted to keep him there. I\u2019d never felt this close before with anyone. I knew now how disconnected he\u2019d been the first time we\u2019d done this. This time was so different. He was right here with me. Feeling everything I was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm and tight. I want to stay right here,\u201d he said before covering my mouth with his. His tongue thrust into my mouth, and I sucked on it hard.</p><p>Preston started to move. My hips moved with him as he slid in and out of me. He kissed me and whispered words of approval as his movements grew faster and harder. I was climbing with him. I needed more. I knew what was coming this time, and I wanted it.</p><p>Just as my orgasm hit me, Preston grabbed my hips and thrust hard one last time, calling out my name. It was perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>After waking up several times during the night to find Amanda still tucked tightly against my chest, it was a major letdown when I woke up alone.</p><p>I stretched and sat up, searching for the pieces of clothing we\u2019d thrown around the room. Amanda\u2019s were gone, and mine were neatly folded on the chair. When had she left? Standing up, I reached for my jeans and slipped them on before going to find my phone so I could call her and find out where the hell she was.</p> <p>If she thought last night hadn\u2019t changed things, then she was so very wrong. It had changed everything. My life was fucked up and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it, but I wasn\u2019t about to let Amanda go. Not now.</p><p>Whispering and giggling came from my bedroom. She was still here, or Daisy was talking to herself. I opened the door slowly to find Amanda sitting on the bed with Daisy. They were talking quietly, but whatever they were talking about was making Daisy laugh. Amanda was dressed in a short skirt, so almost every golden inch of her legs was in clear view. I\u2019d had those legs wrapped around me last night. I closed my eyes and forced the images away. Daisy was here. I had to keep my hands off Amanda in front of Daisy. This was going to be hard.</p><p>\u201cPweston!\u201d Daisy squealed as her eyes met mine, and she clapped happily. I\u2019d been spotted. Daisy\u2019s cheeks were a healthy pink today, and she was feeling much better. The happy glow on her face made my heart swell. Amanda had put that look there.</p><p>\u201cHey, my Daisy May. Looks like you\u2019re feeling better this morning,\u201d I told her as I walked into the room. I fought hard to keep my eyes off Amanda. I wasn\u2019t sure just yet how to explain to her how I felt. I sure as hell couldn\u2019t tell her what I did that paid for this apartment and also took care of my mom\u2019s place and the kids. I\u2019d lose her, and after last night I knew that wasn\u2019t an option. I couldn\u2019t lose Amanda.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling bettah,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd Amanda is gonna cuwal my hayah today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is? You got a big date I don\u2019t know about?\u201d I teased, sitting down beside her. She giggled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI just like cuwals,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Amanda started to move, and I couldn\u2019t keep from looking at her anymore. I turned my head in her direction and watched as she got off the bed and straightened her incredibly short skirt. She needed to change. That was too short.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She shrugged and twisted a lock of her hair around her finger nervously. \u201cI thought I\u2019d give y\u2019all some time to visit. I have a class in thirty minutes. I could come back after, if that\u2019s okay. I told Daisy I\u2019d curl her hair. . . .\u201d She trailed off and looked down at the floor.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been awake when she\u2019d woken up, to talk to her about anything. There was no telling what was going through her head right now. But I knew I needed to clear a few things up before I let her walk out of my apartment with that damn skirt on.</p> <p>\u201cDaisy May, why don\u2019t you watch a little television while I go fix you some breakfast and see Amanda off to school. Okay?\u201d I told her as I stood up.</p><p>Daisy nodded, and I handed her the remote to the flat-screen on my wall that I\u2019d won last month in a poker game.</p><p>I looked back at Amanda and nodded toward the door. She walked toward it and I followed her out. Yeah, that skirt was way too short in the back. If she bent over, someone would see her sweet little ass. She was going to have to change. No question.</p><p>Closing the door behind me, I moved quickly and grabbed her waist, then turned her around to face me and pressed her up against the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone when I woke up,\u201d I whispered before kissing the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI woke up early,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI missed getting to see you all rumpled from sleep, touching you while that sexy, sleepy haze was still in your eyes.\u201d I slipped my hand up her thigh and easily cupped her almost bare butt, thanks to the barely there panties she was wearing. \u201cManda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she replied a little breathlessly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to go change.\u201d</p><p>She went still in my arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go out like this. It\u2019ll drive me crazy. This skirt\u2019s too short, sweetheart. Guys will be looking, and I don\u2019t want them looking.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across her full red lips. Thank God. She wasn\u2019t going to get all pissy about this, because I really didn\u2019t want to force her to do anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous?\u201d she asked, almost as if she didn\u2019t believe it as she said it.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I\u2019m jealous,\u201d I replied, running my hand over the soft skin of her bottom. \u201cI\u2019m not sharing this. I don\u2019t want to think about other guys looking at you in this.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s smile got bigger, and I was real close to ripping these panties off and taking her against the fridge. The fact that my little sister was in the other room was the only reason I wasn\u2019t inside her right this minute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change,\u201d she replied, reaching up to touch my face. She kissed my cheek, then took in a deep breath as if she was smelling me. \u201cSo, last night . . . it wasn\u2019t just a onetime thing?\u201d</p><p>I would question how she could think that, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019d had sex with her before and walked away. She had every right to think I was going to walk again. She didn\u2019t realize that I was incapable of pushing her away anymore. We\u2019d gone too far.</p><p>\u201cLast night changed everything,\u201d I assured her before kissing the corner of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to get you out of my system. I don\u2019t want to. I need you, Manda.\u201d I covered her mouth with mine and slipped inside to taste her. This connection with her was the first thing in my life I was scared of. I\u2019d never feared anything else\u2014I could handle it. My brothers and sister I knew I\u2019d be there. I could take care of them. I\u2019d do whatever I had to, and I knew they\u2019d love me. But this thing with Amanda\u2014if I lost it, if I lost her, I would lose it all. In the screwed-up life I\u2019d been dealt, she was my only source of comfort. Just being with her made everything else seem like it would be okay. I\u2019d always be honest with her about everything . . . except the one thing that could take her from me. She\u2019d never understand. Even if she did, she\u2019d never be able to accept it. If she knew I slept with wealthy women for money, she\u2019d leave me. She could never know.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Jason: Have you thought about that dinner in NYC yet?</p><p>The text from Jason came during my literature class. I stared down at my phone and tried to think of what I was going to tell him. If the decision was between him and Preston, then it was Preston. I liked Jason, and he was probably the safer of the two guys when it came to protecting my heart. But that was just it. I wasn\u2019t worried about Jason hurting me, because I knew he didn\u2019t have that power. We\u2019d only gone out one time, and that was to my brother\u2019s engagement party. It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d led him on.</p><p>Tucking my phone back into my backpack, I decided I\u2019d deal with him later. I needed to think about the proper response. The professor dismissed class, and I hurried back outside to my car to get back to Preston\u2019s. I had promised to do Daisy\u2019s hair, and if I was completely honest with myself, I was anxious to see Preston again. Last night and this morning almost seemed like I\u2019d walked into one of my dreams.</p><p>Having Preston look at me with emotion in his eyes was amazing. And him telling me I had to change may have been a little barbaric, but honestly, I\u2019d put on a pair of sweats if he asked me to. The fact that he was possessive of me and didn\u2019t want other guys to look at me made my silly heart soar.</p><p>The bad thing was, I kept waiting for my alarm clock to wake me up. This didn\u2019t seem real just yet. My phone started ringing, and I reached into my backpack to get it out. Preston\u2019s number lit up the screen.</p><p>Smiling, I answered and put the phone to my ear. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. You out of class yet?\u201d</p><p>Was he checking up on me? Really?</p><p>\u201cYeah, just got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou coming back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I was planning on it. I promised to do Daisy\u2019s hair, remember?\u201d</p><p>He paused and sighed. Oh no, it was already ending. Time to wake up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I just wanted to make sure your plans hadn\u2019t changed. I need to run up to the gym and meet with Coach. I can\u2019t leave Daisy here alone.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . he wasn\u2019t trying to get rid of me.</p><p>\u201cI just hate to ask you to come here and stay with her while I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I opened my car door and got inside. \u201cI\u2019m glad I can watch her for you. I was planning on spending the rest of the day with Daisy, so it\u2019s no problem. I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. What was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you, Manda.\u201d</p><p>Was he really this unused to people helping him out with the kids? \u201cNo need to thank me. See ya in a sec.\u201d I clicked off and turned the car toward Preston\u2019s.</p><p>The door to Preston\u2019s apartment opened before I could knock. Preston reached out, grabbed my hand, and pulled me inside. His mouth was on mine immediately. It was different this time than it had been the other times. Something about it was desperate. Like he was trying to hold on to me. Was he worried that I was going to change my mind? After the way I\u2019d chased him for months? I let my backpack fall to the floor, and I slid my hands into his hair. He needed some kind of reassurance from me. I was sure of that. So I gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you,\u201d he said against my mouth as he closed the door behind me, then pressed me up against it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get back,\u201d I assured him, then took a nip at his bottom lip before stroking the inside of his mouth again with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d he repeated. His voice was a little panicked sounding as his hands ran up the inside of my shirt and cupped my boobs. \u201cI want you, Manda. Just you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile. That sounded so good. \u201cIt\u2019s just a workout, Preston. I\u2019ll even give you a massage when you get back.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around me, and I felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He muttered a curse and then pulled away from me. He ran the pad of his thumb over my bottom lip. \u201cI gotta go. I wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>This clingy Preston was something new. I liked it, but then, it also bothered me a little. I didn\u2019t want him to worry every time he left me that things would be different when he got back. Was he insecure? I\u2019d never pegged Preston as insecure.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner you go, the sooner you get back,\u201d I told him, biting down on his thumb that was still touching my lip. \u201cNow go.\u201d</p><p>Preston nodded and dropped his hand from my mouth. He started to say something more and stopped. I moved away from the door and watched as he opened it. He glanced back at me one more time before he left. I gave him a reassuring smile, and a slow, sexy smile touched his lips. I liked it when he was smiling. I didn\u2019t want him worried or anxious. When he closed the door, I realized he hadn\u2019t taken a bag with him. That was odd. Maybe he kept a change of clothes in his locker at the gym. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do it. Cassandra Gregory was one of my biggest clients. She\u2019d sent many more wealthy women my way too. But damn if I could leave Amanda at my apartment and walk into this woman\u2019s beach house and screw her. It would be a fucking miracle if I could even get it up. The guilt of having lied to Amanda and left her there taking care of Daisy was bad enough. Remembering how good it felt to be inside Amanda and having her cling to me and call out my name while she found release was a whole other issue. No one else was going to measure up to that. I\u2019d see her and feel wrong. I couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>I pulled my Jeep into the parking lot of Cassandra\u2019s beach house. I was going to have to tell her something. Anything to put this off. I needed the money. Jimmy had another orthodontist appointment for his braces next week, and I needed at least a thousand dollars for that. Then I needed to get new windows put in the kids\u2019 rooms. Two of them were cracked. Jimmy had said it was wetting the wall and floor when it rained. The last thing I needed was for the trailer to get a rotten floor.</p> <p>My phone rang. I glanced down to see my mom\u2019s name light up the screen.</p><p>Shit. Not who I wanted to talk to right now. But if I ignored her, she could go over to the apartment while I was gone and Amanda was there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said angrily into the phone. It was all her fault I was even in this predicament.</p><p>\u201cBring Daisy home. She\u2019s better by now. And my car\u2019s got a flat tire. I need new tires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring Daisy home tonight if I think she is okay. And if you want new tires, get a damn job.\u201d</p> <p>Stupid bitch hated for me to pay the bills, but she sure didn\u2019t mind asking me for money.</p><p>\u201cYou want me driving around on those bad tires of mine with your brothers and sister? Fine. I\u2019ll drive \u2019em to school. They hate the bus anyhow.\u201d</p><p>It was a threat she\u2019d keep because she was just that vicious.</p><p>I glanced up at the house in front of me. I needed the money. I always needed more money. I should have forced the prick who Dewayne had invited to the poker game to pay me cash and not taken that damn flat-screen. It wouldn\u2019t have been enough cash, but it would have helped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your tires. But you better not drive the kids anywhere until I do.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and threw it in the passenger seat. Shutting off all emotion and locking any feelings I had for Amanda deep inside, I opened the door to my Jeep and stepped outside. I\u2019d been doing this for three years now. I could do this. I had to.</p> <p>Three hours later I parked my Jeep back at my apartment and got out, slamming the door behind me. I\u2019d had enough time on the drive home to get very worked up. I kicked at my tire and slammed both hands down on the hood. Deep breaths. I needed to take deep breaths. My chest hurt, my stomach was twisted in knots, and the fuck money in my pocket was heavier than it had ever been. Before I\u2019d let Amanda in, this had been easy. Now it was sick. I was a screwed-up son of a bitch, literally. I needed to feel whole again. I needed to be near Amanda. I stalked across the parking lot and made my way up the stairs, taking them two at a time. Seeing her and holding her would make it better.</p><p>The woman I\u2019d just been paid well to entertain flashed in my mind, and I froze. I couldn\u2019t touch Amanda right now. I had to get clean. I needed a shower. The hottest fucking shower I could stand. Amanda didn\u2019t need to be close to the cheap, meaningless sex I\u2019d just had.</p><p>I opened the door and walked in. The television in my room was on, and I could hear the girls talking. Before either of them realized I was home, I headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I heard the click of the front door closing and watched the bedroom doorway for Preston to appear. He didn\u2019t. Glancing over at Daisy, who was now watching the television again after explaining to me that this girl was a bunch of kids\u2019 nanny and a couple of them were adopted, I eased off the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d I assured her when she turned her head full of curls to look at me. She smiled and went back to watching her show.</p><p>I closed the bedroom door on my way out and walked into the living room. The sound of the shower answered my question. Preston had come home from the gym all sweaty, and he wanted to get clean first. That was a shame. I\u2019d have liked to see him sweaty.</p><p>I went over to the fridge and pulled out the fried chicken and biscuits that Daisy had helped me make earlier. Preston was sure to be hungry after being at the gym for three hours. I turned on the oven and put a chicken breast and a leg along with a couple of biscuits on a cookie sheet, then slid it inside. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the microwave. I was more than positive it was the cause of all kinds of health problems.</p> <p>The water in the shower turned off, and the butterflies in my stomach started up as I waited anxiously to see him again. It was ridiculous that I was so excited about it. He\u2019d only been gone three hours.</p><p>When the bathroom door opened, Preston stepped out with nothing but a towel around his waist. There were no words for this. Nothing compared. His eyes met mine and a smile touched his lips.</p><p>\u201cHey you,\u201d he said as he walked over to me. I was cemented to my spot in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I managed to reply. Keeping my eyes off his body and on his face was another problem.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good.\u201d He looked over at the oven, then back at me. \u201cDid you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Preston lowered his head until his mouth hovered above mine. \u201cSexy as hell and she cooks. Dayum, baby, it don\u2019t get no better.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, I stood on my tiptoes to kiss his mouth before stepping back and checking on his chicken.</p><p>\u201cDaisy helped me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? I think you need to check on it again,\u201d he said with a wicked grin on his face as I stood back up.</p><p>\u201cIt needs a few more minutes,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cI was just admiring the view.\u201d</p><p>I let my gaze travel down his damp, barely covered body, then back up again. \u201cI could say the same,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Preston\u2019s eyes went dark and smoldering instantly. \u201cYou look at me like that again, and I\u2019ll haul you off to the bathroom and take you up against the sink.\u201d</p><p>I took a step toward him. \u201cIs that a threat or a promise?\u201d</p><p>Preston reached for my waist and jerked me against him, when the bedroom door opened. Daisy came skipping out, smiling.</p><p>\u201cPweston,\u201d she called out in greeting, and then a small frown touched her forehead. \u201cWheyah is youwah clothes?\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth to stifle my laugh and reached for a pot holder to get Preston\u2019s food out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cWell, Daisy May, I need to go get some. I just took a shower to get the nasty off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cooked you dinnah,\u201d she said happily, pointing to the food I was putting onto a plate for him.</p><p>\u201cAnd it looks delicious. Thank you, girls, for taking care of me. I\u2019ll go get some clothes on, then come eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Daisy agreed.</p><p>I watched Preston walk toward the door to his room, and the view of him in his towel was just as nice from the back. I needed a fan.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him about the peanut buttah pie yet?\u201d Daisy asked in a whisper after Preston closed the door.</p><p>\u201cNope. I thought I\u2019d let you surprise him with it. Since you did all the hard work on it.\u201d</p><p>Daisy clapped her hands and did a little happy dance. There was no way she was going to be able to let him eat all his meal before she pulled that pie out of the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me fix him a drink?\u201d</p><p>Daisy ran to the dishwasher and got out a clean glass. She handed it up to me. \u201cHe likes to dwink root beeah, I think. \u2019Cause Jimmy said he dwinks beeah, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the kind my momma dwinks. He don\u2019t like it when she dwinks that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Bless her heart. She was so little and knew so much already. I wasn\u2019t about to be the one to tell her that Preston did in fact drink beer. But I also knew there was not going to be any root beer in this kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow about the sweet tea I made earlier? You think he\u2019d like that?\u201d I hoped so, because that was what he was getting. I opened the fridge and shoved the Bud Lights to the back of the fridge and moved the orange juice in front of them before Daisy noticed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yummy sweet tea. I think he will,\u201d she replied.</p><p>I finished pouring his tea and fixed him a plate at the table with Daisy\u2019s help just in time for him to come strutting out of his room in a fitted light-blue T-shirt that matched his eyes, and a pair of low-slung jeans. That look should be illegal.</p><p>His feet were bare and tanned. I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to them before, but now I knew even his feet were sexy.</p><p>\u201cShould I stand still until you\u2019re done?\u201d Preston teased. I snapped my head up and met his amused gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you. I was enjoying it. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. I laughed. He\u2019d caught me ogling him.</p><p>\u201cYou dress like that, and it\u2019s hard not to look,\u201d I replied, and turned away from him to unload the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wong with his clothes?\u201d Daisy asked, confused.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell her nothing, but Preston beat me to it.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Daisy May. I just think Manda may like the way I look in my clothes.\u201d</p><p>My head shot up and his twinkling eyes met mine.</p><p>\u201cIf she does, then you should weah them all the time. She\u2019s sweet and fun and pwetty, and you can bwing hewah with you when you come see us.\u201d</p><p>The excited little voice made me want to go hug her tightly and assure her she\u2019d see me again. She still hadn\u2019t said a thing about her mother or even mentioned going home. That said more than any words she could have said. It broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, Daisy May. Maybe I should wear this every day. Might get Manda to stick around a little while. She and I could come get you and the boys and take you to get a burger sometime.\u201d</p><p>Daisy jumped up excitedly on the balls of her feet. \u201cYes, yes, please.\u201d She turned back to me. \u201cDo you like him in otha clothes, owah just those?\u201d The sincerity of her question made me smile. She was really going to campaign to get Preston to wear that outfit every day just so she could see me again. If she hadn\u2019t already edged her way into my heart, she\u2019d have done so then.</p><p>\u201cActually, Daisy, I think he looks nice all the time. He just caught me looking this time.\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s eyes went big, and a grin broke out on her face when she looked back at Preston. \u201cShe likes you, and she\u2019s weally, weally pwetty and fun.\u201d</p><p>Daisy was selling me to Preston. That might have been the sweetest thing ever.</p><p>\u201cShe smells real nice too, and I have a thing for that pretty blond hair of hers,\u201d Preston added, leaning back in his chair and studying me.</p><p>\u201cShe does smell good,\u201d Daisy agreed. \u201cAnd hewah sweet tea is yummy.\u201d</p><p>Preston nodded. \u201cYeah, she has all kinds of stuff that is yummy.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together to keep from laughing, and leaned a hip against the counter to watch the two of them study me.</p><p>\u201cAnd she can sing, too. She singed me all kinds of songs.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s eyes went wide at Daisy\u2019s statement. Dang it. I hadn\u2019t meant for her to tell Preston</p><p>I\u2019d sung to her. She\u2019d asked me to, and I figured no one had ever sung to her before. I\u2019d let her crawl up into my lap, and I\u2019d sung her every song she\u2019d asked me to.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Preston asked with a mischievous smile on his face. \u201cHmm. I didn\u2019t know that. I guess that will be the deciding factor for me. Amanda will have to sing for me before I decide if I want to keep her around.\u201d</p><p>Daisy seemed pleased with this. \u201cYay! You will keep hewah. She sings weal pwetty.\u201d</p><p>I already dreaded the moment he got me alone.</p><p>Preston\u2019s phone rang, and he tensed up immediately. The playful look on his face was gone. Who was he expecting?</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, then let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m bringing her home in a little while. Let me eat first.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. It was his mom. I wasn\u2019t ready to give Daisy back to that woman.</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>He put the phone down and looked over at Daisy. \u201cMomma is ready for you to come home, Daisy May. Why don\u2019t you go get your stuff together while I finish up?\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s little face fell, but she didn\u2019t argue. She nodded and went to the bedroom.</p><p>I watched her until she was out of sight, then looked back at Preston. \u201cDoes she have to go?\u201d I asked in a low voice.</p><p>Preston frowned and nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it either.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll be okay? Will your mom remember to give her the antibiotics every day? Because it is real important that she take them until they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy will make sure she gets all of it. He\u2019s good with stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung my eyes, and I had to walk away before I started crying and Daisy saw me. I went to the bathroom and turned on the faucet to mask my sniffling. The idea of sending Daisy back to that old, dirty trailer with a momma who didn\u2019t care was horrible.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Preston opened the door to the bathroom and stepped inside. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled me into a hug and rested his chin on my head. \u201cI know this sucks, but I promise you, she\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m going to make sure you get to see her again. Heck, if you\u2019ll stop crying, I\u2019ll get her a phone too so you two can talk.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I liked that idea. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay you want me to get her a phone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Preston chuckled. \u201cDone. Now stop crying. I check on them more than once a week.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to make him feel like he was failing them when it was obvious he was doing everything he could to take care of them. If he had a real job, I didn\u2019t know what it was. He had school and baseball. Over the years he\u2019d had some side jobs, but nothing that stuck around long. Somehow he got money. I\u2019d started to ask him about it when the bathroom door opened and Daisy stood there frowning up at us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wong?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let her know why I\u2019d been crying. I smiled and stepped out of Preston\u2019s arms. \u201cNothing. I just got something in my eye and came in here to get it out.\u201d I reached back and turned the water off.</p><p>\u201cWhy was Pweston hugging you?\u201d</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t miss anything.</p><p>\u201cI was getting it out for her,\u201d Preston replied.</p><p>Daisy seemed to be okay with this answer, so she nodded. \u201cI got my stuff weady to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, my Daisy May, let me finish eating, and then we will go.\u201d</p><p>\"But what about his supwise?\" Daisy asked me looking at the refrigerator hopefully.</p><p>\"I think now would be an awesome time for his surprise,\" I replied, and she dropped her bag and ran over to retrieve the peanut butter pie out of the fridge. Preston shot me a questioning look and I just grinned.</p><p>\"I did all the hawd stuff. Just ask Manda,\" Daisy informed him as she held out the peanut butter pie toward him with pride.</p><p>\"You made me a pie?\" Preston asked with awe in his voice as he bent down to her level.</p><p>\"Yep, I did. Peanut Buttah.\"</p><p>Preston bent over and kissed her cheek. \"I bet that\u2019s gonna be the best peanut butter pie I\u2019ve ever had.\"</p><p>Daisy beamed up at him, and at that moment, Preston Drake was absolutely perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>I was restless. Amanda had left when I went to take Daisy home. She said she needed to go eat dinner with her mother. Last night she\u2019d told her mom she was staying over at a friend\u2019s. She said her mom would get curious if she didn\u2019t show up tonight. The whole apartment smelled like Amanda. I hadn\u2019t been alone with her since work today. I needed to be alone with her. The fear inside me was eating me alive. If she ever found out . . . That couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>My phone rang, and I stalked over to the counter and jerked it up. It was the wrong Hardy.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, trying not to be irritated that it was Marcus and not Amanda.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019re you up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>Waiting by the phone for your sister to call me wasn\u2019t exactly something I could tell him. \u201cNothing. Just at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow is studying for an test, and she needs me to get out of her hair. Feel like meeting me at Live Bay? Rock will be there. Jackdown\u2019s playing, and you know Trisha won\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>No. I wanted to stay here and wait on Amanda. But then if she didn\u2019t call, I might go a little crazy. I needed a distraction.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, yeah. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he replied, and we hung up.</p><p>I slipped on my boots and grabbed my keys. I\u2019d go hang out with my friends until Amanda called.</p><p>The place was already crawling when I walked in. I stopped by the bar and grabbed a beer before making my way over to our table. Marcus was already here. Rock and Trisha were taking up only one stool since she was in his lap. Dewayne wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Marcus said as I pulled out the stool beside him and sat down.</p><p>\u201cBut for how long? Soon as a girl comes over here sniffing, we\u2019ll lose him for the night,\u201d Rock drawled.</p> <p>Marcus laughed.</p><p>I tried not to tense up. They\u2019d notice if I acted different. Then they\u2019d all start asking questions. And there was no way in hell I was answering those questions. Marcus was like my brother, but if he tried to keep me from Amanda, there was gonna be a problem. No one was stopping this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a night off,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cSomeone wear you out last night?\u201d Rock asked.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t going there with them either. This was hard. I\u2019d always been able to talk about girls with them. But then, I\u2019d never talk about Amanda the way I talked about those other girls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not in the mood,\u201d I explained, and took a long swig.</p><p>A phone rang, and Marcus pulled his out. \u201cIs she okay? . . . Yeah, I checked on her today. . . . Sorry, I\u2019m at Live Bay. Can you hear me now? . . . If she\u2019s sleeping fine, then you should be good if you want to leave. . . . Uh, no. Preston, Rock, and Trisha are here. You wanna come see me? . . . Ha! Sure you do. I\u2019ll see you in a sec.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone. \u201cMy mom is going to wear Amanda out. As much as I\u2019d have missed her, I don\u2019t like the idea of her staying here to take care of Mom. She needs a life.\u201d</p> <p>That had been Amanda. My phone vibrated in my pocket.</p><p>I pulled it out and looked down.</p><p>Amanda: Is it okay with you if I come to Live Bay? If not I\u2019ll just go to bed and see you later.</p><p>Hell, no. I needed to see her tonight.</p><p>Me: Your brother thinks you\u2019re coming here. Come ease his mind. Then we\u2019ll figure out a way to leave.</p><p>\u201cIs Preston texting?\u201d Rock asked. \u201cWhen the hell did he start texting?\u201d</p><p>Amanda: Okay. See ya in a few.</p><p>I slipped my phone back into my pocket and looked up to see the entire table staring at me with incredulous expressions on their faces. So I didn\u2019t text that often. What was the big deal?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, reaching for my beer.</p><p>\u201cYou were texting someone,\u201d Marcus replied.</p><p>\u201cIntensely,\u201d Trisha added.</p><p>With Amanda headed up here, I did not need them watching my every move.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s called sexting. You get them worked up enough, and they\u2019ll start sending sexy little videos via text.\u201d I winked and leaned back in my seat.</p><p>That was what they expected of me. Marcus laughed and shook his head. Rock raised his eyebrows and looked at Trisha. \u201cIf I get you that new iPhone, will you send me sexy little videos?\u201d</p><p>Trisha giggled and whispered in his ear.</p><p>I turned my attention off them and watched the door.</p><p>I managed to stay in the conversation at the table without appearing like I was as disconnected as I was.</p><p>Then the door opened, and Amanda finally walked in.</p><p>Motherfucking hell.</p><p>She was wearing a short little red dress and cowboy boots. I was going to end up in a fight.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure this was such a good idea. Every time I\u2019d ever been in Live Bay, Preston had been drunk and there were girls with centerfold bodies wrapped all over him. I\u2019d changed clothes three times trying to find something that made me look sexy enough to compete with the girls I\u2019d be up against in here. Unfortunately, nothing I owned made my boobs look any bigger than they were. So I decided to play up my strengths. Preston liked my legs. So I went with that.</p><p>I looked over at their table, and Preston\u2019s eyes were already locked on me. He looked . . . mad. Why was he mad? Maybe mad wasn\u2019t the word. Maybe he looked fierce. I wasn\u2019t sure. The good thing was, the only girl at their table was Trisha. I had been prepared to walk into something much worse.</p><p>As I headed toward the table, someone stepped in front of me. I looked up to see Dameon Wallace\u2019s smiling face. I\u2019d thought he was gorgeous in high school. But now he didn\u2019t seem so perfect anymore.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dameon,\u201d I replied, taking a step to the side to get around him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Amanda. Haven\u2019t seen you since graduation. How are things?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cGood, thank you, and you?\u201d</p><p>His hand grabbed mine, and he pulled me close to his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d he whispered in my ear as he pulled me away from Dameon.</p><p>\u201cA dress,\u201d I replied, trying to figure out why he was asking me such a ludicrous question and why he was making a scene in front of my brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna end up beating someone\u2019s ass tonight because of this dress,\u201d he growled, and let go of my hand. \u201cGo to the table. I\u2019ll handle this with Marcus.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and hurried to the table, trying to look casual while Marcus studied me carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d Marcus said, looking over my shoulder at Preston, who was right behind me.</p><p>\u201cYep\u201d was the best reply I could come up with. I smiled over at Rock and Trisha, who also seemed to be studying me, then Preston, curiously.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what that was about?\u201d Marcus asked, his gaze locked on Preston instead of me.</p><p>I was almost afraid to look at Preston, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I needed to make sure he was okay.</p><p>\u201cThat douche was all over her, and you were just gonna sit here and let it happen. Someone had to go get her,\u201d Preston explained in an annoyed tone.</p><p>\u201cThat was mighty chivalrous of you.\u201d Trisha sounded amused and not at all fooled.</p><p>Marcus turned back to look at me. \u201cDid that guy touch you?\u201d The edge to his voice meant he was buying Preston\u2019s excuse. That was good. But I still didn\u2019t want him going and roughing up Dameon for just saying hello.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend from high school. We did the flirting thing in school but never anything more. Preston misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>The tension in Marcus\u2019s shoulders eased, and he nodded.</p><p>I chanced a glance at Preston, who hadn\u2019t relaxed at all. He was even more tightly wound now than he had been before. This was a really bad idea. My coming here was going to be an issue.</p><p>\u201cDid I take your seat, Preston?\u201d I asked, trying to distract him.</p><p>He shifted his gaze to me. \u201cNo. You\u2019re fine. I\u2019m gonna go grab another beer and I\u2019ll get a stool. You want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Coke, please,\u201d I replied.</p><p>He nodded and headed toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cAmanda\u201d Marcus called my name, and I tore my eyes off of Preston\u2019s retreating form and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m missing something here?\u201d he asked, studying my face closely.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at Preston at the bar. Preston was getting our drinks and blowing off a girl at the same time. He looked very uninterested, which made me smile. Preston\u2019s eyes met mine and a knowing grin tugged at his lips. His eyes shifted to my brother\u2019s and the smile vanished.</p><p>I decided to study the stage. Jackdown had just come back on the stage, and Trisha was doing her normal cheering.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your Coke,\u201d Preston said, sliding a mug of ice and a can in front of me, then pulling up a stool on the other side of Marcus. He wasn\u2019t sitting beside me. This was so frustrating. I just wanted to tell Marcus and let him get over it. How bad could it be?</p><p>The music was too loud to hear anything else, so no one talked while Krit\u2019s voice filled the room. He had a smooth sound with a little raspy touch to it that made girls go crazy. I had to admit, the guy was hot. I\u2019d never really been into him like a lot of my friends, but then, deep down I\u2019d always had a thing for Preston. It was hard to focus my attention on anyone else. I had liked Dameon in high school but it was never anything very serious.</p><p>A girl walked up to Preston and started whispering in his ear. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and his eyes shot directly to me. This was what I was afraid of when I\u2019d decided to come tonight. Girls knew Preston as a player. They loved him for it. Preston moved forward away from her mouth, which was entirely too close to his body.</p><p>His eyes never left mine. I dropped my gaze to my soda and contemplated just leaving. This was too hard. I couldn\u2019t get upset about the girl because of Marcus. Preston couldn\u2019t act like he was taken because of Marcus. If I was going to be anything more than just a blip on Preston\u2019s radar, we were going to have to tell Marcus.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t just keep going this way. Preston\u2019s reputation would require he act a certain way to keep Marcus from questioning things. I reached for my purse and stood up. I\u2019d tell Marcus bye and go back home. It was where I should have stayed.</p><p>Preston was up and out of his seat before I could say anything. I stopped and watched as he pushed the girl away and walked over to me. \u201cDance with me,\u201d he said in my ear, taking my purse and laying it back down on the table, then pulling me out to the dance floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Preston</p><p>I\u2019d be fighting tonight, but it wouldn\u2019t be with some guy who was getting too close to Amanda. It would be with her brother. He\u2019d been watching me closely, and I\u2019d just given him a very good reason to suspect something. But it had been a choice between letting the girl paw all over me in front of Amanda and watching her face fall, or having my best friend take a swing at me, so I was going with the ass kicking.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let her walk out of here like that. She\u2019d been upset and about to bolt. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked as I pulled her into my arms once we were in the mass of moving bodies. Hopefully, far enough in that Marcus couldn\u2019t see us. Although there was a good chance he was right behind us.</p><p>\u201cDancing with you,\u201d I replied, slipping my hands down over the curve of her hips.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back over my shoulder to see if Marcus was barreling down on us. Coast was still clear. I turned back to Amanda. \u201cYou were about to leave,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Her face pinched into a frown. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d seen more than I could stomach.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled her closer to me and bent my head to whisper in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in you. If you\u2019d left, I\u2019d have chased your sexy ass down.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, slipped a hand up my chest, then twined it behind my neck. \u201cI\u2019d have let you catch me. You wouldn\u2019t have had to try real hard.\u201d</p><p>I was ready to haul her out of here and get her alone. But that wasn\u2019t going to happen until I faced one big hurdle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to talk to Marcus about this.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to kiss her and reassure her, but I\u2019d pushed it far enough. There was a good chance Marcus, me, or both of us could end up in the emergency room if I gave in to that urge.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be upset,\u201d she said.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo, baby. He\u2019s gonna be pissed. So damn pissed he\u2019s gonna go for my throat.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted in my hair. What was she going to do, try to hold me here?</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to tell him. I can learn to deal with the girls.\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t, and I sure as hell couldn\u2019t deal with the guys. There was no hiding that. When that dickwad had stepped in front of her, I\u2019d been one-track-minded. I didn\u2019t care who saw me or what they thought. I just wanted him to move. If he\u2019d touched her, it would have been a lot worse.</p><p>\u201cI want guys to know you\u2019re with me. I don\u2019t like them getting close.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and pressed against me again. \u201cWell, at least no one was hanging all over me. You had a girl making out with your back.\u201d</p><p>I eased both my hands down over her butt and squeezed it gently, causing her to laugh louder. \u201cIf he\u2019d touched you, things would have gone down a lot differently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really? How so?\u201d</p><p>She was teasing me. It was easy to forget we weren\u2019t alone when she looked up at me like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have beat. His. Ass.\u201d</p><p>A hand gripped my shoulder. It was too big to be a female\u2019s, and the hold it had on me meant Marcus had finally come after me. Amanda\u2019s eyes went wide, and she started shaking her head at him.</p><p>\u201cI got this. It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I assured her. She dropped her hands from my neck and grabbed on to my arm tightly.</p><p>\u201cOutside. Now,\u201d Marcus said in a loud, angry snarl. Oh yeah. He was pissed. \u201cLet him go, Amanda,\u201d Marcus snapped at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to her that way.\u201d I raised my voice and got right back in his face. I understood he was mad, but he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to take it out on her.</p><p>\u201cOutside. Now,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>I looked back at Amanda as Marcus stalked toward the door. She was holding on to me so tight her fingernails were digging into my arm. \u201cStay here,\u201d I told her, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she yelled over the crowd. I started moving over the crowd with her holding on to my arm. She was going to have to let me go. Marcus was only going to get more furious if she kept holding on to me like this.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck. What the hell have you done?\u201d Rock said as he stepped in front of us just before we reached the door.</p><p>\u201cMove, Rock,\u201d I said, pushing past him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, God, tell me you didn\u2019t\u201d\u2014he paused and looked over at Amanda\u2014\u201cdo what I think you did,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your business. Just let me go talk to Marcus,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Rock let out a hard laugh. \u201cHe ain\u2019t planning on talking to you. He\u2019s planning on whooping your ass and then locking his sister up in her bedroom for the rest of her life. I just hope he ain\u2019t got a gun on him.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s grip on me tightened. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because she was worried about Marcus hurting me or keeping us apart. I\u2019d never fought with Marcus before, so I wasn\u2019t real sure who was gonna come out of this one on top, but I sure as hell wasn\u2019t gonna let him keep Amanda from me.</p><p>\u201cManda, girl, you need to stay inside with Trisha,\u201d Rock said, reaching out to get Amanda\u2019s arm. \u201cAin\u2019t no reason for you to go out there. Let go of Preston before Marcus sees you clinging to him and blows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Touch. Her.\u201d I clipped out, trying real hard not to jerk her away from him.</p><p>\u201cChill the fuck out. I\u2019m trying to keep her from seeing you and Marcus beat each other\u2019s heads in. Ain\u2019t something she needs to see.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and looked down at her. \u201cYou want to go with Trisha, Manda?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and squeezed me tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making her leave me. Besides, neither one of us will let her get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Rock shook his head and sighed. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe\u2019s Marcus\u2019s little sister. You could screw around with anyone else. Why did you mess with his sister?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care that Rock was the size of a bear and built like a brick wall. He wasn\u2019t going to lump Amanda in with any other girl I\u2019d ever slept with. I stepped up until I was in his face. \u201cNever talk about her like that again. She is not someone I\u2019m screwing around with.\u201d</p><p>I swung the door open and walked outside with Amanda still attached to me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have been nicer to Rock and brought him out here with you,\u201d she said, walking as closely to me as possible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need Rock. It\u2019s gonna be okay. But he\u2019s right. You need to let go of me. This ain\u2019t gonna help Marcus\u2019s temper.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, and I gave up.</p><p>Marcus was pacing in front of his truck. When he saw us, he stopped and his hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>\u201cLet go of him, Amanda,\u201d he ordered as we approached him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Marcus. Listen to me. You don\u2019t understand. You need to calm down and let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an explanation. I\u2019ve known Preston since we were kids. I\u2019ve seen it all from him. Enough to know that he isn\u2019t the kind of guy a girl like you needs to be hanging on to and defending. You don\u2019t know him, Amanda. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do! I know a lot about him, and you have no idea what is going on here. I started this. He ran from me for months. He pushed me away, and I just kept on coming back. And he is not treating me the way you seem to think he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t chase me,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t stand to listen to her tell him she\u2019d come after me so hard and I\u2019d just given in. That wasn\u2019t the way this had happened at all.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she did,\u201d Marcus replied in a deadly calm voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did! I even took advantage of him when he was drunk one night,\u201d Amanda said, stepping in front of me.</p><p>\u201cManda, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was completely drunk, and I came on to him. He doesn\u2019t even remember it. He tried so hard to keep me at arm\u2019s length. He was nice to me, but he kept telling me no. Then his sister got sick and I ran after him to his Jeep and went with him. She is so sweet and little, Marcus. We took care of her together, and then things just happened. I finally got past his walls. He let me in. Don\u2019t ruin this for me. I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Marcus reached for Amanda and jerked her away from in front of me. His fist was planted firmly in my face before I could wrap my head around the fact that she\u2019d just said she loved me.</p><p>\u201cYou sorry-ass motherfucker!\u201d Marcus roared, and jerked me up by my collar before his fist connected with my face again.</p><p>I could hear Amanda\u2019s screams in the distance. But my eyesight was blurry and my head felt foggy. I shook it and raised my hands to block any more attacks while I tried to stop my world from spinning.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, NO!\u201d Amanda was crying. My head cleared up real fast. This was making her cry. I didn\u2019t want her to cry.</p><p>When his fist came at me this time, I blocked it and shoved him hard in the chest to get him to back off me. Hitting him would upset Amanda more, but I couldn\u2019t let him beat the shit out of me either.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you. You\u2019re my best friend. How could you screw around with my little sister? She thinks she loves you,\u201d Marcus roared. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know you. Tell her, Preston. Tell her the shit you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I yelled. \u201cYou got your hits in. She\u2019s upset. I\u2019m not going to hit you and upset her more.\u201d I reached up with my arm to wipe the blood that was trickling out of my nose. Amanda ran past her brother and barreled into my chest.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Marcus growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Amanda cried against my chest. Seeing her like this was making me crazy. Could he not see he was doing to her?</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d I barked at him. \u201cLet me calm her down first. She needs reassurance we aren\u2019t gonna kill each other. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>I bent my head and cupped Amanda\u2019s face so I could look down at her. My left eye was swelling closed, but I could still see her tear-streaked face. I hated seeing her like this. If it wouldn\u2019t make things worse, I\u2019d take a few swings at her stupid-ass brother for making her cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I won\u2019t let him hit me anymore. He caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>She loved me. Her words replayed in my head again. How could someone as fucking sweet as Amanda Hardy love me?</p><p>\u201cI just want to go. I need to get you some ice, and you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d She hiccupped.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll let you do both those things, but first let me deal with him, okay?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped both her arms around my chest and held on tight. This was her way of protecting me. No one had ever protected me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d came Rock\u2019s voice from behind me. \u201cBack off, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my sister he\u2019s screwing with, Rock. Don\u2019t tell me to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I let you beat his face in. I thought the same thing.\u201d Rock stepped in between us. He looked back at me. His gaze dropped to Amanda, then lifted back up to my face. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do different,\u201d Marcus spat out. \u201cShe\u2019s my little sister. I\u2019m supposed to protect her. I\u2019ve always protected her. I can\u2019t let him near her. He isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p><p>The pain at hearing words I already knew were true thrown in my face by one of the only people who I had thought accepted me, flaws and all, was hard.</p><p>Amanda turned her head around to face her brother. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that. Just SHUT UP, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Rock waved his hand in our direction. \u201cYou see that? You ever seen him hold on to someone like that? He didn\u2019t fight back\u2014not because he couldn\u2019t, because if it was a real fight between the two of you, my money\u2019d be on Preston. He\u2019s been fighting his whole life. He didn\u2019t hit you because he didn\u2019t like upsetting your sister. He was protecting her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus took fast, angry breaths as he looked down at Amanda holding on to me, then back up at me. He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she said she loves him,\u201d Marcus told Rock. Then he looked back at me. \u201cShe loves you. Do you even know what to do with that?\u201d</p><p>I kissed the top of her head. \u201cCherish it like it\u2019s the most precious thing on the face of the earth,\u201d I replied with all sincerity.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell. He\u2019s gone and got all poetic,\u201d Rock said, grinning and shaking his head. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>Marcus leaned back on the hood of his truck and crossed his arms over his chest, then hung his head. We\u2019d won. He was conceding.</p><p>\u201cYour eye\u2019s gonna completely close up if you don\u2019t go get ice on it. Y\u2019all go on. I\u2019ll deal with Marcus,\u201d Rock said, nodding toward my Jeep for us to leave.</p><p>I wanted to promise Marcus I\u2019d never hurt her, or to tell him I loved her too. But I couldn\u2019t do those things. If she ever found out about what I did to take care of my family, she\u2019d be hurt. I wanted her. I needed her. But did I love her? Could I love her if I couldn\u2019t be completely honest with her?</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I fixed an ice pack while Preston took a shower and cleaned all the blood off his face. I cringed thinking about his beat-up face. It was going to be hard to forgive Marcus. He\u2019d just kept hitting Preston, who wasn\u2019t even defending himself. I\u2019d known Marcus would be upset, but I didn\u2019t know he would be so violent. I\u2019d never seen Marcus fight anyone, and I\u2019d hardly ever heard him curse. He\u2019d done both tonight.</p><p>Why he couldn\u2019t have just listened to me and let me explain, I didn\u2019t understand. He just lost it. If I hadn\u2019t let go of Preston\u2019s arm, he wouldn\u2019t have hit him. It was my fault. The only thing I could have done to protect him was stay in the line of fire, and I\u2019d moved thinking I could get Marcus to talk about it. To listen to me.</p><p>The bathroom door opened, and Preston came walking out in nothing but a towel again. I could get used to that. The bruises on his face and his swollen eye, however, had my complete attention at the moment.</p><p>\u201cSit down. We need to put ice on your eye,\u201d I informed him before pushing him toward the couch.</p><p>\u201cYou not gonna let me put on clothes first?\u201d he asked in an amused tone.</p><p>\u201cNope. We\u2019ve waited too long already to ice your eye. Sit.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue. He adjusted the towel to keep it from gaping open when he sat down, and leaned back. I handed him the ice pack. \u201cYou do it. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I had a steak. It would work better,\u201d he said, taking the pack and holding it to his eye and wincing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said again. I couldn\u2019t help it. Every time I looked at his face, I felt guilty.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Manda.\u201d He reached for me. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I went willingly. I needed to feel him and know he was okay. Besides, his chest was naked, and snuggling up to it was something I wanted to do very much.</p><p>\u201cI expected Marcus to come at me. He was mad. I can\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers over the ripples in his stomach. \u201cHe was an asshole. I can\u2019t believe he acted that way.\u201d</p><p>Preston chuckled. \u201cYeah, well, baby, there\u2019s a lot about me you don\u2019t know. Marcus knows most of it. He knows enough to not want his little sister anywhere near me.\u201d</p><p>What did that mean? Was he now saying I was an idiot too?</p><p>I started to pull away, and Preston\u2019s arms tightened on me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I\u2019d told my brother I loved Preston tonight. Heck, I\u2019d told anyone in the parking lot who was around to hear me yell it. But Preston hadn\u2019t said the same. I hadn\u2019t really expected him to. I knew he didn\u2019t love me. But I guess I expected more of an affirmation from him. Something more than him agreeing that Marcus being mad was warranted. It was like he was agreeing that I was making a mistake.</p><p>\u201cManda, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d I could hear the concern in his voice.</p><p>Tears stung my eyes, and I blinked them away. I was not going to cry. I was tired of crying about everything. No wonder Marcus treated me like a baby. I acted like one.</p><p>\u201cYou just sound like you\u2019re agreeing with Marcus. Like you think my wanting to be with you is a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s body stiffened, and then the ice bag dropped beside him. His hands were on my waist, pulling me into his lap.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Manda,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>I did as he asked, and the emotions I could see in his eyes were enough. He might not love me, but he felt something really close. I could see it.</p><p>\u201cNothing about this thing we have is a bad thing. I\u2019m not gonna lie about it: I don\u2019t deserve you. I\u2019m sure as hell not good enough for you, but as long as you want me, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a proclamation of love, but it was as close as I would ever get with Preston. I knew enough about his past to know he\u2019d never been serious about any girl.</p><p>\u201cIs this thing with us going to be exclusive? Or is it just a thing . . .\u201d I trailed off, not sure how to word this. I didn\u2019t want to say \u201cjust sex,\u201d because it wasn\u2019t about the sex. We were more than that, or at least I thought so.</p><p>\u201cHell yes, it\u2019s exclusive. You can\u2019t date anyone else, Manda. I can\u2019t deal with it. I was ready to rip a guy\u2019s arms off for talking to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>This was a two way street.</p><p>\u201cUm, and you . . . is it exclusive for you?\u201d I asked tentatively. I knew if he couldn\u2019t tell me yes, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. I was in too deep emotionally.</p><p>Preston grinned. He ran his hand through my hair and cupped the back of my head. \u201cBaby, all I see is you. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced, but I can\u2019t see anyone else anymore. Just you.\u201d</p><p>My heart slammed against my chest. Preston pulled my head close enough that his lips could touch mine. I knew his face was sore, so I kissed him back softly. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cManda, I want you,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>Those weren\u2019t the three words I wanted to hear from him. but they were a very close second. I eased off his lap and stood in front of him while I reached back and unzipped my sundress and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d Preston whispered.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t worn a bra with my sundress, and I\u2019d worn a pair of the skimpiest panties I had. I was bending down to take off my boots when Preston leaned forward and grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cLeave the boots on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get my panties off?\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a wicked grin, then grabbed both my legs and pulled me in between his. Running his hands up my legs, he slipped both hands under the thin strings holding my panties up, and with one hard jerk they fell off me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to know how you knew how to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll replace them. I\u2019ll buy you a bunch just like them,\u201d he promised, pulling me down onto his lap as he removed the towel he was wearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>\u201cCan we do it this way?\u201d Amanda asked nervously as she straddled my lap.</p><p>God, she was so damn innocent. Knowing I\u2019d been the only one ever to touch her, to be inside her, to taste her, made my insane possessiveness worse. I wanted to keep her close. Away from everyone else.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart, it feels real good this way,\u201d I assured her as I held her hips. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the control.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward and pulled one of her nipples into my mouth. They were right there, teasing me. I couldn\u2019t ignore them. I was pretty damn sure I was addicted to them. She arched her back and let out a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cI want it in,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>I smiled up at her. \u201cThen put it in.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide with surprise, and then she slowly lowered her body until the tip of my erection touched the entrance we both wanted it in so badly.</p><p>\u201cDo I just go down?\u201d she asked, looking back up at me.</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t so incredibly turned on, I would have laughed. \u201cYeah, just go down on it.\u201d I liked the way that sounded.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip as she eased down on it.</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s so good,\u201d I groaned as she teased us both by going slow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she panted, \u201cit is.\u201d</p><p>She paused, and I wanted so badly to thrust up, but I held back. This was going to be all her. \u201cDo I keep going?\u201d She was breathing fast and hard, making her tits bounce gently in my face. God, it didn\u2019t get any better than this.</p><p>\u201cAll the way down,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>She sank down all the way, and my hips bucked on their own accord, causing her to cry out.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d I growled as her muscles inside squeezed my dick.</p><p>\u201cOhgod. It feels so good,\u201d she said, throwing her head back and giving me complete access to her pretty neck. I leaned forward and kissed and licked several soft spots before she started to move. Lifting her hips, she said, \u201cI wanna move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp and down, baby. As fast or slow as you want to. It\u2019s your ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed, her eyes going wider at my words.</p><p>She eased up, and I had to fist my hands at my sides to keep from taking over. This was making me fucking crazy. Flipping her on her back and pumping in and out of her until we both screamed out in release was very tempting. But then, watching her experience this for the first time was something I\u2019d never forget.</p><p>\u201cPreston,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go faster? I think I wanna go faster.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell yeah. \u201cYou ride me as fast and hard as you want to. If it feels good to you, it feels just as amazing to me. I promise. You can\u2019t do this wrong.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and placed both her hands on my shoulders, then eased up off me and sank back down quickly. \u201cAH!\u201d</p><p>She did it again, harder this time. It was the most amazing thing I\u2019d ever felt. It was hotter inside than before, and softer. . . .</p><p>SHIT!</p><p>I wasn\u2019t wearing a condom. Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>I grabbed her waist as she started getting her rhythm and stopped her.</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d she begged, sinking back down on me. \u201cYes, oh God, Preston.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me. How was I going to stop this?</p><p>She lifted her hips and sank back down on me hard, then cried out again. She was so close. If I wasn\u2019t positive I\u2019d shoot off like a damn cannon when she came, I\u2019d let her finish first.</p><p>\u201cManda, I gotta put on a condom.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop like I\u2019d expected. She lifted her hips faster and rocked back and forth this time while making sexy little moans that were gonna push me over the edge.</p><p>\u201cManda, a condom, baby. I forgot a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay. I\u2019m on the pill,\u201d she said before pressing down harder and rocking her hips back and forth.</p><p>Why the fuck was she on the pill?</p><p>\u201cPreston, AH! Preston,\u201d she cried out, grabbing my shoulder and leaning forward as she began trembling in my lap.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hold back. I wrapped both my arms around her and buried my head in her shoulder as I shot off my release inside her.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to move. Ever. Preston was inside me. I was completely satisfied, and his mouth was nibbling at my neck. No wonder girls in high school liked sex so much. Nothing I\u2019d ever done under the covers in my bed felt like this.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you on the pill?\u201d Preston asked against my neck.</p><p>Smiling, I arched my neck a little more so he could cover more skin.</p><p>\u201cIrregular, really bad periods. I\u2019ve been on the pill since I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never thought the fact that I took that little pill every day would come in so handy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had sex without a condom before,\u201d he said, tilting his head back to look at me. \u201cBeing inside you with nothing between us was the best experience of my life.\u201d</p><p>My body felt warm all over. Knowing he\u2019d enjoyed it as much as I had made it even better.</p><p>Preston leaned forward and kissed me. \u201cIt isn\u2019t safe though. As good as that felt we can\u2019t do that again. We need to protect you.. I have protection. Can we do this again?\"</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a very good boy,\u201d I teased.</p><p>His hands slipped down my back until they were caressing my bottom. \u201cI can be real good. So damn good you\u2019ll want to strip for me all the time.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, I shifted my hips and felt him still semi-hard inside me. Oh.</p><p>\u201cManda, if you don\u2019t get off me, we are gonna have to have a round two real soon.\u201d</p><p>I wiggled a little more on his lap, and this time he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me. Death by sex with the hottest woman on the planet. That\u2019s one helluva way to go.\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door startled me, and Preston tensed underneath me. I looked from the door to him, and he lifted me off his lap. Then handed me a towel. \u201cGo on in the bathroom and take a shower.\u201d</p><p>I was worried it could be Marcus. I didn\u2019t want him hurting Preston any more. I wrapped the towel around me and stood there.</p><p>Preston pointed to the bathroom, and I shook my head. \u201cIt could be Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Preston laughed. \u201cWell, you standing there like that ain\u2019t gonna help matters if it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer the door naked,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>He looked down at himself and smirked. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Then he headed for the bedroom. Another knock and a \u201cI know you\u2019re in there. Open the damn door\u201d told us it was Dewayne.</p><p>Preston came walking out of the bedroom in a pair of sweats and pointed to the bathroom. \u201cIt\u2019s Dewayne, and we both know he ain\u2019t here to kick my ass. Go take a shower, and don\u2019t come out in a towel.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind me.</p><p>Pressing my ear to the door, I listened to see what Dewayne wanted before I turned the water on. He could be here to warn us Marcus was on the way.</p><p>\u201cShe in here?\u201d Dewayne asked.</p><p>\u201cWord travels fast.\u201d</p><p>Dewayne let out a bark of laughter. \u201cHell yeah, it does. You messing around with Marcus\u2019s sister, that\u2019s screwed up. Even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, D. What do you want, other than to see if Amanda is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you know, the usual. You got Marcus ready to pound in anyone\u2019s head who looks at him the wrong way. Rock and I have to keep him from getting thrown in jail. So I need to know, are you just fucking her, or is this more than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Amanda, D. Don\u2019t say that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cSo Rock was right. For you to mess around with Manda, it has to be for a bigger reason. She got to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been attracted to her for a couple of years now, but she was too young. She\u2019s not anymore, and I . . . It\u2019s different with her. Everything is different.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him admit that it was different with me eased the worry that he might never love me. Just to know he felt something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it was your business, but since we were kids if something goes wrong with one of us, then it is everyone\u2019s business. Just be careful. I know shit you probably don\u2019t know I know. It ain\u2019t the kind of thing relationships are built on. And Manda ain\u2019t the kind of girl you just use for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Don\u2019t you think I fucking know that?\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence, and then the front door opened and closed. I stepped back and took a deep breath.</p><p>The bathroom door swung open, and Preston walked inside with a wicked grin on his face. \u201cSince you waited on me while you listened in on that conversation, I think I\u2019ll help get you clean and you can show off those singing abilities of yours in the shower. I\u2019ve been waiting all damn day to hear them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Preston</p><p>Letting Amanda go home was hard. I wanted to keep her here. Every time she walked out my door, I worried that she wouldn\u2019t come back. That she\u2019d find out the truth about me. Tonight was family dinner at her house. She said her brother had told her that he didn\u2019t want her to tell their mom. She wasn\u2019t emotionally stable enough to deal with it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect her mother to accept me. She knew I was from the wrong side of town. She knew I\u2019d gotten in trouble all through high school and Marcus had helped bail me out. I was Marcus\u2019s charity case in her eyes. I\u2019d never be good enough for her daughter.</p> <p>My phone vibrated in my pocket, reminding me of my appointment. Every time I had to go work, I loathed it more. I\u2019d started looking in the paper every day for a job that could pay me enough to take care of the kids and fit into my schedule with classes and baseball season when it started up. So far there was nothing. I wasn\u2019t qualified for anything. But I wasn\u2019t giving up. I had to find a way out of this. I wanted to be worthy of Amanda, and I knew I never would be as long as I continued doing what I was doing.</p><p>I reached over and picked up my keys. I had to go do this. If I wanted to keep my scholarship and feed the kids, I had to do this.</p><p>I walked up the back steps to the three-story brick house that belonged to our illustrious mayor. He was shagging his secretary and his wife was paying me for the same service. She had been for over a year now.</p><p>I had to park half a mile down the road and walk up from the back of the house and use the back door. She\u2019d leave it unlocked.</p><p>Opening the door, I went inside and headed for the stairs. Sometimes she waited on me in some ridiculous piece of lingerie, and sometimes she was just upstairs in bed naked, drinking wine. Depended on her mood.</p> <p>I reached the first step and heard voices. That couldn\u2019t be good. She was always alone when she called me. I froze and listened. It was another woman. I recognized the voice, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on who it was. Surely she hadn\u2019t invited over another one of my clients for a threesome. I charged extra for that, and right now I wasn\u2019t sure I could pull it off. Getting up for just her was going to be hard enough. I was having to close my eyes and pretend lately. It was the only thing that worked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the committee meeting next week, then. Thank you, Janice, for offering to help. Having your name behind it will always drive more volunteers.\u201d Janice was the mayor\u2019s wife. This was an impromptu visit she was dealing with, and they were coming around the corner. Shit.</p><p>I\u2019d started to make a run for it when Mrs. Hardy turned the corner and our eyes met. Fucking hell.</p><p>Janice\u2019s eyes found me, and they went wide with surprise. She hadn\u2019t been expecting us to get caught either.</p><p>I stood there unable to move from this train wreck. How did I explain this? I didn\u2019t need this woman to know what I did. I was going to find another job, and when I did, I was going to make myself worthy of Amanda. Her mother knowing this dirty secret of mine would ruin everything. She\u2019d tell Amanda. If she ever found out about Amanda and me, she\u2019d tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Preston. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. The uh, toilet that is broken is upstairs to the left. It just keeps running over.\u201d Janice\u2019s forced smile and high-pitched voice weren\u2019t very convincing. \u201cRun along now and get it fixed.\u201d She waved her hand and smiled back at Amanda\u2019s mom.</p> <p>Mrs. Hardy\u2019s eyes were still locked on mine. She was connecting the dots, dammit.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I thought you mentioned that your washing machine was broken too.\u201d I was a hell of a lot more convincing.</p><p>She nodded nervously. \u201cYes, yes it is. But go on and get that toilet fixed.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and headed up the stairs, praying Mrs. Hardy believed this bullshit.</p><p>\u201cSweet kid. He can fix anything,\u201d Janice said in the same nervous, high-pitched tone.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Mrs. Hardy asked. The tone of her voice made my stomach knot up. She knew.</p><p>Fuck it all to hell. She knew.</p><p>Amanda</p> <p>Preston had gone to work out again today. He got a call from his coach and had to leave unexpectedly. I\u2019d been on my way over here. We were going to go down to the beach. We only had a few weeks of heat left before the fall air started making it impossible to enjoy the beach.</p><p>I scrolled through my text messages to kill time, and I saw Jason\u2019s unanswered one. It had been two weeks since he\u2019d sent it. He hadn\u2019t sent another one. I\u2019d been so wrapped up in Preston I\u2019d forgotten about it.</p><p>Me: I am so sorry I haven\u2019t responded. With school starting back up and everything, I\u2019ve been busy.</p><p>I might need to call him. Two weeks was beyond rude. Jason\u2019s response popped up on the screen.</p><p>Jason: That\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve talked to Sadie. I know you are seeing someone. Lucky guy.</p><p>Sadie hadn\u2019t mentioned Jason when we\u2019d talked the other day. She was happy for me, but she\u2019d sounded worried too.</p><p>Me: Yeah. That too. I should have responded, though. I\u2019m really sorry.</p><p>Jason: Don\u2019t worry about it. Just promise me if things don\u2019t work out that you will give me a call. Keep this number.</p><p>He was really sweet. If things didn\u2019t work out, I\u2019d be crushed. There would be no calling someone else.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll remember that. Thank you again for the offer. Flying to NYC for dinner would be amazing.</p><p>Jason: Offer stands. Just say the word.</p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and Preston walked in with a scowl on his face. He\u2019d only been gone an hour and a half. He wasn\u2019t very sweaty, either.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, laying my phone down to get up and go to him.</p><p>He held up his hands to hold me off. \u201cI\u2019m nasty. Let me get a shower first.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything else. He just stalked to the bathroom and closed the door. Loudly.</p><p>Was he mad that I was still here?</p><p>My phone played the text song, and I reached down to get it.</p><p>Jason: I got an invitation to your brother\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Willow must have sent it when she\u2019d thought there was something going on between us.</p><p>Me: Are you going to come?</p><p>Please, God, no. Preston wouldn\u2019t be nice to him. I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to him if I wanted to keep Preston calm.</p><p>Jason: I want to.</p><p>What did I say to that? I couldn\u2019t be rude. Sadie and Jax were coming.</p><p>The bathroom door swung open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was in such a bad mood when I got back,\u201d Preston said, walking out of the bathroom.</p><p>I looked up from my phone. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I was worried you wanted me to leave. I can if you have things to do.\u201d</p><p>Preston frowned and closed the distance between us. \u201cGod, no. I want you with me. I just had a bad afternoon. I hated having to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t gone that long. We have plenty of time to spend on the beach before the sun goes down.\u201d</p><p>Preston bent down and kissed me.</p><p>My text alert went off.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>Preston pulled back and looked down at my phone.</p><p>Jason: You didn\u2019t tell me no. I\u2019m taking that as your approval.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move. Preston had read it. Trashing it now wouldn\u2019t change that. I wasn\u2019t even sure if this was going to be a big deal. So I waited for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cJason? Jason Stone?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. The angry snarl in his voice told me this would be a very big deal.</p><p>He took the phone out of my hands, and I let him. I hadn\u2019t said anything wrong.</p><p>He scrolled up and read through our texts. When he got back to the last one, he lifted his eyes to meet mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want, Manda? Private jet rides to NYC?\u201d He threw my phone onto the table and stormed into his room. I jumped when his door slammed behind him.</p><p>My eyes filled with tears. He hadn\u2019t even let me explain. He\u2019d just stormed off. I hadn\u2019t said that was what I wanted. I was being polite.</p><p>The door opened, and I backed up, not sure if I should leave or if I should plead my case. I wasn\u2019t used to having a man mad at me. It was scary. My dad had never yelled at me, and until the night Marcus found out about Preston and me, neither had Marcus. My heart was racing in my chest, and I felt like I was going to throw up.</p><p>Preston pointed at my phone. \u201cYou talk to him often? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo-o-o,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>\u201cSure as hell sounds like it. He\u2019s got money. Your brother sure as hell approves if he\u2019s sending him a wedding invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the invitation until just now.\u201d</p><p>Preston let out a hard, angry laugh. \u201cYou knew about the jet ride to New York City, though, didn\u2019t you? Looks like you were the one texting him today too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had forgotten to text him back the last time he texted me. I was trying to be polite. He\u2019s Jax\u2019s brother,\u201d I explained.</p><p>Preston turned around and slammed his fist into the wall. \u201cFuck that, Manda. You texted him. You wanted to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>A tear trickled down my face, and I couldn\u2019t think of the right thing to say to make him understand. He was so angry. For the first time ever, I wanted to leave his apartment. I wanted to go somewhere alone and cry.</p><p>I walked over and got my phone off the couch, then picked up my beach bag and headed for the door. I didn\u2019t look back at him. I couldn\u2019t or I\u2019d break down crying right now.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him to see me cry. I wanted to be mad at him and yell at him and tell him how stupid he was being, but the lump in my throat was stopping me.</p><p>I hurried out the door and down the steps. When my foot hit the bottom step, I burst into tears. I hadn\u2019t been able to make it to my car. Wiping at my face, I slipped on my sunglasses, which had been on top of my head, and started out toward my car.</p><p>The sound of heavy steps running down the stairs startled me, and I turned around to see Preston running after me.</p><p>\u201cManda, wait. I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>A smart person would\u2019ve kept walking. I wasn\u2019t a smart person.</p><p>Preston\u2019s panicked face as he begged me not to leave was more powerful than common sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an asshole. God, baby. I\u2019m so sorry. I was upset when I came in, and then I saw the text and it set me off. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m jealous as hell. You\u2019re mine, and he\u2019s after you. He has money and your family\u2019s approval. Two things I don\u2019t have. I want to be able to fly you to New York City on a damn jet, and anywhere else you want to go, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That was the only explanation I needed. I understood. I took the few steps separating us, and I grabbed his face and kissed him fiercely on the mouth. I was possessive with it. I wanted him to understand that all I wanted was him. Not a ride in a jet and a fancy dinner. He moaned and ran his hands through my hair and pulled me closer to him. I controlled the kiss. I bit his lip and pulled his tongue into my mouth, and I sucked hard before plunging back into the warmth of his. When I finally broke the kiss, we were both breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cDay-um,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo one compares to you. No one. Get that through your head,\u201d I told him, and slipped my hand up his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t need jets and fancy locations. I just need you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Preston</p><p>Amanda had fallen asleep on her stomach. After we\u2019d played around in the water until we were both very satisfied, we\u2019d come back up to lay out on the towels she\u2019d brought with us. I\u2019d coated her back with sunscreen, and she\u2019d dozed off while I was rubbing it in.</p><p>I\u2019d lain here and watched her sleep for the past thirty minutes. I\u2019d also fought the urge to throw a towel over her ass. Every time I felt eyes directed this way, I made sure to stare them down until they looked away.</p> <p>After having to leave her to go work, I\u2019d come back pissed off. I was still looking for a job that could pay me what I needed. I was even looking into working night shifts somewhere. Anything to get me out of this hell I was in.</p><p>Seeing the text from Jason Stone had been all I\u2019d needed to push home the fact that Amanda deserved more than what she was getting. I couldn\u2019t even tell her I loved her. She hadn\u2019t said those three words to me again. That one time she\u2019d told her brother, and that was it.</p><p>I knew she was waiting on me to say them, but how could I? Did I want her? Yes. Did I need her to breathe? Yes. Could I imagine life without her? No. But could I be in love with her, truly in love with her, and deceive her at the same time? I wasn\u2019t sure. Love was honest. It was pure. I was neither of those things. So how could I love?</p><p>Her eyelashes fluttered, and opened slowly. Sleeping beauty was waking up. My chest hurt just looking at her. She was amazing. Everything about her.</p><p>\u201cAre you watching me sleep?\u201d she asked, smiling up at me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating,\u201d I replied.</p><p>She buried her face into the towel, but I could see the pleased grin on her face. She never asked for affirmation, but she needed it. That surprised me. I\u2019d have thought she\u2019d had enough of it growing up and didn\u2019t need it, but now I wondered if she had gone without it. She had a dad who worked all the time and mother who was on every committee in town. Had she been the rich little girl in the big house with no one around but her brother to tell her that she was beautiful, that she was smart, that she deserved more than a sorry-ass loser like me?</p><p>She sat up and stretched. Almost every golden inch of her body was on display.</p><p>\u201cI have another family dinner tonight. So I\u2019m going to have to head home soon,\u201d she said with a frown on her face.</p><p>She had family dinner every week. Since her dad had left them, she never missed it. I could tell it was important to her mother and she didn\u2019t want her mother upset.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stay home and do homework and wait on you to crawl into bed and send me a naughty text message.\u201d</p> <p>She giggled and pulled her hair up into a knot on her head. I loved watching her do little things like that. I could sit and watch her all damn day and never get bored.</p><p>\u201cNaughty text message, huh? I thought that was called sexting,\u201d she replied.</p><p>I reached over, grabbed her arm, and pulled her on top of me. \u201cOh yeah, we can sext all you want to. You can tell me all the things you want me to do to you, and I\u2019ll tell you just how I\u2019m gonna do it,\u201d I whispered in her ear, then took a nibble.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, okay. I like that idea,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Smiling, I slipped my knee up between her legs. \u201cYou just have to promise to play with that pretty little pussy for me.\u201d</p><p>Amanda gasped and slapped at my arm. \u201cYou are so bad, Preston Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with you, baby. Only with you.\u201d</p><p>Her phone started playing that country song about cowboys and angels. It was her ringtone. She needed a new one. I was beginning to get jealous of any guy in a cowboy hat.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Willow,\u201d she said, looking over at me. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about us. Marcus isn\u2019t telling her because he\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll make him tell Mom, and he wants to wait and tell Mom after the wedding. No more added drama and all.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019d assumed he\u2019d never tell their mother. Or at least I\u2019d hoped by the time he did I\u2019d have another job and I\u2019d be able to deny it. Mrs. Hardy didn\u2019t really have any proof. As far as she was told, I was there to do the plumbing. I had to find another job. Before this damn wedding.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, pressing the phone to her ear. \u201cYep. I\u2019ll be there. Did you bring the dress home? . . . Yay! Now let\u2019s hope it fits. I feel like I\u2019ve gained five pounds lately. . . . If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll go on a diet. Promise. . . . See ya in a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Amanda clicked her phone off and smiled before crawling off me and standing up. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get home and take a shower before dinner. Low is bringing my bridesmaid dress over.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want her to leave me, but I also needed to spend some time finding a job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting on my sext.\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Mom had been acting weird all night. She was normally very happy on family dinner night. She adored Willow and getting to assist in planning the wedding\u2014which was now on the beach instead of the church where Mom had wanted it\u2014 something she looked forward to when we were all together.</p><p>She\u2019d said very little about my dress, which fit perfectly, much to my relief. While we\u2019d all discussed the wedding cake colors and if the groom\u2019s cake should be cheesecake or chocolate cake, Mom had stared out the window.</p><p>When the door closed behind Marcus and Willow, I turned to go up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and looked back at Mom. She was standing at the bottom of the stairs with her arms crossed, staring up at me. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, walking back down the steps and following her as she made her way into the living room.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Amanda.\u201d</p><p>I was suddenly very nervous. The serious tone of her voice wasn\u2019t something I was used to hearing. I couldn\u2019t figure out what in the world this could be about. Unless . . . she knew about Preston. That could be bad, but at least we were about to clear the air and I wouldn\u2019t have to hide it from her anymore. Besides, I was positive once she got to know him she\u2019d like him. She\u2019d just never really spent any time with him.</p><p>\u201cI received an interesting call today from a friend of mine. It was someone who saw you today. On the beach.\u201d</p><p>It was about Preston.</p><p>\u201cSo you know who I was with, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPreston Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Mom. I know you don\u2019t approve of him. But all you know about him is that his mother is low class and he grew up rough. He has gotten into some trouble growing up, but he\u2019s different now. If you\u2019d just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sleeps with women for money. He\u2019s a gigolo, Amanda. A very well-paid one.\u201d</p><p>I busted into a fit of laughter. Where in the world had she heard that? It was ridiculous. How had she come up with something this insane?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, Amanda. I saw him.\u201d</p><p>She saw him? What the heck did that mean? How did she see him?</p><p>\u201cMom, whatever it is you think you saw, you didn\u2019t. Preston doesn\u2019t sleep with women for money.\u201d</p><p>Mom walked over to the chair across from me. \u201cI went to visit Janice. She had volunteered to do some work on the Sea Festival committee. She hadn\u2019t been expecting me, and I noticed she seemed a little nervous. We talked over everything for about thirty minutes. When we stood up to leave and walked to the door, Preston Drake was sneaking up her staircase. He stopped and looked at me like a deer caught in the headlights. Janice got all flustered and made up something about Preston coming to fix her toilet. That boy was not there to fix her plumbing.\u201d</p><p>There had to be a better explanation. He wasn\u2019t going up to the mayor\u2019s bedroom to sleep with his wife for money. This was Sea Breeze, Alabama. Not Los Angeles. What had gotten into my mom?</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me you think Preston was there to service Janice? That\u2019s crazy, Mom. It is very likely he was there to help her fix her toilet. He does odd jobs sometimes.\u201d</p><p>My mother let out a weary sigh, and her face pinched into a frown. \u201cI stood outside long after she closed the door, and I watched the window in her bedroom. Preston Drake was in there. He closed the curtain, and soon Janice\u2019s shadow joined him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a shadow, Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Blanche about this the next day. I figured if anyone knew, she would. Blanche pays Preston for sex. She has been since she and Ken divorced. Apparently, he has a small, discreet client list among the wealthy women in this town. Preston is a high-priced gigolo who services attractive older women. He doesn\u2019t do odd jobs, Amanda.\u201d</p><p>I was dreaming. I had to be dreaming. This was a nightmare, and I was about to wake up. I shook my head and stood up. I couldn\u2019t sit here and listen to this. I didn\u2019t believe it. Preston was too good. He would never lie to me about something this big.</p><p>\u201cI was worried you wouldn\u2019t believe me. You fell for those pretty-boy looks of his. Why don\u2019t you ask him? See what he says. Watch his reaction. Then you come back and tell me this is a lie.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my keys off the hook beside the door and ran outside. Preston could explain this. Because this couldn\u2019t be true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Preston</p><p>I\u2019d been watching my phone for the past hour, waiting on Amanda to text me. After once again searching the job listings online, I\u2019d come up empty handed. If I had taken welding in school, I\u2019d have a job, that was for damn sure. If I didn\u2019t need money right now, I\u2019d go to school for welding. That way I could work hours that fit into my schedule and make more than enough money to cover our needs.</p><p>A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts, and I put my phone down and grabbed a pair of discarded sweats. I jerked them on quickly and went to the door. It was after eleven. Who the hell was coming to see me so late?</p> <p>When I opened it, Amanda walked inside, pushing past me.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you a question. It is going to sound ludicrous, but I need you to listen to me, and then you can explain how very wrong my mother is.\u201d</p><p>Her mother. No. God, no. I couldn\u2019t say anything. My voice left me. This was not happening. Not now. I hadn\u2019t had enough time to fix it.</p><p>\u201cPreston, you\u2019ve gone pale.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at her. She knew. She didn\u2019t believe it, but she knew.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me. Preston, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I needed her to say it. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you?\u201d</p><p>I was going to lie. I needed a lie to get out of this. I couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>\u201cShe said . . .\u201d Amanda let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m about to say this out loud.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it. I could convince her it wasn\u2019t true. I could tell her something else. The women I worked for wouldn\u2019t want the truth out. They\u2019d never back up her mother\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d I urged, finally making eye contact with her.</p> <p>She ran her hand through her hair and looked over at the couch. \u201cYou want to sit down? It\u2019s kind of unbelievable, and it may take awhile to explain.\u201d</p><p>Getting her farther away from the exit for her to go running out of was a good idea. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I followed her over to the couch and sat down in the chair across from her. I wasn\u2019t sure how this was going to play out, and sitting too close to her might be a bad idea. I also wanted to see her face.</p><p>\u201cMy mom found out that you and I are seeing each other. Apparently, someone saw us at the beach today. She was upset, which I\u2019d expected. But why she was upset was not at all something I\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>She twirled a strand of hair around her finger nervously. \u201cMom saw you at the mayor\u2019s house. Going upstairs . . .\u201d She trailed off. She wanted me to say something. What could I say? There was no denying I\u2019d been there. This was my chance to lie. To cover this mess up. But my mouth wouldn\u2019t open. I couldn\u2019t come up with one thing to say to ease her mind.</p><p>\u201cShe said you were sneaking upstairs and that Janice was really nervous. Then after she left, she saw you through the bedroom window closing the curtains, and then she saw Janice\u2019s shadow join you.\u201d</p><p>Again, it was my chance to lie to her. But I couldn\u2019t. The lies wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cPreston, say something.\u201d</p> <p>I realized, sitting there looking at her, that I loved her. I\u2019d been right. When you love someone, you can\u2019t lie to them. It hurts too much. It\u2019s a deception that goes too deep.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing her,\u201d I finally replied.</p><p>Amanda raised her eyebrows. \u201cAnd? Were you in Janice\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>The truth was going to rip my heart out, but it was what she deserved. What she\u2019d always deserved.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was.\u201d</p><p>Amanda didn\u2019t say anything. She just sat there staring at me in shock. I knew she was waiting on some reason as to why I was in Janice\u2019s bedroom other than what her mother had told her. I wished like hell I had a reason other than the truth.</p><p>\u201cMy mom said Blanche Turner told her that she pays you to sleep with her. That many women do. Tell me that isn\u2019t true, Preston. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d do something like that.\u201d</p><p>I stood up because sitting down was impossible. This was the moment I\u2019d feared since I\u2019d let Amanda in. \u201cI have classes and baseball, and three other mouths to feed, and a whole other house\u2019s bills to pay. Three kids aren\u2019t cheap. I have to make sure they\u2019re fed and still keep my scholarship, which means I don\u2019t miss baseball and I don\u2019t fail classes. It\u2019s more responsibility than most adults have, Manda.\u201d</p><p>Amanda stood up. \u201cAre you telling me this is true? All this time, you\u2019ve been leaving me to go screw other women for money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey mean nothing to me. They know it. There is no emotion. Just sex. It\u2019s more money than I could make doing anything else. It keeps the kids taken care of, and I don\u2019t have to worry about how I\u2019m going to keep their electricity on or how I\u2019m going to pay for braces or for new tires for my mom.\u201d</p><p>Amanda shook her head. The disbelief in her eyes sliced through me. \u201cYou never thought to tell me about this? How long have you been doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years? So you just started dating me and let me promise to be exclusive and that I wouldn\u2019t be with anyone else, while you left me regularly to screw other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It was just sex. I felt nothing for them. Ever. They were a job. That\u2019s all they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone, Manda. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. I tried to push you away. I tried to tell you I wasn\u2019t good for you, but you wouldn\u2019t stop. You kept getting close, and I wanted you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me fall in love with you,\u201d Amanda said as a sob escaped her.</p><p>And I\u2019d fallen in love with her. I couldn\u2019t tell her that now. Not like this. She\u2019d think I was saying it to keep her. I didn\u2019t want her to ever doubt it. If I told her now, she\u2019d never believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for another job. I\u2019m trying to find something else to do. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I want to be worthy of you. Of your love. I just need some more time.\u201d</p><p>Amanda covered her mouth as another sob broke free. She shook her head. \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t work like that. You should have told me. You made a fool out of me. I thought what we had was special to you. I knew you didn\u2019t love me, but I thought you cared for me. But all this time, you were leaving me to go have sex with other women. I don\u2019t care that they paid you. It\u2019s that you did it. That you could do it. I could never have let another guy touch my body. Not when I was with you. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stomach it.\u201d She wiped at the tears streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cI had to have the money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Preston. That isn\u2019t a good enough excuse for me. You should have told me in the beginning. Before I fell foolishly in love with you. You should never have asked me to be exclusive and led me to believe you were doing the same thing.\u201d She turned and headed for the door. This was it.</p><p>No!</p><p>I ran after her and wrapped my arms around her from behind. It was time to beg. \u201cI swear to you that I will find another way to make money. I never cared about any of them. Just you, Manda. It\u2019s always just been you. Don\u2019t walk out of here. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>She was stiff in my arms. \u201cWhen you chose to sleep with other women and lie to me about it, then you decided that you could lose me. You knew all along that if I ever found out I\u2019d be gone, but you did it anyway. Let me go, Preston.\u201d</p><p>I deserved this. Every moment of agony and pain that followed, I deserved it. Letting my arms fall away, I watched helplessly as Amanda opened the door and walked out without a backward glance.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be back. This was it for us. Just as I\u2019d realized that I couldn\u2019t keep lying to her because I was in love with her, she\u2019d realized that you can\u2019t love a lie.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>When I opened the door to my house, my mother was standing there waiting on me. Any anger I\u2019d felt was gone. It was replaced by a cold, numbing pain.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever see him again, if you agree to never tell Marcus about any of this. I don\u2019t want him to know. If you tell Marcus, I will go back to Preston Drake. You won\u2019t be able to stop me. But I can promise you I\u2019ll never speak to him again if you promise me you\u2019ll never breathe a word of this to anyone. Especially my brother. He doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>Mom frowned. \u201cDoes he know about you and Preston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He knows.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like that. \u201cWhat am I supposed to say to him if he asks about your breakup?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cTell him I changed my mind and realized Preston wasn\u2019t good enough for me after all. Or tell him I\u2019m seeing Jason Stone now. Just don\u2019t tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Might as well lie about how it all ended. The entire relationship was one big fat lie. It seemed fitting. I walked past my mom and up the stairs. I wouldn\u2019t get much sleep tonight, but I wanted to be alone. My broken heart needed privacy to grieve. Hearts don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve been lied to. They still love anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Preston</p><p>Rock was leaning up against my Jeep when I walked out of the gym. His arms were crossed over his chest, and he was wearing black aviators. I hadn\u2019t seen him in over a week. Other than going to classes, to the gym, and to my mom\u2019s to check on the kids, I hadn\u2019t seen anyone. I hadn\u2019t worked and I was almost out of money, but I\u2019d never be able to go back to what I\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cYou hunting me down?\u201d I asked, throwing my gym bag into the back of the Jeep.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing as how you\u2019re hiding out, I had to come find you.\u201d</p><p>I jerked open the door. \u201cWell, you found me.\u201d</p><p>Rock opened the passenger-side door and sat down. He wasn\u2019t about to let me drive off. What did he know? I had been expecting Marcus to barge into my apartment and beat the shit out of me all week. But other than a text from him saying my tux fitting was next Thursday, that was all I\u2019d heard from him.</p><p>\u201cHeard Manda broke it off with you,\u201d he said, studying me to see my reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou heard right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t believe the reason why. Doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Marcus believes it, and it\u2019s probably good he does, but I\u2019m not buying it.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what the reason she\u2019d given Marcus was. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t the truth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help what you believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems to me that the guy I saw so fiercely determined to take a stand against his best friend over a girl wouldn\u2019t just stand by so casually while she up and moves on to another guy.\u201d</p><p>I gripped the steering wheel tightly. That hadn\u2019t been what I was expecting. Manda was seeing someone else already? That didn\u2019t sound like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expect you to go hunt down Jason Stone and beat the shit out of him like you wanted to do to Marcus. I\u2019m finding it real hard to believe you\u2019re okay to just let him have her without a fight.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Stone? Fuck.</p><p>\u201cGuess she wanted things I couldn\u2019t give her,\u201d I clipped out, and cranked the Jeep. I didn\u2019t want to listen to any more of this.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe that ain\u2019t what is really going on. Maybe she found out about your job, and she couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>How did he know?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Rock shrugged. \u201cYou know, the job that allowed you to take care of your brothers and sister and pay your bills too. The one you kept a secret. The one I had to do some serious badass detective work to figure out.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d followed me. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell this to Marcus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcus ain\u2019t my only friend. I don\u2019t got favorites.\u201d</p><p>I let my head fall back on the headrest and sighed. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the Friday after the engagement party. I was sure you were dealing drugs, and I was tailing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew before I started dating Manda?\u201d</p><p>Rock nodded. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Then why the hell did you let me get away with it? I couldn\u2019t stay away from her. Someone needed to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was pretty damn sure you were in love with her. I\u2019d never seen you in love. And Manda is a sweet girl. I figured if anyone could make you walk the straight and narrow, she could. But you never stopped working. I couldn\u2019t figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have mouths to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other jobs out there that don\u2019t require illegal activity.\u201d</p><p>I let out a hard laugh. \u201cNothing pays me enough. The ones that do I\u2019m not qualified for.\u201d</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019re looking in the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him. \u201cWhere do you suggest I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking in the right place now.\u201d He smirked. \u201cDrive to Pensacola. I got a guy I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Pensacola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He owns a club. I used to work for him. Bouncers get paid real well. Late hours and good money.\u201d</p><p>A bouncer?</p><p>\u201cHow good is the money?\u201d</p><p>Rock closed his door and buckled his seat belt. \u201cThe nicer the club, the better the pay. The place I\u2019m taking you to pays more than most at fifty dollars an hour, and you\u2019ll get six hours a night. As many nights as you can handle.\u201d</p><p>Three hundred dollars a night. I could work Thursday through Sunday nights and make twelve hundred dollars a week.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can get me this job?\u201d</p><p>Rock laughed. \u201cI already got you the job. I\u2019m just taking you to meet your new boss and get your paperwork done. You start this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>After two weeks of dreading calculus because I\u2019d have to see Preston, and then arriving and him not being there, I had come to the conclusion that he\u2019d dropped the class. This was a good thing. I didn\u2019t want to see him. I wasn\u2019t sure yet how I\u2019d react to seeing him.</p><p>My phone started playing my ringtone, and I reached into my backpack and pulled it out as I walked across campus to the coffee shop. I needed caffeine if I was going to make it through the study group I was headed to next.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Jason\u2019s voice greeted me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, too,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYou sound better this week.\u201d</p><p>Jason had made the mistake of calling me the day after my breakup with Preston. When he\u2019d asked me how I was doing, I\u2019d starting sobbing and telling him about my breakup. Of course I left out the actual reason why we broke up. Preston didn\u2019t deserve my protection, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I loved him. He\u2019d shattered my heart, but I still loved him.</p><p>\u201cI think it works that way. Each week you get a little better. Maybe by next month I\u2019ll be out dancing in clubs.\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled. \u201cYeah. Well, let\u2019s not get carried away. Clubs aren\u2019t real safe for a single girl. I, of course, could escort you.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t led Jason on at all. I\u2019d been painfully honest with him. I was still in love with Preston. I probably always would be. But if Jason wanted to be friends, then I\u2019d like that. I needed friends right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that offer in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s wedding planning coming in the Hardy household? Only two more weeks.\u201d</p><p>The wedding had taken over our lives. There were flowers everywhere, and candles and several different china patterns covering the dining room table. It was insane. Willow was the most laid-back bride I\u2019d ever met. She just smiled and agreed to things. My mother, on the other hand, was a freaking bridezilla, and she was just the mother of the groom.</p><p>\u201cI think I may borrow that jet of yours and fly to the Keys until it\u2019s over. That or kill my mom.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll let you borrow the jet, but I don\u2019t think Jax has enough influence to get you off the hook for murder. Running away sounds like a safer plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I\u2019ll stick with plan A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still planning on kicking your butt on the Go Kart track. After the wedding, the race is on.\u201d</p><p>We had gotten into a conversation about the Go Kart track in town and how I knew which one was the fastest and I couldn\u2019t be beat. He disagreed that he couldn\u2019t beat me. We made plans to go race after the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten. I\u2019m currently in training, Hollywood. You\u2019re out of your league.\u201d</p><p>My phone beeped, and I pulled it back to see Jimmy\u2019s number flashing across the screen. Why would Preston\u2019s little brother be calling me?</p><p>\u201cUm, Jason, I gotta go. I\u2019ve got a call on the other line I need to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Bama. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I replied before clicking over.</p><p>\u201cJimmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, but Momma\u2019s been asleep for a real long time, and we can\u2019t wake her up. I called Preston and he didn\u2019t answer. Jimmy isn\u2019t home yet from school, and I don\u2019t know if I should call 911.\u201d</p><p>I ran back toward the parking lot for my car. \u201cHow long has she been asleep?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSince yesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you at school yesterday and today? Could she have gotten up while you were at school?\u201d</p><p>That had to be it.</p><p>\u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t moved. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Brent. I\u2019m on my way right now. I want you to call 911 when we hang up, and tell them this exact same thing, okay? Then you and Daisy sit together in the living room. I\u2019ll be there in about five minutes. Be waiting on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>How did I tell this little boy his mother was very likely dead? That or in a coma.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that. She could just be sleeping a long time. You call 911. I\u2019m on my way. Is Daisy okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s sitting here beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You keep her right there with you. See you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the line, and I dialed Preston\u2019s number. It rang three times, then went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Preston. You know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston, it\u2019s Amanda. Brent just called me. Your mother hasn\u2019t woken up in two days. They\u2019re worried. I had him call 911, and I\u2019m on my way over there. Call me as soon as you get this.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call and gunned the engine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Preston</p><p>A loud banging sound interrupted my dreams. I tried to block it out. I wasn\u2019t ready for this dream to end. Amanda was laughing and running down the beach while I chased her. She didn\u2019t hate me. She still loved me. The banging was joined with a ringing noise and some yelling. I peeled open my eyes and glanced over at the clock. It was four in the afternoon. I\u2019d slept all day. I hadn\u2019t gotten home from work until almost four this morning. Then I\u2019d been too jacked up on coffee to sleep. It had been almost seven before I crashed. I had to go back to work at eight tonight.</p><p>The banging reminded me of why I was awake. I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the door before whoever was on the other side beat it down.</p> <p>I jerked it open to see Marcus standing on the other side. \u201cShit, man, I was getting ready to break the door down. I\u2019ve been calling you, and then banging on this door for over ten minutes when that didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sleeping. I\u2019m working nights now, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I forgot you worked last night. Listen, I need to tell you something, and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re gonna take it, so you might want to sit down.\u201d</p><p>This was not something you wanted to wake up to. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I demanded. I didn\u2019t need to sit down, I just needed to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mom. She overdosed.\u201d He paused and waited for a reaction from me.</p> <p>\u201cDid it kill her this time?\u201d This wasn\u2019t her first overdose.</p><p>Marcus placed his hand on my shoulder and let out a heavy sigh. \u201cYeah, man. It did.\u201d</p><p>I turned and headed for my room to put on some clothes. The kids would need me. I slipped on some jeans and tried to figure out how I could fit all three kids in here and take care of them when I was working nights. Without my mom\u2019s rent and utilities I\u2019d have a little extra to hire a sitter.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Marcus asked from the doorway of my room.</p><p>\u201cShe was junkie, Marcus. It was bound to happen. I just need to get to the kids. They\u2019re probably scared.\u201d</p><p>The tightness in my chest surprised me. I wouldn\u2019t grieve for this woman. She\u2019d done nothing for me in my life. I swallowed the weak emotion from the little boy deep inside who had wanted his mother to love him. Even a little. I\u2019d figured out long ago she never would. I wouldn\u2019t shed a tear for her now.</p> <p>\u201cThe kids are fine. Amanda has all three of them. They\u2019re getting ice cream, then going to the park. She sent me to find you. There are custody issues you have to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Amanda had the kids? How? Why? No matter how much they liked her, they would have called me first.</p><p>\u201cHow did Amanda know to get the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour younger brother called her. Told her your mom hadn\u2019t woken up in two days, and Amanda left school and rushed over there. She also had him call 911 while he waited on her to arrive. They couldn\u2019t reach you, so they called her.\u201d</p><p>Brent had called Amanda. My chest hurt. All three kids had been upset when I\u2019d had to tell them I wouldn\u2019t be bringing Amanda around anymore. Daisy had even cried. But they\u2019d known they could count on her when they couldn\u2019t get me on the phone. A lump formed in my throat, and I grabbed my keys and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI know she left you for the Stone guy, and I\u2019m sorry about that, man.\u201d</p><p>So that was what she had told him. She\u2019d left me for Jason Stone. Was she even dating him, or had it just been her way to cover up the truth?</p><p>\u201cYou were right. I wasn\u2019t good enough for her. She finally wised up and saw it too.\u201d I opened the door and headed down the stairs. I couldn\u2019t talk about this with Marcus. Not right now.</p> <p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, she still cares about you. She was really upset about this, and she was worried sick over those kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids love her\u201d was the only reply I had.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I stopped and looked back at him. I\u2019d told enough lies. I wasn\u2019t going to keep on telling them just to make everyone feel better. \u201cI\u2019ll always love her. Always.\u201d I jerked open the door to my Jeep and jumped inside. \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDHR is waiting on you at the trailer.\u201d</p><p>I shifted into drive and took off.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have to fight Momma for the kids now. She\u2019d made it easy. I wasn\u2019t exactly the best option as a parent, but anything was better than her. And I didn\u2019t want them separated. I couldn\u2019t let them go. I\u2019d figure this out somehow.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>I held Daisy\u2019s cotton candy ice-cream cone while she ran over to the slide to go down it another time. She alternated between taking a lick of her ice cream and sliding. The ice cream wasn\u2019t going to last too much longer. The sun was getting the best of it.</p><p>\u201cHas Preston called you yet?\u201d Jimmy asked, taking the seat beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo, but my brother did find him, and he is at the trailer talking to the people who determine where you go. He\u2019s an adult and your closest relative, so he should have no problem getting custody,\u201d I assured him. Brent and Daisy were too young to think about the legal issues. But it was bothering Jimmy. He understood the courts had rules.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want us full-time?\u201d Jimmy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never tried to take us from Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she would have fought him on it, and he\u2019d have lost. He was also afraid that he\u2019d draw attention to the situation and they\u2019d take all of you away from him and each other.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy nodded. \u201cYeah, he explained that to me. I\u2019m just worried that they will do it now.\u201d</p><p>. My daddy was buddies with two of the three judges who could possibly hear this case. They played golf every Saturday morning and had since I was a little girl. If I had to go to my daddy and beg and plead with him for their help, I would.</p><p>\u201cI promise you this will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy sighed. \u201cI hope so. You know, Daisy really misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her too. I\u2019ve missed all three of you.\u201d</p><p>Daisy came running back to me with a big grin on her face to take another few licks of her melting ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou better stop and eat it, Daisy, before it just melts away,\u201d Jimmy told her.</p><p>\u201cIt gives me headaches if I eat it too fast,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Jimmy just smiled and kicked at a rock down by his feet.</p><p>\u201cAmanda, is my momma in heaven?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>I looked down at her little face. She was the first one to say anything about her momma\u2019s death. The boys had acted like nothing important had happened. Brent was swinging by himself, and I was giving him his space. But he hadn\u2019t brought up the fact that his mother was dead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about heaven, Daisy. I\u2019d like to think that because she brought such amazing kids into this world, there was someplace nice she got to go once her life was over.\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure the woman was rotting in hell, but I wasn\u2019t about to tell that to her seven-year-old daughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about heaven eithaw. I just been to Sunday school a few times with my next-dowah neighbow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d grown up in church, and I still didn\u2019t know a lot about heaven. \u201cChurch doesn\u2019t have all the answers, Daisy. Sometimes the answer we need is in our heart. We just have to listen to it.\u201d</p><p>Daisy looked down at her chest and frowned, then looked back up at me. \u201cI\u2019ve nevah heawed my hawt befowah.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy chuckled beside me, and I smiled over at him.</p><p>\u201cListen real close, and you\u2019ll finally hear something one day,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She nodded, then spun around and ran back toward the slide.</p><p>Once she was far enough away, Jimmy looked at me. \u201cThanks for not telling her the truth.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears sting my eyes. He was so young to know so much. \u201cI happen to think that was the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy shook his head. \u201cNo, that ain\u2019t the truth. I believe there\u2019s a heaven for the good and a hell for the bad. And we both know my momma wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>How did I argue with him? He knew more about how cruel his mother was than I did. I couldn\u2019t sit here and tell him his mother was in heaven when I knew she wasn\u2019t. He was right. She\u2019d probably split hell wide open.</p><p>\u201cJimmy.\u201d Preston\u2019s voice interrupted my thoughts, and I lifted my eyes to see him walking up to us. His eyes were full of concern as he looked at his brother.</p><p>Jimmy stood up and walked to meet him halfway. Preston pulled him into a tight hug and whispered something in his ear. Jimmy nodded and looked back at me. \u201cThanks, Amanda. For everything,\u201d Jimmy said.</p><p>The lump in my throat was painful. I nodded. I wasn\u2019t sure I could talk. This was the first time I\u2019d seen Preston since I\u2019d walked out of his apartment. Knowing he\u2019d just become the guardian of three kids, that the world was on his shoulders, and how alone he must feel was killing me. Dammit, why did I have to love him so much?</p><p>\u201cPweston!\u201d Daisy came running from the slide when she spotted her big brother. Preston bent down and opened his arms wide, letting her run into them.</p><p>\u201cHey, my Daisy May. You been havin\u2019 fun?\u201d</p><p>Daisy nodded and pointed back at me still holding her ice cream. \u201cAmanda came and took us away from all those people. She got me ice cweam and bwought us hewah to play.\u201d</p><p>Preston didn\u2019t look up at me. He kept his gaze on Daisy. \u201cSounds like she saved the day. You ready to go to my place now?\u201d</p><p>Daisy nodded enthusiastically, then broke free of Preston to run back to me.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around my waist and squeezed me tightly. \u201cThank you for getting us and the ice cweam.\u201d</p><p>I bent down and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come see me?\u201d she asked, pulling away and looking up at me pleadingly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll talk to your brother about that. We\u2019ll have another ice cream date, okay?\u201d</p><p>Daisy beamed at me. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d she called out as she ran back to Preston, who was standing a good distance away from me with his hands tucked in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cGo get Brent, and y\u2019all go on out to the Jeep,\u201d he said to Jimmy, and then he turned to look at me.</p><p>I stood up and walked over to throw away the ice cream and close some of the distance he had left between us.</p><p>\u201cThanks for going after them when they called you today. And sending your brother to wake me up. It means a lot.\u201d The flat tone of his voice was so unlike him. It was as if all emotion was gone. He sounded hollow. I wanted to wrap my arms around him and tell him it would be okay. That I\u2019d help him, that I loved him. But I couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d never loved me. He\u2019d lied to me. As much as I wanted to ease his pain right now, I wasn\u2019t the one to do it.</p><p>\u201cIf they ever need me, all they have to do is call. I\u2019ll help however I can.\u201d</p><p>Preston nodded and looked away from me. Holding my gaze wasn\u2019t something he wanted to do, apparently. I hated that. I missed him so much.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he replied.</p><p>He started to turn to walk away. I didn\u2019t want him to leave yet. I wasn\u2019t done looking at him. Being near him. I wanted to say more. For him to say more. This was just so wrong.</p><p>\u201cWait, Preston,\u201d I called out before I could stop myself.</p><p>He paused, then looked back at me. I had to say something. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I couldn\u2019t tell him I was sorry about his mom, because I knew he wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t tell him I missed him, because what good would that do?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Manda. You made the right choice. You\u2019ve got your dinners in New York and rides in a jet now. It\u2019s what you deserve. And I\u2019ve become the guardian of three kids. I love them. It\u2019ll completely change my world. And it\u2019s what I deserve.\" He didn\u2019t wait for me to process his words. He just walked away. And I let him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Preston</p><p>Trisha had been a lifesaver this past weekend. She had come to the apartment and stayed with the kids while I worked. Rock had even come the last two nights. She\u2019d made cookies for the kids and let them each make their own homemade pizzas. It was like she was having as much fun as they were. And she was refusing to let me pay her for watching them.</p><p>She\u2019d even shown up at six on Monday morning to help me get them ready for school, and she\u2019d brought them all a lunch box packed with food. They had all looked at the lunch boxes like they didn\u2019t know what to do with them. I knew for a fact that they\u2019d been eating free lunches in the lunchroom since day one of kindergarten, and not once had my momma packed them a lunch.</p> <p>Jimmy had looked up at me when Trisha handed him the solid black Igloo lunch box, and smiled. \u201cShe packed me lunch,\u201d he\u2019d said in an awed voice. If I hadn\u2019t been worried about Rock knocking me on my ass, I\u2019d have grabbed her face and kissed her. She had no idea how much her thoughtfulness meant to them.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten them safely on the school bus and was now wide awake. My days of sleeping in were over. By the time I got to my ten o\u2019clock class, I\u2019d be wired on caffeine.</p><p>I\u2019d poured my first cup of coffee when a knock sounded at the door. Who the hell was it now? I set my cup down and walked over to open the door. Trisha stood outside, with Rock behind her. She looked anxious.</p><p>\u201cHey, y\u2019all. Did you forget something?\u201d I asked, stepping back to let them in.</p><p>Trisha came in, followed by Rock, who closed the door behind him.</p> <p>\u201cNo. We want to talk to you about something,\u201d Trisha said, glancing up at Rock.</p><p>\u201cOkay, uh, y\u2019all want some coffee?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Can we sit down?\u201d Trisha asked.</p><p>Typically, I\u2019d be less patient this early in the morning, but after all they\u2019d done for me over the past few days, I\u2019d open a vein and give them a pint of blood if that was what they wanted.</p><p>\u201cSure. Have a seat.\u201d I waved them over to the couch.</p><p>I sat in the chair across from them and took a drink of my coffee while I waited on them to say whatever it was they had come here to say.</p> <p>Trisha took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed that we haven\u2019t been around as much lately. Like at Live Bay, we aren\u2019t there as often and we haven\u2019t been leaving the house much.\u201d</p><p>I had been too wrapped up in my world with Amanda to notice anyone else. I just nodded instead of explaining how unaware I\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWell, Rock and I\u2019ve been trying for over six months to get pregnant. Last month we went to a specialist, and I was told there was a one percent chance that I\u2019d ever conceive. He said we could try different procedures they had, but it would cost thousands of dollars up front.\u201d She paused and looked back at Rock again. He\u2019d wrapped his arm around her shoulders and tucked her up against his side.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if she wanted me to comment on this, or how in the hell this had anything to do with me. So I waited for more.</p><p>\u201cWe checked into adoption, but it also costs thousands of dollars to adopt a baby, and you are put on waiting lists. It isn\u2019t easy, and we don\u2019t have thousands of dollars. We\u2019d have to get a loan, and we might not be approved for a loan even then. It would be unsecured. Anyway, we started talking about adopting an older child. One in the state system who needs a home. I want a little girl.\u201d She teared up as she said the words \u201clittle girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy momma was a lot like yours. She didn\u2019t want to have much to do with me. Then she ran off with one of her boyfriends when I was eight, and I never saw her again. I remember lying in bed at night and pretending that there was a momma out there who wanted me. She was going to come get me one day, and she would love me.\u201d Trisha stopped and reached up to wipe a tear that was rolling down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI saw Daisy, and I wanted her immediately. She was just what I wanted. A little girl I could love and raise as my own. I knew you\u2019d never split the kids up. I understood that. So this weekend I offered to stay with them because I wanted to spend time with them.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and blinked back the tears filling her eyes again.</p> <p>\u201cI want them all. Jimmy and his sweet, caring nature\u2014he reminds me so much of you. And Brent is so funny and charming when he opens up. They don\u2019t expect anything, and that breaks my heart. I want to give them everything. I want to love them and reassure them that they have a home. I begged Rock to come with me Saturday night to stay with them. I wanted him to get to know them. He fell in love.\u201d She sniffed and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cDaisy wrapped him around her little finger in minutes, and he agrees that Jimmy is you made over, so of course he loved him. Then Brent just gets to you. You can\u2019t help it. I know you just lost your mother and things are unsettled for y\u2019all. I don\u2019t want to come into your life and disrupt everything. I just want to know if there is any chance that you would consider letting Rock and me have the kids. We have the room. You\u2019ve seen the new house we\u2019re renting. I\u2019d make them lunches and go on field trips. We\u2019d bake cookies and go cut down our own Christmas tree every year. They\u2019d never be left alone. I\u2019d love them. We both would.\u201d</p><p>When I lifted my eyes from Trisha\u2019s hopeful, tear-streaked face to see the unshed tears in Rock\u2019s eyes, I knew my answer. They wanted to give them what I wouldn\u2019t be able to. I\u2019d be the big brother who wouldn\u2019t remember to pack their lunches. I\u2019d be gone to school and games and work all the time. They\u2019d know I loved them, but they\u2019d be fending for themselves a lot of the time.</p><p>With Rock and Trisha, they\u2019d have parents. The kind of parents I never got to have. The ones who gave them a happy, secure life. This wasn\u2019t an opportunity most kids in their situation were given. There was even a real good chance the judge wouldn\u2019t give the kids to me. He\u2019d take them away and split them up into foster care.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be the luckiest kids I know to have you two as parents,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Trisha let out a sob and covered her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call their social worker, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>Amanda</p><p>It was the last family dinner before the wedding. I\u2019d thought Mom was in such a tizzy planning that she\u2019d cancel it, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she ordered a fancy cake from the bakery in town and lit candles on the table. We were making this last one count, apparently.</p><p>Marcus and Willow walked into the kitchen holding hands. Marcus was whispering in her ear, and she was giggling. They made me want to vomit, they were so sweet. Romance just made me angry these days. I hadn\u2019t heard from Daisy or the boys since the day in the park. I\u2019d hoped Daisy would call me, but I knew they were settling in with Preston and dealing with things.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Mom. You went all out,\u201d Marcus said as he took in the fancy cake and candles that decorated the table.</p><p>\u201cIt is the last family dinner before this family goes from three to four, and I wanted to celebrate the wonderful new changes to come,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>She had left Dad out of that count. She pretended like he didn\u2019t exist. Marcus respected that. To the point that Dad wasn\u2019t even invited to the wedding. Neither was Willow\u2019s sister, Tawny. Only Larissa was coming. She would be the flower girl.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do all this,\u201d Willow told my mother. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working on the wedding nonstop for weeks. But thank you. It means so much.\u201d</p><p>Willow had a way with people. My mom was a tough nut to crack, and she had adored Willow since she\u2019d first met her at a family dinner. I had been charmed by her immediately too, so I understood her effect on people.</p><p>Then again, Willow scored big points just for making Marcus so happy. Anyone who made my brother smile like she did had to be perfect in every way.</p><p>\u201cI want everything to be special for the two of you,\u201d Mom replied, waving us toward the table. \u201cEveryone have a seat. I\u2019ll bring the food to the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, Mom,\u201d Marcus said, pulling Willow\u2019s chair out for her, then turning to follow Mom into the kitchen.</p><p>Willow looked across the table at me. \u201cCan you believe I\u2019m going to be Mrs. Marcus Hardy by this time Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I nodded. \u201cYes, I can. I expected it after I saw my brother with you the first time. He was hooked. It was all over his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the luckiest woman in the world,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The pain in my chest was something I was getting used to. Seeing other couples in love and happy hurt because I wanted that. Not with just anyone, either. I wanted it with a guy who didn\u2019t want it with me in return. Seeing the way my brother looked at Willow, I yearned to be looked at that way. By a guy who had never told me he loved me. Who had lied to me and betrayed me. Yet I still wanted him. Would my heart ever stop wanting him?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You seem down.\u201d The concern in Willow\u2019s voice was obvious.</p><p>I knew Marcus hadn\u2019t told her about Preston and me. She didn\u2019t even know we had dated. I couldn\u2019t exactly tell her that my heart was damaged beyond repair and I was dying inside. She thought I was interested in Jason Stone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll try not to be such a downer.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and started to say something else, when Marcus and Mom walked back into the room carrying the trays of food that had been catered. Mom hadn\u2019t had time to cook this week. She\u2019d been too busy worrying over things like what ribbon to tie on what chair.</p><p>\u201cThis smells amazing,\u201d Marcus said as he set the pan full of fried crab claws and hush puppies down on the table.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d do seafood tonight. Since it\u2019s a beach-themed wedding.\u201d</p><p>That made no sense, but my mother was obsessive, so I ignored it.</p><p>Marcus reached for some food and started putting it on Willow\u2019s plate. He always did things like that for her. He made her breakfast in the morning and brought her coffee. My brother had been raised to be a southern gentleman. My mom had accomplished that and then some.</p><p>\u201cGuess what I found out today,\u201d Marcus said as he started to fix his own plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>Marcus looked over at me. \u201cLooks like Trisha and Rock are gonna adopt Preston\u2019s brothers and sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I couldn\u2019t act like I didn\u2019t care. Because I did.</p><p>Marcus raised his eyebrows and nodded. \u201cYep. Trisha found out awhile back she can\u2019t get pregnant. They wanted to adopt. Then she met the kids, and she and Rock want them. Preston\u2019s already got the ball rolling. The kids\u2019 social worker doesn\u2019t see that this is going to be a problem. The court will find it a perfect solution. Preston wouldn\u2019t have got to keep those kids. He has his job as a bouncer four nights a week, and then he has school and baseball. He has no time to raise kids.\u201d</p><p>Trisha and Rock would be amazing parents. And the kids would still be in town close to Preston. He could get them whenever he wanted. Trisha would love Daisy. She\u2019d be the momma that Daisy deserved.</p><p>Wait . . . Preston\u2019s job as a bouncer at a club? Was this something he\u2019d made up to cover the truth, or had he really found himself a new job?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make wonderful parents. I\u2019m so happy for them and those kids,\u201d I replied, trying to keep the emotion off my face. My mother was watching me. I could feel her eyes studying my every move. I could not let her see any weakness.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Preston is pretty pumped about it. He has been worried about losing the kids because he\u2019s so young. He didn\u2019t want them split up and put in the foster care system. This removes that possibility.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and picked up a crab claw. \u201cWhen did Preston start working as a bouncer?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual about it. I put the crab claw in my mouth and pulled the meat off with my teeth while I waited on Preston to answer. I would not look over at my mother.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks ago. Rock hooked him up with a great gig. He works four nights a week and gets paid some serious jack. He sleeps most of the daylight hours during the weekend, though. It was why no one could get him on his phone the day his mom died.\u201d</p><p>Marcus was being careful too. He could sense the tension coming from Mom. I hadn\u2019t told him that she knew about Preston, but I was pretty sure he was able to figure it out by the major vibes she was putting off.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Well, I\u2019m glad things are working out for him,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Marcus shifted in his seat, and the questions in his eyes as he looked at me were clear. He wanted to know if Mom knew. He also was questioning her involvement in our sudden breakup. I couldn\u2019t have him asking her anything. She\u2019d tell him about Preston. I didn\u2019t want Marcus to know. I needed him to think this was my choice and I\u2019d moved on.</p><p>\u201cSo, change of subject, but Jason is flying in tomorrow. He wanted to come early so we could spend some time together. If you need me for anything, give me advance notice, because I have plans with him too,\u201d I told my mother.</p><p>Mom\u2019s tension eased and she smiled. \u201cOh, that\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need you some, but you can always bring Jason with you. We can find some use for his muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have muscles, Mom. He has people lift everything, from his luggage to his damn fork. The kid hasn\u2019t ever done any type of manual labor.\u201d Marcus sounded annoyed.</p><p>\u201cHe has a gym in his home, where he works out daily. I can assure you he has very nice muscles,\u201d I said sweetly, meeting my brother\u2019s gaze across the table.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, Manda. Then be my guest.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what I wanted. But nothing was about what I wanted. It rarely was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Preston</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had a drink in weeks. But right now I needed at least four straight shots of tequila. All week I\u2019d been worried about tonight. Being the best man in Marcus\u2019s wedding was something I\u2019d always expected. But now that it meant walking down the aisle with the maid of honor, who also happened to be the one girl I was in love with and could never have, it was going to be pure hell.</p><p>I\u2019d been busy all week helping Rock and Trisha get their house ready for inspection. We\u2019d painted the boys\u2019 room blue and bought them bunk beds, along with a television and an Xbox. Then we\u2019d painted Daisy\u2019s room a pale yellow, and Trisha had insisted she have a canopy bed. Daisy called it her princess room. There was a little pink-and-purple table with two chairs sitting in the corner with a tiny little tea set on it. Then there was a dollhouse that had more rooms than any doll could need, with everything from a high chair to working ceiling fans in it.</p> <p>I was exhausted, but I was also positive that the inspection was going to be a success. Now, tonight, instead of working I was here trying like hell not to look over at Amanda. I\u2019d gotten a glimpse of her when she\u2019d walked into the beach house the Hardys were renting for the reception. She was wearing some slinky little pink dress and matching heels that made her legs look even longer. I\u2019d jerked my gaze off her quickly. My intention was to pretend like she wasn\u2019t here. It was the only way I could do this.</p><p>\u201cPreston.\u201d Her soft voice called my name, and I turned around to see she\u2019d walked over to me. Her hair was left down instead of up like the other girls\u2019. It hung in perfect silky golden curls down her back. Her very bare back. There was hardly anything to that dress she was wearing. I tore my eyes off her dress before I caved and checked to see if she was wearing a bra, and I met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cManda,\u201d I replied. Wishing the bar was open already. I needed it for the rehearsal, not after the rehearsal.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Trisha and Rock getting the kids. I wanted to tell you how happy I was for y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. She was going to be all nice and friendly. Did she not understand that she tied me up in knots? I was trying to find a way to live without her. This was going to fuck up everything. I\u2019d made a little progress. It was shot to hell now.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. The kids are real happy about it,\u201d I replied, and looked away from her. Anywhere but at those green eyes that I\u2019d seen darken during an orgasm and twinkle with laughter when I\u2019d said something funny.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>What kind of question was that? Did it look like I was doing okay?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always doing okay, Manda.\u201d</p><p>I could hear her swift intake of breath. What had she expected me to say? The truth? She couldn\u2019t handle the truth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad to hear that. I\u2019ll, uh, see you later,\u201d she stammered, and I looked down at her as she walked away. The back of her dress scooped down all the way to her lower back. Any farther and her perfect little ass would be showing. Dammit, did her brother not require her to wear more clothes than that?</p> <p>She stopped walking, and I tore my gaze off her ass to see who she\u2019d stopped to talk to. Jason Stone. His arms wrapped around her in a hug, and the blood in my head started pounding furiously against my temple. He was touching her bare back. Had he touched her other places? Had he touched her places only I\u2019d touched her?</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I stormed for the doors leading outside to the beach. I needed some fresh air, and I needed space. Why had she brought him here? I\u2019d thought the story that she was seeing him was a lie to cover up the truth. But maybe it hadn\u2019t been a lie. Maybe she had run straight to him and his fucking jet. I slammed both hands, palms down, on the wooden railing outside and let out a stream of curse words. I\u2019d known this day would come. Seeing her with someone else. I just didn\u2019t know it would be so damn soon.</p><p>\u201cYou okay out here? We kinda need that railing for the wedding. If you could refrain from destroying it, that would be much appreciated.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at Marcus. He had walked up beside me.</p><p>\u201cBy any chance is this random act of violence over the fact that my sister is here with Jason Stone?\u201d</p><p>No use in denying it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to see her with someone else so soon.\u201d</p><p>Marcus leaned on the railing with his elbows. \u201cI was kind of surprised too. I mean, one day she is telling me she loves you, and then the next thing I know, you two are broken up and she\u2019s dating Jason. Just don\u2019t seem right. Amanda isn\u2019t fickle.\u201d</p> <p>Why hadn\u2019t she told him? Was she protecting me, or was she protecting her pride? I wanted to believe it was me she was protecting. She\u2019d been the only person to ever protect me. To want to protect me.</p><p>\u201cShe wised up. I wasn\u2019t good enough for her. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>Marcus let out a heavy sigh. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. You\u2019re my best friend. I love you like a brother. I just had seen you over the years go through girls faster than you did underwear, and I didn\u2019t want my little sister to be one of those girls. I didn\u2019t want her hurt. You\u2019re not a bad guy. You\u2019re a great guy. You\u2019re loyal to a fault. You can cheer up a whole damn room. You\u2019ve always had my back. If you were in love with a girl, then she\u2019d be one lucky woman.\u201d He paused and turned his head to look at me. \u201cBut you never said you loved Amanda. I knew for you to be faithful, you had to be in love with her. Even after she claimed to love you, you never said you loved her.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told anyone how I felt about her. I was tired of keeping it to myself. Amanda didn\u2019t want to hear it now. She\u2019d never believe me, anyway. But I could tell Marcus.</p><p>\u201cI love her. I\u2019ll love her until the day I die. No one else is ever going to take her place. It\u2019s impossible. I don\u2019t want to even try. The weeks I spent with her were the best ones of my life. Having her love me was amazing. But I screwed up. I always screw up. It\u2019s what I\u2019m good at.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stood back up and put his hand on my back. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re good at. You\u2019re good at a lot of things, but screwing up isn\u2019t one of them. We all make mistakes. God knows I did with Low back when I found out about her sister and my dad. But when we find that one person who completes us, we don\u2019t give up. No matter how bad we screwed up. We make it right.\u201d</p><p>I stood there looking out at the water as Marcus\u2019s footsteps faded away. He had no idea what he was saying. If he knew I\u2019d been screwing women for money while with his sister, he\u2019d kill me. When he thought Willow had betrayed him, he\u2019d reacted the way any man would. Amanda had done nothing but love me and trust me. What I\u2019d done to her was so much worse.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>\u201cDo I need to be worried about my life being in danger?\u201d Jason whispered as I led him to the room where he could wait while we rehearsed. Mom had football playing on the massive flat-screen and appetizers and drinks set out.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cEither you are completely blind, or you\u2019re just really good at ignoring things. But Preston just stormed out of this house after shooting me a death glare.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking and looked back at the double doors that were standing open and led out onto the beach. \u201cPreston went outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When we hugged. He saw it, and what could only be described as rage lit up his face before he tore out of here like a man being chased.\u201d</p><p>Really? He had seemed so uninterested in talking to me. I was still trying to deal with the fact that I annoyed him now. My presence was something he truly despised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he left because of you. He can\u2019t stand to be near me. He probably left because he was afraid I\u2019d try to talk to him again. This weekend is going to be oh so much fun. I have to walk down the aisle with him. Sit by him at the reception, and we both have to make toasts.\u201d</p><p>Jason reached out, took my hand, and squeezed it. \u201cAmanda, that guy doesn\u2019t dislike you. I don\u2019t know what he has said to you, but I can promise you what I just saw was not disinterest or annoyance. He was ready to take me apart for touching you. I know guys. I am one. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe him. I really did, but it was hard. I knew Preston well, and I could see the blank, empty emotion in his eyes when he looked at me. I was dead to him. I couldn\u2019t let myself hope for anything more. It already hurt too much. I didn\u2019t need to add to the pain. Not if I was going to find a way to move on from this and live again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, but I can\u2019t. I know him too well.\u201d I walked over to the table. \u201cYou can get anything you like to drink here, or snacks are over there. I hope you like SEC football, because that\u2019s all we watch around here. The other teams aren\u2019t really important in the grand scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cSo you SEC people really are as obnoxious as I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot obnoxious. Just being honest. The facts are the facts,\u201d I replied, and winked at him.</p><p>\u201cThe facts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go over the last ten NCAA national championship winners if you want to clear up any confusion,\u201d Rock drawled as he walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cCase in point. If you want to make friends, don\u2019t dis the SEC,\u201d I said, nodding toward Rock.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Jason replied.</p><p>\u201cHey, Amanda,\u201d Brent said, following Rock into the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, you! I didn\u2019t know I was going to get to see you tonight,\u201d I said, going over to hug him.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me, then nodded toward Rock. \u201cI\u2019m here with Rock and Trisha. They\u2019re gonna let us go live with them. Jimmy and I even got bunk beds and an Xbox. Preston keeps beating us at the football game he bought us, though. I\u2019m practicing. I\u2019m gonna take him out next time.\u201d</p><p>I would not get all weepy over this. I was just so happy for them. Hearing the joy in his little voice was wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt you\u2019ll be beating your brother in no time. I have complete faith.\u201d</p><p>Brent nodded and looked over at the table of food curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat? Help yourself. I need to go see who has the flower girl. We\u2019re about to start soon.\u201d</p><p>Brent hurried over to the table.</p><p>\u201cBring me one of them cookies,\u201d Rock told Brent as I walked out of the room</p><p>Preston</p><p>Rehearsal had been difficult for reasons much different from those I\u2019d come here dreading. Being near her was hard, but seeing her with him was harder. I\u2019d had to keep myself in check while walking down the aisle beside Amanda. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. She needed to wear a bra, dammit.</p><p>The rehearsal dinner had assigned seating, and Amanda\u2019s was beside Jason. Mine was directly across from them, since I was the best man. I got to witness their joking around and flirting. I didn\u2019t even pretend that it didn\u2019t bother me. I spent my entire meal glaring at him. The next time he called her \u201cBama\u201d I was going to come across the table and pummel his face in. He didn\u2019t get to give her nicknames. She wasn\u2019t his. Or was she?</p><p>I managed to make it through the meal without causing anyone bodily harm. The moment it was finished, I bolted for the door. I had to do this shit all over again tomorrow. I was never going to make it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Preston</p><p>The Hardys were putting the wedding party and out-of-town guests up at a hotel across the street from the beach house where the wedding was being held. I\u2019d gone downstairs this morning for some breakfast just in time to see Amanda walking out the front door on the arm of Jason Stone. His rock-star brother and Sadie White were with her. I lost my appetite.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it through today if I didn\u2019t get a grip. I had to control my emotions. I\u2019d been keeping them in check until I\u2019d seen Amanda again last night. She\u2019d tried to talk to me and I\u2019d been rude. I\u2019d protected myself. A lot of good it had done me.</p> <p>I\u2019d go talk to Marcus. He\u2019d make me feel better. I was heading for the elevator when it opened and Marcus came barreling out. His eyes looked panicked. \u201cHave you seen Low?\u201d he asked, looking past me to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>Marcus swore and gritted his teeth. \u201cBecause she\u2019s missing. We had an argument, but it was over. I thought we were good. Then I went to get her, and she wasn\u2019t in her room. I\u2019ve called Mom, and she\u2019s not at the beach house. I can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She was probably off somewhere taking a breather. \u201cCalm down, dude. The girl ain\u2019t going anywhere. She\u2019s here somewhere. You just got wedding nerves.\u201d</p><p>Marcus took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p> <p>He took off for the front door. I didn\u2019t follow him. Instead, I headed back up the elevator to my room.</p><p>I stopped outside the door I\u2019d seen Cage go into last night. I could talk to Cage. I needed to talk to someone. I knocked on the door.</p><p>It opened up, and Eva was standing there in her robe looking like she just got out of bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eva, sorry if I woke you up,\u201d I said, and walked into the room before she could turn me away. I was running out of friends to talk to. Cage was a last resort.</p><p>\u201cPreston?\u201d she replied. It sounded more like a question.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here. I mean, I knew she would be, but fuck me I hadn\u2019t been prepared to see her with him. What the hell does she see in him? He\u2019s a prick.\u201d I stalked over to a chair and gripped the back tightly. I wanted to hit something. Anything.</p> <p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Eva asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Cage?\u201d I asked her instead. I wasn\u2019t here to talk to her. I needed a guy to rant to.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>What the hell did that mean?</p><p>\u201cHe just left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was gone when I woke up,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Low was missing. Cage was missing. \u201cFuck. Marcus can\u2019t find Low, either,\u201d I told her. I didn\u2019t want to assume anything, but that was the truth.</p><p>The door swung open and Cage walked inside. His eyes swung from his upset girlfriend to me, and the fury that lit them told me he had the wrong idea.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing with my girl in my hotel room?\u201d Cage asked in a cold, even voice.</p><p>\u201cI came looking for you. Wipe that stupid-ass alpha snarl off your face. I\u2019m not here to make a play for Eva,\u201d I replied, annoyed that he was acting the same way I would.</p><p>Cage walked over to stand by Eva, who shifted away from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later. You got your own set of problems,\u201d I said, and headed out the door.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Breakfast with Sadie was nice. I\u2019d missed her. Seeing her again would have made this day perfect, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that my heart was broken and every time I saw Preston\u2019s face and he looked past me it shattered all over again. The wedding pictures would be starting soon. I needed to put on my bridesmaid dress and fix my hair.</p><p>I started to walk to the stairs, where I knew Willow was going over things with the wedding director, when I saw Preston\u2019s blond hair out on the beach. He was alone. His hands were tucked into his pockets, and he was watching the waves crash against the shore.</p><p>I slipped off my heels and headed out there after him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear me approaching, thanks to the wind and waves.</p><p>\u201cYou out here hiding?\u201d I asked when I was close enough for him to hear me.</p><p>His shoulders tensed. That was the only clue I had that he had heard me.</p><p>\u201cIs this the way it\u2019s always going to be between us? Can we not even go back to being friends?\u201d</p><p>Preston\u2019s shoulders rose and fell as he sighed. \u201cI can never be your friend, Manda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You did. If I can forgive you, then why can\u2019t you forgive me? Why do you have to hate me so much you can\u2019t stand to be around me?\u201d</p><p>Preston turned his head to look at me. \u201cHate you? You think I hate you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. Yeah, that was what I thought. He sure acted like it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Manda. I could never hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you treating me this way? Why can\u2019t you at least look at me? Talk to me? I\u2019m not asking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Preston grabbed me and slammed his mouth against mine violently. His tongue plunged into my mouth, wrapping around mine while his hands grabbed my butt and pulled me hard up against his body. I\u2019d barely had time to respond, when he was suddenly gone. I opened my eyes, and he was standing in front of me breathing hard. \u201cThat is why I am acting the way I am. Because every time you get near me, I want to grab you and hold on so damn tight you can\u2019t go anywhere again. I want to kiss you until you forget what a sorry-ass bastard I am. But I can\u2019t. You want to move on, and I am trying to let you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t over me. He wanted me. But he didn\u2019t love me. Could I live without love? I wanted what Marcus and Willow had. But I also wanted Preston. Did I let go of the dream of a fairy-tale romance so I could have my dream of Preston?</p><p>\u201cYou show up here with him,\u201d he growled. \u201cHow the fuck do I handle that? All I can think about is, has he touched you? It\u2019s killing me. It is literally eating me up inside. Knowing he may be touching you in places only I had touched you. Places that were mine. Mine! And I fucked it up and lost it.\u201d</p><p>I took two steps, closing enough distance between us so that I could touch him. I\u2019d made my decision. Preston wasn\u2019t raised like my brother. He hadn\u2019t been given love. How did I expect him to know how to love if no one had ever shown him? Marcus could love easily. He\u2019d been loved all his life.</p><p>I\u2019d show Preston how to love. Maybe one day he\u2019d love me too. He just needed someone to teach him how love works. How it feels. That it isn\u2019t built on lies. I loved him more than my fantasy of what I thought romance was. I would never be happy with anyone but him.</p><p>I reached out and placed my hand on his heart. His pec muscle jumped underneath my hand. \u201cI\u2019m not dating Jason. We are friends. Only friends. Never even kissed him. He knows my heart is unavailable. I\u2019ve explained it to him, and he is okay with that. He isn\u2019t looking for anything more with me. This weekend he knew was going to be tough on me, so he flew in to be supportive. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Preston was breathing hard. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t touched you anywhere? Because he sure as hell hugs you too tightly.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and shook my head. \u201cHe has hugged me twice. That is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got money. He\u2019s got fame. He\u2019s got that damn jet. Why don\u2019t you want him?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my thumb over his heart. \u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>The hard mask on his face fell away, and his eyes swam with emotion.</p><p>\u201cHow? Why?\u201d he asked, reaching up to cover my hand with his. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You\u2019re special, Preston Drake. I think I\u2019ve been in love with you since my sixteenth birthday and you came to my bonfire party on the beach with Marcus. You winked at me and called me beautiful. From that moment on I watched you. I was fascinated by you. Then as I got older, I wanted you. Once I got you, I realized I was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Preston slid his other hand around my waist and rested it against my lower back. \u201cThe night you walked out on me and you knew the truth, there were no more lies standing between us, and I realized this crazy, wild, intense feeling I had for you was love. I\u2019d never had this before. Sure, I loved my brothers and sister, but nothing like this out-of-control emotion I couldn\u2019t name. I had been scared to tell you I loved you because I couldn\u2019t believe that what I was feeling was love if I wasn\u2019t telling you the truth about me. I lied to you because I knew you\u2019d leave me if you found out. I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>My breathing stopped. I\u2019m more than positive my heart did too.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and lowered his head until his lips hovered over mine. \u201cI love you with a scary, insane, wild, amazing love. I always will. No one else could ever make me feel this way.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips against his and wrapped my arms around his neck. Both his hands locked on my waist, and he picked me up. I wrapped my legs around him while I kissed him with all the emotion pouring through me. His hands slipped under my dress and cupped my bottom so he could hold me up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys. Really? This is my freaking wedding day. Can y\u2019all save that crap until it\u2019s over?\u201d Marcus\u2019s voice carried out over the wind, and we broke apart to see him grinning at us a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hard to resist,\u201d Preston called back out to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, try. Please. Everyone is getting ready inside. We need the best man and maid of honor. If y\u2019all could try not to make out during the wedding pictures, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Preston laughed and set me back down on the sand. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not going to bash my face in this time?\u201d</p><p>Marcus shook his head. \u201cNo, but if the two of you had continued to look at each other and sulk like babies, I was going to bash your face in for being an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you found the bride,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>What did that mean? Had he lost her?</p><p>Marcus shrugged. \u201cYeah. She\u2019d gone to eat fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFries?\u201d we both asked in unison.</p><p>Marcus rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, fries. It\u2019s one of those Cage and Low things I\u2019m still learning to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Preston squeezed my butt and then patted it. \u201cYou go on ahead with your brother. I\u2019ll follow behind. Tonight isn\u2019t the time to deal with your mother\u2019s reaction.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten about her. Crap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Preston</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if the wedding was as beautiful as everyone said it was. All I\u2019d been able to see was Amanda. I could attest to the fact that she was gorgeous. It was hard to see anyone else around her. She commanded my complete attention.</p><p>The wedding dinner, however, was another thing. Once again she was seated beside Jason, since he was her plus one, and I was across the table getting to witness it.</p> <p>She\u2019d smiled at me reassuringly throughout the meal. I knew she was trying to get me to stop staring Jason down, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. I was pissed, and I wanted him to leave.</p><p>When the longest meal I\u2019d ever sat through was over, Jason had stood up and congratulated Marcus and Low, then explained he had a plane waiting on him. Amanda said she\u2019d walk him out. I didn\u2019t want them alone. I trusted her, but I couldn\u2019t say the same for Jason. Once they stepped out of the dining room, I started to stand up and follow them. Marcus\u2019s hand gripped my arm tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. She doesn\u2019t want him. She is being polite. He was her guest. Don\u2019t make a scene. She\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Marcus was talking under his breath so no one could hear him but me. I knew he was right, but I didn\u2019t like sitting here waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he tries to kiss her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stop it. Trust her.\u201d</p><p>I did trust her, dammit.</p><p>Amanda walked back into the room, and she immediately looked toward me. She mouthed, Let\u2019s go. Then she turned to go say her good-byes to her mother and some guests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you two find the time to see us off later,\u201d Marcus said before I could even stand up. He\u2019d read her lips too.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, and thank you for trusting me with her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus smiled. \u201cYou are my best man. Who better to trust her with?\u201d</p> <p>I grinned and headed out the door. Amanda was already out here somewhere waiting on me, and I was more than anxious to get her alone.</p><p>Two hands reached out of the shadows and wrapped around my arm, tugging me into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t very nice in there,\u201d Amanda scolded before kissing my neck and running her hands up my chest.</p><p>\u201cI was on my best behavior,\u201d I replied, grabbing the bottom of this ridiculous excuse for a dress and pulling it up so I could run my hands over her ass again. She was wearing a fucking thong. I\u2019d made that discovery on the beach earlier, and it had driven me crazy every time I looked down at her ass in this dress.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were a bad boy. I\u2019m surprised Jason toughed it out as long as he did.\u201d She bit down on my earlobe and raised her bare leg up my side. I grabbed her under the knee and pulled it higher.</p><p>\u201cHe was too close to you, and you don\u2019t have on a bra. Manda, you have got to start wearing a bra, baby. I\u2019m gonna get arrested if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and reached up to pull the straps of her dress down until her breasts were bare.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby. I\u2019ve got to get you back to my apartment. Now. Real fast.\u201d I bent down to flick her erect nipples with my tongue.</p> <p>\u201cMmmmm, I can\u2019t wait that long, and we have to be here to see them off,\u201d she moaned, pressing my head closer to her nipple until I pulled it into my mouth and sucked.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to be able to wait that long either at this rate. It had been too long since I\u2019d touched her. I was ready to be buried up in her, and this time I might not ever come out.</p><p>\u201cPreston,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo down the beach that way. There are no houses, and it\u2019s dark and empty. I need you right now.\u201d She was pointing off into the darkness.</p><p>She wanted to have sex on a beach? Hell, yes.</p><p>I slipped the straps of her dress back up her arms and covered her tits back up, then grabbed her hand and led her out deeper into the darkness. We walked until the music and laughter from the house had faded away and there was no sound other than the waves..</p><p>Amanda pushed at my chest when I tried to pull her against me, and she reached for the button on my pants. There was a wicked gleam in her eyes as she looked up at me. She got the button undone and unzipped them, then pulled down my pants and my boxer briefs. I slipped off my shoes and stepped out of them. My girl wanted me naked, so I was going to oblige her.</p><p>She placed both her hands on my thighs and stuck out her tongue and took a swipe at my dick. Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cManda, baby . . . Ohgod.\u201d She wrapped a hand around the base of my cock, then covered it with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBaby, AH, you . . . OH, Manda, God, that feels incredible.\u201d I gave up trying to stop her. I couldn\u2019t form words. I reached down and buried my hands in her hair, and watched in delirious pleasure as she slid my dick in and out of her mouth like it was a damn Popsicle and she couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>\u201cHoly . . . fuck. UH, yeah. That\u2019s it. So good.\u201d She sucked harder when I praised her. If I wasn\u2019t about to explode, I\u2019d keep on talking, but I needed to get her sweet, hot little mouth off my cock and get inside her.</p><p>I reached down and pulled her up. The popping noise her mouth made when my dick sprang free might go down as one of the hottest sounds ever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop,\u201d she said with a pout, trying to go back down on her knees.</p><p>\u201cI was about to lose it right there in your sexy-as-hell mouth, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to lose it in you.\u201d</p><p>Amanda made a cute little O with her mouth, and I reached under her dress to rid her of her panties. I threw them aside, and she laughed at yet another torn pair of her little sexy underwear. I was going to go buy her some more tomorrow. We were gonna need them.</p><p>I slipped a finger into her, thinking I needed to get her ready, when my hand met wet heat. \u201cYou liked giving me head, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked in wonder as she trembled against my hand, more than wet enough for me. \u201cThat\u2019s so damn hot,\u201d I whispered, lowering my mouth to capture hers. She was turned on and ready for me just by sucking my damn cock. Shit. This woman owned me. I\u2019d be her slave for life. I just couldn\u2019t lose her again.</p><p>Amanda</p><p>Preston unzipped my dress and let it drop to the sand below us, and I kicked it aside. He reached for his pants and pulled out his wallet and a small foil packet. I watched as he tore it open with his teeth then slid the condom down over himself. His white teeth bit into his bottom lip as he worked to get the protection in place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna lie down, and I want you to get on top of me. Just like you rode me on the couch.\u201d He pulled his shirt off, then lay down on the sand, and I stepped over him and lowered myself on him.</p><p>\u201cAh, damn, I\u2019m not gonna last,\u201d he breathed as I placed my hands on his chest and let him guide his erection into me. I was more than ready for him. As soon as he had it in place, I sank down on him and we both cried out from the pleasure of it. I\u2019d missed him so much. This time knowing he loved me. It changed everything.</p><p>We dusted the sand off the best we could and fixed each other\u2019s hair before we headed back to the house. We could see people piling out of the front doors as we approached. We\u2019d made it back just in time.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go in first so your mom doesn\u2019t see us?\u201d</p><p>No. I didn\u2019t. I wanted to walk in there holding Preston Drake\u2019s hand and daring her to say anything about it. Was she really going to tell everyone about his past? Because I wasn\u2019t going to leave him, so they\u2019d all know that her daughter was dating a former gigolo. I wasn\u2019t so sure my mom was that self-destructive. Her social circle would eat that information up. Also, she\u2019d have to rat the mayor\u2019s wife out, and that would cause all kinds of drama.</p><p>\u201cI want to walk in there holding your hand. I\u2019m tired of hiding things because I\u2019m scared of my mom\u2019s reaction. She is going to be against this, but I don\u2019t care. She\u2019ll learn to live with it. And once she\u2019s around you for any amount of time, she\u2019s going to be charmed. You have that way about you. It is impossible for a female to not like you.\u201d</p><p>Preston pulled me up against his chest and cupped my face in his hands. \u201cI love you. I love you so damn much it consumes me. I don\u2019t deserve you, but I\u2019m gonna become the man who does deserve you. I promise you. I\u2019ll make you proud of me.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and ran my thumb over his lips. \u201cI am and will always be proud of you. I want the world to know you\u2019re mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
