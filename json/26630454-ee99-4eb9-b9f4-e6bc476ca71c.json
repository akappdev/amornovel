Jason Manning scrubbed his hands in the stainless-steel sink, then applied ointment to several scratches. He\u2019d just finished examining and prescribing antibiotics for a feisty Persian cat with a bladder infection. The usually ill-mannered feline had never been his most cooperative patient, but today she\u2019d taken a particular dislike to Jason.</p><p>He left the examining room and was greeted by Stella, his receptionist, who steered him toward his office. She wore a suspiciously silly grin, as if to say \u201cthis should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young lady who\u2019d like a few minutes with you,\u201d was all the information she\u2019d give him. Her cryptic message didn\u2019t please him any more than the Persian\u2019s blatant distaste for him had.</p> <p>Curious, Jason moved into his book-lined office. \u201cHello,\u201d he said in the friendliest voice he could muster.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d A teenage girl who seemed vaguely familiar stood as he entered the room. She glanced nervously in his direction as if he should recognize her. When it was obvious he didn\u2019t, she introduced herself. \u201cI\u2019m Carrie Weston.\u201d She paused, waiting expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carrie,\u201d Jason said. He\u2019d seen her around, but for the life of him, couldn\u2019t recall where. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see any point in pretending. If a cat could outsmart him, he was fair game for a teenager.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors. My mom and I live in the same apartment complex as you.\u201d</p><p>He did his best to smile and nod as though he\u2019d immediately placed her, but he hadn\u2019t. He racked his brain trying to recall which apartment was hers. Although he owned and managed the building, Jason didn\u2019t interact much with his tenants. He was careful to choose renters who cared about their privacy as much as he cared about his. He rarely saw any of them other than to collect the rent, and even then most just slipped their checks under his door around the first of the month.</p><p>Carrie sat back down, her hands clenched tightly in her lap. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but I\u2019ve been trying to talk to you for some time, and...and this seemed to be the only way I could do it without my mother finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Weston. We live in 1-A.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. The Westons had been in the apartment for more than a year. Other than when they\u2019d signed the rental agreement, Jason couldn\u2019t recall speaking to either the mother or her daughter.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem...exactly.\u201d Carrie stood once again and opened her purse, taking out a thin wad of bills, which she leafed through and counted slowly. When she\u2019d finished, she looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jason prompted. He didn\u2019t have a clue where this conversation was leading or how long it would take the girl to get there. Stella knew he had a terrier waiting, yet she\u2019d purposely routed him into his office.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a man,\u201d Carrie said, squaring her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d The girl had his attention now.</p><p>\u201cMy mother needs a man. I\u2019m here to offer you one hundred dollars if you\u2019ll take her out on a date. You are single, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...but...\u201d Jason was so surprised, he answered without thinking. Frankly, he didn\u2019t know whether to ask which of his brothers had put her up to this, or simply to laugh outright. He couldn\u2019t very well claim he\u2019d never been propositioned before, but this was by far the most original instance he\u2019d encountered in thirty-odd years.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ugly or anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh...I\u2019m not sure what to tell you.\u201d The girl was staring at him so candidly, so forthrightly, Jason realized within seconds it was no joke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my mother\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>Jason leaned against the side of his oak desk and crossed his arms. \u201cWhy would you assume my taking her out will make a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just hoping. You see, my mom and dad got divorced when I was little. I don\u2019t remember my dad, and apparently he doesn\u2019t remember me, either, because I\u2019ve never heard from him. Mom doesn\u2019t say much about what went wrong, but it must\u2019ve been bad because she never dates. I didn\u2019t care about that before, only now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly now what?\u201d Jason asked when she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI want to start dating myself, and my mother\u2019s going totally weird on me. She says I\u2019m too young. Boy, is she out of it! I\u2019m not allowed to date until I\u2019m sixteen. Can you imagine anything so ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh...\u201d Jason wasn\u2019t interested in getting involved in a mother-daughter squabble. \u201cNot being a father myself, I can\u2019t really say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ninth-grade dance is coming up in a few weeks and I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother won\u2019t allow you to attend the dance?\u201d That sounded a bit harsh to Jason, but as he\u2019d just stated, he wasn\u2019t in a position to know.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll let me go, except she intends to drop me off and pick me up when the dance is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s unacceptable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is! It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s the most awful thing she could do to me. I\u2019d be mortified to have my mother waiting in the school parking lot to take me home after the dance. I\u2019d be humiliated in front of my friends. You\u2019ve just got to help me.\u201d A note of desperation raised her voice on the last few words.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want me to do,\u201d Jason hedged. He couldn\u2019t see any connection between Carrie\u2019s attending the all-important ninth-grade dance and him wining and dining her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou need me to spell it out for you?\u201d Carrie\u2019s eyes were wide, her gaze scanning the room. \u201cI\u2019m offering you serious money to seduce my mother.\u201d</p><p>For a wild instant, Jason thought he hadn\u2019t heard her right. \u201cSeduce her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s practically a virgin all over again. She needs a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Jason was having a hard time keeping a straight face. He could hardly wait to tell his brother Rich. The two of them would have a good laugh over it.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely positive.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t even flinch. Her expression grew more confident. \u201cMom\u2019s forgotten what it\u2019s like to be in love. All she thinks about is work. Don\u2019t get me wrong...My mother\u2019s an awesome person, but she\u2019s so prim and proper...and stubborn. What she really needs is...well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jason felt sorry for the kid, but he didn\u2019t see how he could help her. Now that he thought about it, he did recall what Charlotte Weston looked like. In fact, he could remember the day she\u2019d moved in. She\u2019d seemed feminine and attractive, more than a little intriguing. But he\u2019d noticed a guardedness, too, that sent an unmistakable signal. He\u2019d walked away with the impression that she was as straitlaced as a nun and about as warm and inviting as an Alaskan winter.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Jason was curious enough to wonder why Carrie had sought him out. Apparently his charisma was more alluring than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cWell, because...just because, that\u2019s all,\u201d Carrie answered with perfect teenage logic. \u201cAnd I figured I wouldn\u2019t have to pay you as much as I would one of those dating services. You seem nice.\u201d She gnawed on her lower lip. \u201cBeing a veterinarian is good, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably had lots of experience soothing injured animals, and I think my mother\u2019s going to need some of that\u2014comforting and reassuring, you know?\u201d The girl\u2019s voice became fervent. \u201cShe\u2019s been hurt.... She doesn\u2019t talk about it, but she loved my father and I think she must be afraid of falling in love again. I even think she might like another baby someday.\u201d This last bit of information was clearly an afterthought. Carrie cast him a speculative glance to be sure she hadn\u2019t said something she shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that\u2014she\u2019s probably too old anyway,\u201d she added quickly.</p><p>\u201cShe wants a baby?\u201d Jason could feel the hair on the back of his neck rising. This woman-child was leading him toward quicksand, and he was going to put a stop to it right now.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no...I mean, she\u2019s never said so, but I saw her the other day holding a friend\u2019s newborn and she had that look in her eyes...I thought she was going to cry.\u201d She paused. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>For one brief, insane moment, Jason had actually considered the challenge of seducing Charlotte Weston, but the mention of a baby brought him solidly back to earth.</p><p>\u201cListen, Carrie,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to,\u201d she pleaded urgently, \u201cjust for one date. Couldn\u2019t you ask her out? Just once? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be humiliated in front of my entire class. I\u2019d rather not even go to the dance if my mother drives me.\u201d</p><p>Jason hated to disappoint her, but he couldn\u2019t see himself in the role of rescuing a fifteen-year-old damsel in distress from her mother\u2019s heavy hand, even if Carrie did make a halfway decent case.</p><p>\u201cIs it the money?\u201d Carrie asked, her eyes imploring. \u201cI might be able to scrounge up another twenty dollars...but I\u2019m going to need some cash for the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the money,\u201d Jason assured her.</p><p>Wearing a dejected look, Carrie stood. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to take a couple of days to think it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She released a long, frustrated sigh. \u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d Jason held open the door. He had no intention of asking Charlotte Weston out on a date, but he he did feel sorry for Carrie. Although he hadn\u2019t been a teenager in years, he hadn\u2019t forgotten how important these things could seem. Things like the ninth-grade dance.</p><p>Charlotte let herself into the apartment at six that evening. She slipped off her heels and rubbed the tense muscles at the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Carrie called cheerfully from the kitchen. \u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d There was no need to burden her daughter with how terrible her day had been. Her job as an executive assistant at a large insurance agency might have sounded high-powered and influential, but in reality it was neither. Charlotte worked long hours with little appreciation or reward. For six months, ever since Harry Ward had taken over as managing director, she\u2019d been telling herself it was time to change jobs. But she couldn\u2019t give up the security of her position, no matter how much she disliked her boss.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. Tickets for the dance went on sale today.\u201d Her daughter looked hopefully at Charlotte, as though expecting her to make some profound comment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte chose to ignore the pointed stare. Her stand on the dance issue was causing a strain in their relationship, but she refused to give in to her daughter\u2019s pressure. Carrie wasn\u2019t going on an actual date. She was interested in a boy named Brad, but as far as Charlotte was concerned, Carrie could attend the dance with her girlfriends and meet him there. Good grief, the girl was only fifteen!</p><p>\u201cMom, can we please talk about the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to change your mind, right?\u201d Carrie guessed, then sighed. \u201cWhat can I say to prove how unreasonable you\u2019re being? Every girl in my class is going to the dance with a boy. And Brad asked me.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte reached for an apron, tied it about her waist and opened the refrigerator door. She took out a package of ground turkey for taco salad. She wasn\u2019t up to another round of arguments over the dance.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy a dance ticket?\u201d Charlotte asked, forcing an artificial lightness into her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t, either. I\u2019d rather sit home for the rest of my life than have my mother drop me off and pick me up. Brad\u2019s father said he\u2019d drive us both...What am I supposed to tell Brad? That my mother doesn\u2019t trust his father\u2019s driving? You\u2019re making way too big a deal out of this.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the certainty of youth, Charlotte mused.</p><p>\u201cWill you think about it?\u201d Carrie implored. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Charlotte promised. She hated to be so hardheaded, but when it came to her daughter, she found little room for compromise. To her way of thinking, Carrie was too young for a real date, even if the boy in question wasn\u2019t the one driving.</p><p>The meat was simmering in the cast-iron skillet as Charlotte started to wash the lettuce. The faucet came off in her hand, squirting icy water toward the ceiling, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Carrie asked, leaping up from the kitchen table where she was doing her homework.</p><p>\u201cThe faucet broke!\u201d Already Charlotte was down on her knees, her head under the sink, searching for the valve to cut off the water supply.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s water everywhere,\u201d Carrie shrieked.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Most of it had landed on Charlotte.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to be able to fix it?\u201d Carrie asked anxiously.</p><p>Charlotte sat on the floor, her back against the lower cupboards, her knees under her chin. This was all she needed to make her day complete. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she muttered, pushing damp hair away from her face with both hands. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call the apartment manager,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had to work all day. If something breaks down, he should be the one to fix it, not you. We don\u2019t know anything about faucets. We\u2019re helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpless?\u201d Charlotte raised her eyebrows at that. The two of them had dealt with far more difficult problems over the years. By comparison, a broken faucet was nothing. \u201cI think we can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we can, but why should we?\u201d Carrie demanded. \u201cWe pay our rent on time every month. The least the manager could do is see to minor repairs. He should fix them right away, too.\u201d She marched over to the wall phone and yanked the receiver from the hook. \u201cHere,\u201d she said dramatically. \u201cYou call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know the number.\u201d They\u2019d lived in the apartment for well over a year and until now there hadn\u2019t been any reason to contact the manager.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s around here somewhere,\u201d Carrie said, pulling open the top kitchen drawer and riffling through the phone book and some other papers. Within a very brief time, she\u2019d located the phone number. \u201cHis name is Jason Manning. He\u2019s a veterinarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vet? I didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d But then, Charlotte had only met the man once, and their entire conversation had been about the apartment. He seemed pleasant enough. She\u2019d seen him in the parking lot a few times and he struck her as an overgrown kid. Frankly, she was surprised to learn he was a veterinarian, since she\u2019d never seen him in anything other than a baseball cap, jeans and a T-shirt. Dressing up for him was a pair of jeans that weren\u2019t torn or stained and a sweatshirt.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to phone him?\u201d Carrie asked, holding out the receiver.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I will.\u201d Charlotte rose awkwardly to her feet in her straight skirt. By the time she was upright, her daughter had dialed the number and handed her the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d came Jason Manning\u2019s voice after the first ring, catching her off guard.</p><p>\u201cOh...hello...This is Charlotte Weston in apartment 1-A. We have a broken faucet. I managed to turn off the valve, but we\u2019d appreciate having it repaired as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA broken faucet,\u201d he repeated, and although she knew it made no sense, he sounded suspicious to Charlotte, as though he thought she\u2019d purposely interrupted his evening. She resented his attitude.</p><p>\u201cYes, a broken faucet,\u201d she returned stiffly. \u201cIt came off in my hand when I went to wash some lettuce. There\u2019s water everywhere.\u201d A slight exaggeration, but a necessary one. \u201cIf you\u2019d prefer, I can contact a plumber. Naturally there\u2019ll be an additional charge for repairs this late in the day.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something Charlotte couldn\u2019t decipher, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right over.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem too pleased, but that was his problem. He shouldn\u2019t have agreed to manage the apartments if he wasn\u2019t willing to deal with the hassles that went along with the job.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d her daughter asked, eyes curious, when Charlotte hung up the phone. \u201cIs he coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d be right over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Carrie studied her critically. \u201cYou might want to change clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange clothes? Whatever for?\u201d Surprised at her daughter\u2019s concern, Charlotte glanced down at her business suit. She didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it other than a little water, and in any event, she couldn\u2019t care less about impressing the apartment manager.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Carrie rolled her eyes, returning to her homework. No sooner had she sat down than the doorbell chimed. Her daughter leapt suddenly to her feet as if she expected to find a rock star at the door. \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d</p><p>Jason considered the whole thing a nuisance call. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out what Carrie Weston was doing. The girl had arranged this broken faucet just so he\u2019d have a chance to see Charlotte. The kid seemed to think that once Jason got a good look at her mother, he\u2019d change his mind about wanting to date her. Well, there wasn\u2019t much chance of that.</p><p>Apparently the girl thought he was something of a player. Jason might\u2019ve gotten a kick out of that a few years ago, but not now. Not when he was nearing middle age. These days he was more concerned about his cholesterol level and his weight than with seducing a reluctant woman.</p><p>He probably would\u2019ve ended up getting married if things had worked out between him and Julie, but they hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d been with Charlie nearly seven years now, and the last he\u2019d heard, she had three kids. He wished her and her husband well, and suffered no regrets. Sure, it had hurt when they\u2019d broken off their relationship, but in the end it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. He was pragmatic enough to accept that and go on with his life.</p><p>Jason enjoyed the company of women as much as any man did, but he didn\u2019t like the fact that they all wanted to reform him. He was disorganized, slovenly and a sports nut. Women didn\u2019t appreciate those qualities in a man. They would smile sweetly, claim they loved him just the way he was and then try to change him. The problem was, Jason didn\u2019t want to be refined, reformed or domesticated.</p><p>Charlotte Weston was a prime example of the type of woman he particularly avoided. Haughty. Dignified. Proper. She actually washed lettuce. Furthermore, she made a point of letting him know it.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Carrie opened the door for him, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cThe faucet broke?\u201d Jason didn\u2019t bother to keep the sarcasm out of his voice.</p><p>She nodded, her smile as sly as a wink. \u201cKind of accidentally on purpose,\u201d she explained under her breath.</p><p>Jason was surprised she\u2019d admit as much. \u201cI thought that might be the case.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a screw from the small front pocket of her jeans and handed it to him. \u201cIt was the only way I could think of to get you here to see my mother up close\u2014only don\u2019t be obvious about it, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, is it the apartment manager?\u201d The subject of their discussion walked into the living room, drying her hands on a terry-cloth apron.</p><p>Not bad was Jason\u2019s first reaction. She\u2019d changed her hair since the last time he\u2019d seen her; it was a cloud of disarrayed brown curls instead of the chignon she\u2019d worn a year earlier. The curls gave her a softer, more feminine appeal. She was good-looking, too, not trying-to-make-an-impression gorgeous, but attractive in a modest sort of way. Her eyes were a deep shade of blue, as blue as his own. They were also intense and...sad, as though she\u2019d withstood more than her share of problems over the years. But then, who hadn\u2019t?</p><p>Her legs were attractive, too. Long and slender. She was tall\u2014easily five-eight, maybe five-nine.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not bad-looking, is she?\u201d Carrie asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Jason slid back a warning.</p><p>\u201cMom, this is Dr. Jason Manning, remember? Our apartment manager,\u201d Carrie said, her arm making a sweeping gesture toward her mother.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She stayed where she was, her fingers still clutching the apron.</p><p>\u201cHi. You called about the broken faucet?\u201d He took a couple of steps into the room, carrying his tool kit. He\u2019d have a talk with Carrie later. If this took more than a few minutes, he might be late for the Lakers play-off game. It was the fifth game in the series, and Jason had no intention of missing it.</p><p>\u201cThe broken faucet\u2019s in the kitchen,\u201d Charlotte said, leading the way.</p><p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d Jason set his tools on the counter and reached for the disconnected faucet. \u201cLooks like it might be missing a screw.\u201d He turned pointedly to Carrie, then made a show of sorting through his tool kit. \u201cMy guess is that I have an identical one in here.\u201d He pretended to find the screw Carrie had handed him, then held it up so they could all examine it. \u201cAh, here\u2019s one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so obvious about it,\u201d Carrie warned in a heated whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want Mom to know.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte seemed oblivious to the undercurrents passing between him and Carrie, which was probably just as well. He\u2019d let the kid get away with it this time, but he wasn\u2019t coming back for any repeat performances of this handyman routine.</p><p>\u201cI should have this fixed in a couple of minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Carrie told him. \u201cNo need to rush.\u201d She walked up behind Jason and whispered, \u201cGive her a chance, will you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True to his word, it took Jason all of thirty seconds to make the necessary repair.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom faucet\u2019s been leaking, hasn\u2019t it, Mom? Don\u2019t you think we should have him look at that, too, while he\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Jason glanced at his watch and frowned. If the kid kept this up, he\u2019d miss the start of the basketball game. But he decided he had little choice: pay now or pay later. He gave Carrie the lead she was hoping for. \u201cOr it\u2019ll need fixing tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d There was a clear glint of warning in the fifteen-year-old\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Charlotte turned around and glanced from one to the other. Crossing her arms, she studied her daughter, then looked at Jason as if seeing him for the first time. Really seeing him. Apparently she didn\u2019t like what she saw.</p><p>\u201cIs something going on here I don\u2019t know about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Carrie said with wide-eyed innocence.</p><p>Jason had to hand it to the girl; she had the look down to an art form.</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question, Caroline Marie.\u201d</p> <p>The mother wasn\u2019t a slacker in \u201cthe look\u201d department, either. She had eyes that would flash freeze a pot of boiling water.</p><p>The girl held her own for an admirable length of time before caving in to the icy glare. She lifted her shoulders with an expressive sigh and said, \u201cIf you must know, I took the screw out of the faucet so we\u2019d have to call Jason over here.\u201d</p><p>Once again Jason glanced at his watch, hoping to extract himself from their discussion. This was between mother and daughter\u2014not mother, daughter and innocent bystander. He hadn\u2019t meant to let Charlotte in on her daughter\u2019s scheme, but neither was he willing to become a full-time pawn in Carrie\u2019s little games. No telling how many other repair projects the girl might turn up for him.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want Dr. Manning here?\u201d Charlotte asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a good-looking man and he seems nice and I thought it would be great if you got to know each other.\u201d</p><p>It was time to make his move, Jason decided. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou purposely broke the faucet so we could call him down here?\u201d Charlotte gestured toward Jason.</p><p>Carrie sent him an irritated look as though to suggest this was all his fault. \u201cI wanted him to see you. For being thirty-five, you aren\u2019t half bad. Once he saw your potential, I was sure he\u2019d ask you out on a date. I tried to talk him into it earlier, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Charlotte exploded. Color flashed into her cheeks like bright neon lights. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t! Please tell me you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Carrie snapped her mouth shut, about ten seconds too late to suit Jason.</p><p>\u201cThis is all a big joke, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Charlotte turned to Jason for reassurance, which was a mistake, since he was glaring at Carrie, irritated with her for saying far more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cI had to do something,\u201d Carrie cried, defending herself. \u201cYou need a man. I saw the look on your face when you were holding Kathy Crenshaw\u2019s baby. You\u2019ve never said anything, but you want more children. You never date...I don\u2019t know what my father did to you, but you\u2019ve shut yourself off and\u2014and...I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stalked to the far side of the small kitchen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. You actually asked a man to take me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did more than ask. I offered him money!\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte whirled on Jason. \u201cJust what kind of man are you? Agreeing to my daughter\u2019s plans...Why...you\u2019re detestable!\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, Jason smiled, which was no doubt the worst thing he could have done. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. Now if you\u2019ll both excuse me, I\u2019ll leave you to your discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of man are you?\u201d Charlotte demanded a second time, following him to the door, blocking his exit.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to your room, young lady. I\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201d She pointed the way, as if Carrie needed directions.</p><p>Jason hadn\u2019t imagined things would go like this, and he did feel badly about it, but that didn\u2019t help. Charlotte Weston could think harshly of him if she wanted, but now Carrie was in trouble and Jason felt halfway responsible.</p><p>\u201cShe was just trying to do you a good turn,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cThink of it as an early Mother\u2019s Day gift.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>With her daughter out of the room, Charlotte scowled at Jason Manning, angrier than she could ever remember being.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of anything bad enough to call him.</p><p>\u201cDetestable is a good word.\u201d He was practically laughing at her!</p><p>\u201cDetestable,\u201d she repeated, clenching her fists. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m reporting you to...\u201d The name of the government agency, any government agency, was beyond her.</p><p>\u201cChildren Protective Services,\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cThem, too.\u201d She jerked the apron from her waist and threw it on the floor. Surprised by her own action, Charlotte tried to steady herself. \u201cAccording to the terms of our rental agreement, I\u2019m giving you our two-weeks\u2019 notice as of this minute. I refuse to live near a man as...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeinous,\u201d he offered, looking bored.</p><p>\u201cHeinous as you,\u201d she stated emphatically. Then with an indignant tilt of her chin, she said as undramatically as she could manage, \u201cNow kindly leave my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He opened the door and without a backward glance walked out of her apartment. He\u2019d worn a cocky grin throughout, as if he found her tirade thoroughly amusing.</p><p>His attitude infuriated Charlotte. She followed him to the door and loudly turned the lock, hoping the sound of it would echo in his ears for a good long time.</p><p>When he\u2019d gone, Charlotte discovered she was shaking so badly she needed to sit down. She sank onto a chair, her knees trembling.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d A small voice drifted down from the hallway. \u201cYou weren\u2019t serious about us moving, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re darn right I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m so serious I\u2019d prefer to live in our car than have anything to do with that...that...apartment manager!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Carrie\u2019s voice gained strength as she wandered from her bedroom to the living room, where Charlotte was seated. \u201cWhy are we moving?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had clearly failed as a mother. One more layer of guilt to add to all the others. \u201cYou mean you honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo punish me?\u201d Carrie asked, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mom. I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>What Carrie had done was bad enough, but Jason Manning was an adult. He should\u2019ve known better. True, her daughter had played a major role in all this, but Carrie was a child and didn\u2019t fully understand what she was suggesting. Her daughter had Charlotte\u2019s best interests at heart, misguided though she was.</p><p>Jason Manning, on the other hand, had planned to take advantage of them both.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t you I\u2019m furious with, it\u2019s him.\u201d Charlotte pointed after Jason. To think a professional man would actually agree to such an idiotic scheme.</p><p>\u201cDr. Manning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a sleaze! Imagine, taking money from you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte hesitated, the sick feeling in her stomach intensifying. \u201cOf course he did,\u201d she argued, \u201cotherwise he wouldn\u2019t have played out this ridiculous game with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one who took the screw out of the faucet, Mom. Jason Manning didn\u2019t know anything about it. When I asked him if he\u2019d agree to take you out on a date, he refused. He was really nice about it and everything, but he didn\u2019t seem to think it was a good idea. That\u2019s when I offered him the babysitting money I\u2019ve been saving, but he wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>A dizziness replaced Charlotte\u2019s nausea. Several of Jason\u2019s comments suddenly made sense, especially the hint of sarcasm she\u2019d detected when he\u2019d held up the missing screw. Yet he\u2019d allowed her to rant at him, not even bothering to defend himself.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t going to make us move, are you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes and groaned. She\u2019d had a rotten day at the office, but misplacing a file and getting yelled at in front of an important client didn\u2019t compare with the humiliation that had been awaiting her at home.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how many fat grams there are in crow,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cFat grams in crow? Are you all right, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be eating a huge serving of it,\u201d Charlotte grumbled, and she had the distinct feeling she wasn\u2019t going to enjoy the experience.</p><p>She gave herself an hour. Sixty minutes to calm her nerves, have dinner and wipe down the counters while Carrie loaded the dishwasher. Sixty minutes to figure out how she was going to take back her two-weeks\u2019 notice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Carrie prodded her. \u201cRight away.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t need Carrie to identify him. They both had only one him on their minds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heaven.\u201d Carrie sighed with relief.</p><p>\u201cBut when I finish with Jason Manning, you and I are going to sit down and have a serious discussion, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Some of the enthusiasm left Carrie\u2019s pretty blue eyes as she nodded reluctantly.</p><p>Charlotte would\u2019ve preferred to delay the apology, but the longer she put it off, the more difficult it would become.</p><p>Her steps were hesitant as she approached Jason\u2019s apartment. For some reason, she chose to knock instead of pressing the doorbell.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer right away, she assumed, gratefully, that she\u2019d been given a reprieve. Yet, at the same time, she hated letting the situation fester overnight. With reinforced determination, she knocked again.</p><p>\u201cHold your horses,\u201d Jason shouted from the other side of the door.</p><p>Charlotte took one step in retreat, squared her shoulders and drew in a deep breath. He opened the door. He looked preoccupied and revealed no emotion when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, hating how shaky she sounded. She paused long enough to clear her throat. \u201cWould it be okay if I came inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He stepped aside to let her into his apartment. One glance told her he wasn\u2019t much of a housekeeper. A week\u2019s worth of newspapers were scattered across the carpet. Dirty dishes, presumably from his dinner, sat on the coffee table, along with the remote control, which he picked up. The TV was instantly muted. He walked over to the recliner and removed a pile of clothes, probably things he\u2019d recently taken from the dryer.</p><p>\u201cYou can sit here,\u201d he said, indicating the recliner, his arms full of clothes.</p><p>Charlotte smiled and sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...sure.\u201d She didn\u2019t normally drink much, but if there was ever a time she needed to fortify her courage, it was now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her response seemed to surprise him. It certainly surprised her. He went into the kitchen, returning a moment later with a bottle and a glass. Apparently he found something he didn\u2019t like in the glass because he grabbed a dish towel from the stack of clothes he\u2019d dumped on the floor and used it to rub the inside. When he\u2019d finished, he raised the glass to the light for inspection.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I prefer to drink my beer from the bottle.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then sat down across from her, leaning back and resting his ankle on his knee. He seemed completely relaxed, as well he should. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d have to plead temporary insanity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about what happened earlier,\u201d she began, gripping the beer bottle with both hands. \u201cI talked to Carrie and discovered you hadn\u2019t exactly, uh, fallen in with her scheme. I\u2019m afraid I assumed you had.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was a simple misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Nevertheless...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll place an ad in the paper for the apartment tomorrow. Would it be okay if I started showing it right away?\u201d</p><p>So, he was going to make this difficult after all. \u201cThat\u2019s another reason I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed your mind about moving?\u201d he asked conversationally, his gaze slipping from her to the television screen and back. Charlotte, however, wasn\u2019t fooled. Like any other man, he would enjoy watching her squirm.</p> <p>His eyes wandered back to the silent TV. He made a fist, then jerked his elbow back in a gesture of satisfaction. Obviously things were going well for whichever team he was rooting for\u2014much better than they were for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to move...Carrie and I like living where we do. The area suits us and, well...to be honest, I spoke in anger.\u201d This was all she was willing to give. If he was vindictive enough to demand she vacate the apartment, then so be it. She wasn\u2019t going to beg.</p><p>\u201cFine, then.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re a good tenant and I\u2019d hate to lose you.\u201d His gaze didn\u2019t waver from the television.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s playing?\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised by her question, as though she should know something so elementary. \u201cThe Lakers and the Denver Nuggets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and turn up the sound if you want.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I interrupted your game. If I\u2019d known you were watching it, I would\u2019ve waited until it was over.\u201d She took a swig of beer so he\u2019d realize she intended to be on her way shortly.</p><p>He reached for the remote control with an eagerness he didn\u2019t bother to disguise. He pushed the volume button, dropped his leg and scooted forward, immediately absorbed in the game.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t know that much about sports. Generally they bored her, but perhaps that was because she didn\u2019t understand the rules. No one had ever taken the time to explain them to her. Football seemed absolutely senseless, and basketball hardly less so.</p><p>As far as she could tell, basketball involved a herd of impossibly tall men racing up and down a polished wooden floor, passing a ball back and forth until one of them forged ahead to the basket to try to score. It seemed that whenever the contest became interesting, the referees would blow their whistles and everything would come to a grinding halt. She couldn\u2019t understand why the referees chose to wear zebra-striped shirts, either, since it wasn\u2019t likely anyone would confuse the short, balding men with the players.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d That was innocuous enough, she decided. Such a simple question wouldn\u2019t reveal the extent of her ignorance.</p><p>\u201cFor now, the Lakers. They\u2019re up by four, but the lead\u2019s been changing the entire game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She watched for several minutes, then asked what she considered to be another harmless question. \u201cWhy do some throws count for three points and others only two?\u201d</p> <p>The thoroughness of his response astonished her, prompting several more questions. By the time he\u2019d answered them all, he must\u2019ve been aware that she barely knew one end of the court from the other. But if he was shocked by her lack of knowledge, he didn\u2019t let it show.</p><p>Soon Charlotte found herself actually enjoying the game. Now that it made a bit more sense, she began to understand why Jason liked it so much. The score was tied a minute before halftime and when the Lakers scored at the buzzer to take the lead, Charlotte leapt to her feet and cheered.</p><p>Jason raised his eyebrows at her display of enthusiasm, which made Charlotte all the more self-conscious. Slowly she lowered herself back into the chair. \u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I just didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d be the type to appreciate sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally I\u2019m not. This is the first time I\u2019ve had any idea what was going on.\u201d</p><p>A patronizing smile flashed in and out of his eyes. But that one instant was enough. Charlotte recognized the look; she\u2019d seen other men wear the same expression. Men seemed to assume that because they could change their own oil and hook up a TV by themselves, they were naturally superior to women. Charlotte had run into that attitude most of her life.</p><p>Since it was her duty to defend womankind, and because she\u2019d been fortified with a beer, Charlotte jumped to her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t get haughty with me, Jason Manning!\u201d she said.</p><p>Trying to recover her dignity, she sat back down, tucking one leg beneath her. \u201cYou think just because you happen to know a few sports rules, men are superior to women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he returned wholeheartedly, without the least bit of reservation.</p><p>Charlotte laughed. \u201cAt least you\u2019re honest. I\u2019m sick of men who pay lip service to women, then go into the men\u2019s room and snicker behind our backs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honest to a fault,\u201d Jason agreed. \u201cI\u2019m willing to snicker right in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t find that much of a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, admit it. Men are superior, and if you haven\u2019t owned up to it by now, you should. Don\u2019t forget, God created us first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d Charlotte said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right. If you can, name one thing a woman does better than a man, other than having babies, which is a given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll improve on that. I\u2019ll name...several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral? You won\u2019t be able to come up with one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Charlotte said, accepting his challenge. \u201cWomen are more sensitive than men. Really,\u201d she added when he snorted in response.</p><p>\u201cSure, you cry in movies. That negates your whole argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about crying.\u201d She frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m referring to feelings! Women aren\u2019t afraid to face their feelings. Men are so terrified of emotion they hold it inside until they\u2019re totally bent out of shape.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed, although grudgingly. \u201cI suppose you think women are smarter than men, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re about even in that department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged, as though he suspected she\u2019d depleted her list.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing. Women are better at multitasking than men. We\u2019re used to juggling all kinds of responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>Jason snickered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she returned. \u201cIf you think about it, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s true. Women are expected to help support the family financially. Not only that, we\u2019re also expected to assume the role of emotional caretaker. Responsibility for the family falls on the woman\u2019s shoulders, not the man\u2019s. Have you ever noticed how rarely men put the needs of others before their own?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Needs,\u2019\u201d Jason echoed. \u201cGood grief, what\u2019s that? Some pop-psych buzzword.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte ignored him. \u201cFrankly, I feel sorry for you guys. You\u2019ve been allowed to remain children most of your lives. You\u2019ve never been given the chance to grow up.\u201d</p><p>Jason looked as though he wanted to argue with her, but couldn\u2019t come up with an adequate rebuttal.</p><p>\u201cWomen handle pain better than men, too.\u201d Charlotte was on a roll. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a bigger baby in my life than a man who\u2019s got a minor case of the flu. Most of them act as though we should call in the World Health Organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to drag the horrors of giving birth into this now\u2014which, I\u2019ll remind you, is completely unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to. Men have a hard time just dealing with a simple cold. If God had left procreation up to the male of the species, humanity would\u2019ve died out with Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three,\u201d Jason muttered ungraciously. \u201cThree is not several. Three is a few.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, but you\u2019re too proud to admit it, which is something else a woman\u2019s more capable of doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Standing on one leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, admitting she\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t get me started on that one. It happens to be a personal peeve of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the others weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. I was just listing a few of the more obvious facts, waiting for you to come up with even one logical defense\u2014which you failed to do.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem willing to agree, but it was apparent from the smile he ineffectively struggled to hide that he was aware of his dilemma. He had no option, no argument.</p><p>\u201cYou realize you\u2019ve backed me into a corner, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t have any choice but to agree with you, otherwise you\u2019ll brand me as being smug and insensitive, unaware of my feelings and too childish to accept the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d If anyone was wearing a smug look, it was Charlotte. She felt triumphant, better than she had all day. All week. Come to think of it, she couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d enjoyed herself more.</p><p>Conceding defeat, Jason moved into the kitchen and returned with a second cold beer for each of them. Charlotte hesitated. She\u2019d never intended to stay this long, and Carrie might be concerned. After all the lectures she\u2019d delivered about being gone longer than expected, Charlotte felt she should go home now. But, to her amazement, she discovered she didn\u2019t want to leave. Watching the rest of the Lakers game with Jason appealed to her a lot more.</p><p>\u201cThanks, anyway, but I should get back to Carrie,\u201d she said.</p><p>Although she smiled brightly, some of her reluctance must have shown because Jason said, \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed much longer than I\u2019d planned to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the game\u2019s only half over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call her?\u201d Jason suggested, pointing toward the counter where he kept his phone.</p><p>It seemed like a reasonable idea. Charlotte smiled and headed for the kitchen. She punched out her number and waited. Carrie answered on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Mom,\u201d she said in an unconcerned voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m watching the Lakers game with Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019re not going to move, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jason was kind enough to let me withdraw my two-weeks\u2019 notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s a great guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Charlotte was surprised by how much she meant it. Jason was a great guy. She hadn\u2019t stumbled on many in the past few\u2014or was that several?\u2014years. It was a treat to encounter a man who was candid, sincere and fun. But Charlotte had been fooled by men before, so she wasn\u2019t taking anything for granted.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jason asked when she replaced the receiver.</p><p>If she needed an excuse, he was handing her one on a platter. All she needed to do was make some vague reply about Carrie and she\u2019d be on her way.</p><p>\u201cCarrie says she\u2019ll call if she needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p> <p>His smile was definitely charming, Charlotte decided.</p><p>\u201cHow about some popcorn?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Charlotte nodded eagerly. She hadn\u2019t eaten much dinner, unnerved as she was by her discovery, knowing she\u2019d need to confront him. Jason\u2019s offhand acceptance of her apology endeared him to her even more. If Jason was like her boss, he\u2019d have flayed her alive. Instead, he\u2019d just shrugged it off and given her a beer.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d she said, following him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to do,\u201d he said, opening his microwave and tossing a bag inside. He set the timer, pushed a button and within a minute the sound of popping kernels filled the kitchen. The smell was heavenly.</p><p>When it was ready, Jason poured the popcorn into a large bowl and carried it out to the living room. Charlotte brought paper towels, since she couldn\u2019t find any napkins.</p> <p>He placed the bowl in the middle of the coffee table and Charlotte joined him on the sofa. The game was about to resume. She tucked her feet beneath her as she\u2019d done earlier, leaning forward now and then to scoop up some popcorn. It tasted wonderful, but that might\u2019ve been because of the company. Or the fact that for the first time all day, she was feeling relaxed.</p><p>The Lakers scored twelve straight points and Charlotte rose to her knees, cheering loudly. Normally she was far more reserved, more in control of her emotions. It was as if someone else had taken charge of her mind. Someone more free-spirited and uninhibited. Someone who\u2019d downed two beers on a near-empty stomach. Apparently, hearing that her daughter was bribing men to date her had that kind of effect on her.</p><p>Jason cheered, too, and they turned to smile at each other. Their eyes met and held for the longest time. Flustered and unnerved, Charlotte was the first to glance away.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t shared such an intense look with a man since college. A look that said, I\u2019m enjoying myself. I\u2019m attracted to you. I\u2019d like to get to know you better...a whole lot better.</p><p>Her heart was thumping as she forced her attention back to the TV. She took a deep swallow of beer to hide her discomfort.</p><p>Jason went strangely quiet afterward, too. They both made a pretense of being involved in the game. As time went on, however, it wasn\u2019t the Lakers who held their attention\u2014it was each other.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jason said abruptly, \u201cwhere do you work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowntown, for a large insurance agency. You might\u2019ve heard of them. Davidson and Krier. They have a radio commercial that\u2019s played a lot.\u201d In an effort, weak though it was, to disguise her uneasiness, she sang the all-too-familiar jingle.</p> <p>\u201cI have heard of them,\u201d Jason said, nodding. His rich baritone concluded the song.</p><p>They laughed self-consciously. Charlotte wished she\u2019d had the sense to leave at halftime. No, she amended silently, that wasn\u2019t true. She was glad she\u2019d stayed. If she regretted anything, it was that she was so clumsy when it came to dealing with male-female relationships.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t so strange that Carrie had tried to bribe someone to ask her on a date. Charlotte hadn\u2019t been out with a man in three years. But she hadn\u2019t really missed the dating scene. How could she miss something she\u2019d never actually experienced? She\u2019d hardly dated at all since Tom left.</p><p>Tom. The accustomed pain she felt whenever she thought of her ex-husband followed on the heels of the unexpected attraction she felt toward Jason. The two didn\u2019t mix well. One brought back the pain of the past and reminded her that she had no future. The other tempted her to believe she did.</p><p>\u201cI should be going,\u201d she announced suddenly, her decision made. She scurried to her feet as if she had a pressing appointment.</p><p>\u201cThe game\u2019s not over,\u201d Jason said, frowning. He didn\u2019t move for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch the rest of it at my place. Thanks so much for the wonderful evening. I enjoyed myself. Really, I did.\u201d She picked up the empty popcorn bowl and the two beer bottles and took them into the kitchen.</p><p>Jason trailed her, his hands buried deep in his pockets. He nodded at his garbage can, which was overflowing. There was a semicircle of half-filled bags stacked around it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to take this out to the Dumpster,\u201d he explained, removing the bottles from her hands and throwing them into a plastic recycling bin.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate how understanding you\u2019ve been,\u201d Charlotte said as she walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCarrie and me and...everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said a few steps behind. He slipped in front of her and stood by the door.</p><p>Charlotte knew she was running away like a frightened rabbit. The trapped feeling had returned and it terrified her as it always had. She\u2019d thought it would be different this time, but that had been the beer. Her fears would never change, never go away. They\u2019d always be there to remind her of her shortcomings, how inadequate she was, how no man could ever be trusted. Tom had proved that. She was anxious to be on her way now, but Jason was blocking her only means of escape.</p><p>When she glanced up, some of the fear must have shown in her eyes because he hesitated, studying her.</p><p>There was a short silence, too deep to last long, but too intense to ignore. Charlotte held his gaze for as long as she dared before looking away. His eyes were so blue, so serious, so filled with questions. She\u2019d perplexed him, she knew, but she couldn\u2019t explain. Wouldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>They\u2019d laughed and teased and joked. But Jason was somber now. Funny, this mood was as appealing as the lightheartedness she\u2019d sensed in him earlier. His mouth, even when he wasn\u2019t smiling, was perfectly shaped. Everything about him was perfect. His high cheekbones, his wide brow and straight nose. Too perfect for her.</p><p>The paralyzing regret threatened to explode within her, but Charlotte managed to keep it in check. How, she wasn\u2019t sure. It must\u2019ve been her fear, she decided. Fear of what could happen, the happiness a relationship with him could bring\u2014and the disappointment that would inevitably come afterward. The disappointment he\u2019d feel in her. Then it would be over almost before it had begun.</p><p>She looked up one last time, to say goodbye, to thank him, to escape.</p><p>In that instant she knew Jason was going to kiss her. But one word, the least bit of resistance, and he wouldn\u2019t go through with it. Charlotte was completely confident of that.</p><p>Need and curiosity overcame the anxiety, and she watched, mesmerized, as his mouth descended toward her own. His lips, so warm and seductive, barely touched hers.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes, trembling and afraid. Her body, seemingly of its own accord, moved toward him, turning into his, seeking the security and the strength she felt in him.</p><p>He moaned softly and Charlotte did, too, slanting her head to one side, inviting him to deepen the kiss.</p><p>Yet Jason held back. The kiss was light. Sweet. More seductive than anything she\u2019d ever known. It felt wonderful. So wonderful...</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t understand why he resisted kissing her completely, the way her body was begging him to. Restraining himself demanded obvious effort. She could tell by the rigid way he held himself, the way his hands curved over her shoulders, keeping her at bay. Keeping himself at bay.</p><p>Her head was full of the promise his lips had made and hadn\u2019t kept. Full of the possibilities. Full of the surprise and the wonder. She\u2019d never felt like this before.</p><p>Once again his mouth brushed over hers, warm and exciting. Moving slowly\u2014so slowly\u2014and so easy, as though he had all the time in the world.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d It was a battle for her to breathe. Her heart sounded like a frantic drumbeat in her ears, drowning out coherent thought.</p><p>He tensed, then kissed her, really kissed her, wrapping himself around her, absorbing her in his size, his strength, his need.</p><p>They remained entwined, arms around each other, until Charlotte could no longer stand. She broke away and buried her head in his shoulder, her breathing heavy.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d It was the truth; any fear she felt had nothing to do with him. \u201cI have to go...Thank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>But most of all for that kiss, she added silently. It was unlikely he\u2019d ever know how much that single kiss had meant to her.</p><p>Three</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her. He\u2019d actually kissed Charlotte. An hour later, Jason still had trouble taking it in.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d kissed plenty of women in his day. But this time, with this woman, it was different. He didn\u2019t know how he understood that, but he did. He\u2019d realized it long before he\u2019d touched her. Perhaps because she was so different from what he\u2019d assumed. He\u2019d figured she was dignified, straitlaced, unapproachable. Then, as soon as he\u2019d told her about basketball rules, she\u2019d kicked off her shoes and was cheering as enthusiastically as he was himself. What a contrast he found in her. Prim and proper on the outside, a hellion waiting to break loose on the inside.</p><p>She intrigued him. Beguiled him.</p><p>At some point during their evening together\u2014exactly when, he couldn\u2019t be sure\u2014he\u2019d felt an unfamiliar tug, a stirring deep within. The feeling hadn\u2019t gone away. If anything, it had intensified.</p><p>What they\u2019d shared wasn\u2019t any ordinary kiss, either. Perhaps that explained it. They\u2019d communicated on an entirely different level, one he\u2019d never known before. It seemed their spirits\u2014the deepest, innermost part of themselves\u2014had somehow touched. He shook his head. He was getting fanciful.</p><p>No, this wasn\u2019t the kind of kiss he\u2019d had with any other woman. He\u2019d never gone so slowly, been so careful. Although she\u2019d acted blatantly provocative, urging him to deepen the contact, he\u2019d resisted. That same inner voice that had said Charlotte was different had also warned him to proceed with caution. He\u2019d sensed how fragile she was, and the urge to protect her, even from himself, had been overwhelming.</p><p>Jason wasn\u2019t generally so philosophical. He didn\u2019t waste time deliberating on relationships or motivations. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking right now. His reaction to Charlotte was unwarranted\u2014wasn\u2019t it? Although it\u2019d been a nice kiss, it wasn\u2019t so spectacular that his whole world should be turned upside down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet it was\u2014flipped over completely.</p><p>Jason felt almost giddy with sensation. These feelings weren\u2019t logical. It was as if God had decided to play a world-class trick on him.</p><p>Jason considered himself too old for romance. He didn\u2019t even know what romance was. Pure foolishness, he thought sarcastically. It was one of the primary reasons he\u2019d never married, and never intended to. He wasn\u2019t a romantic kind of guy. A pizza and cold beer while watching a football game interested him far more than staring across a candlelit table at some woman and pretending to be overwhelmed by her beauty. Flattery and small talk weren\u2019t for him.</p><p>And yet...he remembered how good Charlotte\u2019s arms had felt around his neck. She\u2019d held her body so tightly against his that he could feel her heart beat. It was a closeness that had transcended the physical.</p> <p>By the time she\u2019d left, Jason felt heady, as if he\u2019d had too much to drink. He didn\u2019t understand her rush, either. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to leave and had tried to come up with a reason for her to stay. Any reason. But she\u2019d quietly slipped out of his arms and left before he could think of a way to keep her there. If he was witty and romantic he might\u2019ve thought of something. But he wasn\u2019t, so he\u2019d been forced to let her go.</p><p>Jason started pacing, the Lakers game forgotten. He needed to clear the cobwebs from his head. He wasn\u2019t any good at analyzing situations like this. All he knew was that he\u2019d enjoyed holding Charlotte in his arms, enjoyed kissing her, and he looked forward to doing it again.</p><p>He sank down in front of the television, surprised to find the basketball game already over. Stunned, he stared at the credits rolling down the screen. He didn\u2019t even know who won. He waited, hoping the camera would scan the scoreboard, but it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>He had a bet riding on the outcome of the game. Nothing major, just a friendly wager between brothers. Nevertheless, high stakes or low, it wasn\u2019t like Jason Manning to be caught without a final score.</p><p>The phone rang and Jason hurried to the kitchen to answer it.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said absently, keeping his eye on the television, still hoping to learn the final outcome.</p><p>\u201cI knew I never should\u2019ve picked the Nuggets,\u201d Rich muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the Lakers won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy eight points. Where have you been all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Jason returned defensively. \u201cI had company. A tenant stopped in to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring a play-off game, and you didn\u2019t get rid of them?\u201d</p> <p>Actually Jason hadn\u2019t intended to tell his brother even that much, but Rich had a point. Jason wasn\u2019t one to sit around and shoot the breeze when he could be watching a game. Any kind of game.</p><p>\u201cIt was business,\u201d he explained, unnecessarily annoyed. He felt mildly guilty for stretching the truth. Charlotte\u2019s original intent had been to apologize and tell him she\u2019d changed her mind about moving. That was business. Staying the better part of two hours wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Ignoring Jason\u2019s bad mood, Rich chatted on, replaying the last half of the fourth quarter in which the Lakers had made an \u201camazing\u201d comeback. While his brother was speaking, Jason glanced at the list of his tenants\u2019 phone numbers, which he kept by the phone for easy reference. The way his eyes immediately latched on to Charlotte\u2019s name, anyone might think it had been circled in red. He was so distracted by reading her name over and over in his mind that he missed most of what Rich was telling him.</p><p>When the conversation with his brother ended, Jason couldn\u2019t recall more than a few words of what they\u2019d said. Just enough to regret that he hadn\u2019t been watching the game. Just enough to wish he\u2019d thought of something that would\u2019ve prompted Charlotte to stay.</p><p>Without a second\u2019s deliberation, he reached for his phone and dialed her number. Carrie answered before the first ring had been completed. She must not have recognized his voice, because she got Charlotte without comment.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, feeling gauche. \u201cThe Lakers won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently their kiss hadn\u2019t deranged her the way it had him. She must have gone back to her apartment, plunked herself down and watched the rest of the game, while he\u2019d been walking around in a stupor for the past hour.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Jason began, \u201cabout dinner tomorrow night. That is, if you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d she repeated as if this was a foreign concept. \u201cWhat time?\u201d she asked a moment later.</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>His mood lightened. \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll pick you up then.\u201d He replaced the receiver and glanced around his kitchen, frustrated by how messy it was. He hated housework, hated having to pick up after himself, hated the everyday chores that made life so mundane. Every dish he owned was dirty, except the ones in his dishwasher, which were clean. It didn\u2019t make sense to reload it while there were clean dishes he could use in there.</p><p>Needing something to occupy his mind, he tackled the task of cleaning up the kitchen with unprecedented enthusiasm.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eagerness to see Charlotte again had waned by the following afternoon. A good night\u2019s sleep and a day at the clinic had sufficiently straightened out his brain. He\u2019d behaved in a manner that was completely out of character. He couldn\u2019t even begin to figure out why.</p><p>Charlotte was a woman. There wasn\u2019t anything special about her. No reason he should be falling all over himself for the opportunity to take her out. He\u2019d missed the last half of an important basketball game because his thoughts had become so tangled up with her. That would\u2019ve been devotion enough for any woman in his life\u2014only she wasn\u2019t in his life, and he intended to keep it that way.</p><p>Furthermore, Jason wasn\u2019t that keen on Charlotte\u2019s teenage daughter thinking he\u2019d fallen in with her scheme. He could see it now. Carrie would give him a brilliant smile and a high-five when he arrived. The girl was bound to believe she was responsible for Jason asking Charlotte out. She might even try to slip him some of the money she\u2019d offered him earlier. The whole thing had the potential for disaster written all over it.</p><p>If a convenient excuse to cancel this date had presented itself, Jason would\u2019ve grabbed it with both hands.</p><p>The way his luck was going, they\u2019d probably run into his parents, and his mother would start hounding him again about getting married. He\u2019d never understood why women considered marriage so important. Frustrated, he\u2019d asked his mother once, and her answer had confused him even more. She\u2019d looked at him serenely without interrupting the task that occupied her hands and had casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a partner.\u201d</p><p>A partner! She\u2019d made it sound like he needed a wife in order to compete in a mixed bowling league.</p><p>His parents weren\u2019t exactly throwing potential mates his way, but they\u2019d let it be known that they were hoping he\u2019d get married sometime soon. Jason, however, was intelligent enough not to become involved in a lifetime relationship just to satisfy his parents\u2019 wishes.</p><p>Whatever craziness had prompted him to ask Charlotte out to dinner had passed during the night. He\u2019d awakened sane and in command of his usual common sense.</p><p>As the day went on he found himself actually dreading the date. The two of them had absolutely nothing in common. He\u2019d go through with this, Jason decided grimly, because he was a man of his word. Since he told her he\u2019d be there by six, he would be, but snow would fall at the equator before he gave in to an impulse like this again.</p><p>She was dressed completely wrong, Charlotte realized as soon as Jason arrived. Not knowing what to wear, she\u2019d chosen a navy blue suit, not unlike the one she\u2019d worn to the office. She\u2019d attempted to dress it up a bit with a bright turquoise-and-pink scarf and a quarter-size silver pin of a colorful toucan. Jason arrived in jeans, sweatshirt and a baseball cap with a University of Washington Huskies logo on it.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, forcing herself to smile. A hundred times in the last hour she\u2019d regretted ever agreeing to this date. Jason had caught her off guard when he\u2019d phoned. She hadn\u2019t known what to say. Hadn\u2019t had time to think of an excuse.</p><p>Now she was stuck, but judging by his expression, Jason didn\u2019t seem any more pleased than she was. He frowned at her until she was so self-conscious, she suggested changing clothes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he muttered, tucking the tips of his fingers into his back pockets. They definitely made a pair. He\u2019d dressed like someone visiting the amusement park, and she looked like a student of Emily Post.</p><p>Charlotte was grateful that Carrie had gone to the library with a friend. The other mom was picking them up, but it would give Charlotte a convenient excuse to hurry home.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to eat?\u201d Jason asked once they were outside the apartment.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexican food?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Especially since there was a restaurant close by. \u201cHow about Mr. Tamales on Old Military Road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he agreed easily enough. He was probably thinking the same thing she was. The sooner they got there, the sooner they\u2019d be finished and could go back to their respective lives instead of dabbling in this nonsense.</p><p>For the short time they were together, Charlotte figured she might as well enjoy herself. The restaurant was little more than a greasy spoon, but the food had earned its excellent reputation.</p><p>The place apparently did a brisk business on week-nights because there was only one spot available.</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought we\u2019d need reservations,\u201d Jason said, looking as surprised as Charlotte.</p><p>The hostess, wearing an off-the-shoulder peasant blouse and black skirt, smiled and escorted them to the booth. The waitress followed close behind. She handed them each a menu shaped like a cactus and then brought water, tortilla chips and salsa. Charlotte read over the choices, made her selection and scooped up a jalape\u00f1o pepper with a chip.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to eat that, are you?\u201d Jason asked, staring at her as if she\u2019d pulled the pin activating a grenade.</p><p>Charlotte grinned. \u201cOh, that\u2019s another thing I forgot to mention last night\u2014women can eat chili peppers better than a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time, sweetheart. I was weaned on hot peppers.\u201d He took one, poising it in front of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>They bit into the peppers simultaneously. The seeds and juice dribbled down Charlotte\u2019s chin and she grabbed a paper napkin, dabbing it against her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d Jason said, obviously impressed.</p><p>\u201cI never kid.\u201d A five-alarm fire was blazing in her mouth, but she smiled and reached casually for another chip and some water. The water intensified the burning, but she smiled cheerfully as though nothing was wrong.</p><p>\u201cRich and I used to eat these peppers right out of Dad\u2019s garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it Rich is your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of five,\u201d Jason went on to explain, and she noted that his eyes brightened with pride. \u201cPaul\u2019s the oldest, then there\u2019s me, followed by Rich. My sisters, Taylor and Christy, round out the family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre any of them married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone but me. I\u2019m beginning to lose track of how many nieces and nephews I\u2019ve got now, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lull yet.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had never had much of a family. Her father had deserted her and her mother when Charlotte was too young to remember him. Then her mother had died just about the time Charlotte graduated from high school. The insurance money was set up to cover her college expenses. Only the money hadn\u2019t been used for her. Instead, Tom had been educated on her inheritance; he\u2019d robbed her of even that.</p><p>Charlotte lowered her gaze. It hurt too much to think about Tom and that bleak period of her life when she\u2019d been so lost and vulnerable. So alone, with no family. Her ex-husband had used her and when he\u2019d finished, he\u2019d thrown her aside.</p> <p>All the time she was growing up, Charlotte had dreamed about being part of a large, loving family. How she envied Jason his brothers and sisters.</p><p>\u201cThe story of my family tree is less about the roots,\u201d he said, grinning as he spoke, \u201cthan the sap.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s laugh was spontaneous. She picked up her water, warmed by his wit and his willingness to laugh at himself. \u201cI was an only child. I promised myself I\u2019d have a houseful of kids when I got married so my children wouldn\u2019t grow up lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely,\u201d Jason echoed. \u201cI would have given anything for some peace and quiet. The girls were the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I guessed you\u2019d complain about the women in your family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but I really miss Taylor and Christy. They\u2019re both living in Montana now, raising their families. We get together when we can, which isn\u2019t nearly often enough. It\u2019s been over a year since we saw each other.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came for their order. Charlotte asked for the specialty salad, which consisted of beans, rice, cheese, shredded chicken, lettuce and slices of tomato and jalape\u00f1o peppers. Jason chose the chicken enchiladas.</p><p>\u201cDo your brothers live in the Seattle area?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cPaul\u2019s a journalist and Rich works as an engineer for Boeing. We see each other frequently.\u201d</p><p>Their orders arrived and they chatted amicably over their meal. Jason sampled her salad and fed her a bite of his enchiladas; both were delicious. Soon they\u2019d asked the waitress for two additional plates and were unabashedly sharing their meals.</p><p>It was only seven-thirty when they\u2019d finished, even though they lingered over coffee. Charlotte couldn\u2019t remember time passing more quickly.</p> <p>All day she\u2019d been worried about this dinner\u2014and for nothing. She\u2019d enjoyed herself even more than she\u2019d hoped, but that was easy to do with Jason. He didn\u2019t put on airs or pretend to be something he wasn\u2019t. Nor did he feign agreement with her; their differing opinions meant a free and interesting exchange of ideas.</p><p>\u201cI should be heading home,\u201d Charlotte said, although she could happily have sat there talking. They weren\u2019t at a loss for topics, but the restaurant was busy and Carrie would be home soon.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose we should go,\u201d he said reluctantly, standing. He left a generous tip and took the tab up to the counter.</p><p>After talking nonstop for nearly an hour, both were strangely quiet on the drive home. Charlotte had been determined to enjoy herself from the start, but she\u2019d expected to make the best of a bad situation. Instead she\u2019d had a wonderful time.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known how starved she was for adult companionship, hadn\u2019t realized how empty she\u2019d felt inside, how deep the void had become.</p><p>As they neared the apartment complex, she realized one more thing. She didn\u2019t want this evening to end.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in for coffee?\u201d she asked as he parked his car. For half the ride home, Charlotte had been engaging in a silent debate. She was sure that if Carrie was home, she\u2019d make a big deal about Jason\u2019s presence. But Charlotte would get the third degree from her daughter anyway, so she decided it didn\u2019t matter if Jason came in.</p><p>\u201cI could use another cup of coffee,\u201d Jason told her, although they\u2019d both had large mugs at the restaurant.</p> <p>As luck would have it, Carrie wasn\u2019t home yet. Charlotte had been counting on her teenage daughter to act as a buffer between her and Jason. She half suspected Jason was thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s at the library with a friend,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be back any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered what she was up to tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put on the coffee,\u201d she said self-consciously, going directly to the kitchen. \u201cMake yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>While she scooped up the grounds and poured water into the pot, she saw that Jason had lowered himself onto her sofa. He reached for a magazine and flipped through the pages, then set it back and reached for another. Since it was upside down, his attention was clearly elsewhere. He noted his mistake, righted the magazine, then placed it with the others. Apparently Seventeen magazine didn\u2019t interest him after all.</p><p>There was no reason for him to be so nervous. It was funny; they\u2019d chatted like old friends at the restaurant, but the instant they were alone, they became uncomfortable with each other.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like some cookies,\u201d she said, as she carried the tray into the living room. She\u2019d baked chocolate chip cookies that weekend, and there were plenty left over.</p><p>Being a single mother left her vulnerable to attacks of guilt\u2014guilt that often led to an abundance of homemade cookies. There were so many things she didn\u2019t know about family, so much she\u2019d missed out on. It bothered her more than she wanted to admit. Whenever Charlotte was feeling anxious or contrite about something, she baked. And with the ninth-grade dance hanging over her head, she\u2019d been doing a lot of baking lately. The cookie jar was full. The freezer was packed, too. Even Carrie was complaining about all the goodies around the house. Too tempting, she said. Her daughter claimed Charlotte was trying to raise her cholesterol and kill her off.</p><p>More guilt, more need to bake cookies. It was a vicious circle.</p><p>\u201cHomemade cookies,\u201d Jason said, sliding forward, far more appreciative than her daughter. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone but my mother baked these days.\u201d He took one and downed it in two bites, nodding vigorously even before he\u2019d finished chewing.</p><p>Charlotte smiled at the unspoken compliment and poured their coffee in plain white china cups. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty more where those came from.\u201d</p><p>Jason helped himself to a second and then a third.</p><p>Charlotte was pleased that he seemed to value her culinary skills. \u201cI guess it\u2019s true, then.\u201d</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she muttered, sorry she\u2019d brought up the subject.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking the way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach, forget it. Others before you have tried that route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral dozen, no doubt,\u201d she teased, amused by his complete lack of modesty. Not to mention his arrogance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suffered my share of feminine wiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeminine wiles,\u201d Charlotte repeated, trying hard not to laugh out loud. He acted as though she was setting a trap for him. She was about to reassure him that she had no intention of remarrying, then decided against it. She\u2019d let him assume whatever he wanted. After all, he was helping her get rid of these cookies before they overran the apartment.</p><p>She did bring up another topic, though, one she couldn\u2019t help being curious about. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married?\u201d She hoped he wouldn\u2019t be offended by her directness; based on their previous conversations she didn\u2019t expect him to be.</p><p>Jason shrugged and swallowed the last bite of the last cookie she\u2019d set out. He seemed to be thinking over his response as he picked up his coffee and relaxed against the back of the sofa. \u201cI learned something recently about the differences between a man and a woman. It\u2019s information that\u2019s served me well.\u201d</p><p>They certainly had a routine going with this subject. \u201cOh, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, all kidding aside,\u201d he said, his blue eyes serious, \u201cwhat is it women want from a man?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte thought about that for a moment. \u201cTo be loved.\u201d</p><p>He nodded approvingly.</p><p>\u201cTo be needed and respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He grinned, clearly pleased by her answer.</p><p>He was making this easy, and Charlotte warmed to her ideas. \u201cA woman longs to be held, of course, but more than that, she wants to be treasured, appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Jason said, smiling benignly. \u201cNow ask me what a man wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, crossing her legs, holding the saucer with one hand, her cup in the other. \u201cWhat is it a man wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTickets to the World Series,\u201d Jason returned without a pause.</p><p>Charlotte nearly choked on her laughter. Fortunately she wasn\u2019t swallowing a sip of coffee at the time. \u201cI see what you mean,\u201d she said after she\u2019d composed herself. \u201cThere does seem to be a basic, shall we say, disconnect here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt was when Rich gave up two tickets for a Seahawks football game that I knew he\u2019d fallen in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d Charlotte said with a sigh, enjoying the romance of it all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all soft on me. It wasn\u2019t like it sounds. He gave the tickets to a friend as a bribe. Rich didn\u2019t want to date Jamie himself, he wanted someone else to fall in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bribed another guy to take her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. He was in love with her himself, but like the rest of us, he\u2019s useless when it comes to romance. I figured it out before he did, and I know next to nothing about that kind of stuff.\u201d Jason grinned. \u201cFrom that point on, it was all downhill for Rich. He\u2019s married and has a couple of kids now. A girl and a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say. That\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was relaxed now. She removed her shoes and propped her feet on the coffee table, crossing her legs at the ankles. \u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d At Jason\u2019s hesitation, she hurried to add, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, if you won\u2019t take offense at my answer\u2014which is, I don\u2019t know. I thought I was once, several years back, but in retrospect I\u2019m not sure. It hurt when we broke up, and I was sorry we hadn\u2019t been able to work things out, but I don\u2019t have any real regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie. She\u2019s married now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t understand where she found the courage, but she reached forward and brushed her index finger down the side of Jason\u2019s face. She wanted to ease the pain she read in his expression, the pain he discounted so casually. A pain she recognized, since she\u2019d walked through this valley herself, with the cold wind of despair howling at her back.</p><p>Jason\u2019s gaze met hers and she felt immersed in a look so warm, so intense, that her breath caught. She couldn\u2019t remember a man ever looking at her that way, as though he wasn\u2019t sure she was even real. As if he was afraid she\u2019d vanish if he touched her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason removed the cup and saucer from her hands and set them on the tray next to the empty plate.</p><p>He was going to kiss her; she realized it in the same moment she owned up to how much she wanted him to. All night she\u2019d been looking forward to having him do exactly this, only she hadn\u2019t been willing to admit it.</p><p>His mouth was gentle and sweet with the taste of coffee and chocolate. He kissed her the way he had the night before, and Charlotte could barely take in the sensation that overwhelmed her. She\u2019d never thought she\u2019d feel anything so profound, so exciting, again. She hadn\u2019t believed she was capable of such a rush of feeling....</p><p>She whimpered and wrapped her arms around his neck, holding on to him in a world that had started to spin out of control. His hands framed her face and he slanted his mouth over hers, answering her need with his own.</p> <p>Jason kissed her again and again.</p><p>The sound coming from the front door barely registered in her passion-drugged brain.</p><p>\u201cMom...Jason...\u201d was followed by a shocked pause, then, \u201cWow, this is great.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte broke away from Jason and leapt to her feet.</p><p>\u201cGee, Mom, there\u2019s no need to get embarrassed. People kiss all the time.\u201d Carrie floated across the carpet, then threw herself into a chair. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, smiling broadly, \u201cis there anything either of you want to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>Carrie shrugged with utter nonchalance. \u201cThat you\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>On his way back to his apartment, Jason had to admit that Charlotte\u2019s daughter possessed a knack for the unexpected. Arriving when she did was only the beginning; introducing the subject of marriage had nearly sent him into hysterics.</p><p>Him married? It was downright laughable.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jason realized Charlotte had brought up the subject herself, wanting to know why he hadn\u2019t married, asking him if he\u2019d ever been in love. Typical women questions.</p> <p>Perhaps mother and daughter were in cahoots, plotting his downfall. No, that was equally laughable.</p><p>Jason simply wasn\u2019t the marrying kind. Not because he was a womanizer or because he had anything against the opposite sex. He liked women...at times, enjoyed being with them...occasionally. Liked kissing them...definitely. But he relished his freedom too much to sacrifice it to commitment and responsibility.</p><p>No, he told himself resolutely, Charlotte wasn\u2019t involved in any scheme to drag him to the altar. She\u2019d been so embarrassed and flustered by Carrie\u2019s suggestion, her face had gone bright red. The woman\u2019s face was too open to hide her feelings. She had chastised Carrie, asked for and received an apology, and looked genuinely grateful when Jason said it was time he left.</p><p>Despite the episode with Carrie, Jason had thoroughly enjoyed his evening with Charlotte. He hadn\u2019t expected to. In fact he\u2019d originally regretted having asked her out, but in the end their date had been a pleasant success.</p><p>Once again he was bewildered by the strong desire he experienced when he kissed her. He had ordained a hands-off policy for the night, but had shelved that idea the minute she\u2019d sat next to him, gazing up at him with those pretty eyes of hers.</p><p>Actually, he\u2019d known he was in trouble when he accepted her invitation to come inside for coffee. He\u2019d thought of it as a challenge; he\u2019d wanted to see how far he could push his determination. Not far, he concluded. When she\u2019d looked at him, her eyes soft and inviting, he was lost. His hands-off policy had quickly become a hands-on experiment.</p><p>There was something about Charlotte Weston that got to him. Really got to him.</p><p>All that outward confidence she worked so hard to display hadn\u2019t fooled him. Beneath a paper-thin veneer, she was vulnerable. Any fool with two functional brain cells would have figured that out on the first date.</p> <p>Only she didn\u2019t date.</p><p>Carrie had told him it\u2019d been years since her mother had even gone out with a man. Undoubtedly she\u2019d been asked\u2014and if she hadn\u2019t been, why not? She was attractive, intelligent and fun. Offhand, he knew a half-dozen men who\u2019d jump at the chance to meet a woman like Charlotte.</p><p>If she\u2019d turned down offers, and surely she had, then there must be a reason. The question that confused Jason was: If she didn\u2019t date, then why had she agreed to have dinner with him?</p><p>Probably the same reason that had goaded him to ask, Jason concluded. The kiss. That infamous first kiss. It had rocked them both. Taken them by surprise, leaving them excited\u2014and unsure.</p><p>As for the other questions that hounded him, Jason didn\u2019t have any answers. Nor did he understand everything that was happening between him and Charlotte. One thing he did know\u2014and it terrified him the most\u2014was that they were, in effect, playing with lighted sticks of dynamite, tossing them back and forth. The attraction between them was that explosive. That dangerous.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s arrival had been more timely than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>All right, Jason was willing to own up, albeit grudgingly, that he was fascinated with Charlotte. He suspected she\u2019d confess to feeling the same thing. To his way of thinking, if they were so strongly attracted to each other, they should both be prepared to do something about it.</p><p>In other words, they should stop fighting the inevitable and make love. That would get it out of their system\u2014he hoped.</p><p>Naw, Jason mused darkly. Charlotte wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who\u2019d indulge in an affair. She might wear only straight, dark business suits to work, but deep down she was the romantic type, which made her impractical. Most women seemed to be. If they were going to make love, they wanted it prettied up with a bunch of flowery words, a declaration of undying love and promises of commitment.</p><p>Well, Charlotte, along with every other woman, could forget that, he told himself. As far as he was concerned, romance and commitment were out of the question.</p><p>What he wanted in this relationship was honesty. If it were up to him, he\u2019d suggest they do away with the formalities, admit what they wanted and then scratch that itch.</p><p>He mulled that over for a few minutes, knowing it was unlikely that Charlotte would see the situation his way. He might not know her well, but Jason readily acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied with so little. Women tended to see lovemaking as more than just the relief of a physical craving.</p><p>Well, he, for one, wasn\u2019t going to play that game. He liked Charlotte\u2014how much he liked her surprised him\u2014but he knew the rules. Either they dropped everything now, while they still could, or they continued driving each other insane. Sooner or later, one of them would have to give in.</p><p>Without a second\u2019s hesitation, Jason knew it would be him.</p><p>Charlotte affected him deep down. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of hurting her or causing her one second of unhappiness. In the end he\u2019d say all the words she wanted to hear, and he\u2019d do the best job he could, because pleasing her would mean so much to him.</p><p>Then he\u2019d get what he wanted; she\u2019d make love to him willingly, with everything in her. He\u2019d give her all he had, too. The problem was\u2014and he knew it was inevitable\u2014that before he\u2019d quite figured out what was happening, they\u2019d be talking about marriage, which was something he hadn\u2019t done since Julie.</p><p>Jason stopped right there. If he started thinking along those lines, everything would change. Soon Charlotte would be organizing his life, straightening up his apartment, making suggestions about little things he could do to improve his sorry lot. Women always saw his lot as sorry. He was happy living the way he was, but women couldn\u2019t accept that. They didn\u2019t believe a man could survive without them constantly fussing over him, dictating his life.</p><p>Bit by bit, Charlotte would dominate his world, eroding his independence until he was like every other married man he\u2019d ever known\u2014willing to change his ways for a wife. Picking up his socks, getting hassled about sports games on TV, the whole deal.</p><p>No, the domesticated life wasn\u2019t for him. Still, Charlotte tempted him more than anyone else had in ages, and he could almost imagine their lives together. Not quite, but almost.</p><p>He stared at his apartment door, wondering how long he\u2019d been standing there mulling over his thoughts. He was light years ahead of himself, he realized. Good grief, he was already trying to finagle his way out of marrying her and they\u2019d only gone out on one date. He\u2019d only kissed her twice.</p><p>But, oh, those kisses...</p><p>Like he\u2019d told himself before, they were playing with explosives, and the best way to avoid getting hurt was to get out now, before they became too involved. Before he lost the strength to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do something?\u201d Carrie demanded.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Charlotte returned calmly, feigning ignorance. She glanced up from her novel, looking over the rims of her reading glasses with practiced innocence.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d Carrie cried. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from him in a whole week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it been that long?\u201d Seven days, two hours and three minutes, but who was counting? Certainly not her.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Carrie insisted, hands on her hips, \u201cyou know how long it\u2019s been. You jump every time the phone rings. You keep making excuses about checking the mail and getting the newspaper. We both know you\u2019re hoping to run into Jason.\u201d</p><p>It hurt Charlotte\u2019s pride to learn she\u2019d been so obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Carrie asked. Her expression said that if she were in charge, this romance would be making far greater progress. Charlotte, however, had no intention of letting her daughter take control of her relationship with Jason Manning.</p><p>\u201cI think Jason\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Charlotte admitted softly. She did like her landlord. Yet, at the same time, she was grateful he hadn\u2019t taken the initiative and contacted her again. If he had, she wasn\u2019t sure how she would\u2019ve responded.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so crazy about him, then do something about it,\u201d Carrie said again.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Even if Charlotte had a drawerful of ideas, she doubted she\u2019d ever find the courage to use any of them. She didn\u2019t know how to chase after a man and had no interest in doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cC\u2019mon, who\u2019s the kid here?\u201d She launched herself onto the cushion beside Charlotte. \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d she asked, looking up at her mother with mournful eyes. \u201cThe two of you seemed to be getting along really well when I walked in last week.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte slid her arm around Carrie\u2019s shoulders. Despite her efforts not to, she grinned, remembering when she, too, had been so wise and confident.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve had something to do with the subject of marriage\u2014which you brought up. He seemed to get a bit green around the gills at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it frightened him off?\u201d Carrie asked anxiously.</p><p>Charlotte shrugged. She\u2019d brought up the subject herself, not quite as directly, but she had mentioned it. If ever there was a born bachelor, she decided, it was Jason Manning. Together, mother and daughter had managed to terrify the man. He must think they were sitting in their apartment ready to ambush him, tie him up and drag him in front of the closest preacher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted anymore. Perhaps she was protecting her ego by convincing herself that she wouldn\u2019t have gone out with Jason if he\u2019d asked again. Perhaps it was just her pride. Charlotte didn\u2019t know because the opportunity hadn\u2019t come up.</p><p>She was embarrassed to admit it, but what Carrie had said about her hanging around the mailbox hoping to accidentally run into Jason was true. But she wasn\u2019t looking for a way to get him to ask her out, she told herself. She only wanted to set things straight. Since they hadn\u2019t met, accidentally or otherwise, Charlotte was content to let it drop. He apparently was, too.</p><p>Jason Manning had been a brief but pleasant interlude in her\u2014she had to acknowledge it\u2014humdrum life.</p><p>She was grateful for their time together. He\u2019d taught her everything she needed to know about basketball. He\u2019d challenged her in a battle of wits about male and female roles in society. Convinced her never again to eat a jalape\u00f1o pepper to prove a point. And most important, he\u2019d kissed her in a way that made her believe, for those few minutes, that she was whole and desirable. It\u2019d felt so good to surrender her fears and her doubts. If nothing else, she\u2019d always be grateful for that.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s waiting to hear from you,\u201d Carrie said next. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to ask him out, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way with adults, sweetie.\u201d Although Charlotte had no idea if that was even true.</p><p>\u201cThen it should. I\u2019m not going to sit home and wait for a man to call me. If I like him, I\u2019ll phone him. It\u2019s ridiculous to be a slave to such an outdated tradition.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte agreed with her daughter, but in this instance she planned to do nothing at all. And that included hovering around the mailboxes.</p><p>It had been a long day, and Jason was tired when he pulled into the parking lot outside his apartment complex. He scanned the limited spaces, looking for Charlotte\u2019s car. The blue PT Cruiser was in the appropriate slot, so he knew she was home.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that he was trying to run into her, but he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her, finding out how she was doing\u2014that sort of thing. He didn\u2019t intend anything more than a wave and maybe a friendly \u201cI\u2019m-fine-how-are-you?\u201d exchange. Then he\u2019d go about his business and she could go about hers.</p><p>Not calling Charlotte was proving to be more difficult than he\u2019d ever expected. He thought about her even more now. He dreamed about her. Just that morning, the alarm had gone off and he was lying there in bed, trying to force himself to get up, when Charlotte casually sauntered into his mind. He couldn\u2019t help thinking how good it would feel to have her there beside him, how soft her body would feel next to his. He\u2019d banished the thought immediately, angry about indulging in such a fantasy.</p><p>It had started the night before. When he\u2019d arrived home from work, he\u2019d found himself checking out the rear tire of Charlotte\u2019s car. From a distance it looked like it might be low on air. On closer examination, he realized it wasn\u2019t. He felt almost disappointed not to have an excuse to speak to her.</p><p>This evening he could tell from a distance that there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her tires. Once again he wished there was, so he could talk to her.</p><p>Inside his apartment, he reached for the remote control and automatically turned on the television. The six-thirty news crew made for excellent company.</p><p>As the forecaster gave dire warnings about the weather, Jason checked out the meager contents of his refrigerator. One of these days he\u2019d have to break down and buy groceries.</p> <p>As he suspected, nothing interesting presented itself, at least nothing he\u2019d seriously consider eating. An empty cardboard carton from a six-pack of beer. A can of half-eaten pork and beans. A leftover taco, probably harder than cement, wrapped in a napkin, and a jar of green olives. He opened the jar, stuck his hand inside and fished out the last two, returning the container of liquid to the shelf. Chewing on the olives, he closed the door.</p><p>What he was really in the mood for was\u2014he hated to admit it. What he\u2019d really like was chocolate chip cookies. Well, he could forget that. The store-bought ones tasted like lumpy paste, and his mother would keep him on the phone with an endless list of questions if he were to call her and request a batch. Besides, it wasn\u2019t his mother\u2019s recipe he craved. It was Charlotte\u2019s.</p><p>Well, you can forget that, ol\u2019boy.</p><p>A box of macaroni and cheese was the most interesting prospect his cupboard had to offer. He took it out and checked the freezer compartment of the refrigerator and brought out two frozen wieners wrapped in aluminum foil.</p><p>He was adding water to a pan when there was a frantic knocking on his door. Whoever it was pounded again before he had time to cross the apartment.</p><p>He saw Charlotte, pale and stricken, her lavender cardigan covered in blood. Her eyes were panicky. \u201cA dog...someone ran over a dog...they didn\u2019t even stop. Please...can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He kept a black bag at the house for just such emergencies. He grabbed that and hurried after her.</p><p>Charlotte was waiting for him, her eyes bright with tears. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou moved him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to get him out of the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see it happen?\u201d he asked, trotting along behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I heard tires screech and a yelp, and that was it. By the time I got outside, a few kids had gathered around, but no one knew what to do.\u201d</p><p>Her pace slowed as they approached the injured animal. A group of neighborhood children had gathered around. Jason knelt beside the small, black dog. He was a mixed breed, mostly spaniel, Jason guessed. He was badly hurt and in shock. Probably a stray, since he wasn\u2019t wearing a collar, and the poor thing looked mangy and thin.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know who he belongs to?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he belongs to anyone,\u201d a boy on a bicycle answered. \u201cHe\u2019s been around the last couple of days. I never saw him before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take him to my office,\u201d Jason said after a preliminary examination. He didn\u2019t feel too positive about the dog\u2019s chances.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to live?\u201d Charlotte alone voiced the question, but she seemed to be the spokesperson for the small gathering\u2014each one wanted, indeed needed, to know. The children and Charlotte stared down at Jason, waiting for his response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Jason answered honestly. \u201cHe\u2019s got a broken leg and internal injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for his medical expenses,\u201d Charlotte offered, using her index finger to wipe a tear from her eye.</p><p>Jason wasn\u2019t even thinking about the expenses. Frankly, he didn\u2019t think the dog would last the night. \u201cGive me your sweater,\u201d he told Charlotte. Since it was already stained with blood, he figured they\u2019d save time by using it to transport the injured dog.</p><p>She did as he asked, and he spread it out on the pavement, then placed the wounded dog on it. Jason carefully lifted him, using the sweater sleeves, and walked toward his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Charlotte said, while Jason placed the now-unconscious dog in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis could take some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Carrie came running up to the car. The girl had tears in her eyes, too. Mother and daughter briefly hugged before Carrie stepped away. She looked so mournful it was all Jason could do not to stop and reassure her. But he had no reassurances to offer.</p><p>His veterinary clinic was only a few blocks from the apartment complex. Charlotte followed him in. He set the injured dog on the stainless-steel examination table and turned on the lights above it. Charlotte\u2019s sweater was soaked with blood beyond the point of salvaging it, but she didn\u2019t seem concerned.</p><p>Jason examined the dog\u2019s injuries and it was as he\u2019d feared: surgery would be required.</p><p>He told Charlotte and she nodded bravely. \u201cCan I do anything? I\u2019m not a nurse, but I\u2019d like to assist\u2014that is, if you think I\u2019d be any help?\u201d</p><p>Jason hesitated, uncertain, then decided. \u201cYou can if you really want to.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. This wasn\u2019t going to be pretty and if she was the least bit squeamish, it would be better to sit out in the waiting room. He told her as much.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t take long to set up everything he needed for the surgery. They both scrubbed down and he gave her a green surgical cap and gown. He smiled at her before administering the anesthesia, taking pains to explain what he was doing and why.</p><p>The procedure didn\u2019t last more than an hour. When he\u2019d finished, he transferred the dog to the hospital portion of his facility. There was a night-time staff member who\u2019d watch over the spaniel and the other pets who required continuous care.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked hopefully when he returned.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look promising,\u201d Jason told her. He didn\u2019t want to give her any false hopes or mislead her. \u201cBut he might surprise us. He\u2019s only a couple of years old and he\u2019s got a strong heart. The next twenty-four hours will be critical. If he survives until tomorrow night, then he should do okay. But he\u2019s going to need a lot of attention and love afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie and I will make sure he gets it. Can we come see him?\u201d She paused. \u201cDo veterinary hospitals have visiting hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can come anytime you like.\u201d He sighed and rubbed his hand along the back of his neck. He was tired and hungry.</p><p>\u201cYou were wonderful....\u201d She seemed to sense his worry and exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s decide that in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Higgins lives, we\u2019ll owe everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiggins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a good name. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. He was too tired and too hungry to have much of an opinion on anything at the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had dinner, have you?\u201d she surprised him by asking.</p><p>\u201cNo. How\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I am. You want to grab something?\u201d he asked as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOnly this time I\u2019ll treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist. Please don\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the energy to protest, so he simply agreed. Since she was buying, he let her choose the restaurant. She decided on a nearby sandwich shop. He breathed in the scent of freshly baked bread as soon as he walked in the door.</p><p>It was the type of place where customers seated themselves and the silverware was wrapped in a red checkered napkin. The waitress, who looked all of sixteen, took their order, and promptly brought coffee. She came back a few minutes later with six-inch-high sandwiches, layered with sliced turkey, ham, roast beef, lettuce, tomato slices and onion.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asked casually after wolfing down the first half of his sandwich. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUntil the accident tonight I was just fine,\u201d Charlotte told him, her eyes flitting away from his. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me. I\u2019m usually not so emotional, but seeing that poor little dog on the road bleeding and hurt like that really got to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets to me, too.\u201d The sight of an innocent animal suffering never failed to disturb Jason, although he saw it time and time again. The helplessness of the situation, the complete disregard for life that a hit-and-run accident revealed, angered him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were home,\u201d Charlotte said, keeping her gaze lowered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I was there, too.\u201d He reached across the table, taking her hand, linking their fingers. Her skin was smooth and soft, just the way he remembered.</p> <p>His eyes sought hers. He smiled and she smiled back. Jason felt ridiculously, unreasonably pleased that they were together. For days he\u2019d been fighting it, and now that they were together, he felt foolish for having put up such a struggle. He should quit worrying about the future, he told himself. Live for the moment. Wasn\u2019t that what all the self-help books said? One day at a time. One kiss at a time.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Charlotte dragged her eyes from his.</p><p>\u201cHow about dessert?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Charlotte picked up the menu and read over the limited selection.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of homemade chocolate chip cookies,\u201d Jason said.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have...Oh, you mean mine?\u201d She raised eyes as blue as a summer sky.</p><p>He nodded enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ve reconsidered. It\u2019s true.\u201d His voice sounded slightly hoarse and, if he didn\u2019t know better, seductive.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way to my heart takes a direct route through my stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked as if he\u2019d caught her off guard. She was beautiful, he realized all over again. So gentle and caring. He\u2019d missed her, yet he\u2019d tried to convince himself otherwise, and had been doing a good job of it, too\u2014too good, in fact.</p><p>The world seemed to stop. Jason knew his breathing did. He felt as if he were drowning in her eyes. He would\u2019ve liked to blame it on how tired he was, but he\u2019d only be lying to himself.</p> <p>\u201cYou like softball?\u201d he found himself asking next.</p><p>She nodded, obviously trying to keep her eyes averted from his. Apparently she was having a difficult time of it, because whenever their eyes met, it would be several moments before she looked away.</p><p>\u201cI understand softball, more than basketball at any rate,\u201d she said, sounding slightly breathless.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers and I play on a team Saturday mornings. Do you and Carrie want to come and watch this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent on the way home. Jason knew he was going to kiss her again. He couldn\u2019t imagine not kissing her again.</p><p>Charlotte must have read his intentions, because her hand was on the car door the minute he shut off the engine. She reminded him of a trapped bird, eager to escape, and yet she didn\u2019t move.</p> <p>His hand on her shoulder turned her toward him. His heart tripped wildly as she leaned toward him. He felt sure her heart was pounding as furiously as his.</p><p>Slowly, so slowly he wondered if he was dreaming it, Charlotte swayed closer. He lowered his mouth to hers. Jason wanted this kiss, wanted it more than he could remember wanting anything. It\u2019d been over a week since he\u2019d seen her and it felt like a lifetime. A thousand lifetimes.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s hands were braced against his chest as he kissed her again, deeper, more fully. Again he kissed her, and again. Finally she broke away.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she pleaded. The words were breathless and he could feel her shudder.</p><p>Reluctantly, Jason pulled back. Their eyes met again, and for the second time that night, Jason had the feeling she was frightened, although he didn\u2019t understand why. Wanting to comfort her, he traced a knuckle down the curve of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cCarrie will be worried,\u201d she said.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough. For saving Higgins. The dog.\u201d</p><p>Again Jason said nothing.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you want to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to lie about it.</p><p>He saw that her hand was shaking as she opened the car door and climbed out. She seemed eager to make her escape now.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said with obvious false cheer.</p><p>\u201cLittle coward,\u201d Jason muttered under his breath, amused. \u201cSaturday morning!\u201d he shouted after her.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d She turned to face him again.</p><p>\u201cNine-thirty. Is that too early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in the morning about Higgins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her eyes widening as though she\u2019d momentarily forgotten the dog. \u201cOh, please do.\u201d She snapped open her purse and withdrew a business card, walking toward him now. \u201cThis is my number at the office. I\u2019ll be there after nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll phone at nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d he echoed, returning to his apartment.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there more than five minutes when his doorbell chimed. He certainly wasn\u2019t in the mood for company, but as the building owner and manager, he couldn\u2019t very well ignore a visitor.</p><p>He opened his door to discover Carrie standing on the other side, a covered plastic bowl in her hand. \u201cThese are for you.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the container with a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cMom asked me to bring you some chocolate chip cookies,\u201d she said, grinning broadly.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cMom, you look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look fine...I look wretched,\u201d Charlotte insisted, viewing her backside in the hallway mirror. She must\u2019ve been mad to let Carrie talk her into buying jeans. Fashionably faded jeans, no less. Not only had she plunked down ninety bucks for the pair, they looked as if they\u2019d spent the past ten years in someone\u2019s attic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like a little kid,\u201d Carrie said, slapping her hands against her sides in disgust. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a softball game, not the senior prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me my thighs are so...round?\u201d Charlotte cried in despair. \u201cNo woman wants to be seen in pants that make her legs look like hot dogs. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Carrie just rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCall Jason,\u201d Charlotte told her daughter. \u201cTell him...anything. Make up some excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting his family,\u201d Charlotte cried. \u201cI can\u2019t meet his brothers and sisters-in-law looking like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange clothes, then, if you\u2019re so self-conscious.\u201d</p><p>As though she had anything to change into. Charlotte\u2019s wardrobe was limited to business suits and sweatpants. There was no in-between. She couldn\u2019t afford to clothe both of them in expensive jeans. But after Jason had invited her out for today, she\u2019d allowed Carrie to talk her into a shopping spree. Thank heaven for Visa. And thank heaven for Jason\u2019s generosity; he\u2019d refused to accept any payment for the dog\u2019s care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling Jason!\u201d Carrie crossed her arms righteously. The girl had a streak of stubbornness a mile wide, and Charlotte had collided with it more than once.</p><p>Defeated, Charlotte muttered under her breath and fled to her room, sitting on the end of her bed. Before the shopping trip, she\u2019d managed to put today\u2019s plans out of her mind and focus her attention on Higgins. Then the softball game had turned into the better part of a day, including a picnic, involving most of his family.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Carrie said, approaching her carefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shrugged, not sure how to explain her nervousness. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Carrie wanted to know. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it all week. Just think of all the babysitting prospects. Jason\u2019s family is a potential gold mine for me.\u201d Carrie sat on the bed beside Charlotte. \u201cWe\u2019re going, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. She was overreacting, and she knew it. After shelling out ninety bucks she was wearing those jeans, no matter how they made her look.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Carrie said, leaping excitedly to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve got the picnic basket packed. Honestly, Mom, we\u2019re bringing so much food, we could open a concession stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to run short.\u201d Charlotte didn\u2019t bother denying that she\u2019d packed enough to feed Jason\u2019s entire family. A fruit-and-cheese plate, sandwiches, potato salad, a batch of chocolate chip cookies and a variety of other goodies she\u2019d thrown in at the last minute.</p><p>Jason had casually mentioned the picnic the day before, when she\u2019d gone to the hospital to visit Higgins. The dog was just beginning to respond to them. He was recovering slowly, but according to Jason, they\u2019d be able to bring him home within a week. Charlotte soon discovered that visiting her new dog was a dual-edged sword. Every time she was at the veterinary hospital, she ran into Jason. Usually they had a cup of coffee together and talked; once he\u2019d suggested dinner and Charlotte hadn\u2019t been able to dredge up a single excuse not to join him. He\u2019d even taken her and Carrie to a movie. Now she was meeting his family, and it terrified her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, as Charlotte was rearranging their picnic basket to find room for a tablecloth and paper napkins, Jason arrived.</p><p>Carrie answered the door and directed him to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s here,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Charlotte greeted him nervously, turning around, a tense smile on her face. She was watching him carefully, wanting to read his expression when he saw her in the tight jeans.</p><p>\u201cHi, I was just\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, letting whatever he meant to say fade into nothingness. He stood before her, his mouth dangling open. Slowly his eyes widened.</p><p>With appreciation.</p><p>At least she thought it was appreciation. She prayed that was what it was, and not disgust or shock or any of the emotions she\u2019d endured that morning.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ve got everything ready.\u201d She rubbed her suddenly damp hands down her thighs. \u201cCarrie says I\u2019ve packed too much food, but I don\u2019t think so. I hope you like cantaloupe, because I just added one.\u201d She knew she was chattering aimlessly, but couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>\u201cYou look...fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Charlotte hated how uncertain she sounded.</p><p>Jason nodded as though he wouldn\u2019t be able to take his eyes off her long enough to play ball, which had to be the nicest compliment he\u2019d ever paid her.</p><p>\u201cCarrie talked me into buying the jeans,\u201d she mumbled, tossing the napkins on top of the heap and closing the lid as far as it would go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemind me to thank her.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say any more, just reached for the basket and brought it out to the car. Charlotte was so relieved, she wanted to weep with gratitude. Her spirits lifted\u2014more than lifted\u2014they soared as she and Carrie followed him. Carrie climbed in the backseat as Charlotte got in the front, hoping her jeans wouldn\u2019t split.</p><p>The ball field was several miles away, near the Southcenter shopping mall. Charlotte was grateful to Carrie for carrying the conversation. Thrilled with the outing, the girl had plenty to say.</p><p>Charlotte had never been to this park before, and when she saw it she was astonished she hadn\u2019t heard of it. It had several baseball diamonds, and an equal number of soccer fields. The Green River intersected the park, with several footbridges spanning its banks.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mention I was bringing anyone,\u201d Jason told her after he\u2019d parked the car. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to ask you a bunch of embarrassing questions. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, having trouble meeting his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d She was a big girl\u2014she could deal with a bit of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually bring someone.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stiffened, not because she was timid or dreaded the questions, but because it confirmed something she\u2019d rather not deal with right then. Jason was attracted to her. As attracted as she was to him.</p><p>What did bring fear to her heart was that he might be taking their time together seriously\u2014that he might really start to care for her. That would be disastrous. You care for him, her heart reminded her. Yes, but that was different.</p> <p>Kissing was all they\u2019d done; it was all Charlotte had allowed. A few innocent kisses didn\u2019t amount to much. Or did they?</p><p>\u201cUncle Jase!\u201d Two boys\u2014Charlotte guessed they were seven or eight\u2014raced across the green lawn toward Jason. One glance told her the pair were identical twins.</p><p>\u201cHello, boys,\u201d Jason said with a wide smile.</p><p>They stopped abruptly when they noticed Charlotte and Carrie, their eyes huge and questioning. Suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThese are my friends, Charlotte and Carrie,\u201d Jason said, motioning toward them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re girls,\u201d one of the pair muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI noticed that myself,\u201d a tall, athletic man said as he strode toward them. He was wearing the same uniform as Jason. Charlotte didn\u2019t need an introduction to know this was his brother.</p><p>\u201cThis is Paul, my oldest brother,\u201d Jason said, tucking a couple of baseball bats under his arm, along with his mitt. The task appeared to demand a great deal of attention.</p><p>In the next five minutes, Charlotte was introduced to Leah, Paul\u2019s wife, who was five months pregnant and chasing after a toddler named Kelsey. Jason\u2019s younger brother, Rich, his wife, Jamie, and their two children, Bethany and Jeremy, arrived shortly afterward, and there was another series of introductions.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s head was spinning with all the names and faces. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Openly curious, too. Carrie, who loved children, was delighted when Rich\u2019s daughter wanted to sit in the bleachers with her.</p><p>The men were on the diamond warming up when Jamie sat next to Charlotte. Leah joined them, sitting on her other side. Charlotte smiled from one to the other. Their curiosity was almost visible. As the silence lengthened Charlotte frantically sorted through a number of possible topics, but try as she might, the most inventive thing she could think of was the weather.</p><p>Oh, what the heck, she decided. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re curious about me,\u201d she said. After the morning she\u2019d had, she wasn\u2019t up to a game of Twenty Questions.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to be so blatant about it,\u201d Leah, the shorter of the two, murmured. She had one of the nicest smiles Charlotte had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d Charlotte lied.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we were,\u201d Jamie said with a laugh. \u201cWe can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk away,\u201d Charlotte invited.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known Jason?\u201d Rich\u2019s wife asked without hesitation.</p><p>Charlotte found Jamie Manning to be a study in contrasts. Rich, Jamie\u2019s husband, was probably one of the best-looking men she\u2019d ever seen. Definitely GQ material. Yet, at first glance, his wife seemed rather plain. Charlotte soon learned how misleading first impressions could be. Five minutes with Jamie, and Charlotte was awed by her radiance. She had an inner glow that touched those around her.</p><p>\u201cI met Jason about a year ago,\u201d Charlotte answered, when she realized both women were staring at her, waiting for her response. \u201cMy daughter and I live in one of his apartments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d Jamie repeated, leaning forward so she could exchange a wide-eyed look with Leah. \u201cDid you hear that? He\u2019s known her a whole year.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte felt she should explain further. \u201cActually, I met him a year ago, but we\u2019ve only recently started to, uh, know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Once again it was Leah who spoke, wearing a subtle smile as though she was amused and trying to disguise it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive us for acting so surprised, but Jason doesn\u2019t usually bring anyone with him on Saturdays,\u201d Leah elaborated.</p><p>\u201cOr any other day for that matter,\u201d Jamie added.</p><p>\u201cSo I understand. I...I take it he doesn\u2019t date often?\u201d Charlotte asked. In some ways she was hoping they\u2019d tell her he went through women like water. But in her heart she knew it wasn\u2019t true. If anything, it was just the opposite. Charlotte didn\u2019t want to hear that, either, didn\u2019t want to know she was special, because it made everything so much more difficult.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Jamie answered, crossing her legs and resting her elbows on her knees. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming out here for what, two, three summers now, and this is the first time Jason\u2019s ever brought a woman.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte drew in a slow, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember Jason bringing a woman to any family function, ever,\u201d Leah said, looking positively delighted. Her eyes sparkled. \u201cI\u2019d say it was about time, wouldn\u2019t you, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout time, indeed,\u201d Leah\u2019s sister-in-law said with a grin.</p><p>From his position on the diamond, Jason could see his two sisters-in-law on either side of Charlotte. No doubt they were pumping her for information, wanting to know every minute detail of their relationship. The distance was too great for him to be able to read Charlotte\u2019s expression.</p><p>If he had half a brain, he would\u2019ve realized what he was doing before he invited her to join him. Why had he asked Charlotte to this game? Clearly he needed his head examined. Only an idiot would thrust a lamb like Charlotte into a pack of hounds without warning.</p><p>He\u2019d told her his family would probably be curious about her, but he\u2019d said it casually in the parking lot after they\u2019d arrived. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d given her much advance warning.</p><p>His family was far too nosy. By the end of the afternoon, Charlotte would be so sick of answering questions, she\u2019d never want to go out with him again.</p><p>He pitched the ball to Paul with enough force to make his oldest brother remove his mitt, shake his hand and cast Jason an odd look.</p><p>Jason was angry. But it wasn\u2019t the way Leah and Jamie had surrounded Charlotte that had set him off. He\u2019d had no business inviting Charlotte and Carrie to this game. For one thing, they were playing the league leaders and likely to be soundly defeated. If he was going to ask someone to come and watch him play ball, it should be against a team that\u2019d make him look good, not like a bunch of fools. The outcome could prove to be downright embarrassing.</p><p>Not only were they likely to get their butts kicked, but Charlotte was going to spend the entire time being interrogated. First by Jamie and Leah, and then, when the game was over, by his brothers. They wouldn\u2019t be subtle about it, either. The first woman he\u2019d cared about in years was going to come away thinking his family had been trained by the CIA.</p><p>Even now, Jason wasn\u2019t sure what had prompted him to ask Charlotte to come. But he certainly remembered the night he\u2019d done it....</p><p>They\u2019d been sitting in the car outside the apartment the night of Higgins\u2019s surgery. She\u2019d been shaken by the accident, struggling to hide how much. He had known when he dropped her off that he was going to kiss her again. She\u2019d known it, too. His lips had brushed hers. Lightly. Briefly. He had sensed she was still frightened\u2014of him? Of their mutual passion? Of her own desires? Until she was at ease with him, he was content to proceed slowly. He\u2019d never indulged in any kisses more sensual or seductive than those he\u2019d shared with Charlotte.</p><p>He could tell she was a novice when it came to lovemaking. That surprised him because she\u2019d been married. He\u2019d never asked about her ex-husband, preferring to wait until she was comfortable enough to talk about it on her own. But from what Carrie had told him the day she\u2019d come to his office, the marriage had been short and disastrous.</p><p>Jason was convinced Charlotte hadn\u2019t realized how much he enjoyed their kissing sessions. How much holding her satisfied him. How she left him feeling dizzy with need.</p><p>The same magic that had made him kiss her that night had encouraged him to risk inviting her to the ball game. Only now did he understand what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d dragged Charlotte into an impossible situation. Carrie, too. He was glad they were with him, but he wished he\u2019d thought of some other way of introducing Charlotte and her daughter to his family. Some other time, when he\u2019d be at her side to ward off their curiosity.</p><p>\u201cJase!\u201d Rich\u2019s voice shot past his ear two seconds after a ball nearly creamed the side of his head.</p><p>Stunned, Jason took two steps backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Rich demanded furiously.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d Paul shouted from the shortstop position. He looked pointedly toward the stands. \u201cIt seems to me that he\u2019s met his Waterloo.\u201d</p><p>After nearly getting his head knocked off by a fly ball, Jason focused his concentration on the game, which to his surprise wasn\u2019t going badly. Every now and then he could hear a high-pitched shout, which he\u2019d like to think came from Charlotte. By the end of the seventh inning the score was tied.</p><p>Jason came to bat at the bottom of the ninth. The all-important ninth inning. The score remained tied and there were already two outs. Either he pulled off a hit or they were going into extra innings.</p><p>Charlotte was sitting in the stands almost directly behind him. He set the bat over his shoulder and eyed the pitcher. The first pitch was a fast ball and Jason swung, determined to hit it out of the field. More to the point, he was hoping not to be embarrassed in front of Charlotte.</p><p>He heard the cracking of the wood against the ball and he dropped the bat, then started running as though his life depended on making it to first base. It wasn\u2019t until he got there that he realized he\u2019d hit a home run. He felt jubilant as he rounded the bases.</p><p>He cast his eyes toward the bleachers to find Charlotte on her feet, cheering and clapping. Her face was bright with excitement. In all his life, Jason had never felt such elation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He crossed home plate and didn\u2019t stop. His brothers, his whole team, stared at him as he trotted behind the protective barrier between home plate and the viewing stands and headed straight for Charlotte. Excitedly, she launched herself into his arms.</p><p>Jason grabbed her around her waist, lifted her from the bleachers and swung her down. Her eyes shone with happiness and Jason thought he\u2019d never seen a more beautiful woman.</p><p>Charlotte threw back her head and laughed. It wasn\u2019t for several minutes that Jason was even aware of the crowd that had gathered around them.</p><p>A bit self-conscious now, he lowered Charlotte to the ground, but kept his arm around her. Paul and Rich were the first to congratulate him, followed by several other teammates, who slapped him heartily on the back. One suggested Jason bring Charlotte again, since she was definitely his good-luck charm.</p> <p>\u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d Charlotte said, smiling at him proudly. Jason found it difficult to pull his gaze away. The urge to kiss her was so strong, he had to fight to restrain himself. He would\u2019ve done it, too, would\u2019ve kissed her in front of everyone and ignored the consequences, if only his brothers hadn\u2019t been present. He held back more to protect Charlotte from embarrassment than to ward off any razzing he\u2019d get from his family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Ryan, one of the twins, announced once the excitement had died down. \u201cWhen are we gonna eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Leah promised. Paul headed toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Jason said and, without thinking, did the very thing he\u2019d decided against. He kissed Charlotte briefly, before trailing after his brother to get the picnic basket in the trunk of his car.</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d done that. Neither could Charlotte, judging by the look of surprise that flashed in her blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to fess up?\u201d Paul asked, holding a heavy cooler with both hands, studying Jason.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d he demanded, narrowing his eyes, hoping his brother would take the hint.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all defensive on me. I was just wondering how you met.\u201d</p><p>Jason relaxed a little. He was being too touchy. \u201cShe lives in the complex.\u201d He didn\u2019t think it would sound good if he admitted Carrie had offered him money to take her mother out.</p> <p>\u201cShe seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. Lay off her, though, will you?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes went solemn, as if he was offended by Jason\u2019s remark. Then he nodded. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Paul must\u2019ve said something to Rich, too, because when they sat down to eat, after pushing three picnic tables together, no one gave Charlotte more than a glance. It was as though she\u2019d been part of the family for years. Which was just the way Jason wanted everyone to treat her. Heaven forbid she figure out how special she was to him. He\u2019d already made a big enough fool of himself, simply by inviting her and Carrie to this outing.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s daughter had won a few hearts all on her own, Jason saw, secretly pleased. Ryan and Ronnie had clamored to sit next to her at lunch, beating out Bethany, who cried with disappointment until Carrie agreed to hold the little girl on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI think Carrie\u2019s made a conquest,\u201d Jason said to Charlotte, munching on a chocolate chip cookie. His fourth, and he was ready for another.</p><p>\u201cShe loves children. She\u2019s the type of kid who\u2019d prefer to be the oldest of ten.\u201d</p><p>Jason watched as a sadness, however brief, flashed in Charlotte\u2019s eyes. It told him she wasn\u2019t speaking only for Carrie, but herself, as well. She must\u2019ve wanted so much more from her marriage than she\u2019d gotten. He remembered something else then, something Carrie had told him about Charlotte wanting more children. At the time he\u2019d decided to stay away. A woman with marriage and children on her mind was someone he planned to avoid. Strangely, the thought didn\u2019t terrify him nearly as much now.</p> <p>Still, he had to admit that the fleeting look of pain got to him. He\u2019d experienced the desire to protect her in the past, to guard her from hurt, but only when she was in his arms. Only when he feared he might hurt her. Now, the need to keep her safe burned in his chest. He wanted to block out anything that would cause her pain. Most of all, he wanted to meet the ex-husband who\u2019d walked away from his family, and he\u2019d prefer it be in a dark alley some night.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t know any details of the divorce, Carrie had told him she never heard from her father. What kind of man would desert his family? What kind of man would turn a warm, vivacious woman like Charlotte into a near-recluse?</p><p>\u201cI like your family,\u201d Charlotte said, smiling up at him, distracting him from his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDid Leah and Jamie bombard you with questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few, but they\u2019re so nice, I didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d Jason was eager to know, partially because it might clear up a few questions he had himself. Maybe Charlotte could put into perspective what he was feeling and was unable to define.</p><p>She laughed, causing the others to momentarily look their way. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The question surprised him.</p><p>\u201cFor a moment there, you looked as if you were afraid I might\u2019ve told them something you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell them anything you want,\u201d he said decisively, meaning it. If she chose to imply that they were madly in love, then fine, he\u2019d deal with it. On the other hand, if she\u2019d chosen to let his family believe they\u2019d only just met, which wasn\u2019t so far from the truth, then he\u2019d live with that, too.</p><p>\u201cI told them we\u2019re friends...special friends.\u201d</p><p>Jason approved. He couldn\u2019t have said it better.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jase,\u201d Ronnie shouted, clutching a Frisbee. \u201cAre we ready to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay?\u201d Jason didn\u2019t need to be invited twice. His favorite part of these family get-togethers was the time after lunch that he spent with his nieces and nephews. Chasing after Ronnie and Ryan and a Frisbee kept him young at heart, he told himself. Though he didn\u2019t care to admit out loud just how much he liked running around with a pair of eight-year-olds. The boys enjoyed it, too, and before the afternoon was over Rich and Paul invariably joined in.</p><p>As they did now. The two brothers against Jason and a handful of youngsters in a game of Frisbee football. A few minutes into the competition, Jason dived to catch a wild throw, catapulting himself into the air and latching triumphantly on to the disk.</p><p>Ronnie and Ryan cheered, and Jason felt as pleased with his small feat as he\u2019d been with the home run. After an hour, the two teams took a break. Breathless, he reached for a cold soda, pulled back the tab and guzzled it down.</p><p>He turned, looking for Charlotte. The last time he\u2019d seen her she was with Leah and Jamie cleaning up the remains of their picnic. He saw her sitting on a blanket under a madrona tree, bouncing Jeremy on her knee. Bethany and Kelsey were sprawled out, napping, beside her. She was playing a game with the baby, nuzzling his neck and making cooing sounds. Her eyes radiated a happiness he\u2019d never seen. A joy that transfixed him.</p><p>\u201cJason, are you in or out?\u201d</p><p>Jason barely heard the words, his gaze on Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cIn,\u201d he decided, tossing the empty can in the garbage and heading back to the field. A couple of minutes later he was completely engrossed in the game. Carrie had sided with his brothers against him and was proving to be a worthy opponent. Ronnie caught the Frisbee and lobbed it to his twin. Jason glanced toward Charlotte again and saw her lift Jeremy above her head and laugh up at him.</p><p>Jason\u2019s heart constricted. Watching Charlotte with his brother\u2019s child did funny things to his chest. She was smiling, happy. A powerful emotion seized his heart in a way that was almost painful.</p><p>One pain was followed almost immediately by another as the Frisbee hit him hard. The wind momentarily knocked out of him, he doubled over.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jase!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>Paul and Ronnie were the first to reach him.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes moved toward Charlotte and he shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>So this was what it meant to be part of a family, Charlotte mused, as Jason drove her and Carrie home from the ball field. This profound sense of belonging, of acceptance. She\u2019d never experienced anything like it before. It was as though Jason\u2019s family had known and loved her for years. As though they genuinely cared for her. Charlotte couldn\u2019t recall a time when she\u2019d felt anything as uplifting as she had that afternoon.</p><p>After the game they\u2019d gathered together for a picnic. Charlotte didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever laughed more. There\u2019d been good-natured teasing, jokes, games. Even now, driving home, laughter echoed in her ears. The cousins were as close as brothers and sisters, the older ones watching out for the smaller children. They fought like brothers and sisters, too, mostly over Carrie, each wanting her attention.</p><p>Carrie had beamed, loving every minute of it.</p><p>After the initial round of questions, Leah and Jamie had treated Charlotte like...well, like family. The women were obviously good friends, yet included Charlotte in all their conversations. Jason\u2019s brothers, too, had tried to make her feel comfortable. Neither Paul nor Rich had asked a single question about her relationship with Jason, probably content to have their wives fill in the gaps later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d Jason said, taking his eyes off the road for a second. \u201cAnything wrong? My brothers didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him with a smile.</p><p>The only sound was the hum of the road. Carrie, usually filled with boundless energy, was exhausted after chasing the children around for most of the afternoon. She\u2019d enjoyed herself as much as Charlotte had.</p><p>And perhaps her daughter was thinking the same thing Charlotte was\u2014that she\u2019d missed out on something important because they only had each other.</p><p>Jason parked the car, then carried the near-empty picnic basket into her kitchen. He hesitated after setting it on the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re sure nothing\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cPositive. I had a wonderful time. A fabulous time. Thank you for asking Carrie and me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to believe her. \u201cDid Leah and Jamie hound you with questions?\u201d he asked for the second time that day, a pensive frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d she murmured, resting her hands on his forearms and gazing up at him. \u201cI meant it. Every word. This day with you and your brothers and their families was one of the happiest of my life. If I\u2019m being introspective it\u2019s because...well, because I\u2019ve never realized until now how much I\u2019ve missed in life.\u201d Jason\u2019s questioning eyes sought hers, as if he wasn\u2019t sure he understood.</p><p>She managed to meet his eyes. She felt close to Jason just then, closer than she had to anyone, and that confused her. She was falling in love with this man and that was something she couldn\u2019t allow. Was it Jason she loved, or his family? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharlotte, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the request. \u201cI was an only child, too,\u201d she told him, \u201clike Carrie.\u201d She wanted to explain. \u201cThere were never outings that included aunts and uncles or cousins. This is a new experience for Carrie and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said again, his voice low and commanding.</p><p>Slowly her gaze traveled the length of him, up his chest, over the width of his shoulders, to his eyes. She stared into them and felt a sudden sense of connection. It was a powerful sensation, powerful and exciting.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Carrie?\u201d Jason asked, glancing over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the phone in her room. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart tripped into double time. She was tempted to make some excuse, anything that would put an end to the craziness that overcame her with Jason, but she didn\u2019t trust her voice, let alone her heart.</p><p>Whatever she might\u2019ve said was never meant to be. Jason\u2019s kiss saw to that. He gathered her in his arms, and lowered his mouth to hers. His lips were there, warm and moist, reminding her of sunshine. The kiss was chaste, yet curiously sensual.</p> <p>Of her own accord she deepened their kiss. Jason responded quickly.</p><p>He moaned, or perhaps it was her own voice making those soft sounds. She melted into him, her body responding instinctively, naturally, to his.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d He brought her even closer, and their kiss went on and on. She grew hot, and hotter, then hotter still...until...</p><p>\u201cNo more...\u201d she cried, breaking away, panting. \u201cPlease...no more.\u201d</p><p>Jason trembled with restraint, closing his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCarrie\u2019s in the other room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie,\u201d Charlotte repeated, grateful for the excuse.</p> <p>Jason drew in several deep breaths, then said, \u201cI should be leaving.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded, but she didn\u2019t want him to go. Her body was on fire. She wondered if he was experiencing the same kind of torment himself\u2014and if he was angry with her for sending him away.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come with me again next Saturday?\u201d The question was offhanded, as though he\u2019d just thought of it.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart soared at the prospect. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure you want me.\u201d</p><p>Laughter leapt into his eyes, melding with the fire that was already there. \u201cTrust me, Charlotte, I want you.\u201d</p><p>With that, he was out the door.</p><p>No sooner had Jason left than Carrie appeared in the kitchen. \u201cDid Jason leave?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded, too preoccupied to answer outright. She was trembling, and all because of a few words. He wanted her. He\u2019d been honest and forthright as she\u2019d come to expect.</p> <p>\u201cMom, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Charlotte said, as she unloaded the picnic basket. There was surprisingly little food left over. Ryan and Ronnie had discovered her chocolate chip cookies, thanks to Jason, and the three dozen she\u2019d brought had disappeared in no time. She\u2019d set out the fresh fruit-and-cheese platter and that had disappeared, too. There were a couple of sandwiches still wrapped, but they\u2019d keep for her and Carrie to eat the following day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the ninth-grade dance,\u201d Carrie said stiffly from behind her.</p><p>Charlotte froze. This wasn\u2019t a subject she wanted to discuss, not again. \u201cI\u2019ve said everything I\u2019m going to say about it, Carrie. The subject is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize you\u2019re ruining my entire life,\u201d Carrie announced theatrically.</p><p>\u201cDropping you off at the dance and picking you up myself is a reasonable compromise, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you think wrong. I\u2019d...rather walk to school naked than have you drive me to the dance as if...as if there wasn\u2019t a single boy in the entire class who wanted to be seen with me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to pick up Brad, too, if that\u2019ll help.\u201d That was more than she was really in favor of, but she supposed she could live with it.</p><p>\u201cThen everyone will think I asked Brad to the dance. I mean, I know girls do that, but it\u2019s important to me that a certain girl find out that Brad asked me. How can you do this, Mom? Can\u2019t you see how important this is?\u201d Her eyes were imploring, a look designed to melt any mother\u2019s heart.</p><p>Charlotte steeled herself. \u201cYou\u2019re too young, Carrie, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re doing to me!\u201d Carried wailed.</p><p>\u201cThe subject is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, ruin my life. See if I care.\u201d She stalked out of the kitchen, arms swinging.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Charlotte watched her go. This argument was getting old. She\u2019d been under the impression that her daughter had accepted her decision. But now it was apparent Carrie had only been regrouping, altering her tactics. Cool reason had evolved into implied guilt. Her fifteen-year-old made it sound as though Charlotte had done untold psychological damage by not letting her go on an actual date. Well, so be it, Charlotte decided. This issue was one she didn\u2019t intend to back down on any more than she already had.</p><p>Pulling out a kitchen chair, Charlotte sank tiredly into it, resting her face in her hands. She sighed again. She had trouble enough raising one child; she was insane to even contemplate having another.</p><p>A baby.</p><p>But she did want another child, so badly she ached with it. Holding Jeremy, Jamie and Rich\u2019s little boy, had stirred to life a craving buried deep within her heart. She attempted to push the desire away, rebury it, anything but acknowledge it. She\u2019d had to repress this desire several times over the years.</p><p>A baby now was out of the question, she stubbornly reminded herself. She was too old; there were dangers for a woman on the other side of thirty-five. But age was the least of her concerns.</p><p>Getting pregnant required a man. Even more problematic, it required making love.</p><p>The sadness that weighed down Charlotte\u2019s heart felt impossible to carry alone. Tears blurred her eyes. If ever there was a man she could love, it was Jason Manning. But the thought of falling in love again terrified her. Charlotte was afraid of love. Afraid of all the feelings and desires Jason had stirred to life. He was wonderful. His family was wonderful. But it was a painful kind of wonderful, taunting her with all that was never meant to be in her life.</p><p>Charlotte had dealt with her share of problems. Finances. Isolation. Low self-esteem. Everything had been a struggle for her. She didn\u2019t know how to react to wonderful.</p><p>For the first time since her divorce, Charlotte felt the protective walls she\u2019d erected around her heart being threatened. Those barriers were fortified by years of disappointment, years of resentment and pain. Now they seemed to be crumbling and all because of a man she\u2019d never even seen without a baseball cap.</p><p>For now, Jason was attracted to her, but in her heart she believed his interest in her wouldn\u2019t last. It couldn\u2019t. The time was fast approaching when she wouldn\u2019t be able to put him off, and he\u2019d know. That very afternoon, she\u2019d seen the way he\u2019d trembled in an effort to restrain himself. She\u2019d watched as he\u2019d closed his eyes and drawn in several deep breaths.</p><p>Soon kissing wouldn\u2019t be enough for him. Soon he\u2019d discover how inadequate she was when it came to making love. She had never satisfied Tom, no matter how hard she\u2019d tried. In the end he\u2019d taunted her, claiming the day would come when she\u2019d realize all the ugly things he\u2019d said about her were true. She didn\u2019t have what it took to satisfy a man.</p><p>When Jason learned that, he\u2019d start to make excuses not to see her again. He\u2019d regret ever having met her, and worse, he\u2019d regret having introduced her to his family.</p><p>She never should\u2019ve accepted his invitation. It would make everything so much more awkward later....</p><p>The tears slipped from her eyes before she was aware she was crying. The soul-deep insecurity, awakened by the memories of her marriage, returned to haunt her. The doubts, the fear and dread, were back, taking up residence in her mind.</p><p>Covering her face with her hands, Charlotte swallowed the sobs beginning to spill out in huge swells of emotion. In an effort to gain control, she held her breath so long her lungs ached.</p><p>She heard her ex-husband\u2019s words\u2014you aren\u2019t woman enough\u2014inflicting injury all over again until she covered her ears and closed her eyes, wanting to blot them out forever.</p><p>Why should Jason fall in love with her when the world was full of whole, sexual women who\u2019d gladly satisfy his needs? Passionate women who\u2019d blossom in his arms and sigh with pleasure and fulfillment. She was incapable of giving a man what he needed. Tom had repeatedly told her so. She was inept as a woman, inept at lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Carrie said coolly from behind her. \u201cI\u2019m going to Amanda\u2019s house.\u201d She waited as though she expected Charlotte to object.</p><p>Charlotte nodded, then stood and resumed unpacking the picnic basket, not wanting Carrie to see her tears. \u201cOkay, honey. Just don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may never come home again,\u201d Carrie said dramatically.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Carrie muttered and walked out the door.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until later, much later, while she was in bed finding it impossible to sleep, that Charlotte\u2019s thoughts returned to Jason. She\u2019d allowed things to go further than she should have. It was a mistake. One she had to correct at the earliest possible moment. She must\u2019ve been crazy to let their relationship reach this point.</p><p>Crazy or desperate? Charlotte didn\u2019t know which. It had all started weeks earlier when she\u2019d held a friend\u2019s baby. Funny how she could remember the precise moment with such accuracy. The longing for a child had escalated within her, gaining momentum, refusing to be ignored. She\u2019d gone home and wept and although the tears had finally dried, inside she hadn\u2019t stopped weeping.</p><p>Shortly after the incident with Kathy Crenshaw and her baby, Charlotte had met Jason. He\u2019d kissed her that first night and it had been...She hadn\u2019t tensed or frozen up and that had given her hope. Her confidence continued to grow when he kissed her again and again; he\u2019d always been gentle and undemanding. He was special that way, and she\u2019d be forever grateful for the uncanny gift he had of understanding her needs.</p><p>But Jason was a man of raw sensuality. He wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with a few chaste kisses for much longer. He had no idea how terrified she was of him, of any man.</p><p>No, it was only a matter of time before the best thing that had happened to her in years came abruptly to an end.</p><p>On Sunday, Jason wasn\u2019t in the mood to cook. Microwave popcorn for dinner suited him better than a frozen entr\u00e9e. He popped a batch and sat down in front of the television to watch a bowling tournament. Not his favorite sport, but there wasn\u2019t much to choose from.</p><p>When his phone rang, he stood on the sofa and reached across to grab it from the kitchen counter. He was half hoping it was Charlotte.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJase, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got Charlotte\u2019s phone number, do you?\u201d Paul asked cordially enough, only Jason wasn\u2019t fooled. As the oldest, his brother sometimes got the notion that he needed to oversee family matters. That didn\u2019t include Charlotte, and Jason intended to make sure Paul understood that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>Of course he had Charlotte\u2019s number. \u201cYeah. What do you want it for?\u201d Suspicions multiplied in his brain. Being a newspaper reporter, Paul was used to getting information out of people.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all bent out of shape, little brother. Leah and I want to go to a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, we\u2019d like Carrie to babysit. She was a real hit with the boys yesterday. You don\u2019t mind, do you? The girl\u2019s a natural with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d The fact was, Jason felt downright pleased. If Paul and Leah wanted Carrie to babysit, then Charlotte would be at home alone. He could come up with an excuse\u2014Higgins would do\u2014and casually drop in on her.</p><p>They needed to talk, and the sooner the better, although it wasn\u2019t talking that interested him.</p><p>He tossed what remained of his popcorn in the garbage, brushed his teeth and shaved. He even slapped on some cologne. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to using anything more than aftershave, but this evening was an exception.</p><p>He was whistling when he\u2019d finished, his spirits high.</p> <p>On the pretense of asking about next Saturday\u2019s ball game, he phoned his brother to be certain Paul had managed to get hold of Carrie. He had. In fact, he\u2019d be picking her up in the next half hour. Allowing ten minutes for Paul to whisk Carrie out of the apartment, that left him with forty minutes to kill.</p><p>Forty minutes would go fast, Jason mused, as he sat back down and turned on the TV. But his mind wasn\u2019t on the bowling match. A far more intriguing match was playing in his mind. One between Charlotte and him.</p><p>Tonight was the night, he decided, determined to take Charlotte beyond the kissing stage. He didn\u2019t mean to be calculating and devious about it...Well, yes, he did, Jason thought with a grin.</p><p>He\u2019d be gentle with her, he promised himself. Patient and reassuring. For years he\u2019d been treating terrified animals. One stubborn woman shouldn\u2019t be any more difficult. He had no intention of pressuring her into anything. Nor would he coerce her if she was at all uncomfortable. He\u2019d lead into lovemaking naturally, spontaneously.</p><p>He glanced at his watch, eager now, and was disappointed to see that only ten minutes had passed. Half an hour wasn\u2019t really very long, but it seemed to feel that way to Jason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now, Mom,\u201d Carrie called out.</p> <p>Charlotte walked out of the kitchen, drying her hands on a terry-cloth towel. She smiled at Paul, then looked at her daughter. \u201cDo you know what time you\u2019ll be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore ten. Don\u2019t worry, I know it\u2019s a school night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her back closer to nine,\u201d Paul assured Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Carrie said as they left, offering her first smile of the day. Actually, Charlotte had been talking to Paul, but she let it pass. Carrie was still upset about the school dance and had been cool toward Charlotte all afternoon.</p><p>Charlotte had just settled down with a book when there was a knock at the door. Please, God, don\u2019t let it be Jason, she prayed, but apparently God was occupied elsewhere. Just as she\u2019d feared, she opened the door and came face-to-face with Jason, boyishly handsome in his baseball cap.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, charming her with his smile. It wasn\u2019t fair that a man should be able to wreak such havoc on a woman\u2019s heart with a mere movement of the lips.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She\u2019d been dreading this moment all day. \u201cI was going to phone you later.\u201d A slight exaggeration; she\u2019d been planning to delay calling for as long as possible. \u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes...I won\u2019t be able to go to the ball game with you next Saturday after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said, making himself comfortable on her sofa. He anchored his ankle on the opposite knee and grinned up at her. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of other Saturdays. The summer is filled with Saturdays.\u201d</p><p>It was awkward for her to be standing, while he seemed completely at home. So Charlotte sat, too\u2014as far away from him as she could while still being on the same sofa. She angled her legs sideways, her hands clasped. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to make it any other Saturday, either.\u201d</p><p>A pause followed her announcement. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for us to see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He didn\u2019t reveal his reactions one way or another.</p><p>Emotion seemed to thicken the air. He might not be saying anything, but he was feeling it. Charlotte was, too.</p><p>\u201cIs it something I said?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes farther and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSomething I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Oh, please, Jason, just accept this. Don\u2019t make it any more difficult than it already is.\u201d Her voice, which had remained steady until then, cracked.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Jason said, moving next to her with startling agility. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She covered her mouth with one hand and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you tell me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d she cried, leaping to her feet. \u201cEverything would\u2019ve been all right if you hadn\u2019t been so...so nice.\u201d She was angry now, unreasonably angry, and not quite sure why.</p><p>Jason stood, too, his gaze holding hers. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry I kissed you. Nothing would make me regret that.\u201d</p><p>His words made it all so difficult. She wasn\u2019t sorry, either.</p><p>Her expression must have told him as much. He relaxed visibly and reached for her, gently holding her shoulders. Slowly, he drew her forward. Charlotte had no resistance left, and walked right into his embrace.</p><p>She sobbed once, then hid her face in his chest and wept openly.</p><p>Jason stroked her hair and whispered reassurances in her ear, as if she were a small child needing comforting. In some ways, she was exactly that.</p><p>After several minutes he lifted her face upward to meet his mouth. Over and over again he kissed her, lightly, softly, gently. Her breathing grew shallow.</p><p>\u201cJason...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He raised his head, his eyes meeting hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved into a deliberate smile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were against his chest when he sought her mouth again. He was still gentle, but the kisses changed in texture and intensity. Their lips were fused together, the heat between them burning so fierce, she thought it might scorch her. Charlotte found it difficult to breathe, but she didn\u2019t care. Breathing wasn\u2019t important. She held on, her hands clutching his upper arms.</p><p>Jason led her back to the sofa, and without protest, Charlotte followed. He sat down and brought her into his lap. He didn\u2019t give her the opportunity to protest before he directed her lips back to his. When her mouth opened in exultant welcome, he moaned. He kissed her again and again, until she was panting. Until her heart seemed to stop beating. Until there was nothing in her world but him.</p><p>His hands were opening the front of her blouse even before she realized his intent.</p><p>\u201cJason, no,\u201d she said in a panic. \u201cPlease, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Jason twisted around and turned off the light. The room dimmed and shadows danced across the walls. \u201cIs this better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Charlotte clamped her eyes shut. \u201cI...I\u2019m not very good at this,\u201d she whispered, close to tears. \u201cI\u2019m not...sexy enough.\u201d The only thing that kept her from springing free of his hold was fear. It held her immobile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCharlotte, do you hear me? You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>She buried her hands in his hair. His cap was gone, but she didn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d removed it. Or if he had. She sighed.</p><p>He kissed her again, his mouth hard and hungry. Charlotte understood his hunger, but she wasn\u2019t capable of satisfying it. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered when she could.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d How disappointed he sounded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said a second time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of that?\u201d he asked, sounding regretful.</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, kissed her once more, then inhaled sharply. \u201cI just wanted to check.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cWho told you that you aren\u2019t sexy?\u201d Jason asked, relaxing on her sofa.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s hands stilled as she poured coffee into two mugs.</p><p>How do you expect a man to get excited when his wife\u2019s such a cold fish? No wonder you\u2019re a failure at lovemaking. Are you sure you\u2019re even a woman?</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart reeled as Tom\u2019s words returned to haunt her. She\u2019d laid to rest as much of his vindictiveness as she could, bound her wounds and gone on with her life. Pulling away the bandage, examining the damage now, just seemed pointless.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d he probed gently.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-husband,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, rather than argue with Jason. For the moment he was infatuated with her, but his fascination wouldn\u2019t last, and eventually he\u2019d feel the same way as Tom.</p><p>\u201cYou never mention your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to say.\u201d She carried the two mugs into the living room. \u201cCarrie was excited about babysitting Paul and Leah\u2019s children,\u201d she said, pointedly changing the subject.</p><p>Jason stood and took a cup from her hands, then sat next to her on the sofa, sliding his arm around her shoulders. His touch was warm against her chilled skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he whispered and kissed her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely and sensuous and beautiful. Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you differently. I\u2019m not going to force you to discuss your marriage. Not now, but I want you to know I\u2019ll be ready to listen whenever you\u2019re ready to talk.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wanly, determined to steer the conversation away from the past.</p><p>Jason drank his coffee and left soon afterward, when it was apparent Charlotte wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. She wasn\u2019t sure what her mood was, but she lacked the strength to analyze it.</p><p>Before leaving, Jason asked if she\u2019d changed her mind again about the ball game on Saturday, and after a short hesitation, she nodded. Yes, she\u2019d go, she told him. Jason smiled, obviously pleased, and headed out the door.</p><p>Something was happening to her, Charlotte thought, trembling. And it was happening against her will.</p><p>She\u2019d made the decision earlier\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to see him again. After careful deliberation she\u2019d decided it was best to end everything now before one or both of them ended up hurt. It was a simple, cut-and-dried conclusion.</p><p>Yet...yet when she\u2019d tried to talk to him about it, regret and doubt had consumed her until she\u2019d dissolved in tears and pain.</p><p>Heaven help her, she didn\u2019t want it to end! Jason must\u2019ve sensed that because he hadn\u2019t appeared too concerned when she\u2019d told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His confidence was well-founded. Within minutes, he\u2019d broken through her resolve and was kissing her senseless. And Charlotte hadn\u2019t raised a single objection.</p><p>It was too late. Too late to walk away from him. Too late to go back to the way her life had been before Jason. She was trapped by her own weakness and would continue to be until Jason discovered the truth for himself.</p><p>Carrie arrived home soon afterward, full of tales about the twins and Kelsey. Seconds later, it seemed, she was in her room and on the phone. Her thoughts heavy, Charlotte appreciated the privacy.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though this was the first time Jason had kissed her. The impact he had on her senses wasn\u2019t startling or new. The man had the uncanny knack of stirring awake the part of her she\u2019d thought had died the day Tom asked for a divorce.</p> <p>She felt reborn, alive with hope. And yet she was more frightened than she\u2019d ever been before. Everything was different with Jason. In his arms she experienced an excitement she\u2019d never even known was possible. His tenderness, the loving gentle way in which he touched her, had given her cause to wonder, for the first time, if what Tom had said was true.</p><p>What if it wasn\u2019t? Could that be possible? With Jason she felt none of the dread she\u2019d felt when Tom had kissed her. His lovemaking had always been so hurried, so raw, as if he were in a rush to complete the act so he could turn away from her. She couldn\u2019t imagine Jason being anything but compassionate and tender.</p><p>But what if all the things Tom had said were true? Her heart slowed with uneasiness. Jason Manning was an attractive, sensual man. A passionate man. And he\u2019d expect\u2014no, he\u2019d need\u2014a passionate woman.</p><p>Thinking of her years with Tom conjured up such ugly images in her mind. His taunts echoed like the constant sound of waves in a seashell, never stopping, never fading, always there to remind her of what a failure she was.</p><p>At ten, Charlotte turned out the lights, made sure Carrie was off the phone and went to bed. She should\u2019ve guessed that sleep would escape her that night.</p> <p>You\u2019re perfect, Jason had said.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t\u2014Tom had made certain she knew as much. The need to weep welled up within her, tightening her throat.</p><p>She had loved Tom. She\u2019d hated him.</p><p>He had stripped her of her pride when he left.</p><p>Her life had ended that day. Yet, in other ways, her life had begun.</p><p>She\u2019d known for weeks, months, that Tom was involved with another woman, and she\u2019d said nothing because she was afraid. Because she feared life alone. Because she was willing to do whatever she could to save her marriage, even if that meant denying the truth. So she\u2019d chosen to believe his lies.</p> <p>When he\u2019d forced her to face reality, he\u2019d come at her in anger and guilt...and hate. She hadn\u2019t cried. Not a single tear, not even when the divorce was decreed final. It wasn\u2019t until years later that she gave herself permission to grieve for the marriage, the fantasy she\u2019d built in her mind of what might have been.</p><p>In the beginning she\u2019d been too numb with shock, too dazed by that last horrible scene, to experience any emotion. Gradually, as time passed, Charlotte began to feel again, a little at a time. It was like an anesthetic wearing off. As the years went by, as the numbness faded, she had to deal with the pain. A throbbing, savage pain.</p><p>Her grief came in waves. Regret struck first, reminding her of all the might-have-beens; one fantasy led to another. By now they would\u2019ve had more children, she\u2019d told herself. Tom would be established in his career and she\u2019d be living the life she\u2019d been cheated of as a child.</p><p>Anger followed regret. How could she have given her heart to a man who\u2019d ravaged her self-respect? How could she have loved him when he\u2019d treated her so poorly? But love him she had, so much that she still ached at losing the life she\u2019d dreamed they\u2019d share.</p><p>But mostly, as the years went on, Charlotte felt an overwhelming sense of guilt. She knew it was unreasonable. After all, it was Tom who\u2019d cheated on her, Tom who\u2019d walked out on his family, abandoned his wife and child. It was Tom who\u2019d forsaken their vows. Yet she was the one who accepted responsibility.</p><p>Sometimes the guilt was so overpowering, Charlotte found it intolerable. If she\u2019d been a better wife, Tom wouldn\u2019t have sought another woman. He\u2019d said so himself. If she\u2019d been more enticing, more sexual, more attractive, more satisfying, he wouldn\u2019t have done it. She was too thin, too flat, too cold. The list was endless.</p><p>After years of telling herself that Tom had used her inadequacies as an excuse for adultery, years of struggling to repair her self-esteem, Charlotte gave up. Surrendered. She bought it all. The reassurances she tried to offer herself were empty. Null and void.</p><p>Everything Tom had said was true. She was a failure as a woman. A failure as a wife. No man would ever be satisfied with her. Not for long. Tom hadn\u2019t been and Jason wouldn\u2019t be, either. She might as well accept that now and stop fighting the inevitable.</p> <p>The doorbell chimed just as Jason finished reading the latest issue of one of the veterinary periodicals he subscribed to.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, opening the door, half expecting one of his tenants.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Carrie said, striding purposefully into his apartment. \u201cHave you got a minute to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jason led the way into the living room and sat down. Carrie started to pace in front of his television, hands behind her back. Walking in his apartment was dangerous with the week\u2019s worth of newspapers spread across the carpet.</p><p>\u201cIs it Higgins?\u201d he prompted, when she didn\u2019t speak right away.</p><p>She shook her head, eyes lighting up. \u201cHiggins is doing great. He\u2019s eating and everything. I think he likes it with Mom and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d They\u2019d lavished the dog with love and attention from the moment Jason had carried him into their apartment on Monday afternoon. One would\u2019ve thought the mutt was some kind of hero. In a way he was, Jason decided. If it hadn\u2019t been for the dog, Jason didn\u2019t know how long it would have taken him and Charlotte to connect.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mom,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d He saw that tears had pooled in Carrie\u2019s eyes, and she wasn\u2019t trying to hide the fact. Like most men, Jason was uncomfortable when a woman started to cry. No matter what the cause, he felt personally responsible. And he felt an overpowering urge to do whatever he could to rectify the problem.</p><p>He certainly felt that way with Charlotte\u2014even more so. She\u2019d look at him with her beautiful blue eyes and the instant he saw the slightest hint of tears, he\u2019d be putty in her hands. He was putty in her hands, anyway, tears or not, but that was because it was Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s ruining my life,\u201d Carrie was saying.</p><p>Jason was no psychiatrist, but he wasn\u2019t completely obtuse. \u201cDoes this have something to do with that dance?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s this boy...his name\u2019s Brad. He\u2019s the cutest boy in class and the star of the track team. Every girl in school\u2019s crazy about him and he asked me. Me,\u201d she emphasized again, bringing her hand to her heart. \u201cHe asked me to the ninth-grade dance. When I talked to Mom, she said I could go, but when I said Brad\u2019s father was picking us up and...and driving us there, she went totally weird on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mother has a good reason for feeling the way she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t even talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, listen. I\u2019d like to help, but this is between you and your mother. I can\u2019t interfere with a parenting decision.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded, her throat working as she struggled not to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to interfere...I was hoping that you\u2019d help me\u2014tell me what to say to make Mom understand how old-fashioned she\u2019s being. I haven\u2019t said anything to Brad about my mom not wanting me to be in the same car as him and his dad and...and the dance is next Friday night. There isn\u2019t much time left.\u201d</p><p>Jason rubbed the side of his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mother\u2019s primary objection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks driving with him makes it a real date. And I\u2019m not allowed to date until next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What if she drove you and Brad to the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, either.... Everyone will think I asked him and...it might be silly, but I want Suzie Jennings to know otherwise.\u201d She wiped her eyes and took a moment to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cHow about if Brad\u2019s dad drops you off and your mother picks the two of you up after the dance?\u201d</p><p>Carrie dropped her hands to her side. \u201cPicks us up?\u201d she repeated thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be considered a date then, would it? The two of you obviously need to be driven to and from the dance and this would simply be a means of transporting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a party at Amanda Emerich\u2019s house right afterward, but it\u2019s directly across the street from the school and everyone\u2019s invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an even better idea,\u201d Jason said enthusiastically. At Carrie\u2019s blank stare, he explained. \u201cHow about if your mother offered to chaperone the dance?\u201d</p><p>Judging by the look Carrie gave him, she didn\u2019t share his enthusiasm. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work because she\u2019d need a date. Chaperones at our school dances are always couples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with her,\u201d Jason said casually. As soon as he made the suggestion, he wanted to jerk it back. Him dancing? The last dance he\u2019d attended had been his sister\u2019s engagement party. He\u2019d rented a tuxedo and been miserable most of the night. Before then, his only other experience on the dance floor had been as a high-school junior. He didn\u2019t know how to dance then and he hadn\u2019t learned since.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Carrie asked, her voice rising. For the first time since she\u2019d entered his home, her eyes sparkled with hope.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Oh, what the heck, he\u2019d do it if it would help the kid. \u201cSure,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019d volunteer to be a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>Carrie let out a cry of glee and raced across the room to throw her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cYour mother might not be willing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Carrie said confidently. \u201cMom\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but will she be crazy about the idea of Brad\u2019s dad driving you there and the two of us taking you home?\u201d</p><p>Carrie mulled that over for a moment. \u201cOf course she will,\u201d she said, revealing no doubt. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she be? It\u2019s a wonderful compromise. We\u2019ll both be satisfied.... I mean, this plan isn\u2019t perfect\u2014no one wants their mother chaperoning a school dance\u2014but it\u2019ll work because Mom\u2019s going to agree when she knows you suggested it.\u201d</p><p>Jason was suffering from second thoughts when he rang Charlotte\u2019s doorbell an hour later. Carrie had devised a plan for approaching Charlotte with his idea. At the appropriate point, he was to suggest the two of them chaperone the dance and make it sound like a spur-of-the-moment idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was rather proud of his compromise\u2014not the part about chaperoning the dance, but the shared-driving idea. By the time Carrie had left his apartment, he felt like an expert. Raising children wasn\u2019t so difficult if you applied a bit of common sense.</p><p>Now, though, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure he should get involved. The dance was an issue between Charlotte and Carrie, and his instincts told him he was trespassing.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been different if Charlotte had come to him for advice, but she hadn\u2019t and he doubted she would. There wasn\u2019t any reason for her to, at least not with regard to Carrie. Charlotte was the one with parenting experience, not him.</p><p>Despite his second thoughts over his role in this drama, he\u2019d agreed to help Carrie\u2014even though his instincts now told him he was going to regret this.</p> <p>Carrie answered the doorbell and smiled brightly when she saw him.</p><p>Charlotte looked pleased to see him, too, but she also looked like she\u2019d rather not be. Jason was learning to read her quite well, and that skill was coming in handy.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jason,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHi. I stopped by to see how Higgins is doing.\u201d A weak excuse, and one she was bound to see through in the next couple of minutes.</p><p>The black dog trotted toward him, his tail wagging slowly. Jason squatted beside him and affectionately rubbed his ears. \u201cHow do you like your new home, fellow?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want a cup of coffee?\u201d Carrie called out from the kitchen. Her voice was enthusiastic. The kid wasn\u2019t any better at disguising her emotions than her mother was.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Jason glanced up at Charlotte. He didn\u2019t know what was going on with her lately. She\u2019d been avoiding him\u2014that much he understood\u2014but he was willing to give her the space she needed. For now. He was a patient man. She was attracted to him, fighting it as hard as she could, but her resistance wasn\u2019t strong enough to defeat him.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Jason had met a woman who needed him. Unfortunately she was too self-sufficient and proud to admit it. Charlotte Weston brought out all his protective urges. And his intuition told him he\u2019d begun to bring out qualities in her\u2014a sensual confidence and an ability to laugh, have fun\u2014that she\u2019d been repressing for years.</p><p>The woman was a puzzle, but slowly, surely, he was putting together the various pieces she revealed. Once he had the whole picture, he\u2019d be able to scale those defensive walls of hers.</p><p>He strongly suspected Charlotte\u2019s problems revolved around her ex-husband and her marriage. She\u2019d been badly hurt, and gaining her trust and her love would require time and patience. Where Charlotte was concerned, Jason had an abundant supply of both. Carrie brought him a cup of coffee, and Jason pulled out a kitchen chair, then nonchalantly sat down. Carrie did the same. Higgins ambled over and settled at his feet.</p><p>Charlotte glanced at the two of them and frowned. \u201cIs something going on here that I should know about?\u201d</p> <p>The kid couldn\u2019t have been more obvious, Jason mused again. \u201cCarrie came to me earlier this afternoon,\u201d he announced, deciding honesty was the best policy, after all. The way he figured, if they were forthright about what they\u2019d discussed, then Charlotte might be willing to forgive them for discussing it behind her back.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d Carrie muttered a warning under her breath.</p><p>\u201cCarrie came to you?\u201d Charlotte demanded. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dance,\u201d Carrie admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou went to Jason about an issue that\u2019s strictly between you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to talk to someone,\u201d Carrie cried, pushing back the chair when she stood. She faced her mother, feet braced apart, hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re being completely unreasonable and Jason agrees with me. He came up with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d Jason could see he\u2019d been wrong. In this case, honesty might not have been the best policy. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever say I thought your mother was unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>His defense came too late. Charlotte whirled on him, her face red and growing redder. Her eyes, the eyes he\u2019d always found so intriguing, were filled with disdain.</p> <p>\u201cWho gave you the right to intrude in my life?\u201d she flared.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d Jason could feel himself sinking waist-deep in the quicksand of regret.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re undermining my authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...please, hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, give me a chance to explain.\u201d Jason didn\u2019t have much of an argument; he should\u2019ve listened to his instincts and stayed out of this.</p><p>\u201cYou may think because...because I\u2019ve let you get close to Carrie and me that you have the right to express your opinion on how she should be raised, but you\u2019re wrong. What goes on between my daughter and me is none of your business. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Feeling all the more chagrined, Jason nodded. The best thing to do now was make a hasty retreat. \u201cI can see I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s voice trembled as she pointed to her door.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Carrie shouted. \u201cThe least you can do is listen to him.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte ignored her daughter while Jason, calling himself every kind of fool, made his way out of the apartment. He paused long enough to cast an apologetic glance at Carrie, but he agreed with Charlotte. He\u2019d butted in where he didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>After Jason\u2019s departure, Carrie went to her room, slamming her door with such force Higgins scrambled across the living room, frantically looking for a place to hide.</p><p>Charlotte was so angry, it was all she could do not to follow Jason and tell him she never wanted to see him again. She would have done it, too, if she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d regret it later. And if she didn\u2019t need to coax Higgins out from behind the couch and comfort him.</p><p>The man had some nerve! If Carrie thought she was going to manipulate her into giving in by getting Jason to side with her, then her daughter was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize what you\u2019ve just done!\u201d Carrie shouted as she opened her door.</p><p>Still stroking Higgins, Charlotte ignored her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve insulted Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your language, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Thirty silent minutes passed while Charlotte cooled her temper. Carrie was apparently doing the same thing. A short while later, her bedroom door opened again and she walked out. She was pale and her eyes showed evidence of crying, but she appeared to have composed herself.</p><p>The same didn\u2019t hold true for Charlotte. She was still furious. How dare Jason involve himself in her affairs!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called Brad,\u201d Carrie announced, opening the refrigerator. She stared at the contents, took out a cold pop and pulled back the tab. After taking one long drink, she turned to face Charlotte. \u201cBrad said he\u2019d tell his dad you\u2019d be driving us to and from the dance.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things Charlotte might have expected, this wasn\u2019t one. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, feeling only a little better.</p><p>\u201cI...was hoping you\u2019d be willing to split the duties. Let Brad\u2019s father drive us there and you pick us up.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte mulled it over. That didn\u2019t sound so unreasonable. She\u2019d have a chance to meet the boy\u2019s father when he came to get Carrie, and it wasn\u2019t as if the two kids would be alone in the car\u2014or at the dance.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019d be willing to agree to that.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte thought Carrie would be grateful or relieved; instead she broke into giant hiccuping sobs. Her daughter slumped in a kitchen chair and buried her face in her arms and wept as if she\u2019d lost her best friend.</p><p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d Charlotte placed her hand on Carrie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and brushed the tears from her face, her shoulders heaving with the effort to stop crying. \u201cYou should never have said those things to Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, he intruded in my affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was the one who asked him to talk to you. If you\u2019re going to be angry with anyone, it should be me, not him.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte realized Carrie didn\u2019t understand the nuances of a male-female relationship. Frankly, she wasn\u2019t that well acquainted with them herself. She\u2019d admit that she\u2019d reacted in anger, but it was justified. Jason had simply assumed too much.</p><p>\u201cBut Jason didn\u2019t want to interfere,\u201d Carrie sobbed. \u201cIt took me forever to get him to agree and...and he only did it because I was desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe overstepped the bounds.\u201d Charlotte tried to remain adamant.</p><p>\u201cYou made him leave without even bothering to listen.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI like Jason\u2014and you do, too,\u201d Carrie added unnecessarily. \u201cHe\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to us. Higgins is alive because of him and...and he took us to meet his family. Saturday was the most fun day I\u2019ve ever had. It...it was like we belonged with Jason and his brothers.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had felt the same way.</p><p>\u201cJason wasn\u2019t minding your business, Mom, at least not the way you think. He...he was helping a friend. Me. And you hated him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate Jason.\u201d Far from it. She was falling in love with him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who came up with the idea of Brad\u2019s father driving one way and you driving the other. He...he suggested you chaperone the dance just so you\u2019d feel comfortable about everything.\u201d She drew in a shaky breath. \u201cWhen I told him you\u2019d need a date for the dance if you were going to be a chaperone, he said he\u2019d take you. I mean, Jason isn\u2019t the kind of man who dances...but he\u2019d be willing to do it, for me, because he\u2019s my friend. And for you, too, so you\u2019d be comfortable at the dance. And what did he get for being so nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy anger,\u201d Charlotte whispered, feeling wretched.</p><p>\u201cYou kicked him out of the house, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever want to come back. I know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat down next to her daughter, feeling strangely like weeping herself.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to go to the dance with Brad more than anything,\u201d Carrie admitted, \u201cbut now I don\u2019t care if I do or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, this isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like Jason,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cWhen I asked him if he\u2019d ask you out, I did it for selfish reasons, and I apologize for that...but I\u2019m glad I did it. You\u2019re happier when you\u2019re with him, Mom. You don\u2019t think I notice, but I do. Jason makes you smile and laugh and forget how much you don\u2019t like your job.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte folded her arms around her middle. What Carrie said was true. It was as if her life had started all over again when Jason first kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the dance anymore,\u201d Carrie murmured. \u201cBut I care what happens with you and Jason. Go to him, Mom. Tell him you\u2019re sorry. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s entreaty affected Charlotte more than any regrets she might feel about what she\u2019d said and done. For one thing, she hadn\u2019t realized how fond Carrie was of Jason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you do it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Charlotte long to decide. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. She would apologize, for not giving him the benefit of the doubt, for not being willing to listen to him and Carrie, but mostly for the rude way in which she\u2019d told him to leave her apartment.</p><p>It was the second time she\u2019d had to apologize to this man.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Carrie asked.</p> <p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Charlotte promised.</p><p>The opportunity came the following morning. After walking Higgins, Charlotte was on her way to the office, crossing the parking lot. She\u2019d spent a sleepless night composing what she intended to say to Jason. She\u2019d wait until that evening, go to his apartment and say what needed to be said.</p><p>She was halfway to her car when she heard her name. Her heart filled with dread when she saw Jason jogging toward her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, feeling wretched.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you.\u201d His eyes bore into hers. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019m sorry for what happened yesterday. I should never have gotten involved. This is between you and Carrie, and I was out of line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should never have spoken to you the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were angry and you had every right to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you...Oh, Jason, I feel terrible.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy should you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie told me how you were willing to help chaperone the dance and...and I didn\u2019t have the common decency to hear you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best. I\u2019m not much of a dancer.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte smiled up at him, knowing her heart shone in her eyes, and not caring. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me find that out for myself Friday night?\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cYou need to borrow a suit?\u201d Rich asked, looking smugly amused as he led Jason to the walk-in closet in the huge master bedroom. The home had been built several years earlier, when Jamie was pregnant with Bethany. Rich himself had designed the sprawling L-shaped rambler that overlooked Puget Sound, and he was justifiably proud.</p><p>\u201cYes, I need to borrow a suit,\u201d Jason muttered, not giving his brother the satisfaction of explaining. Already he regretted having volunteered to be a chaperone for this dance. No matter how hard he tried, he wasn\u2019t going to be whirling around a dance floor as if he knew what he was doing. He\u2019d probably make a fool of himself in front of Charlotte and a bunch of smart-aleck ninth-graders.</p><p>As an engineer, Rich was required to dress more formally on the job than Jason was. Jason owned a suit, but it was outdated. Maybe if he waited a few more years it would become fashionable again.</p><p>If the truth be known, he wasn\u2019t even sure when he\u2019d last worn it. Sometime in college, he guessed. He\u2019d buy another one if he thought he\u2019d get any use out of it, but that didn\u2019t seem likely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need a suit for?\u201d Rich asked outright.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be borrowing one if I\u2019d known I was going to face an inquisition.\u201d</p> <p>Rich chuckled, clearly enjoying Jason\u2019s discomfort. \u201cI just want to be sure you aren\u2019t going to run off and marry Charlotte. Mom would kill you if you pulled a stunt like that.\u201d</p><p>Jason snickered, hoping to give the impression that marriage was the farthest thing from his mind, which it was. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t act like it couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Rich said, pushing hangers aside as he sorted through several tailored jackets. \u201cWith our family\u2019s history, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard-of for you to elope.\u201d</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t argue with that. It had all started with Taylor. A few years back, his sister had moved to Montana and within three months had married Russ Palmer. The decision to marry had apparently been impulsive\u2014and it happened while they were chaperoning the high-school drill team in Reno. The deed was done by the time they bothered to contact any family.</p><p>Jason frowned. Taylor had been a chaperone, too, and look where it had led. This high-school dance was beginning to sound more and more dangerous.</p><p>Christy had married on the sly, too, again without telling anyone in the family. There were extenuating circumstances in her case, however. Well, sort of. His youngest sister had actually been engaged\u2014to a lawyer, James Wilkens\u2014when she\u2019d gone to Idaho with Cody Franklin and married him. Their marriage had caused quite a ruckus in the family, but eventually everything had been smoothed over. Anyway, Christy was much better suited to Cody than to James, although the attorney had remained a good family friend.</p><p>Rich had followed suit, marrying Jamie with some idiotic idea of being a sperm donor for her baby. Jason had stood up for his brother, but he\u2019d known from the beginning that the two of them were in love. He\u2019d predicted that this sperm donor business wouldn\u2019t pan out, and he\u2019d been right. Jamie had gotten pregnant, sooner than either of them had expected, and the process hadn\u2019t involved any artificial insemination, either.</p><p>Paul had been next. Diane, Paul\u2019s first wife, had died tragically, shortly after giving birth to Kelsey. Her loss had sent the family reeling. For six months, Paul had shunned his family\u2019s offers of help, attempting to balance his duties at home with his job and at the same time comfort his grieving children, all preschoolers. He\u2019d been proud and angry. Leah, Diane\u2019s sister, had convinced him he couldn\u2019t continue alone. She\u2019d given up her teaching position at the college and moved in with Paul and the children. Shortly afterward, they were married. But once again, no one in the family was informed of the ceremony.</p><p>The only single Manning left was Jason, and he didn\u2019t plan to get married. He\u2019d decided that years before. It was unfortunate that his parents had been cheated out of putting on a large wedding, but those were the breaks. He wasn\u2019t marching down any aisle just to satisfy his mother\u2019s need to work with caterers and some florist friend she\u2019d known for years.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jase,\u201d Rich said casually, breaking into his thoughts. \u201cHow are things with you and Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine?\u201d Rich repeated, with that smug look Jason found so irritating.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to concern yourself with my affairs,\u201d Jason said, resenting the way Rich and Paul made his love life their business.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ask her to marry you?\u201d Almost in afterthought, Rich held up a well-cut gray suit coat. The tailoring was excellent and the material was top of the line.</p><p>Jason ignored the question and reached for the jacket, trying it on over his black T-shirt with Seattle at Night silk-screened across the front.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your intentions toward Charlotte?\u201d Rich asked with a pensive frown. He sounded oddly formal\u2014and unusually serious.</p><p>\u201cMy intentions are my own, but since you asked,\u201d Jason said, turning around to admire his profile in the full-length mirror, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.... They\u2019re dishonorable, as always.\u201d He tried to make a joke of it, laugh off the attraction he\u2019d been battling from the moment he\u2019d met Charlotte Weston over a leaky faucet.</p><p>His joke, however, fell decidedly flat.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, big brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Jason demanded. He didn\u2019t like his brother sticking his nose where it didn\u2019t belong, but he couldn\u2019t help being curious about Rich\u2019s remark.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Jason returned flippantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever invited a woman to watch you play softball.\u201d</p><p>Rich made it sound as if that alone was enough to force him into a shotgun wedding. Jason refused to get into an argument with his younger brother. It wouldn\u2019t do him any good. Just because Rich and Jamie were so happy together, his brother seemed to think he was an expert on the subject of love and marriage. Jason didn\u2019t want to be the one to disillusion him.</p><p>Perhaps he did have some deep affection for Charlotte, Jason told himself. He\u2019d be the first to admit he was strongly attracted to her, but marriage? Out of the question.</p><p>This was a familiar argument, one he\u2019d worked through early in their relationship. It had worried him then, but he\u2019d been so fascinated with her that he\u2019d pushed his apprehensions to the back of his mind, deciding to take one day at a time.</p><p>He\u2019d face one hurdle, he decided, before he confronted another. For now, the obstacle was their physical relationship. When she trusted him enough to put aside her fears and allow him to make love to her, it would be time to reevaluate what was happening between them. But not yet.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me borrow the suit or not?\u201d Jason asked stiffly. \u201cIf I have to stand here and listen to a lecture, too, I\u2019d rather go to the rental shop.\u201d</p><p>He half expected Rich to jerk the coat off his shoulders and send him on his way. Instead, his youngest brother grinned, as if he knew something Jason didn\u2019t. It was another irritating habit of his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to keep the suit as long as you like,\u201d Rich assured him. \u201cYou never know when you\u2019re suddenly going to need one.\u201d</p><p>Friday evening came, and it took Jason a full half hour to knot his tie correctly. He was out of practice, and getting it just right frustrated him. He should\u2019ve borrowed the clip-on variety, but he hadn\u2019t thought of asking for one. No doubt Rich had plenty of each type.</p><p>Surveying his reflection in the mirror, he barely recognized himself. He was tall, besting his brothers by an inch or more, his shoulders were wide and, if he had anything to be proud of physically, it was that his stomach had remained flat. Haphazard meals and baseball did that for a man.</p><p>Charlotte probably wouldn\u2019t recognize him, either. If memory served, it was the first time she\u2019d gone anywhere with him when he wasn\u2019t wearing a baseball cap. He brushed his hand along the side of his head, making sure his hair stayed flat. He carefully examined himself to see if he could find any gray hairs for a more distinguished look. When he didn\u2019t, he was actually disappointed.</p><p>He checked his watch. If everything had gone according to schedule, Carrie would have been picked up fifteen minutes ago for a pre-dance buffet. Since the dance didn\u2019t start for another two hours, Jason had suggested taking Charlotte out to dinner.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what had gotten into him lately. He\u2019d made reservations at an expensive restaurant, and ordered a fancy corsage to give her when they arrived.</p><p>Normally, his idea of a night on the town included pizza, beer and a Mariners\u2019 game. Drag an irresistible woman into his life, and before he knew it, he was forking out major bucks for dinner and flowers. The thing was, he\u2019d come up with the idea on his own and was even excited about it, knowing how pleased Charlotte would be.</p><p>He\u2019d seen this happen with his friends\u2014his brothers, too\u2014but he would never have believed he\u2019d fall such willing prey to a woman\u2019s charms. It wouldn\u2019t have happened with anyone but Charlotte. Of that, he was certain.</p><p>At exactly seven, he walked over to Charlotte\u2019s apartment and rang the bell. She kept him waiting for several minutes before she opened the door\u2014not a promising sign. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she finally did come, Jason was about to complain. He was going to a lot of trouble for this blasted dance; the least she could do was be ready on time.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d intended to say, however, flew out of his mind when he saw Charlotte. For the longest moment of his life, he stood there immobile.</p><p>This was Charlotte! She was...stunning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry,\u201d she said, sounding flustered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to keep you standing out here, but I\u2019m having a problem with this dress.\u201d</p> <p>She was beautiful.</p><p>The word didn\u2019t begin to describe how breathtaking she looked. Her hair was done in a way he\u2019d never seen before, swirled to one side, exposing the smooth skin of her cheek and her long, slender neck. Dangling gold earrings swung from her ears. Her eyes were a brighter blue than ever before, the color of the sky washed clean by a summer squall. Her dress was a paler shade of blue...Her dress...Jason\u2019s gaze slid over the sleeveless dress with its tight bodice and flared skirt, and an invisible hand seemed to appear out of thin air and knock him senseless.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d Her eyes implored him as she held one hand behind her back. \u201cIs something wrong? I look terrible, don\u2019t I? Don\u2019t worry about hurting my feelings...This dress is too fancy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was all he could do to close his mouth. \u201cYou look...fabulous.\u201d Which was the understatement of the century. Jason felt sorry that he wasn\u2019t more sophisticated and urbane.</p><p>If he had been, he might have told her how exquisite she was. He might have found the words to say he\u2019d gladly rework the knot in his tie for another hour if it meant he could spend the evening with her. For the first time since he\u2019d donned the suit jacket, he felt no remorse for volunteering to escort Charlotte to her daughter\u2019s dance.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get the zipper all the way up,\u201d Charlotte explained. \u201cI was so busy helping Carrie get ready before Brad and his father arrived that I...I didn\u2019t get dressed myself, and now I can\u2019t reach the zipper. Would you mind?\u201d</p><p>She presented him with her back and it was all Jason could do to pull the tab up instead of down. If he went on instinct he\u2019d have had her out of that dress, in his arms and on the way to the bedroom. He couldn\u2019t recall a time he\u2019d wanted a woman more than he did Charlotte Weston right then and there.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder when he delayed.</p><p>His hand felt clammy, and at first his fingers refused to cooperate, but with some effort he managed to do as she asked, sliding the zipper up her back.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what a madhouse it\u2019s been around here,\u201d she went on. \u201cCarrie was so nervous. She looked so grown-up. I can\u2019t believe my baby isn\u2019t a baby anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jason returned her smile. \u201cMy mother felt the same way when Christy\u2014my sister\u2014attended her first big dance.\u201d</p> <p>Even now, Jason was having trouble forming coherent sentences.</p><p>\u201cThe dress isn\u2019t mine,\u201d she told him as she searched for her evening bag, wandering from one room to the next until she located it. \u201cI borrowed it from one of my friends at the office...It\u2019s too close to the end of the month to go out and buy one.\u201d She sighed, sounding breathless. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had the extra money, I doubt I would\u2019ve been able to find one at the last minute. I\u2019d feel dreadful if something happened to Cheryl\u2019s dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI borrowed the suit from my brother.\u201d Maintaining an intelligible conversation, he discovered, wasn\u2019t as much of a problem as keeping his eyes off her.</p><p>Charlotte drew in a deep, steadying breath. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but I\u2019m as nervous as Carrie.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, trying to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cThe last dance I attended was in college,\u201d she said. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know if I can dance anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly light on my feet, Charlotte,\u201d Jason felt obliged to remind her. He\u2019d warned her earlier, but he doubted she\u2019d taken him seriously.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should practice?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She was gazing up at him with wide eyes. Jason would\u2019ve given everything he owned to find out if she was feeling anything close to the emotional havoc he was.</p><p>\u201cPractice?\u201d he echoed. \u201cThat\u2019s an idea.\u201d He swallowed, wondering exactly what he was inviting. Trouble with a capital T, considering the way his body was reacting.</p><p>Charlotte set aside her evening bag and walked into his embrace. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not going to be very good at this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Hey, as far as I\u2019m concerned, those ninth-graders are going to dance circles around us anyway.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s laugh sounded sweet and soft, and Jason\u2019s heart constricted. Could this be love? This pleasure he felt in doing small things for her\u2014like the dinner and flowers? This need to hold her in his arms? This desire to be with her and her alone?</p><p>The feel of Charlotte\u2019s body against his was the purest form of torture he\u2019d ever experienced. She fit in his arms as though she belonged there. Had always belonged there. He tried to ignore how right it felt.</p><p>And couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He tried to ignore the fragrance of wildflowers that whispered through her hair whenever she moved her head.</p><p>And didn\u2019t.</p><p>He tried, but failed.</p><p>Everything went fairly well for the first few minutes. At least he wasn\u2019t stepping on her feet. Then Jason realized their feet weren\u2019t moving and they were staring at each other more than they were dancing. Gazing at each other with starry-eyed wonder.</p><p>He shifted his hand upward, wanting to lessen the feeling of intimacy, but his fingers inadvertently grazed the skin of her upper back.</p><p>Either he kissed her now or he\u2019d regret it the rest of the night. Either he continued the pretense or confessed openly to how vulnerable she made him feel.</p><p>He brought her closer to him. He could feel her heart racing, echoing his own. Once he kissed her, he knew there\u2019d be no stopping. Not this time.</p><p>He lowered his head ever so slightly and waited.</p><p>Charlotte sighed, closed her eyes and lifted her mouth enticingly to his. He suspected she was unconscious of what she was doing, what she was seeking.</p><p>Frankly, Jason didn\u2019t care. He was so hungry for the taste of her, nothing mattered. His mouth found hers and he groaned. Charlotte did, too.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t touched her in days, wanting to give her time, give himself time to define the boundaries of their relationship. It had been too long. He felt so needy he trembled.</p><p>The kiss was long, slow, deliberate.</p><p>Slowly, reluctantly dragging his mouth from hers, he created a small distance between them. Her eyes slowly fluttered open and met his.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Charlotte.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be any plainer than that. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Emotion flickered in her gaze. Was it fear? Pain? Jason found it impossible to tell.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d His hands were in her hair. By the time she lifted her mouth from his, Jason was melting with a need so powerful it throbbed within him.</p><p>Charlotte sighed into the hollow of his throat. \u201cJason, will you be angry with me?\u201d</p><p>He saw the emotions assailing her, but noted the dignified way in which she tilted her chin and the proud squaring of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. Visibly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you made dinner reservations for seven-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He recognized her fear and tried to ignore his own disappointment.</p><p>Self-conscious now, Charlotte broke away, quietly adjusting her clothes, then retrieved her evening bag. It wasn\u2019t until she looked up at him that he saw the anguish in her eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what her ex-husband\u2014he assumed it was her ex-husband\u2014had done. Her gaze linked with his, regret and misery so evident it was all he could do not to reach for her again. To comfort, not to kiss. To offer her solace, not passion.</p><p>Now, more than ever, Jason was determined to discover how her ex-husband had hurt her so badly. Determined to help her recover and teach her how beautiful love could be.</p><p>Charlotte was shaken to her very core. The intensity of their kisses had grown fervent and passionate, near the point of no return. If she\u2019d given him the least bit of encouragement, he would have carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>For one wild moment, she\u2019d been tempted to let him. Then the haze of desire had faded enough for sanity to return.</p><p>She felt grateful that Jason had allowed her to regain her senses, had given her the option to stop or proceed. Not like Tom...</p><p>Charlotte was jarred by this latest exchange even more than the other times Jason had held her and kissed her.</p><p>He\u2019d almost made her forget.</p><p>Since her divorce, Charlotte had been content in her own small, secure world. The world she\u2019d so carefully constructed for herself and Carrie. It had been the two of them, prevailing against all odds, forging a life together. The borders of her world had been narrow and confining, but Charlotte had made peace with that, had accepted its limitations.</p><p>Then a series of events had thrown her into confusion. It had all started at the baby shower for her friend Kathy Crenshaw. Charlotte had held the newborn in her arms and the longing she\u2019d managed to ignore all these years had struck her full-force.</p><p>Shortly afterward she\u2019d met Jason, and her life hadn\u2019t been the same since.</p><p>Because of Jason, she\u2019d recognized how restricted her world had become. How limited. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019d shown her glimpses of a life she\u2019d never dared hope existed. He\u2019d taught her to dream, to believe in the impossible.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>After a protracted farewell to Higgins, they went out to the parking lot. Jason opened the car door and helped her inside, then stood in the fresh air for several minutes, hands in his coat pockets. He closed his eyes and turned his face toward the night sky.</p><p>Charlotte knew it was difficult for a man to cut the lovemaking off as abruptly as they\u2019d done. He needed a few minutes to compose himself.</p><p>She watched him as he climbed into the car. He hesitated after inserting the key into the ignition and smiled over at her. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cAre you...all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever finer,\u201d he assured her, then clasped her hand to kiss her knuckles.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Jason Manning was a romantic. Beneath that I-don\u2019t-give-a-damn attitude was a tenderness and warmth that left Charlotte feeling like a starry-eyed adolescent. The candlelight dinner at an elegant cliffside restaurant had been wonderful. There he\u2019d given her a fragrant rosebud corsage that was so lovely, it had brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>The dance had been the best part of their evening. They\u2019d had a delightful time, despite being surrounded by ninth-graders and forced to endure an earsplitting mixture of songs.</p><p>Jason and Charlotte had discovered early on that they weren\u2019t going to be able to dance to rap music. After a number of hilarious attempts, they\u2019d given up. Several of their efforts had left Charlotte laughing so hard, her ribs ached.</p><p>Jason had been equally amused, and after their unsuccessful attempts to blend in with the kids, he\u2019d reached for Charlotte, guiding her into his arms. She\u2019d draped her wrists loosely around his neck and he placed his hands on her hips. Then they\u2019d invented their own dance.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Charlotte knew Carrie had risked her \u201ccool\u201d status, her daughter had come to her, eyes bright with excitement, to confess it wasn\u2019t so bad having her mother chaperone a dance, after all.</p><p>After the dance, while Carrie and Brad attended the nearby party, Charlotte and Jason sat outside in the schoolyard, gazing at the stars, laughing and kissing. Not the passionate, soul-deep kisses of earlier, but tender, sweet ones. By the end of the evening the barriers surrounding her heart had started to crumble.</p><p>Charlotte and Carrie came home at a respectable hour, their heads filled with romance. With barely a word, they wandered off to bed, passing each other like sleepwalkers in the hall.</p><p>Several hours later, Charlotte, unable to sleep, wrapped her memories around her like a cloak. Not since her own schooldays had she been more at ease with a man. In the space of one evening, she\u2019d come to realize\u2014without doubt, fear or regret\u2014that she was deeply in love with Jason Manning.</p> <p>After an hour of savoring every moment, she found she could finally sleep, knowing she\u2019d be with him the next morning when he picked her up for the game.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Mom?\u201d Carrie called happily from the kitchen. It was shortly after ten. \u201cJason\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sucked in her stomach and zipped up her skinny jeans. Then she reached for a clean sweatshirt and tossed it over her head. Jason was already in the kitchen, checking the contents of the picnic basket, when she sauntered in from her bedroom. Her heart did a little dance when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She felt shy, and couldn\u2019t explain it.</p><p>He turned around and their eyes met before he sent her a wide smile. \u201c\u2019Morning.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte opened the refrigerator and withdrew a six-pack of diet soda to add to the cooler.</p><p>\u201cIs that all I get\u2014just a friendly \u2018good morning\u2019?\u201d he asked, keeping his voice low so Carrie wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know the answer to that. I swear, Charlotte, leaving you last night was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d He slipped his arms around her waist and nuzzled his face in the slope of her neck.</p><p>Charlotte twisted around and stared up at him. \u201cIt was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that got me through it was knowing I\u2019d be with you again this morning.\u201d He lowered his mouth to hers, and she parted her lips. The kiss was slow and deep and hot.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, you two are getting ridiculous,\u201d Carrie said from behind Charlotte. \u201cEven Higgins thinks so.\u201d At the last minute, Carrie had convinced her they should bring the dog. Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure he was healed enough to run around the park, but Carrie had phoned Jason and he\u2019d felt it would be all right.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jason asked, picking up the wicker basket, his hand around Charlotte\u2019s waist as though, even now, it was difficult to let her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ready for the last ten minutes,\u201d Carrie said pointedly, holding Higgins\u2019s leash and leading him to Jason\u2019s car.</p><p>On the ride across town, Jason put on a CD and the three of them sang along with Bon Jovi. But as they pulled into the massive parking lot, Jason\u2019s voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing for you to worry about.\u201d He tried to reassure her with a smile, but she wasn\u2019t so easily fooled. She glanced around, wondering what could possibly be amiss. She couldn\u2019t imagine, unless it was a vehicle he happened to recognize.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Higgins for a walk,\u201d Carrie announced as soon as she\u2019d climbed out of the backseat. Charlotte knew her daughter was eager to show off the dog to Ryan, Ronnie and the other children.</p><p>When Jason was opening the trunk of his car and removing his softball equipment, Charlotte spoke.</p> <p>\u201cIs there someone here you\u2019d rather I not meet? An old girlfriend, a former lover?\u201d</p><p>He turned and his gaze met hers. He smiled, a smile that started with his eyes and worked its way down to his mouth. \u201cNothing quite so dramatic. My parents are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said vehemently, and she realized he wanted her with him as much as she wanted to be. A rugged sigh followed his response. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you having to endure another inquisition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, though,\u201d Charlotte assured him. She couldn\u2019t help thinking Jason\u2019s parents must be exceptional people, to have raised such a wonderful family. Before meeting the Manning clan, she\u2019d known so little of what it meant to be part of a family, one in which everyone supported and encouraged one another. Where joys were shared and grief divided. All her life, Charlotte had been on the outside looking in, yearning for that special bond.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to drive you crazy with questions,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I know how to be evasive. You forget, I\u2019m the mother of a teenage daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s laugh was automatic. He grinned over at her, tossed a baseball bat over one shoulder and reached for her hand, linking their fingers. Linking them in a way that would dissolve any doubts.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart sang with a joy that radiated from her heart.</p><p>They strolled casually, hand in hand, across the freshly mowed lawn. Jason\u2019s steps slowed as they approached the playing field.</p><p>Charlotte glanced up to find his eyes on her. \u201cI just pray I can keep from hitting a home run,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Charlotte laughed as they walked toward the older couple talking with Paul and Rich. Jason made the introductions and Charlotte smiled warmly and held her hand out to his parents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cAfter getting to know Jason and his brothers, I can\u2019t help thinking you two must be very special people.\u201d</p><p>Jason waited a restless twenty-four hours for the summons. It arrived Sunday morning, disguised as an invitation to dinner at his parents\u2019 house that same evening. Jason, however, wasn\u2019t fooled. His mother intended to feed him, but he knew he\u2019d be obliged to sing for his supper.</p><p>He showed up promptly at six and was pleased to see that his mother had gone to the trouble of preparing all his favorites. Homemade rolls hot from the oven. Crispy fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, fresh-picked peas. A molded gelatin salad rested in the center of the dining-room table.</p><p>Jason had always been a meat-and-potatoes man, unless he had to cook for himself, which unfortunately he did most evenings. His eating habits were atrocious and he knew it. A homemade dinner like this was a rare treat.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see nearly enough of you,\u201d his mother said, as the three of them sat down at the table.</p><p>Jason noted that she\u2019d set out her best china and silverware, as well as linen napkins and a matching tablecloth. This was going to be a heavy-duty interrogation. And it didn\u2019t look as if he had much chance of escaping before his mother ferreted out the information she wanted.</p><p>His father handed him the platter of chicken and Jason thought he might have read sympathy in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGenerally, when your brothers are here for dinner, I get so involved with the grandchildren,\u201d his mother said conversationally. \u201cYou and I don\u2019t have much of a chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk,\u201d Jason said, reaching for the rolls and adding three to his plate, along with a thick slab of butter and a spoonful of strawberry preserves. His mother would have to wait for her information while he enjoyed his dinner.</p><p>\u201cGravy, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d A look of understanding passed between them.</p><p>\u201cI hardly know what\u2019s going on in your life these days,\u201d his mother continued, undaunted. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a month of Sundays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Elizabeth. Jason was over two weeks ago. Now, let the boy eat. You can drill him about Charlotte later.\u201d</p><p>His father was nothing if not direct. His mother didn\u2019t even pretend to be affronted; she simply sighed and nodded. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d his father muttered, ladling gravy over a modest pile of mashed potatoes. He set the gravy boat aside and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Elizabeth. You\u2019ve been half starving me for months, claiming we\u2019ve got to start eating healthier. I\u2019ve been eating salads and fish and broiled chicken. Now this. I\u2019m beginning to feel like it\u2019s my last dinner before facing the executioner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Jason\u2019s favorite dinner!\u201d Elizabeth declared righteously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled, son,\u201d Eric Manning said, his elbows on the table. \u201cYour mother\u2019s after something big this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, dear,\u201d Jason\u2019s father said contritely, then winked at him.</p><p>If his mouth hadn\u2019t been full of homemade bread, Jason would have laughed. His mother was in quite a mood. His father, too, but he was well aware of the love they shared. They had the kind of relationship he\u2019d always hoped to have with a woman himself. For the first time in his life, he felt that might be possible.</p><p>They ate in relative silence with short discourses from Jason as he answered their questions about the veterinary hospital and his practice. He noticed how carefully his mother steered away from the subject of Charlotte and his social life.</p><p>No sooner had Jason and his father cleared the table than his mother brought out a deep-dish apple pie. Even the dessert was Jason\u2019s favorite.</p><p>While she dished up heaping bowlfuls and added ice cream, his father poured coffee.</p><p>\u201cNow, Eric?\u201d she asked, looking expectantly toward her husband.</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>Jason glanced from his mother to his father, realizing his reprieve was about to end.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do. Jason,\u201d she said, shifting her attention to him, \u201cas you probably know, your father and I are curious about you and Charlotte. Very curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I had that impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both liked her very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a likable person,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you meet her?\u201d</p><p>He finished his pie, tipping the bowl on its side and spooning up the last of the melted ice cream. When he was convinced he\u2019d gotten every drop, he wiped his mouth with the napkin, set it aside and reached for his coffee.</p><p>\u201cShe lives in the apartment complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWidowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to volunteer any more information than necessary.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with her?\u201d</p><p>His mother was going for the jugular. Jason supposed she was entitled to the truth, since she\u2019d gone to so much trouble with this dinner.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The reaction he received was definitely satisfying. His mother\u2019s eyes grew huge, and she glanced excitedly at his father.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious the boy\u2019s in love, Elizabeth. I told you so, didn\u2019t I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it makes all the difference in the world that he\u2019s willing to admit it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte means a lot to me,\u201d Jason added without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to marry her?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice had a breathless, hopeful quality.</p><p>Jason sipped his coffee. He was in love with Charlotte, no question. He woke in the morning and his first thoughts were of her. When he went to bed at night, she was there in his mind, following him into sleep. His whole day was focused on when he\u2019d see her again. Kiss her again.</p> <p>\u201cJason?\u201d his mother urged.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll eventually marry Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn.\u201d His father slapped the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jason, I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d His mother dabbed the corners of her eyes with a napkin. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased,\u201d she said with a sniffle, reaching for her husband\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you two are so happy.\u201d Jason hadn\u2019t talked about marriage with Charlotte yet, but he\u2019d do that in due course. They were still beginning to know each other, feel comfortable together. By next summer at just about this time, they\u2019d be ready to take such a monumental step.</p> <p>\u201cNow this is important, son,\u201d his father said, his eyes serious. \u201cYour mother and I want your word that you\u2019re not going to do what your sisters and Rich and Paul did. In other words, don\u2019t marry Charlotte without the family being there.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth backed her husband up. \u201cI\u2019ve waited all these years for a family wedding and I refuse to be cheated out of my last chance. Do you understand me, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jason said calmly. \u201cWhen Charlotte and I get married, we\u2019ll do it up big, just for you. The whole nine yards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reception, with a dinner and dance?\u201d His mother\u2019s eyes implored him.</p><p>\u201cAs long as Charlotte agrees, and I\u2019m sure she will. She enjoys that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will she mind...my helping with the arrangements?\u201d</p> <p>Jason shrugged. \u201cMy guess is she\u2019d welcome it. She doesn\u2019t have any family of her own, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t care if your mother has her hand in the arrangements or not,\u201d his father muttered. \u201cI just want to be sure you aren\u2019t going to marry Charlotte behind our backs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already promised I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Still, given their family\u2019s history, Jason could understand his parents\u2019 skepticism.</p><p>\u201cSo I have your word on this?\u201d his mother asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cMy word of honor. Only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d His mother looked concerned.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Mom. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was wondering...Once Charlotte and I decide to marry, would you show her how to make fried chicken like yours?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to bother Jason with her problems, but there wasn\u2019t anyone she trusted more, anyone\u2019s opinion she valued as much. Her day at the office had been one of the worst ever. Her boss, Mr. Ward, had been unreasonable and demanding in the past, but his abuse that afternoon had reached an all-time high. He\u2019d shouted at her, called her incompetent, belittled her. And it had been over something that was completely out of her control. A client had left the agency due to a problem with accounting, not anything Charlotte had done, yet she\u2019d taken the brunt of Mr. Ward\u2019s anger. Unfortunately the insurance agency wasn\u2019t large enough to have a Human Resources department, so there was no one to complain to, no recourse to speak of.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. For three years she\u2019d been employed as an executive assistant at the insurance agency. In the beginning she\u2019d enjoyed her job and thrived on the challenge. Then, six months ago, Mr. Beatty, her original boss, had retired, and she\u2019d found his replacement to be the worst kind of supervisor.</p><p>She\u2019d made her decision earlier that afternoon, prepared her letter of resignation and placed it on Mr. Ward\u2019s desk before leaving the office. Although she\u2019d felt confident when she left work, she was vacillating now, uncertain that she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>It always seemed to be like this. She\u2019d become indignant, decide to leave, and later, after her anger had cooled, she\u2019d change her mind. Mr. Ward would seem repentant, try to convince her that his outbursts weren\u2019t personal; they were just his way. She\u2019d start to believe him, at least until the next time.</p><p>Then it occurred to her.</p><p>What kind of woman would allow a man to verbally abuse her like that? What kind of woman allowed herself to be swayed by cheap talk and empty promises? The kind of woman who\u2019d stayed married to Tom Weston for as long as she had, that was who.</p><p>She needed a sounding board, someone who\u2019d listen to her frustration and doubts without casting judgment, without anger. Someone whose self-esteem was strong enough to accept her decisions whether she took his advice or not. Someone like Jason Manning.</p><p>Jason answered the phone immediately, sounding delighted to hear from her.</p><p>\u201cI...I had a crummy day,\u201d she said when he asked. \u201cDo you...would you go for a walk with me?\u201d She considered bringing Higgins, but he was curled up with Carrie on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right over.\u201d</p><p>As Charlotte left, Carrie was talking on the phone with Brad. She hadn\u2019t told her daughter about quitting her job, although she was sure Carrie would cheer her decision.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jason said, kissing her lightly on the lips when she stepped out the door.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes. They joined hands and walked in the direction of the community park several blocks over.</p><p>The evening was beautiful. The fragrance of rhododendrons filled the evening air, mingling with the scent of blooming azaleas. Birds chirped and several people were getting a start on their yard work.</p><p>\u201cI...did something I\u2019m not positive I should have done,\u201d she said, keeping her eyes lowered.</p><p>\u201cWas it illegal?\u201d</p><p>The question made her smile. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why look so grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, grateful they\u2019d arrived at the park. Jason steered her toward an unoccupied bench and they sat down, his hand still holding hers.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t get along with my boss. I\u2019m good at my job\u2014at least I used to be. But now...Mr. Ward makes unreasonable demands and takes out his frustration on whoever\u2019s close at hand. Unfortunately most of the time that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a healthy atmosphere to be working in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Charlotte wasn\u2019t the only employee who felt unhappy. Cheryl was on the verge of giving her notice, too, and so were a couple of the others. It wouldn\u2019t surprise Charlotte if half the office staff left with her.</p><p>\u201cThen you should quit.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound so straightforward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been a quitter. It\u2019s one of the reasons the divorce was so difficult for me. I\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly. She hadn\u2019t meant to drag her marriage into this, lay it out for Jason to examine...yet, perhaps it was time.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Charlotte inhaled deeply, gathering her resolve. \u201cI wrote my two-weeks\u2019 notice this afternoon and left it on Mr. Ward\u2019s desk and now...now I\u2019m having second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you want to continue working at the agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid you won\u2019t be able to find another job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly\u2014there\u2019s always a high demand for executive assistants. It\u2019s just...I know what\u2019s going to happen in the morning. Mr. Ward will arrive and read my letter and call me into his office. He\u2019ll apologize the way he always does. He seems to know exactly what to say, and when he\u2019s through with the apology, he\u2019ll offer me a token raise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if he threw in a bouquet of flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might. He has before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be swayed by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o.\u201d Her voice trembled and she shut her eyes to hold back the tears that burned. \u201cIt\u2019s so much like my marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving to deal with an angry unreasonable man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...but more than that. Mr. Ward treats me the same way Tom did, and I swore...I promised myself I\u2019d never allow another human being to do the things he did to me. And yet I take it, day after day, and I hate myself for it.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s arm was around her now, hugging her close as if he wanted to absorb her pain. She was thankful he wasn\u2019t kissing her; she couldn\u2019t have endured that just then.</p><p>\u201cI feel so angry when I let someone manipulate me. I want so badly to believe that things will change...that they\u2019ll get better. But they never do. Sooner or later Mr. Ward will go back to doing exactly what he\u2019s always done...and I\u2019ll realize I\u2019ve let myself be controlled again. I can\u2019t seem to deal with the truth.... I guess it\u2019s easier to deny everything than face the reality. Why is truth so painful?\u201d</p><p>Jason waited a few minutes, his arm about her calm and comforting. \u201cIs it your boss you\u2019re talking about or your ex-husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Charlotte raised her head and wiped the tears from her eyes before they had a chance to fall. \u201cTom...had an affair. I knew it for months but...I pretended I didn\u2019t. I made believe we were happy and in love, while doing everything I could to win him back. But it wasn\u2019t enough...Now I know nothing would have been enough.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t interrupt her with questions; once again she was grateful. The effort not to weep had produced a lump in her throat, and talking was almost painful. She hesitated, head still lowered.</p><p>Jason\u2019s mouth brushed her hair. \u201cYour husband was a fool, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond; she couldn\u2019t. Jason didn\u2019t know the full story, didn\u2019t understand that there\u2019d been a reason Tom had turned to another woman. Any healthy male would have, or so her ex-husband had vehemently assured her time and again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stubborn and hardheaded,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t know when to let go and...so I hold on, no matter how painful...or damaging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do,\u201d Jason said after a thoughtful moment, \u201cbut don\u2019t judge yourself so harshly. Some people know exactly what to say to get what they want. Everyone needs to hear they\u2019re important, that they\u2019re loved and appreciated. But those are only words, and talk is cheap. You got out of your marriage at the right time and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI didn\u2019t.... I didn\u2019t want out of the marriage, don\u2019t you see? It was Tom who asked for the divorce, Tom who forced everything into the open. I would\u2019ve gone on pretending forever if he hadn\u2019t. I won\u2019t do it again. I won\u2019t! I\u2019m quitting my job, Jason. I\u2019m walking out two weeks from now and I won\u2019t look back. I swear to you, I won\u2019t look back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a message from his mother when he returned to his apartment. His mind was heavy with everything he\u2019d learned about Charlotte\u2019s marriage and he contemplated waiting to return his mother\u2019s call, but she\u2019d sounded so excited.</p><p>Sighing, he reached for the phone. His mother answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cJason, I\u2019m so glad you called! I have so much to tell you. I talked to Taylor and Christy and they\u2019ve both agreed to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what a day I\u2019ve had,\u201d his mother continued, her voice animated. \u201cI called Barbara Johnson, you remember Barbara, my friend who owns the floral shop, don\u2019t you? We went to high school together a thousand years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d With barely a pause to breathe, she went on, \u201cBarbara was the one who got things started. She suggested we contact the yacht club right away and book a date for the reception. They\u2019re booked at least a year in advance. A year, I told myself. I know you, Jason, and when you\u2019re ready to do something, you don\u2019t want to wait an entire year. Barbara was right. The earliest date was August the year after next. I can tell you, I was shocked. I had no idea we\u2019d need to book the reception so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReception? What reception?\u201d Jason was starting to get a frightening premonition.</p><p>His mother ignored his question. \u201cThat\u2019s when I learned there\u2019d been a cancellation in July. This July! I couldn\u2019t believe our luck. Naturally I booked it that very instant. Then I contacted the caterers and, as luck would have it, they agreed to do the dinner, although it\u2019s only three weeks\u2019 notice. Three weeks, Jason. Three weeks. It sounds crazy to even attempt something of this magnitude, but we\u2019re going to pull it off without a hitch.\u201d</p> <p>Jason\u2019s vague premonition was beginning to solidify. \u201cMom, what are you talking about?\u201d he asked with growing anxiety.</p><p>Once again his mother disregarded his question. \u201cThat\u2019s when I phoned Taylor and Christy. They both called back to say they\u2019re coming. They\u2019ve already made their plane reservations. Russ is coming, and Mandy, too. Remember Mandy, Russ\u2019s sister? She\u2019s in college now, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing? To what, Mother?\u201d Jason demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Jason, I\u2019ve spent the day making the arrangements for your wedding to Charlotte. What else would I be talking about, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>\u201cMother, have you gone stark, raving mad?\u201d Jason had difficulty keeping a rein on his anger. \u201cHow can you set a wedding date and hire caterers when I haven\u2019t even mentioned it to Charlotte? This is insane.\u201d He rubbed his face, wondering if he\u2019d imagined this entire fiasco.</p> <p>\u201cYour father warned me you\u2019d be angry, but, Jason, I know you. Once you and Charlotte decide to marry, you won\u2019t want to wait two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I don\u2019t suppose it dawned on you that there are other places we could have a wedding reception\u2014if we were actually having one. The yacht club isn\u2019t the only venue in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, no, it didn\u2019t occur to me,\u201d his mother returned calmly. \u201cSince we\u2019re just going to have one formal wedding in this family, we\u2019re doing it up big, and the yacht club\u2019s the best alternative.\u201d</p><p>Jason could see he was losing ground. \u201cLet me talk to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, just a minute.\u201d</p><p>That minute seemed to take an hour. By the time he had his father on the line, Jason was as angry as he\u2019d ever been. The instant he heard Eric pick up the receiver, he shouted, \u201cHas Mother gone crazy? Have you? How could you let things go this far?\u201d</p> <p>His father chuckled, apparently amused, something Jason most definitely wasn\u2019t. \u201cI agree with you,\u201d his father said breezily, \u201cyour mother has gone a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, listen, I know you and Mom mean well, but I refuse to let you run my life. Scheduling the reception, talking to florists, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d allow Mom to do all this without talking to me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, she\u2019s involved Taylor and Christy, as well. That\u2019s when I thought she\u2019d stepped over the line. You haven\u2019t even asked Charlotte to marry you, and Elizabeth\u2019s got your sisters choosing bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. By the way, I don\u2019t suppose she told you about the honeymoon? Two weeks in Hawaii\u2014it\u2019s our wedding gift to you.\u201d</p><p>Jason clenched his fist at his side and closed his eyes, trying to calm himself. It didn\u2019t work. The situation was absurd. And he was beginning to see that his father was in on this nonsense. \u201cTwo weeks in Hawaii...Taylor and Christy choosing bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. You\u2019ve both gone off the deep end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your mother\u2019s credit, she didn\u2019t intend for this to happen. It just did. I know you\u2019re upset now, and to be honest, I don\u2019t blame you, but once you get used to the idea, it doesn\u2019t sound so ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>Get used to the idea, Jason mused. He felt like he was in the middle of a nightmare. \u201cYou honestly think I should agree to this...this outrageousness?\u201d He could barely speak.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me this. Are you in love with Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That much was a given\u2014he\u2019d already told his parents so.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to ask her to marry you?\u201d</p><p>His dad knew the answer to that, too. \u201cYes...eventually, in my own time and my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re planning to marry the girl anyway, then what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do it in three weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree weeks, three months, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t believe it. His father was talking pure craziness.</p><p>\u201cI realize your mother and I went about this wrong, but after what happened with your brothers and sisters, all I ask is that you cut us a little slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little slack,\u201d he snorted. \u201cMarriage is a serious step. A man doesn\u2019t make that kind of decision one minute and march up the aisle the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to feel that way myself, but it\u2019s pretty much what happened with Taylor and Russ, as well as Christy and Cody. They made up their minds, then went right ahead and did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Jason muttered, willing to concede the point. Their weddings were spontaneous, to say the least. Same for Rich and Paul.</p><p>\u201cI agree, marriage is a serious step,\u201d his father went on calmly, \u201cbut if you\u2019re in love with Charlotte and intend to marry her anyway, I don\u2019t see the harm in your mother getting the ball rolling.\u201d</p><p>The ball rolling. She\u2019d started an avalanche. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Mom\u2019s just a tad premature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d his father agreed amicably enough. \u201cBut you can\u2019t really blame her for that. She got caught up in the excitement of the moment. Once she talked to the yacht club, everything sort of fell into place. It makes sense once you analyze it. You\u2019ve been a bachelor a long time, Jason. If you\u2019re as serious about marrying Charlotte as you claim, my advice is, just do it. If you wait, you might talk yourself out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Jason echoed. \u201cYou make marriage sound like taking up an exercise program.\u201d He could see he wasn\u2019t going to make any more headway with his father than he had his mother.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, all right? That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte might say no.\u201d</p><p>His father laughed. \u201cCharlotte\u2019s as much in love with you as you are with her. She\u2019ll marry you in a New York minute and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about it overnight. That\u2019s all your mother and I are asking. If you decide you\u2019d rather not go through with this, then phone us in the morning and we\u2019ll put a stop to everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to sleep on this,\u201d Jason argued. \u201cI can tell you right now that I\u2019m not going to agree. I\u2019ve never heard anything more absurd in my life. A wedding in a few weeks! I was thinking more along the lines of two or three years!\u201d</p><p>A heavy silence followed his words. \u201cThen you must not be as much in love as your mother and I assumed. Give us a call in the morning,\u201d his father said and hung up the phone.</p><p>Jason was too furious to stand still. He paced his living room, jerked his baseball cap off his head and slapped it against his thigh. He tried to smooth out the crease in the bill, realized he couldn\u2019t and tossed the hat on top of the television.</p><p>Earlier that evening, he\u2019d been talking to Charlotte about this very thing\u2014people manipulating and controlling others. Well, he wasn\u2019t about to fall prey to it now. Especially not with his parents.</p><p>If he allowed his mother to schedule his wedding, there was no telling where she\u2019d stop. The next thing he knew she\u2019d be meddling in all his personal affairs. She\u2019d be deciding when it was time for him and Charlotte to have a family.</p><p>He drew in a deep, calming breath to clear his head.</p><p>His assessment of his mother was unfair, he told himself a few minutes later. His parents hadn\u2019t interfered in his brothers\u2019 or sisters\u2019 marriages. From what he understood, they\u2019d suggested Leah and Paul get married, but that was common sense. Leah and Paul should have seen it themselves. He knew his parents had debated long and hard about confronting them and had done so reluctantly, after much soul-searching.</p><p>But arranging his marriage to Charlotte was an entirely different matter. They\u2019d stepped over the boundary there\u2014although...although he did understand how easy it must have been to get caught up in the heat of the moment. Getting the date at the yacht club had set everything in motion, and before either of his parents were aware of it, they\u2019d planned the whole wedding.</p><p>As he recalled from his dinner conversation the day before, Jason had told his mother that Charlotte would welcome her assistance in planning the wedding. She\u2019d done a bit more than suggest what type of flowers to use in the bridal bouquet, however.</p><p>No, it was out of the question.</p><p>Jason flatly refused to be a pawn. When he was ready to marry Charlotte he\u2019d...</p><p>Married. He and Charlotte.</p><p>He needed at least a year just to get used to the idea. A man his age didn\u2019t surrender his freedom without plenty of serious thought.</p><p>Then he remembered the phenomenon of holding Charlotte in his arms, of loving her, and the simple pleasure he found in spending time with her. He tried to imagine what his life would be like without her and discovered he couldn\u2019t. So his belief that he wasn\u2019t ready flew out the window.</p><p>But marriage, he told himself, would take away his freedom. He\u2019d never watch another game on TV again without feeling guilty\u2014a wife would make sure of that. Women nagged and controlled, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>Charlotte was a woman, but she wasn\u2019t like the others he\u2019d known. She\u2019d been controlled and manipulated herself; she\u2019d fought against it. Jason couldn\u2019t in all honesty believe she\u2019d try the same tactics on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once again his argument wouldn\u2019t hold.</p><p>All right, maybe there were more things to consider besides his freedom. But here, too, he was losing ground. He\u2019d found freedom in Charlotte, freedom to be himself, freedom to look toward the future.</p><p>Charlotte wanted children.</p><p>Another contentious issue. Children. Carrie had said as much the day she\u2019d stopped by his office to bribe him to take out her mother. If he married Charlotte, he might as well accept that a year or so down the road they\u2019d have a baby.</p> <p>So? Wasn\u2019t that what he wanted?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought much about a family until recently. He vividly remembered the sensations that had overwhelmed him the first time he\u2019d seen Charlotte holding Jeremy. Watching her play with his brother\u2019s son had left him breathless. Of course, being hit by a fast-moving Frisbee might have contributed to that.</p><p>Okay, so he wanted children. A man didn\u2019t marry a woman without giving the prospect some consideration. Since he was well past thirty, and fast approaching forty, he should start thinking along those lines soon. Charlotte was nearly thirty-six herself, and he knew it was safer for a woman to give birth before the age of forty.</p><p>Which meant he had to throw out his idea of waiting two or three years to get married. If he was serious, and he was, they should do it soon.</p><p>But three weeks was too soon....</p> <p>He\u2019d sleep on it, Jason decided, take his father\u2019s advice and give this whole wedding business some thought. But he could say right now, that on general principles alone, he was against it.</p><p>An hour later, after tossing and turning and wreaking havoc with his bedsheets, Jason knew. Knew it from the way he couldn\u2019t keep his hands from clenching. Knew it from the way his stomach tensed.</p><p>He was going to marry Charlotte Weston. The wedding was already scheduled.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. Jason had fidgeted all through dinner, although dinner had been his idea. He\u2019d called her early that morning, before she\u2019d left for work, and invited her out.</p><p>The invitation had sounded offhand, spur of the moment. Or that was how he\u2019d apparently intended it to sound. But Charlotte wasn\u2019t fooled. His voice had tensed as though he wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d say yes\u2014which was ridiculous. Surely he knew how crazy she was about him. Yet, when she assured him she\u2019d be happy to join him for dinner, he hadn\u2019t seemed the least bit relieved.</p><p>She\u2019d suggested Mr. Tamales, but he\u2019d disagreed. Instead he\u2019d chosen a fancy seafood restaurant near the harbor. She\u2019d been looking forward to chicken enchiladas, but certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed with her shrimp Louis.</p> <p>Charlotte could have sworn, however, that Jason hadn\u2019t eaten more than three bites of his wine-saut\u00e9ed scallops. \u201cJason,\u201d she said after a long silence. \u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word in the last five minutes. Aren\u2019t you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2019s in knots.\u201d His reply was quick and short-tempered. He reached for his water glass, emptying ice chips into his mouth, then chewed on them fiercely.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers and for an all-too-brief moment the tension eased from around his mouth. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, wondering at his strange mood.</p><p>\u201cHow did everything go with your boss?\u201d he asked, seeming to want to change the subject.</p> <p>She\u2019d already told him, but apparently he hadn\u2019t been paying attention. \u201cHe\u2019s angry, especially since two other people also gave their notice when they learned I wasn\u2019t changing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he try to make staying worth your while?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cHe offered me and the others a raise.\u201d Mr. Ward had called all three of them into his office, smugly claimed he was willing to overlook this small mutiny and offered them each a raise if they\u2019d withdraw their resignations.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take his bride\u2014I mean bribe\u2014did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Charlotte was still basking in the satisfaction she\u2019d felt when she told Mr. Ward she wasn\u2019t interested in withdrawing her notice. Cheryl and Janice hadn\u2019t changed their minds, either. Mr. Ward had been stunned, but she knew that would soon pass.</p><p>Before the end of the two weeks, he\u2019d try every manipulative tactic in the book. When she didn\u2019t give in, he\u2019d try anger, his least effective tool.</p><p>She was through with a boss who was so angry and unreasonable. Through with guilt and regret and abuse. She already had a line on another job, although she would\u2019ve enjoyed taking the summer off.</p><p>Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t afford it. As it was, she only had two months\u2019 budget in her savings account, and it had taken her a year to accumulate that much. She called it her \u201cattitude money.\u201d It was a whole lot easier to walk away from her position at the agency, knowing she had some cash to fall back on if she didn\u2019t get a job right away.</p><p>\u201cHow about dessert?\u201d Jason suggested after the waitress had taken their dinner dishes away.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m stuffed.\u201d</p><p>He looked disappointed at her response.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead, though,\u201d she urged.</p><p>Jason immediately rejected the idea, proving her initial impression wrong. But if he wasn\u2019t craving dessert, what did he want? He seemed restless, yet obviously wasn\u2019t inclined to leave.</p><p>Whatever was bothering Jason wasn\u2019t trivial, Charlotte realized. Jason Manning wasn\u2019t a man easily unnerved. She wondered if it was something she\u2019d done, something she\u2019d said. She didn\u2019t know what to make of his behavior. Throughout dinner, she\u2019d considered various explanations, none of which seemed all that logical.</p><p>The silence between them lingered as they sipped their after-dinner coffee. From the moment he\u2019d picked her up, she\u2019d been surprised that Jason was wearing a suit, the same attractive gray one he\u2019d had on the night of the dance. His brother\u2019s suit. She knew very well that he didn\u2019t dress formally unless it was some important occasion. His entire wardrobe consisted of jeans and T-shirts.</p><p>He hated wearing a suit. Five minutes after they\u2019d arrived at the dance, he\u2019d loosened his tie, and had completely discarded it by the end of the evening. Why he\u2019d worn one this evening remained a mystery.</p><p>Charlotte frowned, trying to analyze what was wrong. Waiting for Jason to tell her was making her nervous. He looked miserable, which made her increasingly miserable.</p><p>She felt close to Jason, closer than she\u2019d felt to any man since Tom. She hadn\u2019t meant that to happen, and she didn\u2019t think Jason had, either. Their relationship had grown steadily more intense in the past weeks. She\u2019d fallen in love\u2014it was that simple\u2014and thought he had, too.</p><p>But perhaps falling in love wasn\u2019t what Jason wanted. Perhaps he was trying to find a way to tell her they were in too deep, that he wanted out.</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>The fancy dinner, the hesitation and even regret. The fact that his eyes kept avoiding hers. The silence. That was the worst. The awkward silence, as though he couldn\u2019t bear to speak those final words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to leave, if you are,\u201d she said with false enthusiasm.</p><p>He looked over at her, his expression uncertain. Perhaps he planned to tell her in the restaurant, in order to avoid a scene. She\u2019d heard that was a popular tactic. All Charlotte wanted to do was leave, before she made a fool of herself by breaking into tears.</p><p>He was going to break up with her; she was sure of it. A hundred explanations crowded her mind. They\u2019d gotten too close, too fast. It wasn\u2019t as if she was...unencumbered. True, she was single, but she had a child, and if a man was going to get serious with a woman, he\u2019d prefer that she didn\u2019t bring along excess baggage. That was common knowledge. She\u2019d heard it often enough from friends and acquaintances.</p><p>Jason\u2019s parents might have disapproved of her, too. It wasn\u2019t as if she came from a fine, upstanding family. His mother had asked her a number of questions Saturday morning about her parents and grandparents. Charlotte had found it difficult to explain that she had no idea where her father was, or even if he was still alive. Neither of the elder Mannings had seemed to disapprove of her openly. If anything, they\u2019d been warm and gracious. But although they might have accepted her, even liked her, they might also think she was the wrong kind of woman for their son.</p><p>Jason paid the bill while Charlotte excused herself for a visit to the ladies\u2019 room, hoping to regain her composure.</p><p>He was waiting for her by the door when she returned.</p><p>Silence accompanied them into the parking lot.</p><p>Jason opened her door. By the time he\u2019d walked around the front of his car, Charlotte\u2019s hold on her poise was tenuous. When he glanced in her direction, though, she managed a smile. Her pride demanded it.</p><p>Charlotte expected Jason to drive her directly to the apartment, since he hadn\u2019t been able to break the news to her at the restaurant. At least when he delivered the blow, it would be in the comfort of familiar surroundings.</p><p>But he drove to a deserted stretch of beach, then pulled off the road, climbed out of the car and came around to her side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d she said, frowning at her watch. \u201cI should be getting home. Carrie\u2019s by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d He wore a pensive frown, the same expression she\u2019d seen all evening.</p><p>She gazed past him to the shoreline. Small breakers rolled onto the sand, their motion soothing. Charlotte wasn\u2019t soothed, however, and she looked away to the wide expanse of darkening sky. The scent of the sea hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d she muttered. Her patience had evaporated and she couldn\u2019t bear the painful silence anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know.\u201d She walked onto the sand, removed her shoes and purposefully forged ahead, stopping at a thick log that was charred at one end.</p><p>Swallowing a mouthful of self-pity, she looked over her shoulder to discover that Jason had followed her onto the beach. She almost wished he\u2019d driven away, left her behind. It would\u2019ve been easier that way.</p><p>Her legs didn\u2019t feel as if they\u2019d support her much longer, so she sat on the log and stared sightlessly out at the horizon, waiting for him to begin his litany of excuses and stumbling explanations.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte...I\u2019m not very good at this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is? Listen, it\u2019s been great.\u201d She strove to sound flippant and knew she\u2019d failed. She lowered her gaze to her hands, forcing herself to continue. \u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful for this time with you.\u201d Tears rolled down her cheeks and she brushed them aside, not daring to look at Jason. \u201cBut as we both know, all good things must come to an end....\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing. Not one word, and that made everything even more difficult.</p><p>His hands were buried in his pants pockets and when she glanced up at his face, she saw that his jaw was tightly clenched. She didn\u2019t understand his anger, not when she\u2019d made it so easy for him.</p><p>\u201cSo you had me sit through that whole miserable dinner,\u201d he said with barely controlled antagonism. \u201cDid you enjoy watching me squirm?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Charlotte, if you weren\u2019t interested in marrying me in the first place you could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarrying you!\u201d Charlotte\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYou planned on asking me to marry you?\u201d For one wild second she was paralyzed with shock, unable to move or think. There must\u2019ve been a mistake. It was a joke. Jason Manning was a confirmed bachelor, wasn\u2019t he? Despite her feelings for him, Charlotte had accepted that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought...I thought you wanted to stop seeing me.\u201d</p><p>He snickered as though he didn\u2019t believe her and turned away. \u201cWhy would I take you to a fancy restaurant if I wanted to say something as ridiculous as that?\u201d He turned back, glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cTo let me down easy. What did you expect me to think, when you were in such a bad mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you I\u2019m no good at this sort of thing. If you want romance and a bunch of pretty words, you\u2019re going to have to marry someone else.\u201d</p><p>She was on her feet and not quite sure how she got there. \u201cYou honestly want to marry me?\u201d she repeated as her eyes brimmed with tears. They were tears of relief. Tears of joy.</p> <p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do this, I want to do it right.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte complied and was shocked when Jason got down on one knee directly in front of her. He cleared his throat. \u201cI love you, Charlotte. I wasn\u2019t planning to fall in love with you, but I knew it was happening, and I let it happen because\u2014well, I don\u2019t really know. It happened and I\u2019m glad it did. I can\u2019t think of spending a day without you at my side. I can\u2019t imagine playing softball without you there. I love you. I love the chocolate chip cookies you bake. I admire you for the wonderful job you\u2019ve done raising Carrie. I\u2019m deeply impressed by your wisdom and courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jase.\u201d She blinked back her tears and brought her fingertips to her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first woman I ever dated who let me be myself. You didn\u2019t feel obligated to clean up after me. You don\u2019t act as if my refrigerator\u2019s some kind of scary science experiment.\u201d He grinned, apparently pleased with his own wit. \u201cYou even like sports.\u201d</p><p>The lump in her throat made it impossible to speak. Tears ran unrestrained down her face. With all her heart she wanted to shout, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you,\u201d and throw her arms around him. But she was afraid to believe Jason would continue to love her once he learned how inadequate she was, how worthless she was as a lover. She didn\u2019t know if she could bear to disappoint him.</p><p>\u201cIf it helps,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cI talked to Carrie, and she\u2019s all for us getting married.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte sniffed tearfully. \u201cYou mean my daughter\u2019s given you her seal of approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>There was another silence. Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rush you, but I have this sore knee. I slid into first base last week and I\u2019ve been in pain ever since. So, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer a quick answer.\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop herself, before she could listen to her head instead of her heart, she nodded. It wasn\u2019t a very enthusiastic nod, perhaps, but Jason didn\u2019t seem to have any objections.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he murmured, awkwardly rising to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou idiot. You didn\u2019t have to get down on your knee,\u201d she whispered through her tears.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d he said, but he sounded grateful to be off it as he sat down on the log beside her. A deep sigh rumbled through his chest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the most romantic proposal, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jase, it was perfect,\u201d she said, touching the side of his face and gazing into his eyes. Her throat was tight and constricted. \u201cWhat you said about not being able to live without me...that\u2019s how I feel about you. Sharing cookies, going to ball games, walking the dog together\u2014it all sounds wonderful. I guess I\u2019m not much of a romantic, either,\u201d she said with a shy laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy a diamond ring. I figured you\u2019d want to pick a setting yourself.\u201d</p><p>A ring. Charlotte froze. Soon he\u2019d want to discuss a wedding date. A chill worked its way through her, the same cold feeling she\u2019d experienced whenever Tom wanted to make love. A sick sensation would build in the pit of her stomach and by the time they went to bed she\u2019d feel encased in ice. All Tom had to do was kiss her and he\u2019d know. Then the tirades would begin, the accusations, the ugliness.</p><p>Jason was going to kiss her, too. Now. His lips grazed hers. Briefly. Lightly. The cold fear melted as if it had never been. Charlotte groaned and slipped her arms around his neck.</p><p>He kissed her again, but this time the kiss blossomed into something wild and erotic that left Charlotte panting, seeking more.</p><p>They drew apart, and she rested her forehead against his. When he spoke, his voice was husky and warm, as warm as heated brandy and just as intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very good in bed,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Charlotte tensed, panic a heartbeat away, but she forced it down, focusing instead on how gentle he\u2019d always been with her. How patient. With Jason, she\u2019d felt a level of pleasure she\u2019d never realized she was capable of reaching. When he kissed her she felt hot and quivery from the inside out. Maybe it would be different this time, with this man. Maybe. She prayed that was true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about making love, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt you, Charlotte. I hope you understand that. Whatever the problem is, we\u2019ll work it out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful...for that.\u201d Despite the excitement she felt at his kisses, she had to fight back the fear that threatened to choke her every time he mentioned the physical aspects of their relationship.</p><p>Her only recourse was to insist on a long engagement. That way she could slowly, gradually, feel comfortable with their sexual relationship. After they made love...She hesitated. There\u2019d been a time she wouldn\u2019t have thought that was possible, but Jason had given her hope.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to set the wedding date?\u201d she asked, deciding to broach the subject now.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s one small problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let my parents tell you. It\u2019s only fair. They\u2019re at home, waiting for us now.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d Jason muttered under his breath as they pulled into his parents\u2019 driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhat are all these cars doing here?\u201d Carrie asked from the backseat. Jason had insisted on going back to the apartment to pick her up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>Either his parents owned a car dealership or they were entertaining a houseful of company.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be a real circus.\u201d He sighed as he helped Charlotte out of the front seat. Carrie bounded out from the back.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s nervousness, already heightened by the prospect of an audience, grew exponentially.</p><p>The door opened and Elizabeth Manning stepped out of the house. Jason\u2019s father and brothers, sisters-in-law and several children all crowded on the front porch behind her. The porch light revealed a variety of expressions, from amusement to elation.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d his mother asked as she walked toward them.</p><p>Jason slid his arm around Charlotte\u2019s waist and slowly, sweetly smiled down at her. In those brief seconds, Charlotte was comforted and reassured by his love. Her senses sang and her heart fluttered wildly.</p><p>Jason lowered his head. Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure that kissing in front of his parents, his whole family, was the best thing to do. Oh, what the heck. She was marrying Jason. They were in love, so a simple kiss shouldn\u2019t offend anyone.</p><p>Their lips met and she moaned a little with surprise and wonder at the ready response he never failed to evoke from her. Her hand crept up his chest and gripped the lapel of his suit jacket as his mouth made love to hers.</p><p>When he broke away, he was breathless. For that matter, so was Charlotte. She marveled that he was able to speak at all. \u201cDoes that answer your question, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte\u2019s agreed to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d she answered for herself.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great!\u201d Carrie shouted.</p><p>Spontaneous applause broke out from the porch, followed by several earsplitting whistles. Ryan and Ronnie were pounding their feet but she doubted the little boys understood exactly what the family was celebrating.</p><p>The evening was lovely; honeysuckle and roses scented the air. The sun had almost set, casting\u2014literally\u2014a rosy glow over the scene.</p><p>Jason bowed as though he were a knight and she his lady, accepting his family\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize you\u2019re getting the runt of the litter,\u201d Paul told her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Rich put in. \u201cJust be grateful that Charlotte\u2019s willing to put Jason out of his misery. He\u2019s been walking around like a lovesick puppy for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Jason glowered at his brothers, but she could tell he wasn\u2019t angry. He took their teasing in stride. From the time he\u2019d brought her to that first softball game, Charlotte had envied him his family, especially the close relationship he shared with his brothers. The three were more than brothers; they were best friends. They looked out for one another and, just as important, they laughed together.</p><p>Leah and Jamie were best friends, too. Yet they seemed eager to extend that camaraderie to Charlotte. They\u2019d gone out of their way to include her, to make her feel welcome, a part of the family. One of them.</p><p>Jason\u2019s mother came forward, tears in her eyes as she hugged Charlotte. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Jason couldn\u2019t have chosen better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Charlotte said, blushing. Doubt bobbed like a cork to the surface of her mind. Not that she didn\u2019t love Jason. She did, with all her heart, but she still wasn\u2019t sure whether she was the right woman for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you\u2014and for us,\u201d Jamie said, hugging her next. \u201cThe two of you are perfect for each other. Leah and I agreed on that the minute we saw you together.\u201d</p><p>A warmth permeated Charlotte\u2019s heart. She wanted so badly to believe it was true.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be sisters now,\u201d Leah whispered, taking Charlotte\u2019s hands and lightly squeezing her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be marrying into a more wonderful family,\u201d Charlotte said to Jason as they made their way into the house. Carrie followed, carrying Jeremy, while the other children raced excitedly ahead.</p><p>His brothers congratulated Jason, slapping him on the back.</p><p>Once inside, Jason and Charlotte sat on the couch and the family gathered around them, making them the center of attention. Every eye was on Charlotte, smiling and happy, yet expectant. Puzzled, she glanced up at Jason, wondering if they wanted her to say something, to make some speech or pronouncement.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know yet?\u201d Paul asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason murmured. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the explanation up to Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart boy,\u201d Rich said, sitting on the armrest of the couch. He leaned forward eagerly, as though waiting for the opening act of an award-winning play.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone talking about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jason gestured eloquently toward his mother.</p> <p>Elizabeth hesitated and turned to her husband. Eric Manning grinned and gave his wife a reassuring nod, which only compounded Charlotte\u2019s curiosity.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019m delighted that you\u2019ve agreed to marry Jason,\u201d Elizabeth began. \u201cHe\u2019s waited all this time to meet the right woman and, frankly, Eric and I were beginning to wonder if that was ever going to happen. Now that we\u2019ve met you, Charlotte, we\u2019re glad he waited so long. We understood the moment we saw you together how special you were to him.\u201d</p><p>A low murmuring chorus of assent brought a sheen of tears to Charlotte\u2019s eyes. If anyone should be grateful, it was her. Jason had changed her world, opened her mind to everything she\u2019d believed was closed off to her. Love. Family. Joy. Partnership.</p><p>The room went strangely quiet. Charlotte looked around and, although everyone seemed genuinely pleased, there was a tension here, too.</p><p>\u201cJust tell her, Mother,\u201d Jason advised. \u201cNo need to drag this out.\u201d</p> <p>By now, Charlotte was more than curious. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush me,\u201d Elizabeth said, chiding her son. \u201cCharlotte,\u201d she began, \u201cwhen Jason told us he\u2019d fallen in love with you, his father and I naturally wondered about his intentions. Then he told us he intended to ask you to marry him, so we decided to do a bit of checking in regard to the arrangements. Weddings need to be planned.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s fingers entwined with hers, his hold on her hand tightening.</p><p>Elizabeth paused as though she expected a response. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d Charlotte said, since everyone was staring at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a practical thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned some distressing news,\u201d his mother continued. \u201cThe yacht club, which we feel is the best place for the reception, is booked solid for the next twenty-three months.\u201d</p><p>Once again, like clockwork, all eyes in the room swiveled to Charlotte, awaiting her response. \u201cI hope you put our name on a waiting list, then,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>Elizabeth brightened, and some of the tension lines on her forehead seemed to relax. \u201cI did better than that. You see,\u201d she went on, her voice growing more confident, \u201cthere happened to be a cancellation, and so I asked they reserve that day for you and Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving out the most important part,\u201d Jason said, his lips barely moving.</p><p>\u201cThe date is July fourteenth,\u201d Elizabeth announced, folding her hands and nodding sagely. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s excellent timing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine,\u201d Charlotte agreed, when it was apparent once again that everyone was waiting for her to respond. A little more than a year would give her and Jason ample time to discover if a marriage between them was viable. By then, they\u2019d certainly know if a sexual relationship was possible. A year gave them both an opportunity to adjust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not July fourteenth of next year,\u201d Jason filled in, his gaze locking with hers. \u201cMother meant July fourteenth of this year.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was too stunned to respond, other than with a gasp. Her mouth fell open in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Mom?\u201d Carrie asked, looking surprised.</p> <p>\u201cBut...but no one can plan a wedding of any size in that length of time,\u201d Charlotte managed after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s...impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for Elizabeth,\u201d Leah said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. \u201cMom\u2019s been working on this since Jason mentioned the word marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen to everything,\u201d Elizabeth said confidently. \u201cAnd it is possible, very possible\u2014if you\u2019ll agree to such a quick wedding. I realize we\u2019re being unfair to you, and I do hope you\u2019ll find it in your heart to forgive me for taking over like this. The thing is, I know my son, and once he makes up his mind, that\u2019s the end of it. Jason wouldn\u2019t have been willing to wait almost two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...there are other places. Besides the yacht club, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but none of them are as special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Jason said, raising her hand to his lips and kissing it. \u201cI know it sounds crazy, but Mom\u2019s right. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to wait just so my mother could put on a fancy wedding. At first I thought she\u2019d gone berserk. The idea\u2019s preposterous, but the more I thought about it, the more I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah and I will do anything we can to help,\u201d Jamie inserted. \u201cIf you want the truth, we\u2019re both thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaylor and Christy and their families are flying out. They\u2019ve already made their reservations,\u201d Elizabeth added.</p><p>\u201cBut they can change them,\u201d Jason told her, frowning at his mother as if to say Charlotte was under enough pressure as it was.</p><p>And he was right. She felt as if a giant hammer was poised above her head, ready to smash down on her at any second. The entire family was waiting. Happy. Excited. Thrilled. Carrie\u2019s eyes begged her to say yes.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Taylor and Christy can change their reservations, if necessary,\u201d someone said. That was Paul, and Charlotte wanted to thank him.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s wildly romantic,\u201d Leah added. She was sitting in the recliner, her hand resting on her swollen abdomen. Paul was sitting on the armrest, his arm wrapped around his wife\u2019s shoulders, his eyes filled with love as he gazed down on her.</p><p>\u201cNaturally I haven\u2019t made any final decisions\u2014that would be up to you,\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must think I\u2019m a domineering old woman, and I suppose I am, but nothing\u2019s been finalized. I don\u2019t generally meddle in my children\u2019s lives, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, if you want to be angry with anyone, it should be with the rest of us,\u201d Jamie told her. \u201cJason is the family\u2019s last chance for Mom to put on a big wedding. She\u2019d been looking forward to it for years and we all disappointed her. She\u2019s always done a fabulous job with the receptions, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had our hearts set on a formal wedding for so long,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cBut in three weeks?\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all need to work together, of course, but we can do it.\u201d Jason\u2019s mother sounded utterly convinced of that. Her eyes sought out Charlotte\u2019s and, in their beautiful blue depths, Charlotte saw how much Elizabeth wanted this. How much the entire family did. They all looked forward to contributing.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Jason said softly, \u201cwould you like more time to decide?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around; everyone was waiting. The room had gone completely silent; even the children were quiet. Charlotte didn\u2019t know how she could refuse. She closed her eyes and tried to think. If she postponed the wedding, the elder Mannings might hold it against her. It could taint their future relationship. The others were just as eager for this to happen. Each one felt guilty for cheating Eric and Elizabeth out of the family wedding they wanted.</p><p>Her whole future with the Manning family could be at stake, Charlotte thought.</p><p>\u201cDo I...need to decide now?\u201d she asked after an awkward moment.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so little time,\u201d Elizabeth warned.</p><p>Charlotte glanced from one to the other and knew she couldn\u2019t refuse. She loved Jason and wanted to marry him more than she\u2019d wanted anything in her life. She could be happy with him, happy in ways she\u2019d hardly imagined before. And for the first time she and Carrie had the chance to be part of a real family.</p><p>If she were to marry Jason there was the possibility of her having another child. If she conquered her fear of sex. The hollow ache inside her intensified as she studied the soft swell of Leah\u2019s abdomen.</p><p>She turned to Jason, needing some kind of confirmation, some indication of what he was thinking. His eyes, so like his mother\u2019s, blue and intense, reflected his love for her. His faith in her. The desire to be part of her life. He believed their love was enough to overcome any obstacle. Their love was all that was necessary.</p><p>For now, because she wanted to believe it, too, that was enough for her, too.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to do, then, don\u2019t we?\u201d she said, reluctantly dragging her gaze away from Jason and back to his mother.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you agree?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and the entire family broke into cheers.</p><p>The excitement and the enthusiasm carried Charlotte for a full two weeks. Two of the busiest weeks of her life. When she wasn\u2019t putting in her final days at work, she was with Jason\u2019s mother.</p><p>During their first afternoon together, it became apparent that Elizabeth was a gifted organizer. She\u2019d have to be in order to pull off a full-scale wedding in less than a month.</p><p>Ignorance had been bliss. Had Charlotte realized the sheer magnitude of what they needed to accomplish in such a short time, she would have refused.</p><p>Not a day passed that she didn\u2019t have some kind of appointment, some place to be, someone to meet, some decision to make. There were dressmakers, florists, photographers, caterers and printers. And countless decisions, all of which had to be dealt with right that minute. There wasn\u2019t time to ponder or reflect. As soon as one task was completed, Elizabeth steered her toward the next.</p><p>Carrie was delighted to be her mother\u2019s maid of honor. Charlotte\u2019s four soon-to-be sisters-in-law were to be her bridesmaids, and that meant frequent conference calls between Montana and Seattle.</p><p>When Charlotte somehow found time to see Jason, it was for a few moments, and then only in passing. He, too, was exceptionally busy.</p><p>Just when it looked like everything was falling neatly into place, and Charlotte would finally be able to return to a life of her own, a series of showers and parties began. Every night was busy with one event or another. Even the women in the office held a bridal shower for her on her last day with the agency.</p><p>The Mannings were a well-established, well-liked family. Three of Elizabeth\u2019s closest friends decided to honor Charlotte with a shower the Monday before the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how generous everyone is,\u201d Charlotte said to Carrie, who had just attended the shower with her. They were carrying the wide array of gifts from the car into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cThose old ladies don\u2019t even know you,\u201d Carrie remarked, her voice filled with astonishment. \u201cAll these gifts! You don\u2019t suppose they\u2019d throw a birthday party for me sometime, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust joking, Mom.\u201d She hurried past Charlotte and brought in a gaily decorated box that was still unopened. Charlotte had been told the gift was for Jason, therefore he should be the one to open it. The giver was his godmother, a spry older woman named Donna Bondi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want me to see if Jason\u2019s home?\u201d Carrie asked eagerly.</p><p>Charlotte, too, was curious to see what was inside. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d It was almost ten, and under normal circumstances Charlotte would\u2019ve been more concerned about getting to bed so she\u2019d be ready for work in the morning, but her two-weeks\u2019 notice was up and she was officially among the unemployed.</p><p>She had the entire week free, or as free as any bride\u2019s time could be five days before her wedding.</p><p>Carrie returned a few minutes later with Jason in tow. He smiled when he saw her and kissed her lightly on the lips, then bent to stroke an ecstatic Higgins. \u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about Mrs. Bondi sending me a gift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe insisted you open it yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s look was skeptical. \u201cIs it a gag gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you find out?\u201d Charlotte leaned against the kitchen counter and crossed her arms. \u201cWhen you\u2019re finished, I\u2019ll show you all the loot we collected. I had no idea everyone would be so extravagant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about spending our honeymoon writing thank-you notes,\u201d he warned. He was grinning but she caught a serious undertone.</p><p>The honeymoon.</p> <p>She wanted to talk to Jason about that, needed to talk to him about it, but there\u2019d been so little time. They\u2019d each been caught up in a whirlwind of activity. Since the evening he\u2019d taken her to dinner and proposed, she hadn\u2019t spent any uninterrupted time with him. Now wasn\u2019t good, either. He was tired and so was she. Perhaps they could arrange to have lunch one day later this week.</p><p>Jason tore at the paper.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe Mom,\u201d Carrie said, her hands on the back of a kitchen chair as she looked on excitedly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t tear a single piece of wrapping paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so pretty,\u201d Charlotte defended herself. \u201cAnd I can use it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes her forever to unwrap anything. I had to help her tonight, or we\u2019d still be there.\u201d</p><p>Jason paused when he uncovered a plain white box. He raised his eyes to Charlotte.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I have no idea what Mrs. Bondi sent you.\u201d</p><p>Carefully he raised the lid and folded back the white tissue paper, but Charlotte couldn\u2019t see what was inside with Carrie bending over the table.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mrs. Bondi,\u201d Jason said, emitting a low whistle.</p><p>Carrie covered her mouth and giggled before glancing at her mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cWait until you see this, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Using both hands, holding on to the thin straps, Jason lifted the sheerest, slinkiest, blackest nightie Charlotte had ever seen.</p><p>Charlotte forced a smile but she felt as though the older woman had slapped her in the face.</p> <p>Charlotte knew better than to even try to sleep.</p><p>The next morning she\u2019d walk down the church aisle and pledge her life to Jason Manning. She would vow to love and honor this man who\u2019d come to mean so much to her.</p><p>To love him....</p><p>What would happen if she couldn\u2019t love him properly? What would happen when he realized she was incapable of satisfying him sexually? Would he claim he\u2019d been cheated the way Tom had? Would he seek out another woman who\u2019d give him the gratification she couldn\u2019t?</p><p>Oh, please, not that, not again\u2014she couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t know how Jason would react, but she knew she\u2019d find out soon.</p><p>She stared at the bright green numbers on her clock radio as one in the morning became two and then three.</p><p>The alarm was set for six. Charlotte\u2019s stomach tightened and a cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her happiness had been supplanted by her fears, her anxieties and the certainty that her heart would be broken once again.</p><p>She\u2019d made an effort to talk to Jason several times, she reasoned. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d planned it this way. In the past week alone she\u2019d called him three times, but he\u2019d been so busy with his practice, tying up the loose ends so he\u2019d have two uninterrupted weeks for their honeymoon in Hawaii.</p><p>The honeymoon terrified her even more than the wedding.</p><p>What was she supposed to do? Wait for Jason to say \u201cI do,\u201d before she whispered in his ear that she wasn\u2019t sure she could satisfy him? Or should she say something before he slipped the ring on her finger?</p><p>It seemed cruel to wait until they got to their honeymoon suite. How could she possibly tell him something like that wearing the sheer black nightie Mrs. Bondi had sent?</p><p>The tightening in her stomach grew worse, until she thought she might actually throw up.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have left it to the last minute like this, but she\u2019d had no other options.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to spend time alone with Jason, to talk to him, but they hadn\u2019t connected all week. Whenever she saw him, there were other people around. She\u2019d decided to demand time with him after the wedding rehearsal. They had to talk.</p><p>Only that hadn\u2019t worked, either.</p><p>They\u2019d sat next to each other at the rehearsal dinner, but before she could say more than a few words, his brothers had spirited him away for a bachelor party.</p><p>Although she hadn\u2019t been in any mood to socialize, Charlotte had pretended to have a good time with Leah, Jamie, Jason\u2019s two sisters from Montana and her future mother-in-law. If any of them noticed how distracted she was, they must have attributed it to nerves.</p><p>By now the bachelor party would be over, probably had been for hours.</p><p>What was she going to do?</p><p>Her dinner, what little she\u2019d eaten, soured in her stomach and she thought she might be sick. Tossing back the sheets, she climbed out of bed, waiting for the nausea to subside, then wandered aimlessly into the living room.</p><p>Dragging the afghan from the back of the sofa, she wrapped it around her shoulders and huddled in the recliner, the dog at her feet. Carrie and Mandy, Russ Palmer\u2019s half sister, were in the bedroom down the hall sleeping soundly, unaware of her torment.</p><p>Jason knew so little about her first marriage. He hadn\u2019t asked for information, and she\u2019d volunteered even less. Instead, he\u2019d cautiously tried to learn the details, but she\u2019d put off explaining, afraid she\u2019d lose him.</p><p>Soon, within less than twenty-four hours, Jason would know for himself why Tom had gone to another woman. Charlotte would have to face her inadequacies all over again.</p><p>As she sat in the dark, the shadows from the street danced against the walls, taunting her, jeering, shouting that she was a fool to believe she could ever satisfy a man.</p><p>Another hour passed and still the trapped, restless feeling refused to leave her; if anything, it became more intense. If only she could sleep. If only she could disappear. Vanish. Go someplace where no one would find her.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, she tried to force her body to relax, but closing her eyes was just one more mistake. In her mind, Tom rose, scorn engraved on his handsome features. A cocky smile lifted the edges of his mouth, as if to tell her this was exactly what he\u2019d been waiting for. As soon as she tried to make love with another man, she\u2019d know everything he\u2019d told her was true. He wasn\u2019t the one to blame for the failure of their marriage; she was. Charlotte\u2014a woman too cold, too stiff, too lacking in sensuality.</p><p>Her eyes shot open and hot tears dripped down her face. A series of sobs racked her shoulders and took control of her body until she was trembling from head to foot.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear it, couldn\u2019t deal with it. Tom was right, he\u2019d always been right. She was a fool to believe that a sexual relationship between her and Jason would be any different, any better. They could kiss without a problem, but after the wedding, he was going to expect a lot more than a few kisses.</p><p>Panic filled her lungs, and it was all she could do not to scream in sheer terror.</p><p>Jason was wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, but the irritating noise refused to go away. He reached out his hand to turn off the alarm, fumbling with the dials before he realized it wasn\u2019t his alarm.</p><p>Opening one eye, he read the digital readout and discovered it was only four. He was entitled to another couple of hours\u2019 sleep. His head throbbed. Who\u2019d come up with the bright idea of a morning wedding, anyway? No one had asked him about it.</p><p>The noise increased. It was now a steady pounding.</p><p>Someone was at his door. If this was one of his brothers\u2019 idea of a joke, he wasn\u2019t amused. He\u2019d only gotten a few hours\u2019 sleep so far. If anyone in his family was involved in this, he\u2019d make his displeasure clear in no uncertain terms.</p><p>Apparently whoever was at his door wasn\u2019t leaving. Jason struggled out of bed, pulled on a pair of pants and walked blindly through his apartment.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he demanded irritably, wiping a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mandy.\u201d</p><p>The two vaulted into the room as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d Carrie cried.</p><p>Although his vision was a bit fuzzy, he could tell that she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Mandy wailed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Carrie handed him an envelope with his name written across the front. He recognized the handwriting as Charlotte\u2019s, but her usually smooth script was jerky and uneven.</p><p>Puzzled that she\u2019d resort to writing a letter and having it delivered in the wee hours of the morning by two worried teenagers, he removed the single piece of paper.</p><p>He read it quickly.</p><p>Jason,I\u2019m sorry seems so inadequate, but I can\u2019t go through with the wedding. Please, if you can, find it in your heart to forgive me. She\u2019d signed it with her name.</p><p>It was a joke. Not a very good one, but he\u2019d laugh over it in a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWho put you two up to this?\u201d he asked, using his sternest voice.</p><p>\u201cNo one!\u201d Carrie sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I got up to go to the bathroom and Mom\u2019s bedroom light was on, so I went in to see what was wrong and she wasn\u2019t there. She wasn\u2019t anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s gone, too,\u201d Mandy added.</p><p>The words galvanized Jason into action. He shook the hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Carrie asked, still crying softly.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Jason answered firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut someone has to do something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he assured them. \u201cDon\u2019t breathe a word of this to anyone, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do as I say. There isn\u2019t time to argue. If I\u2019m not back with Charlotte before the car comes to take her to the church, tell everyone she\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Mandy asked, her eyes following him as he trotted back to his bedroom. He turned back and grinned. \u201cDo?\u201d he repeated. \u201cFind her, of course. She\u2019s got a wedding to attend.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t even guess where Charlotte was. He finished dressing, grabbed his car keys and took off, determined to find her.</p><p>He drove around for an hour, considering various possibilities. He tried to think like she would. If he were a bride running away from a wedding, where would he go? But that didn\u2019t work; he\u2019d never run away from anything in his life, certainly not a wedding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darned if he knew what Charlotte was thinking. He had difficulty enough understanding women under normal circumstances. Still, he\u2019d thought Charlotte was different. He\u2019d thought\u2014he\u2019d assumed, erroneously it seemed\u2014that Charlotte was as eager for their wedding as he was. He was shocked that he\u2019d been so blind to her doubts. She must be terrified to have run away like this. Terrified and alone.</p><p>He should\u2019ve known something like this would happen. He\u2019d backed her into a corner, pushed her into this wedding. He\u2019d allowed his own needs, his own desires, to overrule hers.</p><p>As dawn streaked the horizon with lavender and pink, he found himself growing ever more concerned.</p><p>Where could she be?</p> <p>His driving became increasingly reckless, his speed gaining as he raced desperately from one possible location to the next. Checking the time, he was nearly swallowed by panic.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much time left. They were both supposed to be at the church in a couple of hours. The thought of hurrying back to his family and having to announce that Charlotte had run away filled him with a sick kind of dread. He wouldn\u2019t return, he decided, until he\u2019d found her. Until he\u2019d done whatever he could to calm her fears, to reassure her, convince her how much he loved her.</p><p>Jason wasn\u2019t sure what led him to the beach where he\u2019d proposed to her.</p><p>When he saw her car parked haphazardly along the side of the road, he nearly collapsed in relief. A calmness took hold of him and his pulse slowed to an even, steady pace.</p><p>He parked behind her and rushed out of his car. The sound of the door closing must have been carried away with the wind, because she didn\u2019t turn around or give any indication that she realized he was there.</p> <p>He paused for a few seconds, looking at her, his heart swelling with gratitude at finding her safe.</p><p>Charlotte sat on a log, facing the water. The same log he\u2019d knelt in front of to ask her to marry him. He felt a stab of pain as he remembered that night and how ecstatic he\u2019d been when she accepted his proposal. He didn\u2019t expect to feel that good again until they shared in the birth of a child.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s shoulders were slumped forward and she seemed mesmerized by the gentle lapping of the water. The wind whipped her hair, which flew wildly about, but she didn\u2019t appear to notice. She wasn\u2019t wearing a sweater. She must be half freezing, Jason thought, peeling off his jacket.</p><p>He watched her for another moment, wondering exactly what he\u2019d say. He\u2019d had hours to prepare for this, hours to come up with the words to tell her how much he loved her and how sorry he was for the way everything had gone. Now he found himself speechless.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him until he was almost upon her. When she happened to look up, he saw that her face, ravaged by tears, was as pale as moonlight. She blinked, then frowned as though she couldn\u2019t quite believe he was really there.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny meeting you here,\u201d he said, placing his jacket around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI...How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took some effort. If you had any doubts, Charlotte, I wish you\u2019d talked them over with me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned again. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any time...I tried, honestly I did, but you were always so busy and the time went so fast, and now...\u201d The rest of her words faded into nothingness, her gaze avoiding his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s time now,\u201d he said, sitting down on the log beside her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI...can\u2019t go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>She answered him with a wrenching sob. \u201cPlease...I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t love you...\u201d</p> <p>Jason tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that, Charlotte. There\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is...I realize now that it\u2019s your family I love. I never had one of my own and it came to me that I was marrying you for all the wrong reasons. I...can\u2019t go through with the wedding...I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jason felt as if someone had punched him. Hard. \u201cMy...family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried. \u201cThey\u2019re all so wonderful and I...got carried away, thinking that if I married you...Carrie and I would be part of a large, loving family. Then I saw how unfair I was being to you...marrying you when I didn\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>A cold anger took hold of Jason. An anger rooted in pain and disillusionment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t think of that sooner, because all this soul-searching is a little too late.\u201d He grasped her arm and pulled her to her feet. She sagged against him, but he tugged at her and she straightened.</p><p>\u201cJason, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Charlotte. Just shut up before I say something I\u2019ll regret.\u201d It was no comfort realizing she was the only woman who\u2019d ever brought him willingly to his knees. He\u2019d gone to her in love, a love so strong it had swept away his loneliness. Charlotte was throwing it all back at him now, rejecting his love, betraying him with her last-minute revelations.</p><p>Walking out on him at the eleventh hour like this couldn\u2019t be considered anything less. Nothing she could\u2019ve done would have humiliated him more than to leave him standing at the altar.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be your wife...Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was so weak he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard her correctly. Not that it mattered; nothing she could have said would\u2019ve had any effect on him after her confession. It didn\u2019t matter if he could hear her or not. She was mumbling, pleading with him, but he closed off his heart the same way he had his ears.</p><p>When they reached his car, he opened the passenger door and deposited her inside. He ran around to the driver\u2019s side, not knowing if he could trust her to stay put. He was mildly surprised that she didn\u2019t try to escape.</p><p>He started the engine and turned on the heater. A blast of warm air filled the car. She didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Neither spoke until they were close to the freeway entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut I do know you\u2019re going through with this wedding, if it\u2019s the last thing either of us ever does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you force me to marry you, knowing what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have something to do with saving my entire family from humiliation,\u201d he continued with the same chilly irony. \u201cThat family you claim to love so much. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want my mother\u2014who\u2019s worked day and night on this wedding for the past three weeks, who\u2019s looked forward to this day for years\u2014to become an object of pity among her friends. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019d have trouble looking my two sisters and their husbands in the eye, knowing they rearranged their entire summer, gave up their vacations, to fly out here for our wedding. Just maybe it\u2019s because I have an aversion to being ridiculed myself. I can\u2019t really tell you what else would reduce a man to drag a woman who\u2019s rejected him to the altar. But make no mistake, Charlotte, you will marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care for you,\u201d she whispered through her tears.</p><p>\u201cRight. You care so deeply that you decided to go into hiding on our wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go through with the wedding, Jason! We just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but we are, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do afterward? I mean, once we\u2019re married and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow we\u2019ll find a way to miss our flight to Hawaii, then, first thing Monday morning, I\u2019ll file for an annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make sense to go through with the wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my darling Charlotte, it does. It makes a whole lot of sense.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was determined to survive the day, although she wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d manage. She\u2019d been a fool to run off the way she had. A fool and a coward. She was an even bigger fool to think she\u2019d appease Jason\u2019s anger by lying.</p><p>When she\u2019d left, she hadn\u2019t thought about what she was doing to Jason or his family. She hadn\u2019t been thinking at all, overpowered instead by her own fears.</p><p>On the way back, she tried to tell Jason she was sorry, to apologize for the hurt and humiliation she\u2019d caused, but each time he cut her off, saying he didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>The ride back to her apartment was like living through the worst nightmare of her life. Jason was so cold, so furiously angry.</p><p>He dropped her off at her apartment, took her arm, leveled his steely blue eyes on her and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be by to pick you up in forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t possibly be ready by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will. And, Charlotte, don\u2019t even think about running away again. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded and almost told him it was bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. Then she remembered the whole wedding was a farce, anyway.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll be ready,\u201d she assured him calmly.</p><p>She showered, brushed her hair and dressed, but she wasn\u2019t conscious of doing any of those things. Carrie was with her, and Mandy, too, both silent and pale. Worried. What she\u2019d done to them was terrible, Charlotte realized. They were both too young to carry this secret, too young to bear the burden of her foolishness.</p><p>Neither girl asked her any questions, and for that, Charlotte was grateful. She didn\u2019t know what she would\u2019ve told them if they had.</p><p>Leah and Jamie had arrived within minutes of Jason\u2019s bringing her home. They were both happy and excited. If her complete lack of emotion bewildered them, they didn\u2019t let it show. They chatted excitedly, recalling events at their own weddings, bubbling over with enthusiasm. Charlotte tried to smile, tried to pretend this was the happiest moment of her life. Leah and Jamie seemed to believe it, even if the girls had their doubts.</p><p>Jason arrived to escort her to the church, and her future sisters-in-law shooed him away. She wore the beautiful off-white dress Elizabeth Manning had insisted on buying her, and Leah had woven flowers in her hair.</p><p>Before she knew it, Charlotte was at the church. The number of guests surprised her. Tears clogged her throat when she reminded herself that she was playing a role. Tomorrow morning she\u2019d go back to what her life had been before she met Jason Manning. Back to the emptiness. The loneliness.</p><p>At the appropriate moment, with organ music swirling around her, she walked dutifully down the aisle, aware every second of Jason standing at the front of the church. His eyes held hers as effectively as a vise, as though he suspected she might try to run even now. And if she tried, she didn\u2019t doubt for a second that he\u2019d go after her.</p><p>With her morning little more than a vague memory, Charlotte found it ironic that the actual wedding ceremony was so clear to her.</p><p>Jason stood at her side, revealing no emotion, and calmly repeated his vows. Charlotte wondered why the minister didn\u2019t stop him. It was all too evident from the clipped, angry tone of his voice that he didn\u2019t mean what he was saying. He had no intention of loving her, of cherishing her, of allowing her ever to be important in his life. Not after what she\u2019d done. Not after she\u2019d led him to believe her motives were so deceitful. Not after she\u2019d made him think she planned to ridicule him and his family. Whatever love he\u2019d once felt for her was dead. He\u2019d practically told her so himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When it was her turn to say her vows, Charlotte\u2019s voice was surprisingly strong. She would always love Jason, and she\u2019d always treasure the months they\u2019d shared. The sincerity in her voice must have caught his attention, because he looked at her for the first time since they\u2019d approached the altar. His eyes narrowed scornfully. For a moment she nearly faltered, but decided she wouldn\u2019t let him intimidate her.</p><p>His eyes seemed to be laughing at her\u2014a mocking laugh that told her she was the biggest hypocrite who\u2019d ever lived. He could think what he wanted, but in her heart she knew the truth.</p><p>After the ceremony, they were whisked from the church to the reception at the yacht club.</p><p>For Charlotte, the lengthy reception was a thousand times worse than the ceremony. They stood, for what seemed like hours, with the members of their wedding party, while an endless line of guests paraded past.</p> <p>Everyone was so thrilled for them, so happy, everyone except the two of them. From the moment they\u2019d arrived at the reception, Charlotte was a heartbeat away from dissolving into tears. Heaven knew how she survived the ordeal.</p><p>Later they had to cut the cake. The photographer took picture after picture.</p><p>\u201cResist the urge to shove the cake in my face,\u201d Jason whispered behind a smile, when she went to feed him a small piece for the camera, \u201cand I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>They ate, they danced, they opened gifts. Outwardly they were the perfect couple. Madly in love, solicitous of each other, eager to be alone. Eager to start their lives together.</p><p>Only Charlotte and Jason knew the reality beneath the pretense.</p> <p>Despite herself, Charlotte was impressed by what a brilliant actor Jason was. He refrained from touching her, but when it was unavoidable, his arms were gentle, his look as tender as he could make it, although she knew that he seethed with outrage. She could feel his anger, hidden below the surface, out of everyone\u2019s sight but hers. At times Charlotte felt as if that anger would devour her whole.</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes longer,\u201d Jason whispered harshly while they were on the dance floor. \u201cThen we can leave.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the airport, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Everything\u2019s been said. I\u2019ll drop you off at your apartment and you can forget this day ever happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll arrange everything. Once this is over, we won\u2019t ever have to see each other again. Needless to say, I\u2019ll expect you to find a new place as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing she\u2019d brought this on herself. But when it was time to go, there was a surprise awaiting both of them. Jason\u2019s brothers and brothers-in-law had rented two limousines. The first to take them to the airport, Rich explained, grinning proudly. And the second limousine was so the entire wedding party could follow them and see them off with as much fanfare and enthusiasm as was allowed.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes sought out Charlotte\u2019s when she returned from changing her clothes. His gaze assured her not to worry. He wasn\u2019t any more willing to spend two weeks in her company than she\u2019d been about going through with the wedding. She was sure he\u2019d find some way to miss the flight.</p><p>Except that he didn\u2019t.</p><p>His mother waited with them at the airline counter, wiping the tears from her eyes as she hugged her son. Carrie was there, too, more relaxed now, excited that she and Higgins would be spending two weeks with Leah and Paul.</p><p>Charlotte hugged Jason\u2019s mother farewell, tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cNo woman ever had a more beautiful wedding,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her father-in-law was waiting when she\u2019d finished, holding out his arms to her as though she were a small child needing reassurance. Nothing could be closer to the truth.</p> <p>\u201cEric, thank you,\u201d she murmured, as she slipped into his embrace. This might well be the only opportunity she\u2019d have to express her gratitude. Soon enough Jason\u2019s parents would know. She wouldn\u2019t be able to face them.</p><p>\u201cYou call me Dad,\u201d Eric said, hugging her close. \u201cWe already love you like a daughter, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her vision and when she turned, she nearly collided with Jason. He took her by the elbow, his fingers pinching her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re laying it on a bit thick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, couldn\u2019t have said a word if she\u2019d tried. They got their boarding passes as everyone watched. They were going to Hawaii, like it or not.</p><p>Charlotte realized there was no escape for them, unless they owned up to the truth immediately. Jason didn\u2019t look any more pleased than she did, but obviously didn\u2019t want to disillusion the family quite so soon.</p><p>As he led her into the security area, away from his family, he muttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t plan this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said with a helpless sigh. \u201cOh\u2014my car. I left it at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandy\u2019s getting it for you.\u201d</p><p>His thoughtfulness surprised her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cI wanted it back in the apartment lot so you wouldn\u2019t have any trouble leaving again. Next time you can go with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>Their seats were in business class and they were quickly served glasses of champagne that neither of them drank.</p><p>As the plane taxied away from the jetway and toward the airstrip, he closed his eyes, heaved a massive sigh and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get us out of this yet.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded and lowered her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to stay out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>The flight was five hours, but it seemed closer to fifty. Jason didn\u2019t exchange one unnecessary word with Charlotte. At this rate, she didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d be able to spend two weeks in each other\u2019s company.</p><p>Jason must have been thinking the same thing. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do about arranging a flight back to Seattle as soon as we land,\u201d he told her briskly, without a shred of emotion. No regret, no disappointment, nothing.</p><p>Charlotte bit her lip. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t pack much of anything...since the suitcase was just for show.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. By the time they landed and collected their luggage, Charlotte was falling asleep on her feet. Apparently Jason suspected as much, since he made some excuse about contacting the airlines from the hotel instead of rushing her onto a return flight. But she wasn\u2019t sure if this small kindness was for her benefit or his own, since he couldn\u2019t have had much more sleep than she had.</p><p>She barely noticed the scenery as the taxi carried them through town. Their hotel was on Waikiki Beach, built on white sands and surrounded by swaying palms.</p><p>When they went to check in at the front desk, Charlotte stepped back, letting Jason take care of the necessary paperwork. He was obviously upset about something, but she couldn\u2019t tell what.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked, as they moved toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could get a double room, but...\u201d Jason rubbed a hand across his face, looking weary and defeated. \u201cMy parents booked us into the bridal suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Charlotte didn\u2019t fully realize the implications of that until the bellman ushered them, with much fanfare, into the corner suite. There was one bed. A king-size bed that loomed before her.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s startled gaze sought out Jason\u2019s as he paid the attendant and closed the door. The fear she\u2019d managed to bury for hours spilled over now, but before she could say a word, he turned to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked. It isn\u2019t as if I intend to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where will...we sleep?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound abrupt. \u201cIf you want to call down to the front desk and order a rollaway for the bridal suite, then by all means, be my guest. Frankly, I feel enough of a fool for one day, so I\u2019ll leave that option to you.\u201d</p><p>With no real alternative, she showered, put on an old T-shirt and crawled between the crisp sheets of the bed, making sure she was as far on her side as possible.</p><p>She was drifting off to sleep when Jason finished his shower and returned to the bedroom. He stood for several minutes looking down at her. Her heart roared like a crazed animal as she wondered about his intentions. He could force her. Tom had often enough, using her body, leaving her feeling sick and abused afterward. She\u2019d curl up tightly while he shouted how incompetent she was, how unattractive, how lacking. She\u2019d lie there silently as the ugly, demeaning words rained down on her. When he was done with his tirade he\u2019d leave.</p><p>The memories made her shiver with revulsion and fear.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, pretending to be asleep. Jason was angry with her, angrier than she\u2019d ever seen him. Eyes closed, she lay still, her heart pounding with dread.</p><p>She heard Jason dressing, heard him pause and then, after a moment, heard him turn off the light and leave the room.</p><p>Abruptly Charlotte sat up. He\u2019d left her, walked away just like Tom had, as though he couldn\u2019t bear to be in the same room with her. Like Tom, he couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of her.</p><p>He\u2019d left without a word.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what she wanted? Then why did she feel so alone, so deserted and unloved, so empty inside?</p><p>The tears that had threatened most of the day broke free with a low, eerie wail. She tucked her knees against her chest as the sobs overtook her.</p><p>She wept for all she\u2019d lost. Jason\u2019s love. Any chance of sharing their lives. The dream of having another child. The family she\u2019d never had. It was gone now, crushed by her own hand.</p><p>It was too late to try and get any of it back. Jason hated her. She could never recapture what she\u2019d destroyed with her fear. Never rebuild the trust she\u2019d demolished when she\u2019d run away.</p><p>She sobbed until the well of grief was emptied. Even that wasn\u2019t enough. She tore at the sheets, pulling the blankets from the bed and beating the pillows.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to exhaust what little energy she had, and she fell across the bed sobbing, then fell into a deep, troubled sleep.</p><p>Jason came back to the room an hour later, moving as silently as possible, not wanting to wake Charlotte. He wished he could hate his wife, punish her for what she\u2019d done. She deserved to suffer, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>But if that was really the case, then why was he the one in pain? He saw her climb into bed and curl up, and it was all he could do not to dash across the room and take her in his arms. This woman had betrayed him, and yet he wanted to comfort her.</p><p>It was either leave the room or beg her forgiveness for forcing her to endure this day. She wasn\u2019t entitled to his forgiveness, he reminded himself, which meant there was only one option. He\u2019d left.</p><p>He\u2019d gone for a walk on the beach, which wasn\u2019t exactly how he\u2019d expected to spend his wedding night. Not that he was any great shakes as a husband. A hundred times or more he\u2019d gone over his own part in this fiasco. He\u2019d rushed Charlotte into marriage and so had his family, not giving her a chance for second thoughts. Looking back, he understood now that it was the urgency of his mother\u2019s idea that he\u2019d found so appealing. Now he understood why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d rushed into marriage with Charlotte because, deep down, he\u2019d been afraid that if she\u2019d had the chance to change her mind, she would. And he\u2019d been right.</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t know what lunacy had prompted him to make her go through with the ceremony. To avoid embarrassment? Having their marriage annulled the following week would still embarrass him and his family. There was the problem, too, of returning all the wedding gifts. Eventually he\u2019d have to face people. Make explanations.</p><p>He\u2019d taken the easy way out, delaying the inevitable because of his pride.</p><p>Charlotte had wanted to cancel the wedding and he\u2019d perversely refused to release her. So now they were stuck in Hawaii on a two-week honeymoon neither of them wanted. Stuck in each other\u2019s company, in the bridal suite no less, until he could find a flight back to Seattle.</p> <p>Once his eyes had adjusted to the dark, Jason made his way across the elegant room. Charlotte was still curled up on the bed, but the sheets and blankets were strewn about as though a storm had raged through.</p><p>He discovered a second and a third pillow hurled across the room. One was on the floor, the other dangling from a chair. It looked as if his bride had thrown a temper tantrum.</p><p>So she hadn\u2019t liked it that he\u2019d left. A smile played across his lips. It was the first time since he\u2019d found her on the beach that she\u2019d displayed any emotion.</p><p>The thought of Charlotte losing her temper pleased him, until he remembered she wasn\u2019t given to bouts of anger. He felt a pang of concern but brushed it aside\u2014it belonged to the past, to the old Charlotte, the one he\u2019d loved.</p><p>Exhausted and depressed, he gazed about the room and noted that the bed was all she\u2019d bothered to disarrange. Everything else in the room remained untouched.</p> <p>Not knowing what to think, and too tired to care, he quietly stripped off his clothes and slipped beneath a rumpled sheet. It didn\u2019t take him long to fall asleep, but his dreams were disturbing and he woke several times before morning.</p><p>Not once during the night did Charlotte move. She stayed on her side, facing away from him, never changing her position.</p><p>He woke in the morning, the bright sunshine slashing through the bedroom curtains. Charlotte was on her back, already awake. She shifted her head and stared at him with eyes so filled with pain that he hurt just looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI lied when I said I didn\u2019t love you, Jason,\u201d she whispered and a tear rolled down the side of her face. \u201cI do...so very much. I\u2019m sorry...for everything I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his throat thick. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p> <p>Charlotte closed her eyes because looking at Jason was so painful, knowing he hated her, knowing he\u2019d never really forgive her for what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI lied when I said I wanted to marry you because of your family. I...ran away because I was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>Her pulse scampered. She should\u2019ve told him the truth weeks earlier. She\u2019d agreed to be his wife; he had a right to know. But the truth was so easy to put off, so easy to deny. So hard to explain.</p><p>There\u2019d been opportunities to tell him, plenty of them, although she\u2019d tried to convince herself otherwise. She\u2019d been too much of a coward to present Jason with the truth. And then, when time ran out, she\u2019d panicked.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d Jason said in a low voice. \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t explain that she was, to put it bluntly, afraid of sex. Of intimacy. That wasn\u2019t what a man wanted to hear. Not just Jason, but any man.</p><p>He deserved so much more than she was capable of giving him. He deserved a woman who was emotionally whole and healthy. A woman who was physically responsive. Not someone scared and battle-weary and all but dead to her own sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cI owe you an explanation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d he agreed, but his voice was devoid of the previous day\u2019s sarcasm, without a trace of anger.</p><p>\u201cI meant to tell you sooner. To give you the choice of going through with the wedding or not. But as time went on I\u2014I couldn\u2019t...and then it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte thought back to an age when she\u2019d been innocent, vulnerable and naive. \u201cMy mother died while I was in high school. My father had abandoned us years earlier and I don\u2019t think my mother ever recovered. If he contacted her at any point after he left, I didn\u2019t know about it. She was different after he was gone. It was like she\u2019d given up on life. She loved me, though\u2014I know she did\u2014and she\u2019d been insightful enough to plan for my future.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s hand reached across the bed for hers. Their fingers entwined and Charlotte was grateful for his touch.</p><p>\u201cI met Tom my first year of college. He came from another state and was attending classes on a limited scholarship. He was intelligent and good-looking. When he asked me out, I was thrilled. He seemed to like me.... Later I realized it wasn\u2019t me that attracted him, but the insurance money I\u2019d received when my mother died. After a few months, we made love and...and he asked me to marry him. I didn\u2019t have any family and...I desperately needed someone. I was too stupid to know why Tom really wanted to marry me. He saw marriage as a way of paying for his education without having to work for it.</p><p>\u201cI dropped out of school after one semester and we got married. The money that was meant for my education went toward Tom\u2019s while I got a full-time job to pay our living expenses.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s hand flinched, tightening around hers.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve gotten out of the marriage as soon as I figured out he was using me. Instead, I compounded my mistake. I thought if I got pregnant it would make everything better. If Tom didn\u2019t love me, surely he\u2019d love the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never regret having Carrie. She\u2019s been the best thing in my life...but Tom wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d She hesitated, reliving the terrible scene, so many years past, when she\u2019d told Tom she was pregnant. He\u2019d wanted her to have an abortion, even given her the money. She\u2019d lied and told him she\u2019d done it, hiding her pregnancy until it was too late. He\u2019d been so furious that he\u2019d hit her. The blow had been so hard, it had loosened three of her teeth.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Jason prompted.</p><p>\u201cI had Carrie and for a while I thought the marriage might work. Tom liked his little girl and was proud of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Tom was having an affair. When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started while I was pregnant. Tom enjoyed sex...and after a while he said I was too fat and ugly to make love to, and everything came to a stop.\u201d Charlotte remembered how relieved she was, how grateful because she no longer had to give in to his rough physical demands. She was working a forty-hour week, waiting tables, and was too exhausted at night to satisfy him. He\u2019d been telling her for months that a man needed enthusiasm from his wife during sex, but Charlotte had never seemed able to rouse any. It was like making love to a corpse, he told her.</p><p>\u201cI...I never was very good at sex,\u201d she continued in a tight voice. \u201cAnd after Carrie was born, I lost all interest.\u201d Actually any pleasure in the physical aspects of their marriage had died months earlier, when Tom had demanded she have an abortion. After Carrie was born, she found herself unwilling to make any effort to please him physically.</p><p>\u201cThat was when the really bad fights began,\u201d she said as evenly as the remembered emotions would allow. \u201cTom claimed it was his right to make love to me whenever he wanted and...and...\u201d Her throat closed up, forcing her to stop.</p><p>\u201cDid he rape you, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>Biting her lower lip, she nodded. Only Tom hadn\u2019t called it rape; he\u2019d said it was his right. He\u2019d married her, hadn\u2019t he? That meant she\u2019d given him the right to do whatever he wanted with her body the moment she\u2019d signed the marriage document.</p><p>Jason moved closer and brought her into his arms, cradling her head against his shoulder, stroking her hair. His chest was heaving and Charlotte knew he was fighting his own anger.</p><p>Her eyes glazed over with tears as she struggled to hold back the fear, the memory of the violence, the feeling of powerlessness, the revulsion of those terror-filled episodes. Her breathing became labored.</p><p>\u201cI...couldn\u2019t satisfy Tom,\u201d she admitted in a breathless whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat has everything to do with Tom\u2014not with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cAre you afraid you won\u2019t be able to satisfy me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded through her tears.</p><p>\u201cBut, Charlotte,\u201d he said, raising himself on one elbow and gazing down at her, \u201chow can you think that? Everything between us has always been so good. Or am I wrong? Haven\u2019t you enjoyed the times we kissed?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her lashes. \u201cYes...but they\u2019ve frightened me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forced you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I know that. You\u2019ve been so patient and gentle. I almost convinced myself I could make love again...that I could erase those nightmare years with Tom and start all over...but I can\u2019t. That\u2019s why I ran away...that\u2019s the real reason, not what I told you earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the tears from her face, and swallowed the bittersweet agony of the moment. \u201cBecause I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Her words were met with a puzzled hesitation. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell me because you love me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and hiccuped a sobbing laugh. \u201cIt sounds ludicrous, I know, but it\u2019s true. Because I couldn\u2019t stand to lose you\u2014not that way. Because if we ever did make love, you\u2019d see\u2014you wouldn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you think that?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>This was the moment she\u2019d dreaded. The moment of truth. She turned her head away, unwilling to look at him, unwilling to let him see her face. A tightness gripped her chest, crushing her, the pressure so intense she could hardly breathe.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easier if he hadn\u2019t been so gentle. She could deal with his anger and frustration, but not his tenderness. She didn\u2019t know how to respond to that in a man.</p><p>Shoving aside the blanket and sheet, she sat on the edge of the bed. When he caressed her back, she stood, unable to deal with being touched just then. Her arms were locked around her middle and the aching pressure in her chest rose, settling in her throat. Tears burned her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded, not unkindly. \u201cJust say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not...not in the ways that matter to a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d she cried. \u201cDo I have to spell out every degrading detail? Is that what you want? Then fine, I\u2019ll say it. I can\u2019t be your wife because I can\u2019t make love.\u201d She gulped in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m frigid, Jason. The term might be out of fashion but it still applies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a brief, shocked silence. Then Jason started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh at me! Don\u2019t you dare laugh.\u201d A fury rose inside Charlotte, one that had been years in the making, one so strong there was no holding back. She threw herself at him, arms swinging, feet kicking, fingers clawing, before he had a chance to react.</p><p>He caught her by the wrists. \u201cCharlotte...I wasn\u2019t laughing at you.\u201d</p><p>She barely heard his words, not that it mattered. She twisted and bucked in his hold. He twisted, too, and with the momentum of his weight they fell together on the bed. He was sprawled over her upper body, his thigh across her legs, holding her down.</p> <p>Her chest was heaving, her shoulders jerking upward in an effort to escape.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, for heaven\u2019s sake, I wasn\u2019t laughing at you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, refusing to answer him.</p><p>\u201cStop struggling, before you destroy any chance of my fathering our future child.\u201d</p><p>She went still, although the fight hadn\u2019t completely left her.</p> <p>\u201cNow let me explain.\u201d</p><p>There were too many years of agony inside her, too many insecurities to be soothed away with a few simple words. \u201cNo. Just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Then if you still want me to release you I will. You owe me this much. All right?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her head away from him, still refusing to answer.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Charlotte. I realized when we first started seeing each other that you\u2019d been badly hurt by your ex-husband. I didn\u2019t understand the extent of it until now, but in some ways I think not knowing was for the best. It would have intimidated me in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>A sob tore through her throat.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time we kissed...I wish I knew how to explain it, but I knew you were different. That moment was different than any I\u2019d ever known before. Kissing you was so good.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t respond, but she knew he was right. Their kisses had been good. Very good.</p><p>\u201cIt got even better, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although only slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not frigid, or whatever term the psychologists prefer now. Not even close. What you are, my love, is afraid, and for a very legitimate reason. You\u2019ve been sexually abused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sexually...damaged. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not forever. In time you\u2019ll heal. We\u2019ll heal together.\u201d He said it with such conviction, as though they faced only a small problem, when to her it was bigger than both of them. Bigger than even their love.</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t you who...can\u2019t make love,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s me. You\u2019re not the one who has to heal...and I don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in this together, Charlotte. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any reason you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t heal,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cunless we try. We can\u2019t sweep this under the carpet and ignore it. I\u2019m not so stupid as to believe that all the pain and all the memories will go away simply because we make love and it\u2019s as good as our kisses have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to forget.\u201d</p><p>Jason rolled away from her, freeing her arms and legs. He stood and raked his hand through his hair. \u201cThe decision is yours, and I\u2019ll abide by whatever you want. I\u2019m not going to force you to be my wife. I\u2019ve made some mistakes in this relationship and just now was one of them. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make more. You should know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d She sat up and wiped the tears from her burning cheeks, her hands trembling. Jason had moved away from her and was staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the decision is yours. If you want me to file for an annulment, then I will. I\u2019ll make the arrangements to get us off this island as quickly as possible. As soon as I can, I\u2019ll take care of all the legalities. In a few days there won\u2019t be anything to bind us together\u2014if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her heart filled with mourning.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something you should understand, Charlotte. If you decide you want to give this marriage a try, there\u2019ll be no turning back.\u201d</p><p>She did understand, and the thought filled her with panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to devote myself to you and the marriage, but I\u2019ll need the same kind of commitment from you. In other words, you\u2019re going to have to want to heal. It may mean counseling for you, for us both. We both have to be willing to do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could...ever tell anyone else about my marriage to Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your decision, too. If you want to stay my wife, you have to realize that the time will come when we will make love\u2014but only when you\u2019re ready. And when we do, it\u2019ll be good, Charlotte...I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often?\u201d It was probably a stupid question, but one she needed to know. She might be able to bear it if Jason wanted to make love occasionally. She might be able to overcome the terror if he wasn\u2019t too demanding.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that because I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than once a month?\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, but not before she saw his smile. \u201cYes, Charlotte, more than once a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that you have some serious thinking to do. Perhaps it would be best if I left for a while. When I come back, you can tell me your thoughts. Does that sound fair?\u201d</p><p>She waited until he turned to look at her before she nodded.</p><p>So this was what it meant to love someone, Jason thought as he left the hotel and headed for the beach. He felt as though a hole had been carved through the center of his life, and nothing\u2014besides Charlotte\u2014was capable of filling it. He wanted to believe she\u2019d realize he wasn\u2019t another Tom. That didn\u2019t seem to be the case, however.</p><p>He\u2019d felt a glimmer of hope when he\u2019d first started talking, trying to get through to her, soothe her fears. The anger had drained from her eyes as she\u2019d studied him, seeming to measure his words. He\u2019d seen trust gradually replace that anger.</p><p>He hoped she\u2019d be willing to give their marriage a chance. He loved her, but he wasn\u2019t naive or arrogant enough to believe his feelings for her could, on their own, heal the horror of her experience. She was going to need more than his love, more than his gentleness. Being tender and patient with her wasn\u2019t going to wipe out the trauma of having been raped by her own husband. No wonder she was so terrified.</p><p>Jason sensed that other things, maybe even worse than those he knew, had happened in her marriage. Things she hadn\u2019t told him yet.</p><p>Her marriage had been so ugly, so abusive. He marveled that she\u2019d even considered remarrying. Knowing what he did now, it didn\u2019t surprise him that she\u2019d run away at the eleventh hour. It wouldn\u2019t surprise him if she decided to go through with the annulment, either.</p><p>He\u2019d given her the option, laid everything out on the table for her to examine. His love, his commitment, his willingness to do whatever he could to help her overcome her fears. But in light of what he\u2019d learned, it seemed so little....</p><p>A couple of hours later, Jason returned to the hotel to confront Charlotte again. Two hours didn\u2019t seem like much time to come to such a monumental decision, but he wanted to be with her.</p><p>Perhaps it would be best if he waited for her to come to him, but he quickly rejected that idea as impractical. If he was going to waste precious time debating with himself, he should do it over something important, like how was he going to live without Charlotte. How was he going to let her go, the only woman he\u2019d ever truly loved? Those were the questions he should be asking himself.</p><p>Charlotte sat in the darkened room, the drapes pulled against the brightness of the sun, waiting for Jason. Having carefully considered her husband\u2019s words, she knew with a clarity that defied explanation what she was meant to do. She should remain his wife. Should share his bed. Should share his life.</p><p>The heavy ache in her chest intensified. Fresh tears moistened her eyes. Jason had offered her his love, his devotion, and his wholehearted commitment. He\u2019d done so with a courage that left her humbled. He was willing to help her heal, but Charlotte didn\u2019t know if it would be enough.</p><p>There was no guarantee the pain would ever end. No guarantee she\u2019d ever feel whole again. Healing demanded courage. It meant reaching back into the past, into the pain, and reliving the nightmare. Wasn\u2019t enduring it once enough? Healing meant risking whatever serenity she\u2019d found in the years since her divorce. Healing meant trusting a man again, trusting him enough to freely share her body.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes, wanting to blot everything out. She was such a coward. A world-class wimp. She knew what she should do, but it was so frightening. She wanted to run away, bury her feelings. Hide, the way she\u2019d been doing for years. There was something so comfortable in denial.</p><p>There had to be more to life than this choking anger. More than this grief and fear.</p><p>With Jason\u2019s love there was more.</p><p>There was hope.</p><p>Charlotte must have fallen asleep. When she stirred she saw that the drapes were open and Jason was sitting on the lanai, sipping a glass of orange juice.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She felt a little shy as she slipped out of bed and rubbed her eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfternoon. I imagine you\u2019re starved.\u201d</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, she realized she was hungry. The last food she\u2019d eaten had been at their wedding dinner, and that had been the day before.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of ordering you lunch.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and joined him on the lanai. \u201cI slept for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed the rest.\u201d He looked so familiar and handsome, sitting there in the sunlight with his baseball cap shading his eyes. His skin was bronzed, and his eyes, as blue as the Hawaiian sky, roamed over her with undisguised love and tenderness. \u201cListen, Charlotte, I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have given you an ultimatum. You\u2019re going to need more than a few hours to decide what you want. I made the same mistake earlier by rushing you into a marriage you didn\u2019t want and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did want this marriage, very badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid,\u201d he repeated in a husky, regretful voice.</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d she corrected firmly.</p><p>For several minutes, he said nothing. \u201cEven now, knowing what it\u2019ll mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven now,\u201d she said, holding out her hand to him.</p><p>Jason held it fast. \u201cI love you, Charlotte Manning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her voice broke, and she struggled not to break down and weep. Someday she\u2019d tell him how close she\u2019d come to walking away from the brightest promise of her life. She\u2019d tell him how she\u2019d finally decided that loving Jason, being his wife, sharing his life wasn\u2019t just something she should do, but something she wanted to do. Ached to do, with all her heart. Someday she\u2019d tell him all of this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, bringing her onto his lap, his mouth instinctively finding hers. Everything she\u2019d planned to say was caught between two hungry mouths. Trapped between two pounding hearts.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Several months later a storm, a Seattle cloudburst, woke Charlotte. Dawn was on the horizon, but very little light filtered through the gray clouds. The wind beat hard against the windows, rattling them until Charlotte feared they might break.</p> <p>Gently setting aside the covers, she climbed out of bed and crept into the living room. Higgins was sleeping there, looking worried. She patted his head and offered him reassurances.</p><p>She opened the living-room drapes just in time to watch a bolt of lightning rip apart the night. For an hour or so afterward, smiling contentedly, she watched morning creep across the sky. Her life, inside and out, was everything she wanted it to be. Jason had moved into her apartment; they planned to buy a house in the spring. She was taking a break from work, enrolled in an advanced accounting course. Eventually she\u2019d handle all of his bookkeeping and maybe look for a few other clients, too. Yes, life was full of new possibilities.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d Jason murmured when she returned to bed. He reached for her and without a second\u2019s hesitation she slipped into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a storm,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His smile was lazy, sleepy. \u201cSo I hear. Are you frightened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d There\u2019d been a time when she would\u2019ve been terrified, but that time was long past. She felt intensely alive, completely calm. The dangerous storms were gone from her life. She\u2019d survived the raging wind, the drenching rain, the booming thunder. That was all in the past. Her future was holding her in his arms.</p><p>She sighed, cuddling close to her husband, suffused with a feeling of profound joy.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said without opening his eyes. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>She slid her arms up his shoulders and brought her mouth to his. He welcomed her kiss, which was slow and deep. Hot excitement poured into her blood. Soon the kiss was no longer slow, but hungry, needy.</p><p>Charlotte felt Jason\u2019s chest lift with a shuddering intake of breath.</p> <p>\u201cI want to make love,\u201d she said against his lips.</p><p>Jason went still. His hand, which was sliding up her thigh, stopped at her hip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d ever made the request, the first time she\u2019d ever initiated their lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lightning briefly brightened the room, shadows frolicked and danced against the walls, followed by the roar of thunder. The bedroom vibrated with sound.</p><p>Jason, ever-sensitive to her moods, paused, but she refused to allow any hesitation. She drew his mouth down to hers and they kissed, until Charlotte\u2019s whole body seemed to throb with excitement.</p><p>Gently Jason removed her nightgown, pulling it over her head. He\u2019d awakened her to an entire world of sensual pleasure in the months since their marriage, a world she wanted to explore now.</p> <p>He hungrily covered her mouth with his own and her head spun, her nails digging into his back. Abruptly she broke off the kiss, her shoulders heaving. \u201cJason, please...I want you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need any further encouragement....</p><p>\u201cOkay, so far?\u201d he asked sometime later.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she whispered, smiling her assurance. The pleasure was so keen it was almost beyond bearing.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder rolled, punctuating their lovemaking. \u201cJason...oh, Jase,\u201d she cried out, her voice a trembling wail of pleasure as her senses caught fire, exploding into a mindless madness. Her body shuddered as she gave herself to the storm, to her husband, to the night.</p><p>Afterward, when he, too, had reached completion, they were both panting. Jason gathered her in his arms, and they were silent, words between them unnecessary.</p><p>Eventually their breathing steadied.</p><p>\u201cI still have trouble believing how good this is,\u201d Charlotte whispered. \u201cMaking love, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jason kissed the crown of her head. \u201cIt always has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you let me try to prove how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was quiet for a moment as she absorbed his words. Their first attempts at making love, on their honeymoon, had left her frustrated and in tears. She was convinced Jason had made a terrible mistake in marrying her. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to criticize herself, though. His patience astonished her and gave her the courage to keep trying.</p><p>She\u2019d struggled with her inadequacies, silently condemning herself, but on the seventh night of their stay, they\u2019d broken through the restraints and made beautiful, intoxicating love. Charlotte had wanted everything to be magically different from then on, but that would have been unrealistic. Her fears were unpredictable and continued to be for weeks. But now, four months after their wedding, loving Jason was the most incredible experience of her life.</p><p>Tears slipped down Charlotte\u2019s cheeks as she recalled the first weeks of their marriage\u2014his gentleness, his unwillingness to give up, his love.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he whispered, his lips against her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have. Are you going to tell me why?\u201d</p><p>Emotion clogged her throat as she struggled to hold back the tears. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s brow creased with a thoughtful frown. \u201cIs it something that came from your meeting with Bill?\u201d</p><p>Bill was her counselor; she saw him twice a week. She shook her head. \u201cYou promise you won\u2019t laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crying because I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d Jason repeated slowly. \u201cBut if you cry when you\u2019re happy, what do you do when you\u2019re sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCry,\u201d she returned with irrefutable logic. \u201cNow aren\u2019t you going to ask me why I\u2019m so happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to. It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re married to me.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed at his mock arrogance. \u201cCarrie cried, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s that happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reason she\u2019s spending the night with a friend. I wanted the evening alone with you.\u201d</p><p>Jason snickered. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why\u2019d you go to bed at six-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan that,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s going to be pretty much the norm for the next few months. I couldn\u2019t seem to get enough sleep when I was pregnant with Carrie, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute, Charlotte, very cute. You couldn\u2019t possibly be\u2014\u201d He stopped cold, his eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said, pressing her head to his chest. She smiled as the erratic beat of his heart sounded in her ear.</p><p>\u201cHow far...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as though in a trance.</p><p>\u201cIt was inevitable, you know,\u201d she told him, happiness spilling from her heart. \u201cHow could I not be pregnant? We\u2019ve been making love for months. And we decided not to use birth control for this very reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the lovemaking\u2019s this good, doesn\u2019t it make sense that the result will be equally beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Jason kissed her again, his mouth worshipping hers. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sighed and closed her eyes, utterly content. She\u2019d conquered her fears, begun to heal her pain. She\u2019d survived the memories and triumphed over her past.</p><p>The future stretched before her, filled with bright promise. She wasn\u2019t going to miss a single moment.</p><p>SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR</p><p>To Beth Huizenga, my friend.</p><p>I admire your strength, your romantic heart and your love of life.</p><p>Prologue</p><p>New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014Las Vegas, Nevada</p><p>James had been warned. Ryan Kilpatrick, a longtime friend and fellow attorney, had advised him to stay clear of the downtown area tonight. The crowd that gathered on Fremont Street between Main and Las Vegas Boulevard was said to be close to twenty thousand.</p><p>But James couldn\u2019t resist. Although he had a perfectly good view of the festivities from his hotel room window, he found the enthusiasm of the crowd contagious. For reasons he didn\u2019t care to examine, he wanted to be part of all this craziness.</p><p>The noise on the street was earsplitting. Everyone seemed to be shouting at once. The fireworks display wasn\u2019t scheduled to begin for another thirty minutes, and James couldn\u2019t see how there was room for a single other person.</p><p>A large number of law-enforcement officers roamed the area, confiscating beer bottles and handing out paper cups. A series of discordant blasts from two-foot-long horns made James cringe. Many of the participants wore decorative hats handed out by the casinos and blew paper noisemakers that uncurled with each whistle.</p><p>James remained on the outskirts of the throng, silently enjoying himself despite the noise and confusion. If he were younger, he might have joined in the festivities.</p><p>Thirty-six wasn\u2019t old, he reminded himself, but he looked and felt closer to forty. Partners in prestigious law firms didn\u2019t wear dunce caps and blow noisemakers. He was too conservative\u2014some might say stodgy\u2014for such nonsense, but it was New Year\u2019s Eve and staying in his room alone held little appeal.</p><p>Impatient for the fireworks display, the crowd started chanting. James couldn\u2019t make out the words, but the message was easy enough to understand. It amused him that the New Year\u2019s celebration would be taking place three hours early in order to coordinate with the one in New York\u2019s Times Square. Apparently no one seemed to care about the time difference.</p><p>As if in response to the demand, a rocket shot into the air from the roof of the Plaza Hotel. The night sky brightened as a starburst exploded. The crowd cheered wildly.</p><p>Although he\u2019d intended to stand on the sidelines, James found himself unwillingly thrust deeper and deeper into the crowd. Luckily he wasn\u2019t prone to claustrophobia. People crushed him from all sides. At another time, in another place, he might have objected, but the joy of the celebration overrode any real complaint.</p><p>It was then that he saw her.</p><p>She was struggling to move away from the crowd, with little success. James wasn\u2019t sure what had originally attracted his attention, but once he noticed her, he couldn\u2019t stop watching. Joyous shouts and cheers rose in the tightly packed crowd, but the young woman didn\u2019t share the excitement. She looked as if she\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world.</p><p>She was fragile, petite and delicate in build. He saw that she fought against the crowd but was trapped despite her best efforts.</p><p>James soon found himself gravitating in her direction. Within minutes she was pressed up against him, chin tucked into her neck as she tried to avoid eye contact.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced up at him and attempted a smile. \u201cI was the one who bumped into you.\u201d</p><p>He was struck by how beautiful she was. Her soft brown hair curved gently at her shoulders, and he was sure he\u2019d never seen eyes more dark or soulful. He was mesmerized by her eyes\u2014and by the pain he read in their depths. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he felt obliged to ask.</p><p>She nodded and bit her lip. He realized how pale she was and wondered if she was about to faint.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d He wasn\u2019t some knight who rescued damsels in distress. Life was filled with enough difficulties without taking on another person\u2019s troubles. Yet he couldn\u2019t resist helping her.</p><p>She answered him with a quick nod of her head.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do exactly that for the last twenty minutes.\u201d Her voice was tight.</p><p>James wasn\u2019t sure he could do any better, but he planned to try. Taking her by the hand, he slipped around a couple kissing passionately, then past a group of teens with dueling horns, the discordant sound piercing the night. Others appeared more concerned with catching the ashes raining down from the fireworks display than with where they stood.</p><p>Perhaps it was his age or the fact that he sounded authoritative, but James managed to maneuver them through the crush. Once they were off Fremont Street, the crowd thinned considerably.</p><p>James led her to a small park with a gazebo that afforded them some privacy. She sank onto the bench as if her legs had suddenly given out from under her. He saw that she was trembling and sat next to her, hoping his presence would offer her some solace.</p> <p>The fireworks burst to life overhead.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. She stood, teetered, then abruptly sat back down.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Having said that, she promptly burst into tears. Covering her face with both hands, she gently rocked back and forth.</p><p>Not knowing what to do, James put his arms around her and held her against him. She felt warm and soft in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI feel like such a fool,\u201d she said between sobs. \u201cHow could I have been so stupid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re often blind to what we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...Oh, I should\u2019ve known. I should\u2019ve guessed there was someone else. Everything makes sense now...I couldn\u2019t have been any blinder.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, murmuring something noncommittal.</p><p>She straightened, and James gave her his pressed handkerchief. She unfolded it, wiped away the tears and then clutched it in both hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cTalking might help,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took several moments to mull this over. \u201cI found him with another woman,\u201d she finally said. \u201cHe wanted me to come to Vegas with him after Christmas, and I couldn\u2019t get time off from work. So I said he should go and have fun with his friends. Then...then I was able to leave early this afternoon. I wanted to surprise him on New Year\u2019s Eve and I drove straight here. I surprised him, all right.\u201d</p><p>And got the shock of her life, too, James mused.</p> <p>\u201cThey were in bed together.\u201d Her words were barely audible, as if the pain was so intense she found it difficult to speak. \u201cI ran away and he came after me and...and tried to explain. He\u2019s been seeing her for some time.... He didn\u2019t mean to fall in love with her, or so he claims.\u201d She laughed and hiccuped simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cYou were engaged?\u201d he asked, noting the diamond on her left hand.</p><p>She nodded, and her gaze fell to her left hand. She suddenly jerked off the diamond ring and shoved it into her purse. \u201cBrett seemed distant in the last few months, but we\u2019ve both been busy with the holidays. I noticed he didn\u2019t seem too disappointed when I couldn\u2019t get time off from work. Now I know why.\u201d</p><p>It was preferable to learn about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s roving eye before she married him, but James didn\u2019t offer platitudes. He hadn\u2019t wanted to hear them himself.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I really love him.\u201d She shook almost uncontrollably. \u201cI want to claw his eyes out, and yet I know I\u2019ll always love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hoping to patch things up?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s over. I told him that and I meant it. I could never trust him again, but you know what?\u201d She hesitated and drew in a deep breath. \u201cI think he was grateful when I broke the engagement. He doesn\u2019t want me back\u2014he wants her.\u201d She stiffened, as if bracing herself against an attack.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts right now, but it\u2019ll get better in time,\u201d James said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019ll never get better. I know it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>James partially agreed with her. Part of him would always belong to Christy Manning. Even now, he had trouble remembering her married name. She wasn\u2019t Christy Manning anymore, but Christy Franklin, and her husband was the sheriff of Custer County, Montana.</p><p>\u201cYes, it will, but it\u2019ll take a year,\u201d James said briskly.</p><p>\u201cNot with me. I\u2019ll never get over Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe that right now, because the pain\u2019s so bad you can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll ever go away, but it does, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she turned to study him. \u201cYou know? It sounds as if you\u2019re talking from experience.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFive years ago the woman I loved broke off our engagement.\u201d He laughed derisively. \u201cYou see, there was a small problem. She married someone else while she was engaged to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said with a sigh of righteous indignation. \u201cWhat kind of woman would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. You see, her parents are good friends of mine, and I realize now they pressured Christy into accepting my engagement ring. She was fond of me and agreed because she wanted to make her family happy. I don\u2019t think she ever realized how much I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love her?\u201d</p><p>It might have been a kindness to lie, but James found he couldn\u2019t. \u201cYes, but not in the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite what I know, I can\u2019t picture myself not loving Brett.\u201d She straightened and wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI suppose I should introduce myself since I\u2019ve cried all over your shoulder. I\u2019m Summer Lawton. From Anaheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames Wilkens. Seattle.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged brief handshakes. Summer lowered her gaze. \u201cI wish I could believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019ll take a year to get over Brett. It doesn\u2019t seem possible. We\u2019ve been dating for nearly five years and got engaged six months ago. My whole life revolved around him.\u201d</p><p>At one time James\u2019s life had revolved around Christy.</p><p>\u201cWe were apart for less than a week,\u201d Summer continued, \u201cand I was so lonely, I practically went through contortions to get to Vegas just so we could be together tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first three months are the most difficult,\u201d he told her, remembering the weeks after the breakup with Christy. \u201cKeep busy. The worst thing to do is stay at home and mope, although that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI really love Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really love Christy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for a man,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs it really?\u201d he countered. \u201cA year,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a year, but by then you\u2019ll have worked through the pain.\u201d</p><p>Her look revealed her doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. Not for me. You see, I\u2019m not the type who falls in love at the drop of a hat. I gave everything I had to Brett. It\u2019s like my whole world caved in and there\u2019s nothing left to live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we test my theory?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me back here on New Year\u2019s Eve, one year from tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In this gazebo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame time, same place, next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame time, same place, next year,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>One</p><p>Summer picked up the mail on the way into her apartment and shuffled through the usual bills and sales flyers. The envelope was there, just as it had been on the first of the month for the past eleven months. A letter from James.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly have any idea how much she looked forward to hearing from him. The first letter had come shortly after they\u2019d met on New Year\u2019s Eve and had been little more than a polite inquiry. She hadn\u2019t written him back mainly because she was embarrassed about spilling her heart out to a complete stranger.</p><p>His second letter had arrived February first. He told her about the weeks immediately after his breakup with Christy, how the pain had intensified when he\u2019d expected it to lessen. His honesty and generosity touched her heart. It seemed uncanny that her anguish mirrored his so completely. She wrote back then, just a short note to tell him how she was doing, to thank him for writing.</p><p>That was how it had started. James would write at the beginning of every month and she\u2019d answer. Gradually their letters grew in length, but were never any more frequent. She liked the formality of exchanging letters, preferring that to the quick and casual convenience of e-mail.</p><p>In the year since Summer had met James Wilkens, she\u2019d been tempted to phone him only once. That was the day Brett got married. Ironically, his wife wasn\u2019t the girl he\u2019d brought to Las Vegas, but someone he\u2019d met recently. Summer had felt wretched and holed herself up in her apartment with a quart of gourmet ice cream and three rented movies. She\u2019d made it through the day with a little fudge swirl and a lot of grit.</p><p>Holding James\u2019s letter in her hand, Summer tore open the envelope and started reading on her way into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s from your lawyer friend, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Julie, her roommate, asked. Wearing shorts and a halter top, Julie wandered barefoot through the apartment, munching on a carrot.</p><p>Summer nodded, kicked off her shoes and lowered herself onto a padded wicker chair. Her eyes never wavered from the page.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to remind me of our agreement,\u201d Summer said, pleased he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>\u201cAgreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet him in Vegas on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>Summer had always planned to follow through on her promise, although she probably should\u2019ve thought twice about meeting a stranger. But he wasn\u2019t really a stranger. She felt she knew James, was comfortable with him. He was a friend, that was all, someone who\u2019d been there when she needed him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d Julie repeated.</p><p>Summer looked up and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s James like?\u201d Julie asked, sitting across from her. The two of them had been close ever since high school and both of them were in the production at Disneyland. Summer had been especially grateful for Julie\u2019s unwavering friendship in the past year.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s older,\u201d Summer said, chewing the corner of her mouth as she tried to recall everything she could about him. \u201cI\u2019d guess he\u2019s at least forty. Kind of a stuffed shirt, to tell you the truth. He\u2019s about six feet tall and he must work out or something because I remember being surprised by how strong he was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he handsome?\u201d</p><p>Summer had to smile. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t actually remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d Julie was incredulous. \u201cI realize you were upset, but surely you noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has very nice brown eyes and brown hair with some gray in it.\u201d She raised her hand to her own hair and wove a strand around her finger. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s more distinguished-looking than handsome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there something romantic going on between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>Summer did care for James, but not in the romantic sense. He\u2019d helped her through the most difficult night of her life. Not only had she clung to him and cried on his shoulder, but he\u2019d stayed with her until the early hours of the morning, listening to her pain, comforting and reassuring her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot in common,\u201d was all she\u2019d say to Julie\u2019s question about a romance.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling about you and the mysterious James,\u201d Julie said, her forehead creased in a frown. \u201cI think you\u2019re falling in love.\u201d</p><p>Love? Not Summer. She\u2019d decided last New Year\u2019s Eve that she was finished with love. It sounded melodramatic and a bit ridiculous to be so confident that she\u2019d never love again, but she\u2019d come to that conclusion the minute she found Brett with his girlfriend. Her feelings hadn\u2019t changed in the past eleven months.</p> <p>Although he\u2019d never said as much, she was sure James felt the same way after losing Christy. It\u2019d been six years, and from what she knew about him, there wasn\u2019t a woman in his life even now. There wouldn\u2019t be a man in hers, either.</p><p>This didn\u2019t mean that Summer never intended to date again. She\u2019d started going out with other men almost immediately. Pride had prompted her actions in the beginning. Later, she wanted to be able to write James and tell him she was back in the swing of things. He\u2019d applauded her efforts and recounted his own endeavors in that area after Christy had broken off the engagement. As she read his account of various disastrous dates, she\u2019d laughed, truly laughed, for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet James on New Year\u2019s Eve, and everything will change,\u201d Julie said with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, everything will change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t see him as just a friend anymore,\u201d Julie predicted. \u201cYou might be surprised to discover there\u2019s more to him than you suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie, I told you he\u2019s got to be forty years old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cBut...I don\u2019t know. I picture James sitting in front of a fireplace, smoking a pipe, with his faithful dog sprawled at his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA basset hound, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Summer agreed with a laugh. James was wonderful\u2014no argument about that\u2014but she could never see herself falling for him. Nor would he be interested in someone like her. The man was a distinguished attorney, while she starred in a musical version of Beauty and the Beast at Disneyland. Working in the theater wasn\u2019t an easy way to make a living, but Summer loved the challenge and the excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised,\u201d Julie said again. The tone of her voice suggested that great things were going to happen for her friend this New Year\u2019s Eve.</p><p>New Year\u2019s Eve</p><p>Summer freely admitted she was nervous about the rendezvous with James. She got to the gazebo nearly fifteen minutes early and was astonished to find him already there. He was sitting on the bench, the one they\u2019d shared a year earlier. In that moment Summer had a chance to study him with fresh eyes.</p><p>The first thing that struck her was that Julie was right.</p> <p>He was nothing like she remembered. Dignified and proper to the very back of his teeth, but there was something compelling about him. She recalled how Julie had wanted to know if James was handsome. If Summer were to answer that question now, she\u2019d give an unequivocal yes. But he wasn\u2019t handsome in a Hollywood sense. He certainly wasn\u2019t boyishly good-looking like Brett, with his sun-streaked blond hair. But James Wilkens was appealing in a way that spoke directly to her heart. She knew from his letters that this was a man of conscience, a man of integrity, a man of honor. All at once Summer felt as if the oxygen had flown from her lungs.</p><p>He saw her then and slowly stood. \u201cSummer?\u201d He sounded equally surprised. His eyes widened briefly.</p><p>\u201cHello, James. I\u2019m early,\u201d she said, feeling guilty at being caught staring so blatantly. \u201cI\u2019m always early...it\u2019s a family trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d He grinned. \u201cUsually early, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Summer had been looking forward to this evening for weeks. There was so much she wanted to say, so much she had to tell him. All at once she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing. \u201cThe streets are crazy,\u201d she said in a hurried effort to make conversation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to risk being late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I made dinner reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She stepped into the gazebo and sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, as if he wasn\u2019t sure where to start. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed lightly. \u201cA lot better than I was last year at this time. I told you Brett got married, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote about it.\u201d</p><p>Summer rarely felt shy, but she did now. She owed James more than she could possibly repay. \u201cYour letters were a godsend,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially during the first few months. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve done just fine.\u201d How confident he sounded, as if there was never a doubt that she\u2019d get over her fianc\u00e9\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>\u201cThe first of every month, I\u2019d run to the mailbox. Your letters were regular as clockwork and I counted on them.\u201d It had become a ritual for her, an important part of her recovery.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed your letters, too,\u201d he said. Fireworks splashed across the night sky, momentarily diverting their attention. \u201cDo you want to join in the festivities?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Summer shook her head. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cActually I\u2019m just as glad. The crowd got to be a bit much last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were there,\u201d Summer said fervently. \u201cYou were like a guardian angel. You helped me so much that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? How?\u201d Summer could hardly believe that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d James assured her. \u201cSeeing your pain reminded me how far I\u2019d come in the years since losing Christy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it worse knowing she\u2019d married that sheriff?\u201d Summer asked tentatively. For her, learning about Brett\u2019s wedding hurt the most. Friends, under the guise of being kind, were more than happy to relate the details and what they knew about his bride. Every piece of information had cut like a knife.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you angry?\u201d she asked. How anyone could treat James in such a shabby manner was beyond her. To be engaged to a man as wonderful as James and then to secretly marry someone else was the most underhanded thing Summer had ever heard of.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t angry at first, so much as depressed,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cAnger came later. It\u2019s the reason I took up squash. I worked out my aggression on the court. It helped.\u201d</p><p>Summer figured that was a sport an attorney would enjoy.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been hard finding out Brett was married.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze and nodded. \u201cOther than the first few weeks after he broke our engagement, the day of his wedding was the worst. It seemed so completely unfair that he should be happy while I was hurting so terribly. If it was ever in me to hate him, it would\u2019ve been then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t hate Brett, but I don\u2019t love him like I did a year ago. He was a big part of my life, and for a long time my world felt empty without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel empty now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. I\u2019m happy, James, and I didn\u2019t believe that would ever be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I was right. It took you a year.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m over him and happy to be with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone I\u2019d rather be with on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d He glanced at his watch and stood. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I only arrived a little over an hour ago, and I\u2019m starved.\u201d She\u2019d been anxious about their meeting, so her appetite had been nil all day. Her stomach wanted to make up for lost time now.</p><p>James led her into the Four Queens Hotel, weaving through the crowds gathered around slot machines and gaming tables. With several thousand people milling around outside, she\u2019d assumed the casinos would be less crowded, but she was wrong.</p><p>James took her hand then, gripping it firmly in his own. Summer was surprised by how good that felt. By the time they walked down the stairs to Hugo\u2019s Cellar, an elegant, romantically lit restaurant, Summer felt as if she\u2019d survived a riot. So much for all the effort she\u2019d taken with her appearance. She thought she was fortunate to be in one piece.</p><p>After a five-minute wait, they were escorted to a booth and presented with elaborate menus. Candles flickered gently, casting dancing shadows on the walls. The noise and bustle upstairs and on the street outside the casino were blessedly absent.</p><p>They dined in leisure, shared a bottle of white wine and a calorie-rich dessert. They had so much to talk about\u2014books, movies, world events, their families and more. James asked about her job at Disneyland and seemed genuinely interested in her budding career as an actress.</p><p>When she learned he\u2019d recently been appointed a superior court judge to the King County bench, she insisted on ordering champagne to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me sooner,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such wonderful news\u2014so well-deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just temporary,\u201d James explained, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve been appointed to serve out the term of Judge Killmar, who had to retire for medical reasons.\u201d</p><p>Summer wasn\u2019t sure he would\u2019ve told her if she hadn\u2019t asked him about his own hopes and dreams. Only then did he mention it was one of his lifetime goals to serve as a superior court judge.</p><p>\u201cYou intend on running for the position yourself, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the primary isn\u2019t until September, and the election\u2019s in November. There\u2019re no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll win,\u201d Summer told him with supreme confidence. Wagging her finger at him, she added, \u201cAnd don\u2019t give me that look. I can\u2019t imagine anyone not voting for you.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s eyes met hers. \u201cYou\u2019re good for my ego,\u201d he said. She thought she heard him mutter \u201ctoo good\u201d under his breath but decided to ignore that.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d finished dinner, it was close to twelve. As they made their way out of the casino, someone handed Summer a foil crown and a noisemaker. She donned the hat and handed James the whistle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The New Year was fast approaching, which meant that her night with James was nearly over. She didn\u2019t want it to be.</p><p>The crowds had thinned out considerably after the fireworks display. They were standing on the sidewalk outside the Golden Nugget casino when a cheer rose from inside.</p><p>\u201cIt must be midnight,\u201d James commented and ceremoniously blew the noisemaker. \u201cHappy New Year, Summer,\u201d he said in a voice so low it was almost a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, James.\u201d</p> <p>They stood facing each other, and then, as if this were the moment they\u2019d anticipated all evening, slowly moved toward each other. Summer saw how James\u2019s eyes darkened as her own fluttered closed. She wanted this. Needed it.</p><p>She sighed audibly as his mouth settled over hers.</p><p>Two</p><p>Summer was no novice when it came to kissing, but James left her breathless and clinging to him for support. She hadn\u2019t expected anything like this. She\u2019d expected them to lightly brush lips and then laugh and wish each other a happy New Year.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t happened like that.</p> <p>The instant James\u2019s mouth was on hers, she\u2019d gone languid. She was immobile, her arms locked around his neck and her body pressed intimately to his, her lips seeking more.</p><p>Summer would\u2019ve liked James to kiss her again. And again. She didn\u2019t want it to end. But she didn\u2019t know how to ask him to continue.</p><p>Slowly, with what she thought might be reluctance, he released her. She stood there looking at him, arms dangling stiffly at her sides while her face reddened with embarrassment. She considered telling him she wasn\u2019t usually this blatant.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d James said. He didn\u2019t sound like himself at all. He cleared his throat and swallowed visibly.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d she whispered, and stepped away from him.</p><p>James reached for her hand and held it in his own. Summer was grateful for his touch. They started walking, with no destination in mind, or none that Summer was aware of. She looked at James, wondering if he felt as confused and uncertain as she did. Apparently he did, because he grew quiet and introspective.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll call it a night,\u201d he announced unexpectedly. He checked his watch and frowned. Summer suspected it had been a year since he\u2019d last stayed up past midnight. He was so proper, so serious and sober. Yet she\u2019d enjoyed every minute of her evening with him. They\u2019d talked and laughed, or at least she\u2019d laughed. James had smiled, and she had the impression he didn\u2019t do that often, either. Every time he\u2019d grinned, Summer had felt rewarded.</p><p>Now she\u2019d ruined everything. She couldn\u2019t bear to know what he thought of her. An apology, words of explanation, stumbled over themselves, but she couldn\u2019t make herself say them\u2014because she wasn\u2019t sorry about their kiss. She\u2019d savored it, relished it, and hoped he had, as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call it a night, too,\u201d Summer said. She waited, hoping he\u2019d suggest they meet the following day. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>By the time they returned to the Four Queens, where they were both booked for the week, Summer was miserable.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said as they walked across the lobby. Either she apologized now or regretted saying nothing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I...don\u2019t know what came over me. I don\u2019t generally...I can only guess what you must think of me and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He hesitated in front of the elevator. \u201cI was wondering what you thought of me. I can only beg your indulgence.\u201d</p><p>The security guard asked to see their room keys before calling for the elevator. James easily produced his while Summer sifted through the contents of her oversize purse before finding hers.</p><p>The elevator arrived, and they both entered. There was no one else inside. Still, James didn\u2019t ask to see her again, and Summer\u2019s heart grew heavier as they ascended. Her room was on the tenth floor, and his was on the fifteenth.</p> <p>The silence closed in on them. When the elevator stopped at her floor, the doors slid open, and James moved aside.</p><p>Summer glanced at him expectantly. Okay, so he didn\u2019t intend to see her again. It made sense, she supposed. A superior court judge wouldn\u2019t be interested in dating an actress.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said brightly as she walked out of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Summer,\u201d James said softly.</p><p>She hesitated, hoping he\u2019d ask her at the last minute, but he didn\u2019t. Discouraged, Summer trudged to her room, unlocked the door and went in. She sat on the edge of her bed, trying to sort out her muddled thoughts.</p><p>When Summer had requested a week\u2019s vacation, she hadn\u2019t planned to spend every available second with James. She knew he\u2019d taken the same length of time, and he\u2019d probably been thinking the same thing.</p><p>She slipped off her shoes and wiggled her toes in the thick carpet. If it wasn\u2019t so late, she\u2019d call Julie and tell her friend she was right. One evening with James, and she saw him in a completely different light. The moment she\u2019d seen him in the gazebo that evening, she dismissed the father-figure image she\u2019d had in her mind all these months. More than anything, that kiss convinced her James was more than a friend. What became of their relationship would depend on several factors, the most important of which was James himself.</p><p>The phone on the nightstand rang, and Summer groped for it. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a sigh of relief. \u201cHello, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a rental car,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it might not be something you\u2019d consider fun, but I thought I\u2019d drive over to Hoover Dam in the morning. Would you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I consider that fun?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are friends here your own age you\u2019d prefer to spend time with and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends? I thought you were my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was thinking of friends closer to your own age.\u201d</p><p>His answer irritated her. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re insinuating, but if it is what I think it is, you\u2019re wrong, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Summer, all I want to know is if you\u2019d like to join me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>That might have been his original question, but she wasn\u2019t finished with what she had to say. \u201cI took a week\u2019s vacation, and I know you have several days. I don\u2019t expect you to entertain me, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about, because I can find plenty to do on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yes, there are any number of people my age in Vegas. There would be in any city. If you want my company, fine, but if you\u2019d rather not see me again, I can accept that, too.\u201d Not easily, but she\u2019d do it and have a perfectly good week without him.</p><p>He was strangely silent.</p><p>\u201cJames? Are you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you always this direct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I didn\u2019t want there to be any misunderstanding between us. I value your friendship, and I don\u2019t want it ruined because of something silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I.\u201d A short pause followed. \u201cForgive me for being dense, but I\u2019m not sure I understood your answer. Are you going to Hoover Dam with me or not?\u201d</p><p>Summer had waited all evening for this kind of invitation, and now the words were almost anticlimactic. \u201cWould you like me to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttorneys do this all the time, you know,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer a question with one of their own. Yes, Summer, I\u2019d very much enjoy your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. When do you want to leave in the morning?\u201d</p><p>James told her, and they set a time to meet in the lobby. Summer replaced the receiver and lay back on the bed. She smiled to herself, eager for morning.</p><p>James hadn\u2019t thought of himself as all that old, since at thirty-seven he was the youngest superior court judge in Washington State. Being with Summer, however, made him feel downright ancient.</p><p>She was perfectly named. Being with her was like walking along Green Lake in the middle of August, when the air carried the scent of blooming flowers and sunshine warmed the afternoon. She shone with a summery brightness that made him feel content. More than content. Happy.</p><p>James couldn\u2019t remember any time he\u2019d smiled more than during their dinner together. She\u2019d told him about playing her role at Disneyland. Her joy and enthusiasm for her job bubbled over like champagne. He could have listened to her all night.</p><p>She certainly hadn\u2019t done all the talking, however, and to his surprise he\u2019d found himself telling her about the ins and outs of his own position with the court and the upcoming election, which was vital to his career.</p><p>His life was very different from hers. While Summer worked in the delightful world of fantasy, he struggled with the often cruel, unjust world of reality.</p><p>Naturally he couldn\u2019t give her any details about the cases he\u2019d heard, but just talking about his short time on the bench had lifted his spirits considerably. It felt good to share his thoughts with her and he\u2019d enjoyed her opinions and her sometimes unpredictable views.</p><p>Then they\u2019d kissed. Talk about sexual chemistry! For the life of him, James couldn\u2019t explain what had happened when she\u2019d slipped into his arms. He\u2019d never intended the kiss to become that intense, but once he\u2019d started, nothing could have stopped him.</p><p>He\u2019d been afraid his reaction had shocked Summer, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case. Later she\u2019d apologized to him and James hadn\u2019t known what to say. She seemed to think she\u2019d done something wrong. She hadn\u2019t. The truth was, she\u2019d done everything right.</p><p>The next morning James sat down in the lobby to wait for Summer. He was excited about this outing. He\u2019d decided earlier not to invite her, feeling it would be unfair to dominate her time. She was young and beautiful, and he doubted she wanted to spend her vacation with a staid older guy like him.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to his hotel room and congratulated himself on not mentioning the trip to Hoover Dam. Ten minutes later he\u2019d talked himself into calling her on the off chance she might be interested.</p><p>Well, she\u2019d told him. A smile pulled at the edges of his mouth. Summer had seemed downright angry when he suggested she\u2019d prefer to be with friends her own age.</p><p>James liked the idea of being her friend. The operative word being friend. He wasn\u2019t going to kiss her again\u2014that was for sure.</p><p>First, he was afraid of a repeat performance of that kiss in the street. Secondly, he was way too old for her. He enjoyed her company tremendously, but then any man would. He wasn\u2019t going to ruin the bond they\u2019d created; becoming romantically involved, if she even wanted to, would do exactly that.</p><p>Summer stepped off the elevator, and James watched as every eye in the place seemed to gravitate toward her. She was stunning. It wasn\u2019t the clothes she wore, although the pretty pink pants and matching sweater flattered her. It was Summer herself.</p><p>She searched the lobby until she saw him, and then she smiled. James felt as though the sun was beaming directly down on him.</p><p>He stood and waited for her to join him. \u201cDid you have breakfast?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cHours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready, we can be on our way.\u201d All he had to do now was stop staring at her....</p><p>A few minutes later, the valet took his ticket for his rental car, and they waited for him to drive the luxury sedan to the back of the hotel. When the car arrived, the young man opened the car door and helped Summer inside. James was almost jealous to have been denied the privilege.</p> <p>They drove out of Las Vegas in companionable silence. James had studied the map so he knew which freeway to take.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about her?\u201d Summer asked.</p><p>James had no idea what she was talking about. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s answer enough. Christy. Your ex-fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Christy.\u201d James mulled over Summer\u2019s question. \u201cSometimes. Generally when I\u2019m feeling especially lonely or when I see a couple with kids. That\u2019s when I wonder what Christy\u2019s and my children would have looked like.</p> <p>\u201cDo you still think about Brett?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lifted one shoulder in a halfhearted shrug. \u201cSometimes. It\u2019s different with me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what you told me about Christy, she went to Montana to help her sister and met someone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would\u2019ve broken the engagement right away, but it seemed like a heartless thing to do over the phone.\u201d Despite everything James felt a need to defend her. \u201cWhen she did get back, her mother had arranged for a huge engagement party and I was extremely busy with an important lawsuit. I never blamed Christy for not telling me about Cody right away. She had her reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame her,\u201d Summer said stiffly. \u201cIt was a rotten thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou blame Brett, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d This was what their conversation was really about, James suspected. Something had happened recently that had hurt her all over again.</p><p>\u201cRight before I left,\u201d she said in a small voice, \u201ca friend called to tell me Brett and his wife are expecting a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d James wondered about that. There seemed to be a certain type of person who delighted in being the first to deliver bad news.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be twenty-eight next month,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cFrom the way you said that, one would think you\u2019re ready to apply for your retirement benefits.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled back. \u201cI suppose I sound ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you sound hurt. It\u2019s only natural, but that pain will fade in time, as well, especially if you meet someone else and get involved in another relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>James couldn\u2019t argue. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I\u2019d dedicated myself to loving Christy for the rest of my life. To be fair, I\u2019m not sure why I never got involved again. It\u2019s not like I made the decision not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally.\u201d A few months ago, two women had let him know that they\u2019d welcome his attentions. James was flattered and he did enjoy a night out now and then, but he could never seem to dredge up much enthusiasm for either woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, then mentally kicked himself. The answer was obvious. Someone like Summer had a long line of men waiting to ask her out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t date all that often,\u201d Summer surprised him by saying. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, when Brett and I first broke up I saw a different man every night. Within a month I was sick of it, sick of pretending I didn\u2019t care, sick of telling everyone about all the fun I was having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been out all month. December is crazy, anyway, with Christmas and family obligations and everything else. In November, I went to a dinner party with a member of the cast, but it was as friends, and it was more a favor to Steve than anything.\u201d</p><p>Silly as it seemed, James was offended that she didn\u2019t count their dinner the night before as a date. He certainly had. Their time together had been the highlight of the year for him.</p><p>\u201cMy parents want me married,\u201d she murmured thoughtfully. \u201cThey hinted at it over Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Now, that was something James could identify with. \u201cMy father\u2019s a longtime widower and I don\u2019t have any siblings. He\u2019s been hounding me for years to marry, but his real interest lies in grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to marry just anyone,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>They glanced at each other and then immediately looked away. Silence again filled the car. James didn\u2019t know what Summer was thinking, but he knew where his thoughts were taking him and it spelled trouble.</p><p>As they neared the outskirts of Boulder City, James mentioned some of the local facts he\u2019d read. \u201cThis is the only city in Nevada that doesn\u2019t allow gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was built for the men who worked on the construction of the dam. I\u2019d guess it has something to do with making sure the workers wouldn\u2019t squander their hard-earned cash on the gaming tables. If that happened, their families would see none of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if it helped,\u201d Summer mused aloud.</p><p>The next hour and a half was spent driving over Hoover Dam. They didn\u2019t take the tour. The day was windy, and James was afraid Summer\u2019s sweater wouldn\u2019t be enough protection against the cold.</p><p>Once they were back on the Nevada side, they stopped long enough for pictures. James felt the wind as he took several scenic photos of the dam with the digital camera he\u2019d bought last year.</p><p>Far more of his shots were aimed at Summer. She was a natural ham and struck a variety of poses for him. He wanted a keepsake of his time with her.</p><p>James asked another tourist to get a picture of the two of them together. He placed his arm around her shoulder and smiled into the camera.</p><p>\u201cCan you send them to me?\u201d she asked, rubbing her arms in an effort to warm herself.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d James agreed, pleased that she\u2019d asked.</p><p>He turned up the heater when they returned to the car. He noticed that Summer\u2019s eyes were drooping about ten miles outside Boulder City. He located a classical-music station on the radio, and the soft strains of Mozart lulled her to sleep.</p><p>She woke when they were on the Las Vegas freeway. Startled, she sat up and looked around. \u201cWow, I must be stimulating company,\u201d she said, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m accustomed to quiet. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she began, then yawned, covering her mouth. \u201cWhat do you think of women who ask men out on dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d He repeated her question, never having given the subject much thought. \u201cWell, it seems fine in theory but I can\u2019t really say since it\u2019s never happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you view them as aggressive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. I know women invite men out all the time these days.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and her eyes fairly danced with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say so, because I bought two tickets to a magic show. It\u2019s this evening at one of the other downtown hotels. I\u2019d enjoy it very much if you went with me.\u201d</p><p>James had walked into that one with his eyes wide-open. \u201cA magic show,\u201d he murmured with pleasure. He hadn\u2019t even dropped her off at the hotel yet and already he was looking for an excuse to see her again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the late show, as it happens, which doesn\u2019t start until eleven. You\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. If he wasn\u2019t driving, James would have pumped his fist in the air.</p><p>Although she\u2019d spent nearly the entire day with James, including lunch and a light dinner on the road, Summer counted the hours until they met for the magic show. She was dressing when the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, thinking it could only be James. Her heart began to beat faster.</p><p>\u201cSummer, it\u2019s Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie!\u201d Summer had tried to call her friend earlier that evening, but she hadn\u2019t answered either her cell or the apartment phone. \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you. How\u2019s it going with the distinguished attorney?\u201d</p><p>Summer sank onto the edge of the bed. \u201cReally well. By the way, he\u2019s a superior court judge now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s great. So you\u2019re getting along well,\u201d her friend echoed in knowing tones. \u201cDo you still see him as a father figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Summer said, and laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s less than ten years between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Her friend\u2019s voice fell. \u201cTell me what\u2019s been happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Summer wasn\u2019t sure where to start, then decided to plunge right in. \u201cHe kissed me last night, and Julie, it was incredible. I don\u2019t ever remember feeling like this in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d say there\u2019s electricity between you?\u201d</p><p>That was putting it mildly. Hoover Dam should produce that much electricity. \u201cYou could put it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to see Hoover Dam this morning, and tonight we\u2019re going to a magic show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sounds promising.\u201d</p><p>That was how it felt to Summer, as well. \u201cJames invited me to drive to Red Rock Canyon with him tomorrow to feed the burros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It had never occurred to Summer to refuse. She didn\u2019t care if he asked her to study goat dung; she would gladly have gone along just to be with him.</p><p>\u201cJulie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you laugh at me if I told you I\u2019m falling in love with this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ve seen it coming for months. You pored over his letters, and for days after you got one, it was James this and James that. I\u2019m not the least bit surprised. This guy must really be something.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s heart sank as she confronted the facts. \u201cHe\u2019s a judge, Julie. A superior court judge. I\u2019m an actress. We\u2019re too different. I live in Anaheim and he\u2019s in Seattle. Oh, it\u2019s fine here in Vegas, but once we leave, everything will go back to the way it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Summer admitted after some hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThen you need to ask yourself exactly what it is you do want,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>Her roommate\u2019s words rang in her mind all through the magician\u2019s performance. Summer sat beside James and was far more aware of him than the talented performer onstage. There was magic in the air, all right. It sizzled and sparked, but it didn\u2019t have a thing to do with what was happening onstage.</p><p>After the show, James escorted her to his car, which was parked in a lot outside the casino.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet this evening,\u201d James commented.</p><p>\u201cI talked to my roommate earlier,\u201d she told him when he slid into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have something to do with Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head for emphasis. When James inserted the key to start the car, she placed her hand on his forearm to stop him. \u201cJames,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI know this is an unusual request, and I\u2019m sorry if it embarrasses you, but would you mind kissing me again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering what happened the first time, it seems unnecessarily risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she murmured, disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cSummer, listen,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and very sweet, but I\u2019m too old for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an excuse, James, you\u2019re going to need something better than that.\u201d This was the second time he\u2019d brought up their age difference, and it made her mad. \u201cForget I asked,\u201d she said heatedly. \u201cIt was a stupid idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d He turned the ignition switch, and the engine fired to life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to tell me you didn\u2019t feel anything. Go ahead and lie, but we both know that\u2019s exactly what it is\u2014a lie.\u201d</p><p>James expelled a labored sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything of the sort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>Summer noticed the way his hands tightened around the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of myself as cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>What surprised Summer was how much his rejection hurt. No doubt James viewed her as immature and naive. Pushy, as well. She was probably the first woman who\u2019d ever asked him out and the only one who\u2019d sought a kiss.</p><p>Shame burned in her cheeks. The sooner they were back at the hotel and she could escape, the better.</p> <p>The engine revved, but they weren\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, James had pulled the car onto the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well know,\u201d he muttered, turning off the car. \u201cI\u2019ve had one hell of a time keeping my hands off you as it is. It doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re asking me to kiss you again.\u201d</p><p>Having said that, he drew her into his arms. His lips were hungry and hard, his kiss long and deep. He broke it off abruptly.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSatisfied now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered back, and directed his mouth back to hers.</p><p>This time the kiss was slow and sweet. Her mouth nibbled his, and she was completely and utterly amazed by how good it was.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, and her tongue outlined his lips.</p> <p>James groaned, and she experienced an intense sense of power.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of control when it comes to you,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t said that.\u201d He kissed her again, deeply, and when the kiss ended, she was clinging to James, mindless of anything but what was happening between them.</p><p>James rested his forehead against hers, his breathing uneven. After he\u2019d regained some control, he locked his arms around her and drew her close. For the longest time all he did was hold her.</p><p>It felt like heaven to be in James\u2019s arms. Summer felt cherished, protected...loved.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of something like this,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSomething like what?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThink about it, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking about it. I don\u2019t understand the problem. I like it when you kiss me and touch me. I assumed you liked it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re too old for me, I won\u2019t be held responsible for my actions.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, brushing the hair away from her face. \u201cI\u2019m not too old for you in years, but in attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s easy enough to change. We\u2019ll start first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart what?\u201d he asked, clearly confused.</p><p>She kissed him, letting her lips play over his. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>James was waiting in the lobby early the following morning. Summer\u2019s face broke into a disgruntled look when she saw him. Hands braced on her hips, shaking her head, she walked around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, thinking he might have left part of his shirttail out.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you say we were going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRed Rock Canyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always wear a shirt and tie to feed wild burros?\u201d</p><p>James wore a shirt and tie to everything. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Then I\u2019d like to suggest we stop at a mall first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mall? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him as if she questioned his intelligence. \u201cI\u2019m taking you shopping,\u201d she announced. \u201cIf you have any objections, you\u2019d better voice them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping,\u201d James repeated slowly. That was probably his least favorite thing to do. He avoided malls whenever possible. \u201cBut why?\u201d he asked innocently. He wasn\u2019t giving in without a fight.</p><p>\u201cClothes,\u201d she informed him, then added in case he hadn\u2019t figured it out, \u201cfor you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Summer said. \u201cI think you look wonderful in a suit and tie, but you\u2019d be far more comfortable in jeans and a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>So this was what she meant about altering his attitude. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that it involved torturing him by dragging him in and out of stores.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d She gazed up at him with wide eyes. \u201cAre we going to the mall or not?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her he felt perfectly relaxed in what he was wearing. He would\u2019ve said it, too, if she hadn\u2019t blinked just then and her long, silky lashes fanned her cheek. Without much effort this woman was going to wrap him around her little finger. James could see it coming, but he lacked the strength to offer even token resistance.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d he asked, and glanced at his watch, trying to give the impression that the burros only made their appearance at certain times. They did, but not in the way he was hoping to imply. The minute they suspected visitors had something edible, they appeared.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be more than an hour,\u201d she promised. \u201cTwo at most.\u201d</p><p>He was being fed a line, and he knew it. They\u2019d be lucky to make Red Rock Canyon before nightfall.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said with a sigh, wondering how a mature, reasonable male would allow a woman he\u2019d barely met to dictate his wardrobe.</p><p>A relationship between them was unrealistic for so many reasons. The age factor, for one. And then she lived and worked in southern California, while his life was in Seattle. He didn\u2019t know much about acting, but it seemed to him that if she was serious about her career, California was the place to be. Long-distance relationships rarely survived.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret this,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>She was wrong. James already regretted it.</p><p>The only shopping mall he knew of in Vegas was the one located on the Strip between two of the largest casino hotels. He drove there and pulled into the underground parking.</p><p>When he turned off the ignition, Summer leaned over and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asked, although he realized he should be counting his blessings instead of questioning them.</p><p>\u201cTo thank you for being such a good sport.\u201d</p><p>Little did she know.</p><p>To his surprise, Summer stuck to her word. It took less than two hours for her to locate everything she felt he needed. James followed her around like a dutiful child\u2014and discovered he was actually enjoying himself. He let her choose for him, and she did well, generally picking styles he might have picked himself.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I squeak when I walk,\u201d he said as he led the way back into the underground garage. Almost everything he had on was new. Right down to the running shoes and socks. He\u2019d changed in a washroom at the mall.</p><p>\u201cYou look twenty years younger,\u201d Summer told him.</p><p>\u201cIn which case, you could be accused of cradle-robbing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and slipped her arm through his. She pressed her head against his shoulder, and James derived a good deal of pleasure from having her so close. He was still trying to figure out how he was going to keep his hands off her.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels like I\u2019ve known you forever,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>James felt the same way. It was as if she\u2019d been part of his life for a very long time. \u201cI have the feeling I\u2019m going to have a huge long-distance phone bill once I get back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Summer closed her eyes and sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d He unlocked the car door and loaded the shopping bags into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful, that\u2019s all,\u201d Summer told him.</p><p>\u201cGrateful?\u201d James asked, joining her inside the car.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t respond to other men this way\u2014the way I have with you. I can\u2019t give you a reason or a logical explanation. In the last year, since we\u2019ve been writing, I\u2019ve felt close to you. It\u2019s as if you know all there is to know about me. My secrets, my faults, everything.</p><p>\u201cThat night a year ago, when we met, was probably the most devastating of my life. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if it hadn\u2019t been for you. Generally I\u2019m the first person to dismiss this sort of thing, but I believe we were destined to meet.\u201d</p><p>James had wondered about that himself, although he\u2019d always seen himself as a rational man. Of all the people in that massive New Year\u2019s crowd, they\u2019d found each other. It had to mean something. He didn\u2019t doubt that fate, kismet or whatever you wanted to call it, had brought them together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced the things I do when you kiss me,\u201d she confided.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in that, either. He started the engine and pulled into the traffic that continuously flowed along the Strip. Concentrating on his driving rather than looking at Summer helped him restrain his emotions\u2014and his impulses.</p><p>If they\u2019d stayed in the parking garage much longer, James knew they\u2019d have had a repeat performance of the night before.</p><p>Kissing her again had been a big mistake. He\u2019d spent half the night fighting off the image of her in bed with him. If he took any more cold showers, the hotel was going to complain about the amount of water he used.</p><p>Summer\u2019s voice was unsure when she spoke. \u201cI thought that after last evening you wouldn\u2019t want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>James nearly drove the car off the road. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze to her hands, which were folded primly in her lap. \u201cWell, I behaved so...brazenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She obviously didn\u2019t know how close he\u2019d come to losing control. Superior court judges weren\u2019t supposed to lose control. James couldn\u2019t remember the last time something like this had happened. Probably because it never had...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know I\u2019m not in this alone. I don\u2019t think I could stand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m experiencing the same feelings you are,\u201d he told her in what had to be the understatement of the century.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both be going our separate ways in the next few days. Until just now, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever hear from you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch all year\u2014why would that end?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect anything permanent to develop between them, though; that would be asking too much.</p><p>\u201cWe can take turns calling each other,\u201d she offered. \u201cMaybe exchanging e-mails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Summer was silent following that, and he was beginning to recognize quiet moments as a warning. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at him and smiled softly. \u201cI was thinking it would be nice to see each other every once in a while. I hope I don\u2019t seem pushy.\u201d</p><p>Seeing her on a regular basis suited him just fine. They hadn\u2019t even gone their separate ways yet, and James was already starting to feel withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>\u201cI could fly up and visit you one month, and you could fly down and visit me the next,\u201d she suggested, again sounding uncertain.</p><p>James\u2019s hands tightened around the steering wheel. He suspected that the more often he saw her, the harder it would be to let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The complete truth would have embarrassed them both. \u201cI was reviewing my schedule.\u201d The primary wasn\u2019t until September, but Ralph Southworth, a businessman and longtime friend who\u2019d agreed to head James\u2019s campaign, had made it clear long ago: From here on out, James\u2019s life wasn\u2019t his own. Every place he went, every civic event he attended, would be a campaign opportunity.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFebruary might be difficult for me to get away.\u201d His workload had suffered because of this vacation, and another trip, however brief, so soon afterward could cause additional problems.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I can come to you. In fact, I\u2019ve probably got enough frequent-flyer miles to make the trip free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll try to come to Anaheim in March.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d She lit up like a sparkler on the Fourth of July. Then she hesitated and bit her lower lip. \u201cApril might be difficult. Disneyland stays open until midnight during spring break, and we add a second Beauty and the Beast show in the evenings. It\u2019s hard to get a free weekend then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work around it.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to mention that from June onward, his schedule would be impossible. There was no hope of visiting California, and even if she was able to come to Seattle, he couldn\u2019t guarantee he\u2019d be able to spend any time with her.</p><p>\u201cYes, we can work around any obstacle,\u201d she agreed. But she didn\u2019t sound optimistic.</p><p>They were outside the city now, driving on a two-lane highway that led to Red Rock Canyon. \u201cI\u2019ll be very involved in my campaign this summer.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel he could be less than honest.</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s the busiest time of year for me, too,\u201d she said with an air of defeat. \u201cBut we can make this work, James, if we both want it badly enough.\u201d</p><p>It frightened him how much he wanted Summer, but he was a realist, so he pointed out the obvious. \u201cLong-distance relationships hardly ever work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? You\u2019ve had several and you speak from experience?\u201d</p> <p>James resisted the urge to laugh at her prim tone. If memory served him, his first-grade teacher, Mrs. Bondi, had used precisely that voice. Come to think of it, he\u2019d been in love with her, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be shocked by how few relationships I\u2019ve had,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a relationship?\u201d Summer asked softly.</p><p>James certainly hoped so. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered. And then, because she seemed to need convincing, he pulled onto a dirt road, behind a ten-foot rock. A trail of red dust plumed behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you stopping?\u201d she asked.</p><p>James wore a wide grin and held out his arms. \u201cIt appears to me you need a little reminder of how involved we are.\u201d James knew he was asking for trouble. Trouble with a capital T. His resistance was about as weak as it could get.</p><p>\u201cOh, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few kisses is all, understand? I don\u2019t have much willpower when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d The words were whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you talk too much?\u201d James asked as his mouth swooped down on hers. He kissed her the way he\u2019d been wanting to all morning. No, from the moment he\u2019d watched her approach him in the gazebo.</p><p>He kissed her again and again, unable to get his fill. He demanded and she gave. Then she demanded and he gave. He moaned and she sighed. Then and there, James decided he\u2019d do whatever he had to\u2014move heaven and earth, take a red-eye flight\u2014to be with her. He doubted once a month would be enough.</p><p>He plowed his hands into her hair and sifted the long strands through his fingers. With their mouths still joined, he lowered one hand to her throat. Her pulse beat savagely against his fingertips.</p><p>James had never thought of himself as a weak man. But with Summer he felt as hot and out of control as a seventeen-year-old in his dad\u2019s car.</p><p>Reluctantly he dragged his mouth from hers and trailed moist kisses along the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He brought his mouth back to hers, kissing her slow and easy. Talking was the last thing on his mind.</p><p>She pulled slightly away. \u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, distracted.</p><p>\u201cWe seem\u2014\u201d she whispered breathlessly.</p><p>His lips returned to her face, lighting on her forehead, her nose, her chin.</p><p>\u201c\u2014to have company.\u201d</p><p>James went still. When he\u2019d left the road, he\u2019d made sure they were out of sight of other drivers. \u201cCompany?\u201d he repeated. He could already imagine the headlines. King County Superior Court Judge Caught in Compromising Position in Las Vegas.</p><p>\u201cThey look hungry.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s gaze followed Summer\u2019s. Burros, five of them, stood outside the car, studying them intently. They were waiting for a handout.</p><p>James grinned. At least the burros didn\u2019t carry a camera.</p><p>Summer smiled, too.</p><p>\u201cI brought along a loaf of bread,\u201d he said, and reached into the seat behind him.</p><p>\u201cShould we get out of the car?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d He\u2019d read about the burros, but wasn\u2019t sure how tame they were. \u201cPerhaps we should lower the window a bit and feed them that way.\u201d</p><p>Summer opened her window a couple of inches, far enough to ease a slice of bread out to the eager mouths. Just how eager was something they were to quickly learn.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Summer backed away from the window as a large tongue poked through the small opening.</p><p>Soon they were both laughing and handing out the bread as fast as they could. James was going to be sorry when it ran out. Summer certainly seemed to be enjoying herself, and so was he.</p><p>When the loaf was finished, they raised the windows. It took the burros a while to realize their food supply had come to an end.</p><p>When the burros finally left, James started the engine and pulled back onto the road. They drove for another hour, stopped and toured a visitors\u2019 center, taking in the beauty of the countryside.</p><p>James felt Summer staring at him as he drove back to the city.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get over the change in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You look like a Jim instead of a James.\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, a big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d he asked, studying her from the corner of his eye.</p><p>His question made her hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I like the way Jim dresses, but I like the way James kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about how Jim kisses?\u201d The conversation was getting ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cToo impatient, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit miffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so wonderful about James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis restraint. When James kisses me, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s holding back part of himself. I have the feeling he\u2019s afraid to let go, and it drives me crazy. I want to discover what he\u2019s hiding from me. I know this probably sounds a little crazy, but I find James intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jim?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, but he\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d James was beginning to feel downright cocky.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got that devil-may-care attitude. I have a strong feeling we should be grateful to those burros, because there\u2019s no telling what could\u2019ve happened between us in the canyon.\u201d</p><p>She was right about that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s those shoes you made me buy,\u201d James told her. \u201cThe minute I put them on, I had this incredible urge to look for a basketball court and do slam dunks.\u201d James loved the sound of Summer\u2019s laugher. He\u2019d never been one to tease and joke, but he reveled in her appreciation of his wit.</p><p>It was midafternoon when they arrived back at the hotel. After showing the security guard their keys, they stepped into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHow about dinner?\u201d he asked, hoping he sounded casual when in reality he felt anything but.</p><p>\u201cSure. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he said. Three hours, and he\u2019d be more than ready to see her again. He wanted to suggest they do something until then, but didn\u2019t feel he should monopolize her time, although he\u2019d pretty much succeeded in doing that anyway.</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock. In the lobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lobby,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>The elevator stopped at her floor, and Summer stared down at her room key. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d They sounded like a couple of parrots.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking me this morning,\u201d she said, easing toward the door. \u201cAnd for coming to the mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He bounced an imaginary basketball and pretended to make a hoop shot.</p><p>She smiled, and acting on pure instinct, James lowered his mouth to hers. The kiss was gentle, and when they broke apart, it was all James could do not to follow her to her room.</p><p>Summer sat on the end of her bed, trembling. She closed her eyes and tried to relive those last seconds with James and couldn\u2019t. Being in his arms was the only possible way to recapture the sensation she experienced each time she was with him.</p><p>Julie, her roommate, had known long before Summer had realized it herself. When James had asked her how often she dated, she\u2019d invented an excuse to explain why her social life was nonexistent of late.</p><p>But it was really because of his letters.</p><p>Hearing from James had become an important part of her life. On the first day of every month she rushed to the mailbox, knowing there\u2019d be a letter from him, each longer than the one before. She\u2019d fallen in love with the man who\u2019d written her those beautiful letters.</p><p>Unfortunately she hadn\u2019t realized it until she\u2019d seen James. She was worried that she alone experienced all this feeling, all this awareness. But after he\u2019d kissed her, she knew that couldn\u2019t be true. He felt it, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled to herself, remembering how flustered he\u2019d looked when she\u2019d said they had an audience.</p><p>Summer smiled at the memory.</p><p>Lying down on the bed, she stared up at the ceiling and soon found herself giggling. She was in love with James. She didn\u2019t feel a second\u2019s doubt, not the slightest qualm or uncertainty. To think she\u2019d actually believed she\u2019d never love another man after Brett.</p><p>She might have drowned in a pool of self-pity if it hadn\u2019t been for James. She owed him so much.</p> <p>As she considered their plans to continue seeing each other, she knew it would be difficult to maintain the relationship, especially since they lived such separate lives.</p><p>It would require effort and commitment on both their parts. Summer was willing. She could tell that James wasn\u2019t as convinced as she was that they could make this work, but she didn\u2019t harbor a single doubt.</p><p>Summer dressed carefully for her dinner date with James. She chose a simple sundress with a lacy shawl and pretty sandals.</p><p>He was waiting at the same place in the lobby, but he surprised her by not wearing a suit and tie. He\u2019d worn one of the short-sleeved shirts they\u2019d bought that day and a pair of khaki pants. For a moment she barely recognized him. He looked relaxed, as though he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whispered when she joined him.</p> <p>\u201cJim,\u201d he corrected, and grinned. He placed his hand inside his pant pocket and struck a catalog pose.</p><p>Summer laughed delightedly.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry,\u201d James said. He tucked her hand in the crook of his arm and guided her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019re about to indulge ourselves in a feast fit for the gods.\u201d When they reached the sidewalk of Glitter Gulch, the lights made it as bright as the noonday sun.</p><p>\u201cI thought about the conversation we had this afternoon,\u201d he announced out of the blue.</p> <p>\u201cAbout keeping in touch?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we have, the two of us, but whatever it is, I don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only felt this strongly about one other woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only felt this way about one other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was going to put a name on this...this thing between us...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked when he hesitated. James was a thoughtful man. She didn\u2019t mean to rush him, but she wanted him to say what was already on the tip of her tongue. Consequently, she had no qualms about leaping in. \u201cI love you, James Wilkens. I want to throw my arms in the air and sing.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as if he were actually afraid she\u2019d do exactly that. \u201cWhat you feel is just gratitude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGratitude,\u201d she repeated scornfully. \u201cJust gratitude.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m capable of knowing my own mind, thank you kindly, and when I say I love you, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d James said, and his voice fell.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about telling me how you feel, either,\u201d she was quick to assure him. It wasn\u2019t necessary; his kiss told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the crowded sidewalk and pressed her finger to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m crazy about you, Summer. Call me the biggest fool that ever lived, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t been doing a very good job of hiding how I feel. Maybe that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t expect to feel like this.\u201d He splayed his fingers through his hair. \u201cIn retrospect, I wonder what I did expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed we\u2019d have dinner that first night and we\u2019d talk about what we said in our letters, and then we\u2019d more or less go our separate ways, me back to my life in California, you back to yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He arched his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI wanted Julie to fly in for the weekend, but she refused and I couldn\u2019t get her to give me a reason. I know now. She realized what I hadn\u2019t\u2014that I\u2019m in love with you. My feelings developed slowly over the past year, and Julie saw it happening.\u201d She inhaled a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, James. We can make this work if we try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>As his words faded an idea struck Summer. \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>James stopped abruptly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d She clasped his arm as she stared up at him. With every passing second the idea gained momentum. \u201cI just thought of something...wonderful,\u201d she said urgently.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His arm circled her waist.</p><p>\u201cOh, James. Kiss me, please, just kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss you here?\u201d James asked, appalled.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She laughed and, throwing her arms around his neck, she stood on the tips of her toes and kissed him, a deep, lingering kiss that communicated her feelings to him\u2014and his to her.</p><p>He stared down at her dumbstruck when she stepped away.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cI think we should get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried.\u201d The word was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense, don\u2019t you agree? I know how I feel about you, and you\u2019ve admitted your feelings for me. Here we are, both worried about the most ridiculous things, when we already have what\u2019s most important. Each other.\u201d</p><p>Still James didn\u2019t say anything. He looked around, and his expression seemed slightly desperate, but that could have been her imagination.</p><p>\u201cI can guess what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got an answer for every one of your arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know each other.\u201d</p><p>That was a pretty weak argument. \u201cIs that so? You know me better than friends I\u2019ve had all my life. You\u2019ve seen me at my worst. You\u2019ve listened to my pain and my frustrations. There isn\u2019t a thing I can\u2019t talk about with you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and Summer longed to smooth the lines from his brow and kiss away his doubts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so worried! Honestly, James, anyone would think you were in a state of shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d This came through loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d His hesitation took her by surprise. She knew the idea would take some getting used to on James\u2019s part. He didn\u2019t leap into projects and ideas the way she did. He was methodical and thoughtful and carefully weighed every decision.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m assuming something here that I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to marry me, do you, James?\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Summer was mortified to the very marrow of her bones. Without even trying, she\u2019d managed to make a complete fool of herself. James had never come right out and said he was in love with her. But with all their talk about how important they were to each other, she\u2019d naturally assumed he cared as deeply for her as she did for him. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d want to marry her.</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a weak voice. Past experience had taught her to right wrongs as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cSummer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to marry me. I understand. Really, I do,\u201d she said and pretended to laugh, but it sounded more like a muffled sob. \u201cNow I\u2019ve embarrassed us both. I don\u2019t know why I say the ridiculous things I do.\u201d She tried to make light of it by gesturing with her hands. \u201cI guess I should\u2019ve warned you that I blurt out the most incredibly awkward stuff. Forget I said anything about marriage, please\u2014otherwise it\u2019ll ruin our evening.\u201d</p><p>James was silent, which made everything ten times worse. She\u2019d rather he ranted and raved than said nothing.</p><p>In an effort to fill the terrible silence, she started chattering, talking fast, jumping from one subject to another.</p><p>She commented on how busy the casinos were. She talked about the big-name stars performing in town. She mentioned a friend of a friend who\u2019d won the California State lottery, and then brought up air pollution problems in Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cSummer, stop,\u201d James finally told her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her mouth shut. How she was going to get through the evening without humiliating herself further, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Her stomach was in such a knot that by the time they reached the hotel where the restaurant was located, she felt sure she\u2019d only be able to make a pretense of eating.</p><p>The hostess seated them, but Summer got up as soon as the hostess left them.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d she said.</p><p>James looked up from his menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She was hoping that a few minutes alone in the ladies\u2019 room would help her regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cSummer, wait,\u201d James said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel bad about this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, determined to drop the subject entirely. \u201cDid you notice they had lobster on the menu?\u201d She didn\u2019t actually know if this was true or not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that most men prefer to do the asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d And it went without saying that the very proper King County Superior Court Judge James Wilkens wouldn\u2019t want an empty-headed actress for a wife.</p><p>Summer asked a passing waiter directions for the ladies\u2019 room. As she walked across the restaurant, weaving around tables, she felt James\u2019s eyes following her.</p><p>Once inside the restroom, Summer sat on the pink velvet sofa and closed her eyes. After a number of deep, calming breaths, she waited for the acute embarrassment to pass.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Briefly she toyed with the idea of slipping away, but that would\u2019ve been childish and unfair to James. His only crime had been his silence, and he\u2019d already explained that was simply his way. Just like making a world-class fool of herself seemed to be hers.</p><p>Five minutes later she rejoined him.</p><p>He looked up, almost as if he was surprised to see her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be that rude. It isn\u2019t your fault I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought you\u2019d marry someone like me,\u201d she said, poking fun at herself. \u201cThe girl who always speaks before she thinks and leaps before she looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do plan to marry you.\u201d He announced this while scanning the menu, which he then set aside. He watched her as if he expected some kind of argument. Summer might have offered him one if her throat hadn\u2019t closed up, making talking impossible.</p><p>The menu slid from her fingers and fell onto the table. Nervously she groped for it.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided?\u201d James asked.</p><p>She stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to order for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even glanced at the menu. Frazzled as she was, she chose the first thing she saw. \u201cChicken Dijon,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot lobster? It isn\u2019t every day one becomes engaged. I think we should celebrate, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Somehow she managed a nod.</p><p>The waiter came, and James ordered for them both, requesting lobster and champagne. Their server nodded approvingly and disappeared. A moment later he returned with a champagne bottle for James\u2019s inspection.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to see about an engagement ring,\u201d James said as though they were discussing something as mundane as the weather. \u201cI imagine Las Vegas has quite a few good jewelers.\u201d</p> <p>The waiter opened the champagne bottle with a loud pop and poured a small amount into the fluted glass for James to sample. He tasted it and nodded. Soon both their glasses were filled.</p><p>Summer breathed easier once they were alone. \u201cJames,\u201d she whispered, leaning forward. \u201cAre you sure you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, too, and a grin slowly formed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll at once I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019m the right person for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the one to decide that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but...I\u2019d hate to think we\u2019re reacting to circumstances that wouldn\u2019t repeat themselves in a hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have a long engagement. We\u2019ll both be positive before we take that final step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Summer felt only mildly reassured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to see each other on a regular basis,\u201d James told her.</p><p>\u201cYes...we\u2019ll need that.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the idea of being apart so much, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want the engagement to be too long,\u201d Summer said. \u201cI dated Brett for five years, and we were unofficially and then officially engaged almost that whole time. We both know where that ended up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you wish you\u2019d married him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t have a single regret. I know you\u2019d never do the things Brett did.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s eyes brightened with intensity. \u201cIt isn\u2019t in me to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d never knowingly hurt you,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cIn light of what happened between Christy and me, I\u2019m not fond of long engagements, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret not marrying her sooner? That way she would\u2019ve gone to visit her sister as a married woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that,\u201d James said. \u201cChristy would never have allowed anything to develop between her and Cody if we\u2019d been married. Getting involved with him behind my back was almost more than she could bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Summer figured she could read the writing on the wall. \u201cYou wish you\u2019d married her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His quick response surprised her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy Manning didn\u2019t love me as much as I loved her. I\u2019m sure she would have done her best to be a good wife, and we probably would have grown close over the years, but she would\u2019ve married me for the wrong reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wrong reasons? What reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to make her parents happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Summer said slowly, still feeling her way carefully around the subject. \u201cSo neither of us wants a long engagement. How long is long? A year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too long,\u201d James said with feeling.</p><p>\u201cSix months?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019ll make it June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune\u2019s a nice month,\u201d Summer said without any real enthusiasm. \u201cWill you want me to live with you in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is that going to be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your career?\u201d</p><p>She lifted one shoulder. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I was getting a little tired of playing Belle anyway. From what I understand, theater in Seattle is thriving. There wouldn\u2019t be any problem with me being your wife and an actress, would there? You being a judge and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Summer picked up her fork and ran her fingers along the smooth tines. \u201cMy current contract expires in April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril,\u201d James said. \u201cCan you arrange a wedding on such short notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I can,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cOh, James, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, neither can I,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Summer had never seen him smile as brightly.</p><p>The waiter brought their dinner, and James looked at the man who was a complete stranger and said, \u201cThe young lady and I have just become engaged.\u201d</p><p>Their server smiled broadly. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Summer would have added her thanks, but James had shocked her speechless. He wasn\u2019t joking; he really meant to follow through with their wedding and he was excited about it. Excited enough to announce their plans to a stranger.</p><p>\u201cThis hotel has an excellent wedding chapel,\u201d the waiter continued. \u201cI gather that more than one celebrity has been married in our chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here in the hotel?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cMany of the larger hotels provide wedding services for their guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t arrangements have to be made weeks in advance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d the waiter explained. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t decide which chapel to use until after they arrive. Apparently you can get married with a few hours\u2019 notice\u2014if the chapel\u2019s available, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d James murmured.</p><p>A look came over him, one she\u2019d seen before. \u201cOur wedding will be in April,\u201d she said hastily.</p><p>\u201cMy very best to both of you.\u201d The waiter refilled their flutes with champagne.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d Summer said after the server had left their table, \u201cis something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing an odd look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a look that says you\u2019re not sure you like what you\u2019re thinking. Or hearing or seeing. The same one you got when I said we had company in Red Rock Canyon the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d he muttered</p><p>\u201cYou want to call off the wedding?\u201d She should\u2019ve realized that when James said he wanted to marry her, it was too good to be true. This had to be the shortest engagement in history.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you get the idea that I\u2019m looking for a way out when I\u2019m thinking exactly the opposite. I can only assume impulsive thoughts must be transmitted from one brain to another.\u201d He drew in a deep breath and seemed to hold it for a long time. \u201cWould you be willing to marry me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? You mean tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then we\u2019ll repeat the ceremony later with family and friends in April.\u201d</p><p>Speechlessness happened rarely with Summer, and yet James had managed to cause it twice in the same evening. Her mouth dropped open, but no words came out.</p><p>\u201cSummer, have I utterly shocked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted in a squeaky voice.</p><p>James grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll admit this is the first impulsive thought I\u2019ve entertained in years. If you can propose marriage at the drop of a hat, then I should be able to come up with something equally thrilling.\u201d</p><p>Summer knew she was going to cry now. She could feel the tears welling up in her eyes. She used her linen napkin to dab them away.</p><p>\u201cJust remember when we tell the children about this night. You\u2019re the one who proposed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren.\u201d Summer blew her nose. \u201cOh, James, I\u2019m looking forward to being a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you agree to my plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried twice?\u201d Everything was going too fast for her. \u201cI\u2019d want Julie here as my maid of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ll phone her as soon as we\u2019re finished dinner. I\u2019ll be happy to pay for her airfare.\u201d</p><p>The tears were back, filling her eyes. These were tears of happiness and relief; she loved him so much. \u201cJames, we\u2019re doing the right thing, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes. It\u2019s what we both want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d He\u2019d never said the words.</p><p>His look softened. \u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>Her mind whirled with everything they\u2019d need to do. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell my parents. You didn\u2019t intend to keep our marriage a secret from our families, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll call my father, as well.\u201d</p><p>Already Summer could hear her mother\u2019s arguments \u201cThey\u2019re going to think we\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>James grinned again. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do first?\u201d Summer asked as they left the restaurant after dinner.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should find an available wedding chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we contact our families before we do that?\u201d This was the part Summer dreaded most, and she wanted it over with as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cBut if we have the chapel booked, we\u2019ll be able to tell them the time and place,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Trust him to be so logical even when he was acting impulsive.</p><p>\u201cThe ring.\u201d James snapped his fingers. \u201cI almost forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so concerned. We can pick something out later. A plain gold band is perfect for now. In April we can exchange those for a diamond if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to have my mother\u2019s ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to wear it,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He kissed her, and Summer blinked in surprise. It was the first time he\u2019d ever initiated a kiss in public.</p><p>Since the waiter had mentioned the wedding chapel at this particular hotel, they tried there first. Summer hadn\u2019t expected it to be so easy, but booking their wedding took only a few minutes. The hotel would see to everything, from obtaining the license to the music and flowers. They\u2019d be getting married at seven the next night.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known it was this simple,\u201d James said as they walked back to the Four Queens, \u201cI might have suggested it sooner.\u201d</p><p>Summer pressed her head against his shoulder. They stopped at a crosswalk and waited for the red light.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d kiss me again,\u201d she breathed close to his ear.</p><p>His gaze found her lips, and he cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d she murmured, but disappointment underscored her words.</p><p>\u201cYou can call your family from my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, but her mind wasn\u2019t on making the dreaded phone call as much as it was on being alone with James.</p><p>His thoughts must have been the same because their pace quickened as they hurried across the street and into the hotel.</p><p>The elevator ride seemed to take an eternity. As if James couldn\u2019t keep himself from touching her in some way, he reached out and brushed a stray curl from her cheek. His knuckle grazed her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re willing to marry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI feel like the luckiest woman alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He held his hand to his brow. \u201cI want you so much I think I\u2019m running a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a fever, too. Oh, James, we\u2019re going to be so good for each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Summer. I\u2019m weak enough where you\u2019re concerned. Much more of this, and I\u2019m going to make love to you right in this elevator.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled and moved against the back wall. \u201cYou\u2019re so romantic, James\u2014and I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at me like you know exactly what I want. Your eyes are telling me you want it as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>The elevator eased to a stop, and the doors slid open. Summer\u2019s heart pounded fast as neither of them made the slightest effort to leave.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to call our families,\u201d she reminded him just as the doors started to close.</p><p>James swallowed hard. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>With precise movements he led the way out of the elevator and down the hallway to his room. She noticed that when he inserted the key his hand trembled slightly, and she loved him all the more for it.</p> <p>\u201cThe phone\u2019s over by the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed.\u201d She completed his sentence, and the word seemed to stick in her throat. She walked across the room and sat on the edge of the mattres, then picked up the phone to dial the familiar number.</p><p>It might\u2019ve helped if she\u2019d taken the time to figure out what to tell her parents. But she was afraid she\u2019d lose her nerve.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t put into words what she felt for James. She\u2019d never loved anyone this way, this much, and she believed he hadn\u2019t, either. They\u2019d each been in love with someone else, and that other person had caused deep pain. This time was different.</p><p>She knew, even before they answered the phone, what her mother and father were going to say.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said, in a panic, banging down the telephone receiver and holding out her arms. \u201cPlease, could you kiss me first?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at the man she\u2019d marry in less than twenty-four hours, and his face was a study in raw sexual need. He walked across the room. The bed dipped as his weight joined hers. With loving care he gathered her in his arms and claimed her mouth. The kiss was slow and sensual.</p><p>He broke away, and his breath was hard and labored. Eager for the taste of him, the touch and feel of him, she brushed her lips over the curve of his jaw, then brought her mouth back to his.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should call your father first,\u201d she whispered when she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. Reluctantly he sat up and reached for the bedside phone. Summer knelt behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist and pressing her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s James,\u201d she heard him say.</p><p>\u201cFine...yes, Vegas is just fine.\u201d Summer could hear a voice on the other end of the line, but she couldn\u2019t make out what was being said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to let you know I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>The voice went silent.</p><p>\u201cDad? Are you still there?\u201d</p><p>The faraway voice returned, this time speaking very fast.</p><p>\u201cDad...Dad...Dad.\u201d Each time James tried to cut in, he was prevented from saying anything.</p><p>In frustration, he held the phone away from his ear. \u201cI think you\u2019d better talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Summer cried. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Summer took the receiver and covered it with her hand. \u201cJust remember this when we talk to my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He kissed her briefly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wilkens,\u201d Summer said. It sounded as if the line had suddenly gone dead. \u201cMy name\u2019s Summer Lawton. James and I have known each other a year. I love him very, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve known my son for a year, how is it we\u2019ve never met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnaheim. I\u2019m an actress.\u201d She might as well give him all the bad news at once. She didn\u2019t dare look at James.</p><p>\u201cAn actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019ve got the right James Wilkens? My son\u2019s the superior court judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. James and I are going to be married tomorrow evening at seven but we\u2019re planning a larger ceremony in April. We felt it was only right to tell you about our plans.\u201d Convinced she\u2019d done a miserable job, Summer handed the telephone back to James.</p><p>Father and son talked a few moments more, and the conversation ended with James abruptly replacing the receiver. He looked at Summer, but she had the strangest feeling he wasn\u2019t seeing her.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s decided to fly in for the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll look forward to meeting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s anxious to meet you, as well. He hasn\u2019t set eyes on you and already he thinks you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed and slipped her arms around James\u2019s neck. \u201cHe could be right.\u201d</p><p>James grinned up at her. \u201cI know he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you, too. Now it\u2019s time to make that call.\u201d</p><p>Summer had been delaying the inevitable and knew it. She stared at the phone, expelled a heavy sigh and said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll call my parents. Be prepared, James. They\u2019re going to have a lot of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t be any worse than my father,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Summer punched out the number to the family home a second time and waited. It was the decent thing to do, call her family with the news of her marriage, but if they just happened to be away, out of town themselves, no one would blame her and James for going ahead with the ceremony.</p><p>Four rings. Summer was about to hang up.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d her mother answered cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Summer said. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in Vegas this week with Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie couldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went alone?\u201d Summer could hear the disapproval in her mother\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI met a friend here. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend is the reason? What\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t sound right. You\u2019re gambling and you\u2019ve lost everything? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did understand why you\u2019d go back to Vegas after what happened there last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, can I explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat around the bush. Just say it.\u201d</p><p>Summer rolled her eyes. She knew where her flair for drama had come from. \u201cI\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>Her mother screamed, and the next thing Summer heard was the phone hitting the floor. Her father\u2019s voice could be heard in the background, followed by moaning and crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d It was her father on the line.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Summer said casually, as if nothing was out of the ordinary. \u201cI called to tell you and Mom that I\u2019m getting married tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s father said nothing for several seconds. \u201cDo we know this young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he\u2019s wonderful, Dad, really wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Brett was wonderful?\u201d her mother shouted into the extension.</p><p>\u201cHelen, get off the phone. You\u2019re too emotional to talk any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, Hank Lawton. This is our little girl who\u2019s marrying some stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s James Wilkens. He\u2019s from Seattle and, Daddy, I\u2019m crazy about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an actor, isn\u2019t he?\u201d her mother demanded. \u201cWhat did I tell you over and over again? Stay away from actors. But do you listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, James is a judge.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of judge? Beauty pageants?\u201d This came from her mother.</p><p>Summer almost groaned out loud. \u201cNo. Superior court. He was recently appointed to the bench and he\u2019ll run for election to his first full term this November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA judge, Hank,\u201d Helen said softly. \u201cAbby\u2019s daughter married that attorney, and we never heard the end of it. Summer\u2019s got herself a judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to talk to James?\u201d Summer offered. It only seemed fair that he talk to her family, since he\u2019d put her on the phone with his father.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her father surprised her by saying. \u201cWhen I talk to him, it\u2019ll be face-to-face. Pack our bags, Helen. We\u2019re headed for Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d James said patiently when he saw her distress, \u201cwhat did you expect your family to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d insist on coming here,\u201d Summer answered. \u201cI wanted it to be just you and me. We can involve our families later, in April. I felt obliged to let my parents know what we were doing\u2014but I didn\u2019t expect anything like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want them to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>In some ways James could understand her regret. If truth be known, he would\u2019ve preferred his father to stay in Seattle. As it was, James\u2019s time with Summer was already limited, and he didn\u2019t want to share with family the precious few days they had left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid once you meet my mother, you\u2019ll change your mind about marrying me,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2014she sometimes doesn\u2019t think before she speaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d James felt he was being diplomatic by not mentioning that Summer possessed the same trait.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s really great...You\u2019ll like him, but probably not at first.\u201d She gazed at James with large, imploring eyes. \u201cOh, James, he\u2019s going to give you the third degree. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s having a background check done on you this very minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, Dad\u2019s been working with the seamy side of life for so many years, he suspects everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a policeman?\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think he trusts anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, if twenty-odd years down the road our daughter phones to tell us she\u2019s marrying a man neither of us has ever met before, you can bet I\u2019ll have a background check done, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to have much of a honeymoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James chuckled. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Summer grinned.</p><p>If this woman\u2019s smile could be bottled, James thought, it would be the most potent aphrodisiac ever made. He couldn\u2019t look at Summer and not want to make love to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Julie?\u201d James said in an effort to get Summer\u2019s mind off her parents\u2019 imminent arrival.</p> <p>\u201cOh\u2014I nearly forgot my best friend.\u201d She reached for the phone and called Julie\u2019s cell.</p><p>Since there were a number of things to do before the actual ceremony, James walked over to the desk and sat down to write out a list, not wanting to forget anything.</p><p>He was only half listening to the conversation between Summer and her roommate when he heard Summer\u2019s soft gasp and the mention of Brett, the man she\u2019d once loved. James\u2019s ears perked up, and his fingers tightened around the pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Summer asked in low tones. This was followed by \u201cGood. Then you\u2019re coming? Great. You might want to talk to my parents and see if you can fly in with them. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be eager to pump you for whatever you can tell them about James.\u201d After a few words of farewell, Summer replaced the receiver.</p><p>James turned around in his chair, wondering if she\u2019d volunteer the information about Brett.</p> <p>\u201cJulie\u2019s flying in, too. I suggested she catch the same flight as my parents.\u201d She seemed self-conscious all at once.</p><p>Her eyes avoided his.</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d James waited, not wanting to approach the subject of her ex-fianc\u00e9, hoping she\u2019d save him the trouble.</p><p>After an awkward moment, she blurted out, \u201cJulie...Julie said Brett phoned.\u201d</p><p>James relaxed, grateful she chose not to hide it from him. \u201cDid she find out what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She hung up on him before he got a chance to say.\u201d</p> <p>James had the distinct feeling he was going to like Summer\u2019s roommate.</p><p>Summer\u2019s shoulders moved in an expressive sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us is going to be nearly as happy once our families arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad can it be?\u201d he asked. All he cared about, all that was important, was marrying the woman he loved.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s going to insist we follow tradition and not see each other all day.\u201d</p><p>James frowned. He wasn\u2019t keen on that idea.</p><p>\u201cMy dad will keep you occupied with a whole bunch of questions. If you\u2019ve got the slightest blemish on your record, he\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Trust me, sweetheart, my background\u2019s been scrutinized by the very best. Your father isn\u2019t going to find anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cIn which case, Dad will probably thank you repeatedly for taking me off his hands.\u201d</p> <p>James laughed, too. \u201cNever mind. By this time tomorrow, we\u2019ll be husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s parents arrived early the following morning with Julie in tow. By chance Summer met them in the lobby on her way down for breakfast. James had called her room an hour earlier, before she was dressed, to tell her he was headed for the coffee shop. Summer had been too nervous to eat then, but had developed a healthy appetite since. She\u2019d need fortification in order to deal with her parents.</p><p>\u201cMom! Dad! Julie!\u201d</p><p>They threw their arms around her as if the separation had been ten years instead of a few days.</p><p>\u201cI called Adam and told him his little sister\u2019s getting married,\u201d were the first words out of her mother\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s taking time off work and he and Denise are driving in for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Summer protested, \u201cJames and I are having another ceremony later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Helen Lawton said briskly, \u201cAdam will be there, too. Now stop fussing. It isn\u2019t like I held a gun to his head and told him he had to come. Your brother wants to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d Summer hugged her father. Stepping back, she placed her hands on her hips. \u201cJames is squeaky-clean, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I had him checked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my father, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She slipped her arm around his waist.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you ever meet a man like this?\u201d Hank Lawton wanted to know. \u201cHe\u2019s as good as gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. He\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>James appeared then, coming from the direction of the coffee shop, a newspaper under his arm.</p><p>Summer made the introductions, and while Julie and her family checked in to their rooms, Summer and James reserved a table at the coffee shop. They sat next to each other, holding hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for all this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy brother\u2019s taking the day off and driving in for the ceremony. I thought we\u2019d have a small, intimate wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is small and intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and his wife have three little kids, who\u2019ll probably cry through the entire ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t,\u201d James said and gently squeezed her hand. \u201cI suspect folks will talk about us the same way when we drag our children to family get-togethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur children,\u201d Summer repeated. She felt weak with pleasure at the thought of having a family with James. \u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019m looking forward to being a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as I am to making you one,\u201d he said in a low voice. The teasing light left his eyes. \u201cIf you have no objections, I\u2019d like a large family. Maybe four kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love to have four children. We\u2019re going to have a good life, James. I can feel it in my heart. We\u2019re going to be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that way, too. Being an only child, I was always drawn to large families. I suspect that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been such good friends with the Mannings over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s the youngest of five.\u201d</p><p>Her parents and Julie appeared just then, and ever the gentleman, James stood until the ladies were seated.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if we steal Summer away from you for the day,\u201d Helen said even before she looked at the menu. \u201cWe have a million and one things to do before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d Summer didn\u2019t know why she bothered to protest. She\u2019d realized this would happen the moment her parents announced they were coming.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we need to buy you a dress.\u201d</p><p>Silly as it seemed, Summer hadn\u2019t given much thought to her attire. A nice suit would do, she supposed, something flattering and stylish. The elaborate gown and veil could wait for the April ceremony.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the matter of finding a preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel provides a justice of the peace,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cDo you object to a man of the cloth?\u201d Hank asked sternly.</p><p>Summer wanted to leap to her feet and tell James this was a test, but she bit her tongue. Sooner or later her soon-to-be husband would have to sink or swim on his own with her family.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019d prefer one myself.\u201d</p><p>Summer had to restrain herself from cheering. James had passed with flying colors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the names of several ministers from our pastor in Anaheim.\u201d Her father patted his shirt pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the women to do their thing, and you and I can find us a proper preacher.\u201d His tone implied that his little girl wasn\u2019t being married by any justice of the peace.</p><p>\u201cWhat about rings?\u201d Helen asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d pick up a couple of plain gold bands for now,\u201d James explained. \u201cI\u2019d like Summer to wear my mother\u2019s diamond. She can choose the setting at a later date, and it\u2019ll be ready before the April ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Breakfast wasn\u2019t the ordeal Summer had expected. Julie sent her curious looks now and then, and Summer knew her friend was waiting for an opportune moment so they could talk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet again at what time?\u201d Helen asked, glancing at her watch.</p><p>Summer\u2019s father studied his, while Summer and James gazed longingly at each other.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d Helen suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat late?\u201d Summer protested. They were being cheated out of an entire day. No one seemed to appreciate that her time with James was already limited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to everything,\u201d her mother assured everyone. \u201cHank, all you need to do is get James to the chapel on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about my not showing up,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply in love with your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s elbow connected with Summer\u2019s ribs. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d she whispered out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Julie had more than gloating on her mind, and so did Summer\u2019s mother. When they\u2019d finished their coffee, Helen organized a shopping expedition. She made it clear that a suitable wedding dress wasn\u2019t the only thing on her list. If her daughter was about to marry a superior court judge, she\u2019d go to him with a complete trousseau.</p><p>The minute Summer and Julie were alone in the store, her roommate grabbed Summer\u2019s arm. \u201cI heard from Brett again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDid he phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This time he stopped by the apartment, right before I left for the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Summer closed her eyes, not because she had any regrets or because she harbored any doubts about James.</p><p>It was as if Brett possessed some kind of radar that told him when he could cause her the most trouble.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been asking about you. Apparently he talked with a couple of the cast members at Disneyland. Steve and Karen? Do those names sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Summer clenched her fists. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much this irritates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? The man\u2019s been making a pest of himself all week. According to Brett, you\u2019re pining away for him.\u201d Julie made a melodramatic gesture, bringing the back of one hand to her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ve been unhappy ever since the two of you split up\u2014he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, puhleese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was pining for anyone,\u201d Summer said, \u201cit was for James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I told Brett that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained, with a great deal of satisfaction, that you\u2019re involved with someone else now, and he should stay out of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, he\u2019s married and about to become a father. The man has no principles.\u201d The thought of Brett trying to reestablish their relationship while his wife was pregnant with their child made Summer sick to her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be rid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be getting married at a more opportune time. I\u2019m telling you, Summer, from the way Brett argued with me, your marriage is about the only thing that\u2019ll convince him it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did tell him I\u2019m getting married, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he wouldn\u2019t believe me. He accused me of fabricating the whole thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGirls, girls.\u201d Helen returned with a salesclerk.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how long it\u2019ll be before she considers us women?\u201d Summer asked her friend under her breath.</p><p>By evening Summer felt more like a French poodle than a bride. She\u2019d been shampooed, her nails polished, her hair curled, her body massaged and moisturized. She\u2019d been in and out of more clothes than a New York fashion model. And she was exhausted.</p><p>The idea of a white suit for the wedding was one of the first ideas to go. Before Summer could argue, she was draped in satin and silk from head to toe.</p> <p>\u201cYou look absolutely stunning,\u201d Helen said.</p><p>Summer wasn\u2019t sure she could trust her mother\u2019s assessment. Her eyes went to Julie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about April?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Helen\u2019s hands flew into the air. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear the dress twice. Big deal. No one needs to know.\u201d</p> <p>She tried another arguement. \u201cIt\u2019s so much money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy baby girl only gets married once.\u201d</p><p>Well, no. She\u2019d be getting married twice\u2014to the same man, but still, there were going to be two ceremonies.</p><p>Julie arranged the veil and the long train for the photographer who was on his way, then handed Summer the intricate gardenia bouquet. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to throw that, just be sure and aim it my way.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Julie reminded her.</p> <p>A knock sounded at the door, and Helen answered it. Summer didn\u2019t pay any attention, assuming it was the photographer her father had hired.</p><p>A few minutes later, Helen introduced the tall, balding man. \u201cSummer, this is James\u2019s father, Walter. You should\u2019ve told me he was a retired superior court judge himself.\u201d</p><p>Summer would have been happy to, had she known.</p><p>\u201cMy, oh, my,\u201d Walter said as he entered the room. He stood in front of Summer, hands on his hips, and he slowly shook his head. \u201cAnd where did my son meet such a beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in Vegas,\u201d Summer said. \u201cA year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to give up hope for that son of mine. It seemed to me he\u2019d settled a little too comfortably into bachelorhood. This comes as a very pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came to meet me and my family, especially on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>Walter withdrew a thick cigar from the inside of his suit pocket and examined the end of it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world.\u201d</p> <p>Walter sat down and made himself comfortable. After a moment he returned the cigar to his inside pocket. \u201cI quit smoking five years ago and I still miss it. Every now and then I take one out and look at it, just for the thrill.\u201d</p><p>Summer could see she was going to like James\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cTo be frank, I didn\u2019t think that boy of mine possessed this much common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a judge,\u201d Summer said, eager to defend her husband-to-be.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the law, James is one of the finest men on the bench. He seems to be worried about the November election, but as far as I can see, he won\u2019t have a problem. No, what I\u2019m talking about is something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>Summer felt like sitting down, too. Both her mother and Julie had mysteriously disappeared, and since the photographer had yet to show up, she decided to relax.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen James?\u201d she asked, missing him dreadfully.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d She folded her hands, wondering what James was thinking and if he was sorry he\u2019d gotten involved in all this. Everything had seemed so uncomplicated when they discussed it the night before.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pacing in his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacing,\u201d she repeated, certain this was a bad sign.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well this wedding\u2019s going to happen less than an hour from now. I don\u2019t think your father and brother could keep James away from you much longer than that.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled in relief.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day my boy would fall head over heels in love like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was engaged before. I know about Christy Manning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Christy. She\u2019s a dear girl, and James had strong feelings for her, but deep down I believe what he found so attractive about Christy was her family. There\u2019s quite a difference between the love James has for you and what he felt for Christy Manning. As you\u2019ll recall, he was content to stay engaged to Christy for a good long while. But you...He\u2019s marrying you so fast, my head\u2019s spinning. His, too, from the looks of him. You\u2019ve thrown him for quite a loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love James, too,\u201d Summer said with feeling, \u201cvery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hope the two of you will seriously consider making me a grandfather soon. I\u2019m hoping for a grandchild or two to spoil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to have four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d Walter nodded, looking pleased. \u201cBut you\u2019re worried about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly, wondering how he knew. \u201cMy biggest fear is that I\u2019m not the right kind of wife for James. I\u2019m afraid I might inadvertently harm his career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have this tendency to speak my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will until I put my foot in my mouth and embarrass James. To give you an example...\u201d She hesitated, not sure she should continue, then realized she couldn\u2019t very well stop now. \u201cI\u2019m the one who suggested we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just...came out. It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time...you know how good things can sound until you\u2019ve thought them through. Well, anyway, James stared at me like he\u2019d swallowed his tongue.\u201d</p><p>Walter burst out laughing. \u201cForgive me, my dear. Continue, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally I felt like a fool. Mainly because James didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t say anything, and I was convinced I\u2019d ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said nothing, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he did mumble something about preferring to do the asking himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you clammed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite the opposite. I started talking at hurricane speed until he told me it was fine and I needn\u2019t worry. And then, after I\u2019d fallen all over myself telling him how sorry I was, he said he thought it was a good idea. James came up with the idea of a ceremony now and then one in April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Clearly this was news to his father.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Summer grinned sheepishly. \u201cHe said something about impulsive thoughts being contagious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to the boy than I assumed.\u201d</p><p>There was another knock at the door, and the photographer let himself inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back to James,\u201d Walter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a delight meeting you, Summer. I don\u2019t have a shred of doubt that you\u2019re the best thing to come into my son\u2019s life for a very long time. Make him happy, Summer, make him very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while you\u2019re at it, teach him how to laugh.\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d She had a sneaking suspicion they had plenty to teach one another.</p><p>James looked at his watch for the third time that minute. No one seemed to understand that he needed to see Summer. Needed to talk to her, find out about her day, tell her about his.</p><p>If he\u2019d had even an inkling that their wedding was going to cause such a big commotion, he would never have agreed to contact their families.</p><p>James liked Summer\u2019s parents, but he\u2019d prefer to spend his time with her. Alone.</p><p>\u201cWe can go into the chapel now,\u201d Hank Lawton said.</p><p>James was so grateful he felt like cheering. According to his calculations, the ceremony would take approximately twenty minutes, thirty at most. They\u2019d sign the marriage certificate, and the rest of the night would be theirs. He couldn\u2019t tolerate any more of these separations, however brief. The next time Summer left his sight would be at the airport.</p><p>He saw her family in the small chapel, her brother\u2019s children wide-eyed and excited as the organ music rose triumphantly. He noticed that the wedding chapel was almost full and wondered for just a moment who the other guests were.</p><p>James went to stand in front with the minister, Reverend Floyd Wilson. James had rented the tuxedo because it seemed odd for the father of the bride to be wearing one and not the groom. Now, however, the shirt seemed too tight around the collar. He resisted the urge to insert his finger and give himself a little extra breathing space.</p><p>It was then that Summer appeared.</p><p>James felt as if someone had smashed him in the knees with a bat. Never in all his life had he seen anyone more beautiful. His heart beat so hard he thought it might pound straight through his chest.</p><p>Her dress was silk and lace with pearls, as traditional a wedding gown as any he\u2019d seen. One would think Summer was a debutante and this a society wedding.</p><p>When she joined him at the altar and placed her arm in his, James felt this was the proudest moment of his life. He knew they\u2019d repeat the ceremony in a few months, but nothing would match the blend of humility and pride he experienced right then.</p><p>Her brother, Adam, was kind enough to serve as his best man, while Julie, of course, was the maid of honor.</p><p>The ceremony itself was a blur. James\u2019s full concentration was on the woman at his side. He knew she was feeling the same emotions he was when she began to repeat her vows.</p><p>Summer\u2019s voice shook slightly, and she sounded close to tears. His arm tightened around hers as the minister said, \u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride.\u201d</p><p>James didn\u2019t need to hear that twice. Carefully he gathered Summer close, sighing when their lips met in the tenderest, sweetest kiss of his life.</p><p>She clung to him. \u201cOh, James, how soon can we get rid of everyone?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d entertained that very question from the moment Summer\u2019s mother had taken her away that morning.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he promised. Heaven only knew how they were going to cope with being separated for the next four months. \u201cAfter dinner.\u201d</p><p>They were hit with a barrage of birdseed on their way out the door. They laughed and tried to catch it in their outstretched hands.</p><p>\u201cPictures,\u201d Helen insisted, and when Summer groaned, she added, \u201cJust a few more. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you\u2019ll get plenty of pictures later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want some now,\u201d her mother insisted. But \u201csome\u201d turned out to be at least a hundred by James\u2019s estimation.</p><p>They signed the marriage license, and James took the opportunity to kiss his bride. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to spend another day like this one,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d she said, then giggled. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to get something out of it. Mother bought me this cute little black nightie.\u201d</p><p>James could feel the hot blood circle his ears and...other places. \u201cYour mother bought you a nightie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe said it\u2019s her wedding gift to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank her later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you see what Julie got us,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling it isn\u2019t a toaster,\u201d he said wryly.</p> <p>Summer laughed. \u201cNo. She picked it out when Mom wasn\u2019t looking. You do like tassels, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTassels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Summer looked around to be sure no one was listening. \u201cI\u2019ll save them for after the honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, my darling husband, they cover\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cHusband,\u201d she said the word as if saying a prayer. \u201cJames, you\u2019re my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And you\u2019re my wife.\u201d It hit him then, too. The beauty of it, of belonging to each other, of the word itself.</p><p>Their families all seemed to return at once.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about anyone else,\u201d Helen Lawton was saying, \u201cbut I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of agreement. They trooped into the hotel\u2019s elegant restaurant and ordered dinner and champagne, although Summer could barely eat and had trouble following the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll say good-night, then,\u201d James announced the minute they could leave without being rude. \u201cThank you all for making this the most incredible day of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d Helen protested.</p><p>\u201cHelen,\u201d Hank snapped. \u201cThink about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, sorry.\u201d Helen\u2019s face brightened, and she smiled apologetically at James.</p><p>\u201cWill we see you in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen!\u201d her husband growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking, Hank. What harm is there in asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mom. What time is your flight?\u201d</p> <p>James didn\u2019t listen to the answer, although he supposed he should have. As it was, he had a hard time hiding his impatience. He and his wife\u2014his wife\u2014would only have two more days together. Luckily that was two days and three nights. Their flights were leaving within a half hour of each other, and then it would be a whole month before he saw her again.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, darling,\u201d Helen said, hugging Summer, \u201cwe\u2019ll see you both in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The entourage left, and James was alone with Summer at last.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to my room or yours?\u201d she asked, smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cNeither. I rented the honeymoon suite here for the rest of our stay. Your mother packed your suitcase and had it sent over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think of everything.\u201d She reached up and removed the wedding veil and shook her head, freeing her curls. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how anxious I am to get out of this dress.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled as he led the way to the elevator. \u201cNot nearly as anxious as I am to get you out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were all those guests?\u201d she asked him when they stepped inside the elevator car.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were friends of your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them before in my life.\u201d</p><p>James shrugged. \u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll bet my mother invited them. She couldn\u2019t bear to have us married in an empty chapel.\u201d</p><p>James fingered his room key. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go work up an appetite.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled and moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue. \u201cI have a feeling you aren\u2019t talking about racquetball.\u201d</p><p>James cleared his throat. He wanted her so much his body trembled with the strength of his need. \u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>James astonished Summer. She didn\u2019t know what to expect from him as a lover, but it wasn\u2019t this. They\u2019d made love no less than three times during their wedding night, and Summer woke the following morning to find him standing at the foot of their bed, fresh from the shower.</p><p>His nude body glistened in the early-morning light. Droplets of water dripped from his hair and onto the dark curls that covered his chest.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Wilkens.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled and stretched her arms high above her head, arching her back. The sheet slipped away, exposing her breasts.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, James.\u201d She saw that he was fully aroused and slowly lifted her gaze to his. Already her body was responding to him, throbbing with readiness and need. James\u2019s eyes narrowed as they focused on her.</p><p>Wordlessly she knelt on the bed and held out her arms to him. She smiled, thinking someone should\u2019ve warned her about this man before they were married. At this rate, they\u2019d both be dead within a week.</p><p>He walked over to the side of the bed, kissed her once, twice, and then knelt beside it.</p><p>All her life Summer had never experienced such power. Or such love. Her breathing grew slow and shallow. She half closed her eyes in pleasure at the simple touch of his hand.</p><p>James groaned, and Summer recognized his meaning. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Neither could she. She threw her arms around his neck and slowly lay back against the bed, bringing him with her.</p><p>She smiled contentedly as they began to make love. All of a sudden her eyes flew open. \u201cJames, you forgot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he assured her breathlessly. \u201cJust this one time.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to stop. Not now. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>James reached his climax soon after she experienced hers. A harsh groan tore from his throat, and his powerful body shuddered.</p><p>His shoulders still heaving, he gathered her in his arms and spread soft, delicate kisses over her face. He started to move away from her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI want to be a part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. You always will be. You could travel to Mars, and my heart would be with you.\u201d He brushed the damp hair from her forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, so much my heart feels like it\u2019s about to burst wide open. Will it always be like this?\u201d she asked. \u201cTwo weeks ago, you were someone whose letters I looked forward to. This week you\u2019re the most important person in my life.\u201d</p><p>James kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get better from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d She laughed delightedly. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d</p><p>In one uninterrupted movement James rolled onto his back, taking her with him so she was sprawled across his chest. Across his heart. \u201cI can\u2019t, either. Summer, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She pressed her head against his shoulder. \u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember next time,\u201d he promised. \u201cThe last thing we need now is an unplanned pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this is my safe time, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>James kissed her neck. \u201cI suppose we should get dressed and meet everyone for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she agreed, but neither of them showed any signs of moving.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d James whispered.</p><p>They\u2019d been married less than twenty-four hours and already Summer could read her husband\u2019s thoughts. \u201cBeing separated? It\u2019s going to be terrible. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll last four months without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months.\u201d He made it sound like an eternity.</p><p>\u201cJames, where do you live?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look. \u201cSeattle. You know my address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it an apartment? A condo? A town house or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house.\u201d</p><p>Summer liked the idea of that.</p><p>A slow grin spread across his face. \u201cI must\u2019ve known I was going to meet you. This is a big house on Queen Anne Hill with seven bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely older home. I\u2019m quite proud of the garden. I hope you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I saw the look on your face when you talked about it. The house is going to be perfect for us, just perfect.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew dark. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope we\u2019ll always love each other as much as we do at this moment.\u201d Summer laid her head on his chest and sighed.</p><p>Time had never passed more quickly for James. He\u2019d dreaded leaving Summer almost from the moment they\u2019d met again on New Year\u2019s Eve. It was as though Seattle was another world, one he wasn\u2019t that eager to return to. Not when it meant having to say goodbye to Summer.</p><p>His wife of two days was unusually quiet as they packed their suitcases on Saturday morning, the day of their departure. When she found him watching her, she offered him a reassuring smile.</p><p>The bellboy carried their luggage to the lobby. While James was checking out of the hotel, he noticed Summer twisting the plain gold band around her finger. His own felt awkward and heavy, and he wondered if she was experiencing any regrets. For his own part, he didn\u2019t have a single one.</p><p>Having returned the rental car earlier, James ordered a car. He and Summer held hands as they rode silently to the airport.</p><p>He wanted to assure her it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, but that would\u2019ve been a blatant lie. Every minute he was away from her was a minute too long. He wanted to be sure she understood how much he loved her, how crucial she was to him. But the backseat of a limo with a driver listening in didn\u2019t seem the most appropriate place to tell her those things.</p><p>Nothing would ever be the same for either of them, and they both knew it.</p><p>The car dropped them off, and since they were flying on different airlines, they separated to check in their luggage and receive their seat assignments.</p><p>James finished first and caught sight of Summer hurrying through the crowd toward him. Even from that distance he sensed her sadness. He met her halfway and they went through security together.</p><p>\u201cMy flight leaves from Concourse B,\u201d she said, looking down at her ticket. Her voice was small and tight.</p><p>\u201cMine\u2019s Concourse A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time\u2019s your flight?\u201d</p><p>She already knew, but apparently needed to hear it again. \u201cTen-thirty,\u201d James told her.</p><p>\u201cMy departure\u2019s at ten.\u201d</p><p>He was perfectly aware of what time her plane left. \u201cI\u2019ll walk down to Concourse B with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, James, you might miss your own flight.\u201d</p><p>Frankly he didn\u2019t give a damn. \u201cThen I\u2019ll catch the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll worry. James, really, I\u2019m a big girl. I can find my way around the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t,\u201d he snapped, surprising himself.</p><p>Summer looked up at him, her eyes brimming with tears. She turned and walked away from him and headed for Concourse B.</p><p>James followed and wanted to kick himself. He wouldn\u2019t see his wife for weeks and here he was, apparently doing his utmost to start an argument. No doubt there was some psychological reason for his attitude. He\u2019d examine what was happening later, but at the moment he was more concerned about saying goodbye to her properly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Summer arrived at her gate and walked over to the window. James could see her plane and knew it wouldn\u2019t be more than a few moments before the boarding call was announced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d He rested his hands on her shoulders and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. She\u2019d done nothing wrong. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, James,\u201d she whispered brokenly, slipping her arms around his waist. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so lost without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d He wasn\u2019t willing to pretend otherwise. \u201cI\u2019ll phone as often as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have my work schedule?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you have everything you need?\u201d They\u2019d gone over the details a dozen times.</p><p>\u201cNo. I need you, James.\u201d</p> <p>His hold on her tightened. He wondered if they were afraid they\u2019d lose the magic. Afraid that once they returned to their respective lives, everything would change.</p><p>Her flight number was announced, and James tensed. It wouldn\u2019t be long before he saw her, he promised himself. He\u2019d try for a week, two at the most. A few minutes later her row was called.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>But neither of them made a move to break apart.</p><p>Summer was the last one to board the plane, and James had to tear through the airport in order to catch his own flight. If anyone had suggested even ten days ago that the dignified James Wilkens would race through an airport so he could spend a few extra minutes with a woman, he would have scoffed. He wasn\u2019t scoffing now.</p> <p>He arrived in the nick of time and collapsed into his seat, his heart racing.</p><p>Between dashing through airports and hours spent making love, Summer would be the death of him yet. He smiled as he snapped his seat belt into place. If he was to die that very moment, he\u2019d leave this earth a happy man.</p><p>James\u2019s house had never seemed so empty. By the time he got home, it was dark and shadowy. His first mistake had been stopping at the office on his way back from the airport. After he arrived in Seattle, he\u2019d spent what remained of the day working through the memos, briefs and case histories. No one else was in, so he was able to accomplish quite a bit, catching up on some of his backlog. He\u2019d do anything he had to so he could arrange time away as soon as possible.</p><p>Summer was never far from his thoughts.</p><p>Once he reached his house, suitcase in hand, he was exhausted. He switched on the light in the kitchen, put down his bags and set his briefcase on the walnut table in the breakfast nook.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t eaten since that morning, and a look inside the refrigerator reminded him he\u2019d been away all week. He\u2019d need to order out or microwave something from the freezer.</p><p>Deciding against both, he heated a can of soup, ate, then showered. He\u2019d showered that morning, but Summer had been in the stall with him and neither one had seemed particularly concerned about washing.</p><p>James stood in front of the mirror in the steamy bathroom and wiped off some of the condensation, then stared at his reflection. He didn\u2019t look all that different from the man he\u2019d been a week ago. But he was different.</p> <p>Unable to delay talking to Summer, he dressed quickly and headed for his book-lined den.</p><p>Having memorized her apartment and cell phone numbers, James called her at home.</p><p>Summer answered on the first ring. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve called sooner, but I went to the office. I needed to clear off my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check your calendar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing. I can fly down on a Saturday morning in two weeks, but I\u2019ll need to be back Sunday afternoon. That doesn\u2019t give us much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut we\u2019ll make the most of it.\u201d Her relief was evident. \u201cI was afraid once you looked at your schedule you\u2019d find it impossible to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it takes, I\u2019ll be in California in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. I traded weekends with a friend so I can come to you in February. My mother\u2019s already started to plan the wedding. She\u2019s left a message with the secretary at the Moose Hall. It\u2019s a very nice building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s enjoying every minute of this, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed. \u201cYes. But the one who surprises me most is my dad. I don\u2019t know what you said or did, but my dad thinks you walk on water.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to laugh.</p><p>Then they were both silent. They\u2019d spent nearly every minute of the previous week together. They\u2019d discussed everything there was to discuss. Yet neither was willing to break the connection.</p><p>An hour later they were still on the phone. They hadn\u2019t spoken more than a few words between whispered promises and deep sighs. They\u2019d shared a few secrets and memories, some of them very private. Very intimate...</p><p>In their next conversation, he\u2019d let Summer know he couldn\u2019t handle much more of that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten together with a group of businessmen and spread the word,\u201d Ralph Southworth was saying.</p><p>James sat in his office, gazing into the distance. As always, his thoughts were fifteen hundred miles to the south with Summer. He barely heard his campaign manager. In eight days he\u2019d be with his wife. The last six had been the purest form of torture.</p><p>He lived for the times he could phone her. Because she performed in the last show of the night, he couldn\u2019t reach her until after ten, and more often than not they spoke until past midnight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dinner party this Friday night at the Morrisons\u2019,\u201d Ralph announced.</p><p>James didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to the Morrisons\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Ralph Southworth looked at him oddly. \u201cWho else do you think I mean?\u201d</p><p>James shrugged. Ralph was a good man, a bit abrasive at times, but sincere and hardworking. According to people James trusted, Ralph Southworth was the best man for the job of getting James elected to the superior court.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you lately, James?\u201d Ralph asked abruptly. He pulled out a chair and sat down across from James\u2019s desk.</p><p>Ralph was nothing if not direct. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. Ever since you got back from vacation, you haven\u2019t been the same.\u201d</p><p>James considered telling Ralph the truth. Part of him was eager to share the news of his marriage. Marrying Summer was nothing to be ashamed of\u2014the opposite, in fact\u2014but arrangements for the second ceremony were already being made. If he was willing to face the truth, James would have to admit he wasn\u2019t keen on explaining his sudden marriage, especially to the man who\u2019d frowned on his vacation in Vegas. He preferred to leave things as they were and invite Ralph to the wedding in April. So far, he\u2019d told no one about Summer and for the time being even left his wedding band at home.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d he asked, unable to resist.</p><p>Ralph shook his head adamantly. \u201cNever, and proud of it.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s eyebrows shot to his hairline. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen have ruined more than one good man. Don\u2019t be a fool, James. Don\u2019t do anything stupid at this point. Unless it\u2019s with someone who can help you politically, of course. Now, if you told me you were seeing Mary Horton...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Horton\u2014never mind, she\u2019s not your type. All I can say is that if you\u2019re going to fall for someone now, just make sure it\u2019s a woman who can help you politically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ralph tossed his hands in the air. \u201cSomehow, I knew you were going to say that. Listen. Keep your head screwed on tight and your pants zipped up. The last thing we need now is a scandal, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Summer\u2019s not like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Summer?\u201d Ralph rolled his eyes expressively. \u201cJames, listen to me. You\u2019ve asked me to run your campaign, and I\u2019m glad to do it, but I\u2019m telling you right now, getting involved with a woman named Summer is asking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being unfair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Where\u2019d you meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas.\u201d</p><p>Ralph\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me she\u2019s a show girl,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014but she\u2019s an actress.\u201d</p><p>A muscle leapt in his friend\u2019s jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything more. Not a single word. I\u2019ve got high blood pressure and don\u2019t want to know any more than you\u2019ve already told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer has nothing to do with you,\u201d James said, finding it difficult to quell his irritation. Ralph made Summer sound like...like a mistake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember a certain congressman who got involved with a stripper a few years back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer isn\u2019t a stripper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ruined him, James. Ruined him. I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t. Furthermore, I won\u2019t have you speaking about her in those terms.\u201d In light of Ralph\u2019s reaction, James didn\u2019t think now was the time to announce they were already married. \u201cIf you must know, I intend to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Do it after the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve decided on April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril!\u201d Ralph barked. \u201cThat\u2019s much too soon. Listen, you\u2019re paying me big money to run this campaign. You want my advice, you\u2019ve got it. What difference would a few months make?\u201d He paused, waiting for James\u2019s response. \u201cWill you do that one thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid you\u2019ll lose her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put off the wedding until after the election. Is that so much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure which is worse,\u201d Julie said, applying bright red polish to her toenails, \u201cthis year or last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Summer asked.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She swirled the brush in the red paint and started with the little toe on her left foot. \u201cLast year, after you broke up with Brett, you moped around the apartment for months.\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed. \u201cThis year isn\u2019t much better, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can see. Listen, I understand how much you miss James. The guy\u2019s hot. No wonder you fell for him. If the situation was reversed, you can bet I\u2019d be just as miserable. The thing is, you won\u2019t be apart for long. April\u2019s right around the corner.\u201d</p><p>Summer folded her arms and leaned against the back of the sofa. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was possible to love someone as much as I love James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the number of times he calls you is any indication, I\u2019d say he feels the same about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works so hard.\u201d Summer knew that many of James\u2019s late-night calls came from his office. She also knew he was putting in extra-long hours in order to free up time he could spend with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSummer, he\u2019ll be here in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him about Brett?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>Summer\u2019s nails bit into her palms. \u201cWhat good would it do? James is fifteen hundred miles away. Brett hasn\u2019t got a chance with me. Unfortunately he doesn\u2019t seem ready to accept that. But he\u2019s going to get the same message whenever he calls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, when James visits, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie, you don\u2019t need to leave. We can get a hotel room\u2014really, we don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. This is your home. You\u2019d be more relaxed, and both of you have been through enough stress lately.\u201d</p><p>Summer was so grateful it was all she could do not to weep. It was the stress, she decided, this tendency to be over emotional. \u201cHave I told you how glad I am that you\u2019re my friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d Julie said airily.</p> <p>\u201cI mean it, Julie. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without you these last weeks. I feel like my whole world\u2019s been turned upside down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been. Who else goes away for a week and comes home married? Did you think James had lost his mind when he suggested it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted, remembering the most fabulous dinner of her life. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything that impulsive his whole life.\u201d</p><p>Julie grinned. \u201cUntil he met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, James made the same comment.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang just then, and Summer leapt up to answer it on the off chance it was James.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cSummer, don\u2019t hang up, please, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett.\u201d Her heart sank. \u201cPlease,\u201d she told him, \u201cjust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? We have absolutely nothing to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Summer closed her eyes, fighting the frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. What do I have to say to convince you of that? You\u2019re married, I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d His voice grew hoarse. \u201cIf you\u2019re married, then where\u2019s your husband?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you any explanations. Don\u2019t phone me again. It\u2019s over and has been for more than a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, please...please.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to hear any more. His persistence astonished her. When she\u2019d found him with another woman, he\u2019d seemed almost glad, as though he was relieved to be free of the relationship. In retrospect, Summer realized that Brett had fallen out of love with her long before, but had lacked the courage to say anything. Later, when he\u2019d married, and she learned it wasn\u2019t the same woman he\u2019d been with in Vegas, she wondered about this man she thought she knew so well, and discovered she didn\u2019t know him at all.</p><p>His behavior mystified her. After loving Brett for six years, she expected to feel something for him, but all the feeling she could muster was pity. She wanted nothing to do with him. He\u2019d made his choice and she\u2019d made hers.</p><p>\u201cBrett? Again?\u201d Julie asked when Summer joined her in the living room.</p><p>Summer nodded. \u201cI hope this is the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about having the phone number changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. And I\u2019m going to get call display, too.\u201d</p><p>Julie studied her for a moment. \u201cAre you going to tell James why we\u2019ve got a new phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It would only worry him, and there\u2019s nothing he can do so far away. Brett doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should.\u201d</p><p>Summer arrived at the Orange County airport forty minutes before James\u2019s flight was due, in case it came in early. Every minute of their day and a half together was carefully planned.</p><p>The only negative for Summer was the brunch with her parents Sunday morning. Her mother had several questions about the wedding that she needed to discuss with James. Summer begrudged every minute she had to share James; she knew she was being selfish, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Julie, true to her word, had made a weekend trip to visit a family member, an elderly aunt in Claremont.</p><p>By the time James\u2019s plane touched down, she was nearly sick to her stomach with anticipation. As soon as he stepped out of the secure area, he paused, searching for her.</p><p>Their eyes connected and in the second before he started toward her, her heart seemed to stop. Then it began to race.</p><p>When they\u2019d parted in Las Vegas, it felt as if everything had come to an abrupt standstill. Now she could see him, could feel him, for the first time since they\u2019d parted two weeks ago.</p><p>Dashing between the other passengers, she ran toward him. James caught her in his arms and crushed her against him. His hands were in her hair, and his mouth hungrily sought hers.</p><p>His embrace half lifted her from the ground. She clung to him, fighting back a flood of emotion. Unexpectedly tears filled her eyes, but she was too happy to care.</p><p>James broke off the kiss, and Summer stared up at him, smiling. It was so good to see him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, brushing his thumb across the moisture on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI guess I missed you more than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI bet you tell all the women that,\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cNope, only the ones I marry.\u201d</p><p>Summer slipped her arm around his waist, and together they headed toward the luggage carousel. \u201cI packed light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Because it felt so good to be close to him, she stood on the tips of her toes and kissed his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to hear Julie\u2019s gone for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to thank her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more crank calls?\u201d</p><p>Summer had almost forgotten that was the excuse she\u2019d given him when she\u2019d had her phone numbers changed. \u201cNone.\u201d And then, because she was eager to change the subject, she told him, \u201cI\u2019ve got every minute planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, almost. Mom and Dad invited us over for brunch in the morning. I couldn\u2019t think of any way to get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good idea to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>James frowned, and she noticed the dark circles under his eyes. He was working too hard, not sleeping enough, not eating properly. That would all change when she got to Seattle. The first thing she\u2019d do was make sure he had three decent meals a day. As for time in bed, well, she didn\u2019t think that would be a problem.</p><p>\u201cThere might be a problem with the wedding date,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>Summer halted midstep. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril might not work, after all.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, does it? We\u2019re already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it later, with your family. All right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unwilling to waste even one precious minute arguing over a fancy wedding when she already wore his ring.</p><p>Seven</p><p>For years James had lived an impassive and sober life. He\u2019d never considered himself a physical man. But three weeks after marrying Summer, making love occupied far more of his thoughts than it had in the previous thirty-odd years combined.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it to your apartment?\u201d he asked, as they walked to her car.</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t immediately respond.</p><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me we have a few things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, forcing himself to stop staring at her. She had him at a distinct disadvantage. At the moment he would have agreed to just about anything, no matter where the discussion led\u2014as long as they got to her place soon. As long as they could be alone...</p><p>\u201cI want to know why there\u2019s a problem with the wedding date.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve realized. \u201cSweetheart, it has more to do with your parents than you and me. Let\u2019s not worry about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to delay the wedding, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded vehemently. \u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m enjoying this separation? I couldn\u2019t be more miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to believe I wouldn\u2019t do anything that would keep us apart any longer than necessary.\u201d James glanced at her as she drove. He was telling the truth, although not, perhaps, the whole truth. Time enough for that later, he thought. He was worried about Summer. She seemed pale and drawn, as if she weren\u2019t sleeping well or eating right. This situation wasn\u2019t good for either of them.</p><p>After fifteen minutes they arrived at her apartment building. He carried in his suitcase and set it down in her small living room, gazing around.</p><p>Summer\u2019s personality seemed to mark each area. The apartment was bright and cheerful. The kitchen especially appealed to him; the cabinets had been painted a bold yellow with red knobs. Without asking, he knew this was her special touch.</p><p>She led him into her bedroom, and he stopped when he noticed the five-foot wall poster of her as Beauty posing with the Beast. She looked so beautiful he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it. He felt a hint of jealousy of the man who was able to spend time with her every night, even if it was in costume.</p><p>His gaze moved from the picture to the bed. A single. He supposed it wouldn\u2019t matter. The way he felt just then, they\u2019d spend the whole night making love anyway.</p><p>He turned toward his wife. She smiled softly, and in that instant James knew he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. His need was so great that his entire body seemed to throb with a need of its own.</p><p>He held out his hand, and she walked toward him.</p><p>If he had any regrets about their time in Vegas, it was that he\u2019d been so eager for her, so awkward and clumsy. Tonight would be slow and easy, he\u2019d promised himself. When they made love, it would be leisurely so she\u2019d know how much he appreciated her. They\u2019d savor each other without interruption.</p><p>\u201cSummer, I love you.\u201d He lifted the shirt over her head and tossed it carelessly aside. His hands were at the snap of her jeans, trembling as he struggled to hold back the urgency of his need.</p><p>He kissed her with two weeks\u2019 worth of pent-up hunger, and all his accumulated frustration broke free.</p><p>He eased the jeans over her slender hips and let them fall to her feet, then released her long enough to remove his own clothes. As he was unbuttoning his shirt, he watched her slip out of her silky underwear. His breath caught in his throat.</p><p>When James finished undressing, they collapsed on the narrow bed together. And then he lost all sense of time....</p><p>Summer woke to the sound of James humming off-key in the kitchen. The man couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket, as her dad liked to say. Smiling, she glanced at her clock radio\u2014almost 6:00 p.m. She reached for her housecoat and entered the kitchen to find him examining the contents of her refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of those,\u201d she teased, tying the sash of her robe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne of what?\u201d He reappeared brandishing a chicken leg.</p><p>\u201cYou get hungry after sex,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t eat on the plane, and yes,\u201d he said, grinning shyly at her, \u201cI suspect you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She yawned and sat on the bar stool. \u201cAnything interesting in there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeftover chicken, cottage cheese three weeks past its expiration date, Swiss cheese and an orange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the orange.\u201d She yawned again.</p><p>\u201cHave you been getting enough sleep?\u201d He peeled the orange and handed it to her, frowning. It wasn\u2019t his imagination; she was pale.</p><p>\u201cMore than ever. I seem to be exhausted lately. All I do is work and sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. She didn\u2019t want to waste their precious time together discussing her sleeping patterns. She ate a section of the rather dry orange. \u201cI better shower and get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the show?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sad that part of her weekend with James would be spent on the job, but there was no help for it. It was difficult enough to trade schedules in order to fly up to Seattle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing what a talented woman I married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible.\u201d He shook his head solemnly.</p> <p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said, staring down at the orange. \u201cDo you ever wonder what\u2019s really there between us?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the chicken bone into the garbage. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019m afraid all we share is a strong physical attraction. Is there more?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed; the question seemed to make him uncomfortable. \u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, we can\u2019t keep our hands off each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about us making love\u2014a lot. Probably more than I should. You\u2019re a brilliant man. I\u2019m fairly sure you didn\u2019t marry me because I challenge you intellectually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married you because I fell in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>He made it sound so uncomplicated.</p><p>\u201cI love the way a room lights up when you walk into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you laugh, I want to laugh, too. I\u2019ve never heard you sing or seen you perform on stage, but there\u2019s music in you, Summer. I sensed it the first night we met.</p><p>\u201cJust being with you makes me want to smile. Not that you\u2019re telling jokes or doing pratfalls or anything\u2014it\u2019s your attitude. When I\u2019m with you, the world\u2019s a better place.\u201d</p><p>Summer felt her throat tighten.</p><p>\u201cLike your father, an attorney or a judge can develop a jaded perspective in life. It\u2019s difficult to trust when the world\u2019s filled with suspicion. It\u2019s difficult to love when you deal with the consequences of hate every day. Perhaps that\u2019s been my problem all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot trusting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You came to me without defenses, devastated, vulnerable, broken. I\u2019d been hurt, too, so I knew how you felt because I\u2019d experienced those same emotions. I\u2019d walk through the fires of hell before I\u2019d allow anyone to do that to you again.\u201d He walked over and held out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just words when I say I love you, Summer. It\u2019s my heart, my whole heart.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his hand with both of hers.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid our relationship is too much about sexual attraction, then maybe we should put a hold on anything physical for the rest of the weekend. Instead, we\u2019ll concentrate on getting to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d She gave him a knowing look, then leaned forward. The front of her robe gaped open, and Summer watched as he stared at her breasts, then carefully averted his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cNot easy, but possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to take a shower before I leave for work.\u201d She slipped off the stool and started to walk away. Then she turned, looked over her shoulder and smiled seductively. \u201cRemember what fun we had in the shower, James?\u201d</p><p>James paled. \u201cSummer,\u201d he warned through clenched teeth. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay out of the bedroom, I\u2019ll need your help.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him full on. \u201cThe shower isn\u2019t in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo have your shower,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d She released the sash and let the silk robe fall open.</p><p>He made a sound that could mean various things\u2014but he didn\u2019t make a move. Feeling slightly disappointed, Summer walked slowly into the bathroom and turned on the shower.</p><p>She\u2019d just stepped inside and adjusted the water when the shower door was pulled open.</p><p>Naked, James joined her there. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t resist you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI can\u2019t resist you, either.\u201d</p><p>Summer and her mother were busy in the kitchen at the Lawton family home. James sat in the living room with his father-in-law, watching a Sunday-morning sports show.</p><p>James didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Hank that he didn\u2019t follow sports all that much. And he sure wasn\u2019t going to admit he found them boring.</p><p>\u201cHelen\u2019s going to be talking to you later,\u201d Hank said, relaxing during a spell of uninterrupted beer commercials. \u201cShe\u2019s having trouble getting a decent hall for the wedding reception in April. The church is no problem, mind you, but finding a hall\u2019s become pretty complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer said something about the Moose Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fell through. I\u2019ll let Helen do the explaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Summer know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Couldn\u2019t see upsetting her. The girl\u2019s been miserable ever since she got back from Vegas. You want my opinion?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cYou should take her to Seattle with you now and be done with it. It\u2019s clear to me the two of you belong together.\u201d</p><p>James wished it was that easy.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Hank said, scooting forward to the edge of his chair as some football players ran back onto a muddy field. \u201cShe has to fulfill her contract. Never understood where the girl got her singing talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fabulous.\u201d Summer\u2019s performance had shocked James. Her singing had moved him deeply and her acting impressed him.</p><p>Hank beamed proudly. \u201cShe\u2019s good, isn\u2019t she? I\u2019ll never forget the night I first went to see her perform at Disneyland. It was all I could do not to stand up and yell out, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s my little girl up there.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such power in her voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to crack crystal, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019d never suspect it hearing her speak, but the minute she opens her mouth to sing, watch out. I\u2019ve never heard anything like it.\u201d</p><p>James had come away awed by her talent. That she\u2019d willingly walk away from her career to be his wife, willingly take her chances in a new city, humbled him.</p><p>\u201cShe could go all the way to the top.\u201d</p><p>Hank nodded. \u201cI think so, too, if she wanted, but that\u2019s the thing. She loves singing, don\u2019t get me wrong, but Summer will be just as happy humming lullabies to her babies as she would be performing in some hit Broadway show.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s heart clutched at the thought of Summer singing to their children.</p><p>\u201cHelen\u2019s mother used to sing,\u201d Hank said, but his eyes didn\u2019t leave the television screen. He frowned when the sports highlights moved on to tennis. \u201cRuth didn\u2019t sing professionally, but she was a member of the church choir for years. Talent\u2019s a funny business. Summer was singing from the time she was two. Now, Adam, he sounds like a squeaky door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d All James could hope was that their children inherited their mother\u2019s singing ability.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. She loves you anyway.\u201d</p><p>James wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond, but fortunately he didn\u2019t have to, because Helen poked her head in at that moment.</p><p>\u201cBrunch is ready,\u201d she said. \u201cHank, turn off that blasted TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Helen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Reluctantly Hank reached for the TV controller and muted the television. His wife didn\u2019t seem to notice, and Hank sent James a conspiratorial wink. \u201cCompromise,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe won\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>James sat next to Summer at the table. \u201cThis looks delicious,\u201d he said to Helen. His mother-in-law had obviously gone to a lot of trouble with this brunch. She\u2019d prepared sausages and ham slices and bacon, along with some kind of egg casserole, fresh-baked sweet rolls, coffee and juice.</p><p>Helen waited until they\u2019d all filled their plates before she mentioned the April wedding date. \u201cThe reason I wanted to talk to the two of you has to do with the wedding date.\u201d She paused, apparently unsure how to proceed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too involved with Adam\u2019s wedding when he married Denise. I had no idea we\u2019d need to book the reception hall so far in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you already had the place,\u201d Summer wailed.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t happen, sweetheart,\u201d Hank said. \u201cTrust me, your mother\u2019s done her best. I can\u2019t tell you how many phone calls she\u2019s made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have the wedding you deserve,\u201d her mother said pointedly, \u201cit\u2019ll need to be later than April. My goodness, it takes time just to get the invitations printed, and we can\u2019t order them until we have someplace nice for the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much later?\u201d was James\u2019s question.</p><p>Helen and Hank exchanged looks. \u201cJune might work, but September would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeptember,\u201d Summer cried.</p><p>\u201cSeptember\u2019s out of the question.\u201d With the primary in September, James couldn\u2019t manage time away for a wedding. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to wait that long, anyway, then let\u2019s do it after the election in November.\u201d The minute he made the suggestion, James realized he\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cNovember.\u201d Summer\u2019s voice sagged with defeat. \u201cSo what am I supposed to do between April and November?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove up to Seattle with James, of course,\u201d Hank said without a qualm.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Helen protested. \u201cWe can\u2019t have our daughter living with James before they\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen, for the love of heaven, they\u2019re already married. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but no one knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to him. \u201cOther than my dad, no one knows I\u2019m married, either.\u201d</p><p>Summer seemed to wilt. \u201cIt sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that you don\u2019t want me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d James could hear the hurt and disappointment in her voice and wished he knew some way to solve the problem, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy is everything suddenly so complicated?\u201d Summer asked despondently. \u201cIt seemed so simple when James and I first decided to do things this way. Now I feel as if we\u2019re trapped.\u201d</p><p>James had the same reaction. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it and get back to you,\u201d he told his in-laws. Both were content to leave it at that.</p><p>After brunch he and Summer took a walk around her old neighborhood. Their pace was leisurely, and she didn\u2019t say anything for a couple of blocks. She clasped her hands behind her back as if she didn\u2019t want to be close to him just then. He gave her the space she needed, but longed to put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re disappointed, sweetheart. So am I,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is what you meant about problems with the April date, isn\u2019t it? The election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like excess baggage in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, you are my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James, how did everything get so messed up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he muttered, ramming his fingers through his hair. \u201cI was the one who suggested we go ahead with the wedding right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heaven. I\u2019d hate to think how long we\u2019d have to wait if you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being purely selfish and only a little practical. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep from making love to you much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re traditional enough\u2014gentleman enough\u2014to prefer to marry me first,\u201d she suggested softly.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d She made him sound nobler than he was. He\u2019d married her because he wanted to. Because he couldn\u2019t imagine not marrying her.</p><p>\u201cAs you said, the problem is the election. I had no business marrying you when I did. Not when I knew very well what this year would be like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe campaign?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a political person, but it\u2019s a real factor in this kind of situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought judges were nonpartisan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, but trust me, sweetheart, there\u2019s plenty of politics involved. I want to be elected, Summer, but not enough to put you through this.\u201d</p><p>She was silent again for a long moment. \u201cOne question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and increased her pace. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told my campaign manager you and I were engaged.\u201d James hesitated, selecting his words carefully.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he asked me to wait until after the election to go through with the wedding. He had a number of reasons, some valid, others not, but he did say one thing that made sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminded me that I\u2019m paying him good money for his advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She gave a short laugh that revealed little amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t even know your campaign manager and already I dislike him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph. Ralph Southworth. He isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to wait until after the election to move to Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said vehemently.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to consider Ralph\u2019s advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d They walked past a school yard with a battered chain-link fence. It looked as if every third-grade class for the past twenty years had made it his or her personal goal to climb that fence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this constantly,\u201d James told her. It had weighed down his heart for nearly two weeks, ever since his talk with Ralph. \u201cThere are no easy solutions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to decide right now, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Actually James was relieved. At the moment he was more than willing to say the heck with it and move Summer to Seattle in April.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s both give it some thought in the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d He placed one arm around her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard for this opportunity to sit on the bench, Summer, but it\u2019s not worth losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing me?\u201d She smiled up at him. \u201cYou\u2019d have a very hard time getting rid of me, James Wilkens, and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled and kissed her lightly. It was a bittersweet kiss, reminding him that in a matter of hours he\u2019d be leaving her again. Only this time he didn\u2019t know exactly when he could be with her again.</p><p>Summer rubbed her face against the side of his. \u201cNot so long ago, I had to practically beg you to kiss me in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before you had me completely twisted around your little finger.\u201d The changes she\u2019d already wrought in his life astonished him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you, but whatever it was I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour flight leaves in less than five hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should go back to the apartment.\u201d She looked up at him and raised her delicate eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty of time for what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, James?\u201d She batted her eyelashes at him. He grinned. She managed to be sexy and funny simultaneously, and he found that completely endearing.</p><p>They made their farewells to her family and were soon on their way back to the apartment. There was time to make love, he decided, shower and pack. Then he\u2019d be gone again.</p><p>Summer must have been thinking the same thing because she said, \u201cWe always seem to be leaving each other.\u201d</p><p>James couldn\u2019t even tell her it wouldn\u2019t be for long. They parked in the lot outside her apartment, but as soon as they were out of the car James knew something wasn\u2019t right. Summer tensed, her gaze on the man climbing out of the car next to theirs.</p><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brett,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cBrett?\u201d It took James a moment to make the connection. \u201cThe Brett?\u201d</p><p>Her nod was almost imperceptible.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Apparently they were about to find out. He was big\u2014football-player size\u2014and tanned. He wore faded cutoff jeans, a tank top and several gold chains around his neck.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brett,\u201d Summer said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d He turned to James. \u201cWho\u2019s this? A friend of your father\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my husband. Kindly leave. We don\u2019t have anything to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband?\u201d Brett laughed mockingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to believe that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d James answered. \u201cNow I suggest you make yourself scarce like the lady asked.\u201d</p><p>Brett planted his muscular hands on lean hips. \u201cSays you and what army? No way am I leaving Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you already left her,\u201d James said smoothly, placing himself between Summer and the other man. \u201cI also remember that you got married shortly afterward. And didn\u2019t I hear, just recently, that you and your wife are expecting a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Unfortunately Summer and I are now married and she\u2019s not interested in starting anything with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he muttered stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Brett,\u201d Summer said, not concealing her impatience. \u201cAre you such an egotist you actually think I\u2019d want you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved,\u201d she said. \u201cPast tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me any bull about you and granddaddy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranddaddy?\u201d she snapped. \u201cJames is ten times the man you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d She pushed in front of James and glared at her former fianc\u00e9. \u201cYou know what? Every day of my life I thank God we ended our engagement\u2014otherwise I\u2019d never have met James. He\u2019s taught me what loving someone really means. Which is something you don\u2019t have a clue about.\u201d</p><p>James had Summer by the shoulders. \u201cIt won\u2019t do any good to argue with him,\u201d he told her. He looked at Brett, who was red-faced and angry. \u201cI think it would be best if you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this,\u201d Brett growled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married,\u201d James said, trying to add reason to a situation that was fast getting out of hand. \u201cNothing you say is going to change that.\u201d</p><p>Brett spit on the ground. \u201cShe\u2019s nothing but a whore anyway.\u201d</p><p>James would\u2019ve walked away for almost anything. But he refused to allow anyone to speak in a derogatory way about Summer. He stepped toward Brett until they were face-to-face. \u201cI suggest you apologize to the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna make me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d James said. He\u2019d been a schoolboy the last time he was in a fistfight, but he wasn\u2019t going to let this jaded, ugly man insult his wife.</p><p>Brett\u2019s hands went up first. He swung at James, who was quick enough to step aside. The second time James wasn\u2019t so fortunate. The punch hit him square in the eye, but he didn\u2019t pay attention to the pain since he was more intent on delivering his own.</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d Summer repeatedly screamed his name. James could vaguely hear her in the background, pleading with him to stop, that Brett wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.</p><p>The two men wrestled to the ground, and James was able to level another couple of punches. \u201cYou\u2019ll apologize,\u201d he demanded from between clenched teeth when Brett showed signs of wanting to quit.</p><p>Blood drooled from Brett\u2019s mouth, and one eye was swollen. He nodded. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>James released him just as the police arrived.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Summer wouldn\u2019t have believed James was capable of such anger or such violence. Part of her wanted to call him a fool, but another part wanted to tell him how grateful she was for his love and protection.</p><p>His left eye was badly swollen, even with the bag of ice she\u2019d given him. James had refused to hold it to his face while he talked to the police.</p><p>His black eye wasn\u2019t the only damage. His mouth was cut, and an ugly bruise was beginning to form along his jaw. Brett was in much worse shape, with what looked to be a broken nose.</p><p>After talking to both Brett and James and a couple of witnesses, the police asked James if he wanted to press charges. James eyed Brett.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be necessary. I doubt this...gentleman will bother my wife again. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d he asked, turning to Brett.</p><p>Brett wiped the blood from the side of his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here looking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like that\u2019s what you got, though,\u201d the police officer told him. \u201cI\u2019d count my blessings and stay away.\u201d He studied him for a moment, then asked, \u201cWant to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019m out of here,\u201d Brett said with disgust. He climbed inside his car and slammed the door, then drove off as if he couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be back,\u201d Summer said confidently. She knew Brett\u2019s ego was fragile and he wouldn\u2019t return after being humiliated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he won\u2019t,\u201d James insisted darkly, \u201cbecause you\u2019re filing a restraining order first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded, wishing she\u2019d thought of doing it earlier.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s pestered you, is it?\u201d</p> <p>Summer lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the reason you had your phone number changed, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She gave a small nod.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could you have done from Seattle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have told me. I could at least have offered you some advice. For that matter, why didn\u2019t you tell your father?\u201d</p><p>James was furious and she suspected she was about to receive the lecture of her life. When nothing more came, she raised her eyes to her husband\u2014and wanted to weep.</p><p>His face was a mess. His eye was completely swollen now. It might have been better if she could\u2019ve convinced him to apply the ice pack. Anyone looking at him would know instantly that her husband the judge had been involved in an altercation\u2014and all because of her.</p><p>The police left soon afterward.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d Summer asked guiltily as they entered the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said curtly.</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t fine. His hands were swollen, his knuckles scraped and bleeding. All at once he started to blur, and the room spun. Everything seemed to be closing in on her. Panic-stricken, Summer groped for the kitchen counter and held on until the waves of dizziness passed.</p><p>\u201cSummer? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I got a little light-headed, that\u2019s all.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention how close she\u2019d come to passing out. Even now, she felt the force of her will was the only thing keeping her conscious.</p><p>James came to her and placed his arm around her waist, gently guiding her into the living room. They sat on the sofa, and Summer rested her head against his shoulder, wondering what was wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, James, you have a terrible black eye. What will people say?\u201d She hated to think about the speculation he\u2019d face when he returned to Seattle, and it was all on account of her. Perhaps she should\u2019ve told him that Brett was bothering her, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to burden him with her troubles.</p><p>\u201cEveryone will figure I was in a major fistfight,\u201d James teased. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be the best thing to happen to my reputation in years. People will see me in an entirely new light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone will wonder....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they will, and I\u2019ll tell them they should see the other guy.\u201d</p><p>Summer made an effort to laugh but found she couldn\u2019t. She twisted her head a bit so she could look at him. The bruise on his jaw was a vivid purple. She raised tentative fingers to it and bit her lip when he winced.</p><p>\u201cOh, James.\u201d Gently she pressed her lips to the underside of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThat helps.\u201d He laughed and groaned at the same time.</p><p>She kissed him again, easing her mouth toward his. He moaned and before long, they were exchanging deep, hungry kisses.</p><p>\u201cI refuse,\u201d James said, unbuttoning her blouse but having difficulty with his swollen hands, \u201cto allow Brett to ruin our last few hours together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and slid her arms around his shoulders. \u201cWant to have a shower?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes, but do you have a large enough hot-water tank?\u201d</p><p>Summer giggled, recalling their last experience in her compact shower stall and how the water had gone cold at precisely the wrong moment.</p><p>The sound of the key turning in the lock told Summer her roommate was home. She sat back abruptly and fastened her blouse.</p><p>\u201cHi, everyone.\u201d Julie stepped into the living room and set her suitcase on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d Her gaze narrowed. \u201cJames? What on earth happened to you?\u201d</p><p>James didn\u2019t expect his black eye to go unnoticed, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for the amount of open curiosity it aroused.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Judge Wilkens.\u201d Louise Jamison, the assistant he shared with two other judges, greeted him when he entered the office Monday morning. Then she dropped her pencil. \u201cJudge Wilkens!\u201d she said. \u201cMy goodness, what happened?\u201d</p><p>He mumbled something about meeting the wrong end of a fist and hurried into his office. It was clear he\u2019d need to come up with an explanation that would satisfy the curious.</p><p>Brad Williams knocked on his door five minutes later. His fellow judge let himself into James\u2019s office and stared. \u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. Looks like you\u2019ve been in a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a minor scuffle, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it.\u201d James stood and reached for his robe, eager to escape a series of prying questions he didn\u2019t want to answer. He had the distinct feeling the rest of the day was going to be like this.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>By the time he pulled out of the parking garage that evening, he regretted that he hadn\u2019t called in sick. He might\u2019ve done it if a black eye would disappear in a couple of days, but that wasn\u2019t likely, so there was no point in not going in. He checked his reflection in the rearview mirror. The eye looked worse than it had the previous day. He pressed his index finger against the swelling and was surprised by the pain it caused. Still, he could live with the discomfort; it was the unsightliness of the bruises and the questions and curious glances he could do without.</p><p>Irritated and not knowing exactly whom to blame, James drove to his father\u2019s house. He hadn\u2019t been to see Walter in a couple of weeks and wanted to discuss something with him.</p><p>His father was doing a New York Times crossword puzzle when James let himself into the house. He looked up from the folded newspaper and did a double take, but to his credit, Walter didn\u2019t mention the black eye. \u201cHello, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>James walked over to the snifter of Scotch Walter kept on hand and poured himself a liberal quantity. He wasn\u2019t fond of hard liquor and rarely indulged, but he felt he needed something potent. And fast.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one of those days, has it?\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s back was to his father. \u201cYou might say that.\u201d He took his first sip and the Scotch burned its way down his throat. \u201cThis stuff could rot a man\u2019s stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Taking his glass, James sat in the leather chair next to his father. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering about the eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to being curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and everyone else I\u2019ve seen today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine you\u2019ve been the object of more than one inquisitive stare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a fistfight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised. You\u2019re the one who told me there\u2019d be times in a man\u2019s life when he couldn\u2019t walk away from a fight. This happened to be one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d His father set aside the paper.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly, but if you must know, it was over Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Summer. How is she? I\u2019m telling you, son, I like her. Couldn\u2019t have chosen a better mate for you if I\u2019d gone looking myself.\u201d</p><p>James smiled for the first time that day. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well. I was with her this weekend.\u201d James raised the Scotch to his lips and grimaced. \u201cWe had brunch with her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen and Hank. Good people,\u201d Walter commented.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the April wedding date\u2014on their end and mine. Helen suggested we wait until September. I said November, because of the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want that?\u201d Walter asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Neither does Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the hell with it. Let her finish out her contract with Disneyland and join you after that. You\u2019ve already had a wedding. I never could understand why you wanted two ceremonies, but then I\u2019m an old man with little appreciation for fancy weddings. What I would appreciate is a couple of grandkids. I\u2019m not getting any younger, you know, and neither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo away with the second ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Walter muttered.</p><p>James closed his eyes in relief. Of course. It made perfect sense. He\u2019d suggested a second wedding because he thought that was what Summer wanted, but if he asked her, James suspected he\u2019d learn otherwise. The wedding was for her parents\u2019 sake.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get so smart?\u201d James asked his father.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, but I must be very wise,\u201d Walter said, and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a superior court judge for a son.\u201d</p><p>James laughed, feeling comfortable for the first time all day.</p><p>\u201cStay for dinner,\u201d his father insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we spent any real time together. Afterward you can let me beat you in a game of chess, and I\u2019ll go to bed a happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d It was an invitation too good to refuse.</p><p>When James got home after ten, the light on his phone was blinking. He was tempted to ignore his messages.</p><p>He felt tired but relaxed and not particularly interested in returning a long list of phone calls. Especially when he suspected most of his callers were trying to learn what they could about his mysterious black eye.</p><p>The only person he wanted to talk to was Summer. He reached for the phone, and she answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cI just got in,\u201d he explained. \u201cDad and I had dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give him my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did better than that\u2014I let him beat me at chess.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and James closed his eyes, savouring the melodic sound. It was like a balm after the day he\u2019d endured.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the eye?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d So he lied. \u201cHow was the show today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go in. I seem to have come down with the flu, so my understudy played Belle. I felt crummy all day. When I woke up this morning, I just felt so nauseous. At first I thought it was nerves over what happened with Brett, but it didn\u2019t go away, so I had to call in sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>She had him there. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I just want to be sure I didn\u2019t give you my flu bug while you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of it,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>They must have talked for another fifteen minutes, saying nothing outwardly significant yet sharing the most important details of their lives. Their conversation would have gone on a lot longer, had someone not rung his doorbell.</p><p>It was Ralph Southworth. His campaign manager took one look at James and threw his arms dramatically in the air. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood evening to you, too,\u201d James said evenly.</p><p>Ralph rammed all ten fingers through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t you listen to your messages? I\u2019ve left no fewer than five, and you haven\u2019t bothered to return one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d James said calmly. \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d</p><p>Ralph\u2019s eyes narrowed as he studied James\u2019s face. \u201cAm I going to need it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d James pointed to the recliner by the large brick fireplace. He\u2019d tell Ralph the truth because it was necessary and, knowing his campaign manager\u2019s feelings about Summer, he suspected Ralph would need a stiff drink. \u201cMake yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Ralph followed him into the kitchen. \u201cI got no less than ten phone calls this afternoon asking about your black eye. You can\u2019t show up and then say nothing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d This was news to James, since he\u2019d done exactly that. \u201cI thought you were here to discuss business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Ralph frowned when James brought an unopened bottle of top-shelf bourbon out of a cabinet. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to need that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI met with the League of Women Voters and I\u2019ve arranged for you to speak at their luncheon in July. It\u2019s a real coup, James, and I hope you appreciate my efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about the eye. And the bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d James said, adding two ice cubes to the glass. He half filled it with bourbon and handed it to his friend. \u201cI got hit in the face with a fist more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose fist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome beach bum by the name of Brett. I don\u2019t remember his last name if I ever heard it.\u201d</p> <p>Ralph swallowed his first sip of liquor. \u201cDoes the beach bum have anything to do with the woman you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The two men stared across the kitchen at each other.</p><p>\u201cWere the police called?\u201d Ralph demanded.</p><p>It took James a moment to own up to the truth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ralph slammed his hand against the counter. \u201cI should\u2019ve known! James, what did I tell you? A woman\u2019s nothing but trouble. Mark my words, if you get involved any further with Spring...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. It doesn\u2019t matter, because her name spells just one thing. Trouble. You\u2019ve worked all your life for this opportunity. This is your one shot at the bench. We both know it. You asked me to manage your campaign and I agreed, but I thought it would be a team effort. The two of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d James wanted to hold on to his seat on the bench more than he\u2019d ever wanted anything\u2014other than to marry Summer. He also felt he was the best man for the position. To get this close and lose it all would be agonizing.</p><p>\u201cThen why,\u201d Ralph asked, palms out, \u201care you sabotaging your own campaign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from this woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph, I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ralph rubbed his face with both hands, clearly frustrated.</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s in California, but I plan on bringing her to Seattle as soon as I can arrange it. Probably April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d James figured he should admit the truth now and be done with it. \u201cWe\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ralph pulled out a chair and sank into it. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just...one of those things. We fell in love and got married. We were hoping for a more elaborate ceremony later, but I can see that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what\u2019s the real problem, James? It\u2019s the marriage. Why didn\u2019t you tell me right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have,\u201d James said, sorry now that he hadn\u2019t. \u201cBut when you told me you\u2019d never been in love, I didn\u2019t think there was much of a chance you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is jeopardize your entire campaign.\u201d</p><p>Somehow he doubted that. \u201cAren\u2019t you overreacting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime will tell, won\u2019t it?\u201d Ralph asked smugly.</p><p>James decided to ignore that. \u201cIf anything, Summer will be an asset. She\u2019s lovely and she\u2019s good at connecting with people. Unfortunately her contract with Disney doesn\u2019t expire until April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ralph said sarcastically. \u201cI forgot, she\u2019s a showgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA singer and an actress and a very talented one at that,\u201d James boasted.</p><p>\u201cAn actress, a showgirl, it\u2019s all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce she\u2019s finished with her contract, I want her to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in Seattle?\u201d Ralph made it sound like a world-class disaster.</p><p>\u201cA wife belongs with her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the beach bum?\u201d</p><p>James frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about him. He\u2019s gone for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so. And while we\u2019re making out a wish list, let\u2019s add a couple of other things. Let\u2019s wish that your worthy opponent doesn\u2019t find out about this little skirmish between you and Summer\u2019s previous lover-boy. And let\u2019s make a great big wish that he doesn\u2019t learn that the police were called and a report filed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d James said confidently, far more confidently than he felt.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Ralph said, and downed what was left of his bourbon in one gulp. The glass hit the counter when he put it down. \u201cNow tell me, what kind of damage did you do to the beach bum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him, did you?\u201d Julie said when Summer set the telephone receiver back in place.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sighed reluctantly. She rested her hand protectively on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cA man has the right to know he\u2019s going to be a father,\u201d Julie said righteously. She bit into an apple as she tucked her feet beneath her on the sofa.</p><p>Summer closed her eyes. Even the smell of food or the sound of someone eating made her sick to her stomach. In the past two months she\u2019d seen parts of toilets that weren\u2019t meant to be examined at such close range. She hadn\u2019t kept down a single breakfast in weeks. The day before, she\u2019d wondered why she even bothered to eat. Dumping it directly into the toilet would save time and trouble.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think James is going to fall for this lie about having the flu?\u201d</p><p>It had been more than a month since she\u2019d last seen him, and in that time Summer had lost ten pounds. Her clothes hung on her, and she was as pale as death. She seemed to spend more time at the doctor\u2019s office than she did at her own apartment. Her biggest fear was that being so ill meant there was something wrong with the baby, although the doctor had attempted to reassure her on that score.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told him?\u201d Julie wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t do it over the phone.\u201d Besides, she remembered James mentioning that a pregnancy now would be a mistake. Well, she hadn\u2019t gotten this way by herself!</p><p>She knew exactly when it had happened, too. There was only the one time they hadn\u2019t used protection.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>Summer shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk on the phone every night. He sends you gifts. I can\u2019t think of anyone else who got six dozen red roses for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s extravagant....\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtravagant with everything but his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so busy, Julie. I never realized how much there was to being a judge, and he really cares about the people he works with. Not only the people who stand before him, but the attorneys and his staff, too. Then there\u2019s the election....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, go to him. He\u2019s just as unhappy without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got three weeks left on my contract, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really suppose no one\u2019s figured out that you\u2019re pregnant? Think about it, Summer. You came back from Vegas all happy and in love, and two weeks later you\u2019re heaving your guts out after every meal. No one expects you to perform when you feel this crummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo everyone a favor and\u2014\u201d Julie stopped when there was a knock at the door. \u201cIs anyone coming over tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Summer laid her head back against the sofa and drew in several deep breaths, hoping that would ease her nausea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Julie said, looking over her shoulder as soon as she\u2019d opened the door. \u201cIt\u2019s Walter Wilkens.\u201d</p><p>Summer threw aside the blanket and scurried off the sofa, anxious to see her father-in-law. \u201cWalter?\u201d What could he possibly be doing here? \u201cCome inside, please.\u201d</p><p>The refined, older gentleman stepped into the apartment. \u201cSummer?\u201d He gazed at her, his expression concerned. \u201cJames said you\u2019d been ill with the flu, but my dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks dreadful,\u201d Julie finished for him. Her roommate took another noisy bite of her apple. \u201cI\u2019m Julie. We met at the wedding. Summer\u2019s roommate and best friend.\u201d</p><p>Walter bowed slightly. \u201cHello, Julie. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, please,\u201d Summer said, motioning toward the only chair in the house without blankets or clean laundry stacked on it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...no, thank you.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSummer, my dear.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHave you been to a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Julie answered, chewing on her apple. \u201cThree times this week, right, Summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him or not?\u201d</p><p>Summer tossed the tangled curls over her shoulder and groaned inwardly. \u201cI don\u2019t have much choice now, do I?\u201d She met Walter\u2019s eyes and realized her lower lip was trembling. She was suddenly afraid she might burst into tears. Her emotions had been like a seesaw, veering from one extreme to another.</p><p>\u201cSummer, what is it?\u201d Walter prodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she whispered. She smiled happily all the while tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>Walter bolted out of his chair. \u201cHot damn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than me, you\u2019re the first person she\u2019s told,\u201d Julie felt obliged to inform him. \u201cNot even her own family knows, although her mother would take one look at her and guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Again it was Julie who answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman doesn\u2019t tell her husband that sort of thing over the phone,\u201d Summer insisted. \u201cOr by e-mail.\u201d She needed to see his face, to gauge James\u2019s reaction so she\u2019d know what he was really thinking.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sicker than a dog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Julie, but I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Walter said, ignoring Summer.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to California?\u201d Summer asked cordially, looking for a way to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cA business trip. I thought James might have mentioned it.\u201d</p> <p>If he had, Summer had missed it. She had a feeling she\u2019d been doing a lot of that lately.</p><p>\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d Walter said, sitting back in his chair and grinning broadly. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just see James\u2019s face when you tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably won\u2019t know what to do, laugh or cry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably do a little of both.\u201d</p><p>Walter himself was laughing, Summer noticed. He hadn\u2019t stopped smiling from the moment he\u2019d heard the news.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s always been so carefully planned in James\u2019s life,\u201d Walter said, still grinning. \u201cThen he met you and bingo. He\u2019s a husband, and now he\u2019s about to be a father. This is terrific news, just terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames might not find it all that wonderful,\u201d Summer said, voicing her fears for the first time. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of an important campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am worried. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019re going to have to do something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Summer asked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my son\u2019s going to become a father, you should tell him, and the sooner the better. Pack your bags, Summer. It\u2019s about time you moved to Seattle with your husband where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, young lady. I\u2019m an old man and I\u2019m accustomed to having my own way. If you\u2019re worried about his campaign, this is how we fix that. You\u2019ll be introduced to the public as his wife and we\u2019re going to put an end to any speculation right now.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Something was wrong with Summer. James had sensed it weeks ago. He would have confronted her and demanded answers if she hadn\u2019t sounded so fragile.</p><p>There was that business with the flu, but exactly how long was that going to last? When he asked her what the doctor said, she seemed vague.</p> <p>Part of the problem was the length of time they\u2019d been apart. He hadn\u2019t meant it to be so long. Summer had intended to come to Seattle, but that had fallen through, just as his last visit to California had. Neither of them was happy about it, but there was nothing James could have done on his end. He was sure that was the case with her, too.</p><p>James paced in his den, worrying. When he had to mull over a problem, that was what he did. Lately he\u2019d practically worn a path in the carpet. He felt helpless and frustrated. Despite Ralph\u2019s dire warnings, he wished he\u2019d brought Summer back to Seattle. This separation was hurting them both.</p><p>His greatest fear was that she regretted their marriage.</p><p>Their telephone conversations weren\u2019t the same anymore. He felt as if she was hiding something from him. They used to talk about everything but he noticed that she steered him away from certain topics now. She didn\u2019t want to talk about herself or her job or this flu that had hung on for few weeks. They used to talk for hours; now he had the feeling she was eager to get off the line.</p><p>James wondered about Brett, but when he asked, Summer assured him she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him since the fight.</p><p>The fight.</p><p>His black eye had caused a great deal of speculation among his peers. James had never offered any explanation. Via the grapevine, he\u2019d heard Ralph\u2019s version and found it only distantly related to the truth. According to his campaign manager, James had been jumped by gang members and valiantly fought them off until the police arrived.</p><p>When James confronted Ralph with the story, the other man smiled and said he couldn\u2019t be held accountable for rumors. Right or wrong, James had let it drop. He was eager to put the incident behind him.</p><p>James certainly hadn\u2019t expected married life to be this lonely. He\u2019d never felt this detached from the mainstream of everyday life, this isolated. Missing Summer was like a constant ache in his stomach. Except that a store-bought tablet wasn\u2019t going to cure what ailed him.</p><p>His desk was filled with demands. He felt weary. Unsure of his marriage. Unsure of himself.</p><p>He went into the kitchen to make a cup of instant coffee when he saw a car turn into his driveway and around to the backyard.</p><p>His father.</p><p>He wondered why Walter would stop by unannounced on a Sunday afternoon. James wasn\u2019t in the mood for company\u2014but then again, maybe a sounding board was exactly what he needed. Other than his father, there was no one with whom he could discuss Summer.</p><p>The slam of a car door closing was followed almost immediately by another. James frowned. Dad had brought someone with him. Great. Just great.</p><p>He took the hot water out of the microwave, added the coffee granules and stirred briskly. There was a knock at the back door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, the door\u2019s open,\u201d he called, not turning around. He didn\u2019t feel like being polite. Not today, when it felt as if the world was closing in around him.</p><p>He sipped his coffee and stared out the window. The daffodils were blooming and the\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello, James.\u201d</p><p>James whirled around. \u201cSummer?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe she was really there. It was impossible. A figment of his imagination. An apparition. Before another second passed, James walked across the kitchen and swept her into his arms.</p><p>Laughing and sobbing at once, Summer hugged him close.</p><p>Then they were kissing each other. Neither could give or get enough.</p><p>Walter stood in the background and cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for the two of you in the living room,\u201d he said, loudly enough to be sure he was heard.</p><p>As far as James was concerned, his father might as well make himself comfortable. Or leave. This could take a while.</p><p>Summer in his arms was the closest thing to heaven James had ever found. Not for several minutes did he notice how thin and frail she was. The virus had ravaged her body.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he whispered between kisses. He paused and brushed back her hair to get a good look at her.</p><p>She was pale. Her once-pink cheeks were colorless, and her eyes appeared sunken. \u201cAre you over the flu?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes and stepped away from him. \u201cI...you\u2019d better sit down, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down? Why?\u201d</p><p>Her hands closed around the back of a kitchen chair. \u201cI have something important to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He could see she was nervous and on the verge of tears. The worries that were nipping at his heels earlier returned with reinforcements. Summer had more than a common flu bug.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d he said. A knot was beginning to form in his stomach. Was she ill? Was it something life threatening? The knot twisted and tightened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the flu,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Whatever it was, then, must be very bad if his father had brought her to Seattle.</p><p>\u201cHow serious is it?\u201d he asked. He preferred to confront whatever they were dealing with head-on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious, James, very serious.\u201d Slowly she raised her eyes to his. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>His relief was so great that he nearly laughed. \u201cA baby? You mean to tell me you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her fingers had gone white, and she was watching him closely.</p><p>James took her in his arms. \u201cI thought you were really sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been really sick,\u201d she told him crisply. \u201cMorning sickness. Afternoon sickness. Evening sickness. I...I can\u2019t seem to keep food down.... I\u2019ve never been more miserable in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect part of her problem has been psychological,\u201d Walter announced from the doorway. \u201cThe poor girl\u2019s been terribly worried about how you were going to take the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feelings exactly,\u201d Walter said. \u201cThe deed\u2019s done, what\u2019s there to think about? Besides, you\u2019ve made me an extremely happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby.\u201d James remained awestruck at the thought.</p><p>\u201cNow tell him your due date, Summer\u2014he\u2019ll get a real kick out of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeptember twenty-third,\u201d Summer announced.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be studying him, waiting for a reaction. James didn\u2019t know what to think. Then it hit him. \u201cSeptember twenty-third? That\u2019s the date of the primary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d Walter asked.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d James asked, taking Summer\u2019s hands in his own.</p><p>Summer looked at Walter.</p><p>\u201cStay?\u201d his father barked. \u201cMy dear son, this is your wife. I brought her to Seattle to live with you. This is where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can live with me?\u201d A man could only take in so much news at one time. First, he\u2019d learned that his wife didn\u2019t have some life-threatening disease. Then he discovered he was going to be a father. Even more important, he was going to have the opportunity to prove what kind of husband he could be.</p><p>\u201cYes. I got out of my contract for medical reasons, and Julie\u2019s getting a roommate. So...everything\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>James pulled out the chair and sat Summer down. Then he knelt in front of her and took her hands in his. \u201cA baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Walter said, \u201cand if he does I\u2019ll set up an appointment with a good psychiatrist I know. This is the best news we\u2019ve had in thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d James asked.</p><p>Summer laughed at him. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d She leaned toward him and whispered, reminding him of the one episode the morning after their honeymoon night.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d James said, and chuckled. \u201cAs I recall, I was the one who said one time wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything to eat in this house?\u201d Walter asked, banging cupboard doors open and shut.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you been so ill?\u201d James wanted to know. It worried him. \u201cIs it routine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy doctor says some women suffer from severe morning sickness for the first few months. He\u2019s been very reassuring. I try to remember that when I\u2019m losing my latest meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything that can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got what she needs now,\u201d Walter said.</p><p>Summer laid her head on his shoulder. \u201cI was worried you\u2019d be upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be upset when the most beautiful woman in the world tells me she\u2019s having my baby?\u201d He reached for her hand and pressed her palm over his heart. \u201cNotice anything different?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head, giving him a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cMy heart\u2019s racing because I\u2019m so excited. Because I\u2019m so happy. We\u2019re going to have a baby, Summer! I feel like I could conquer the world.\u201d</p><p>He wanted his words to comfort her. The last thing he expected was that she\u2019d burst into tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you said a baby would be a mistake right now,\u201d she reminded him between sobs.</p><p>\u201cI said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d Walter glared at James.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying it,\u201d James told him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love. Just knowing we\u2019re going to have a baby makes me happier than I have any right to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn straight he\u2019s happy,\u201d Walter tossed in, \u201cor there\u2019d be hell to pay. I should\u2019ve been a grandfather two or three times over by now. As far as I\u2019m concerned, James owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try and make it up to you,\u201d James promised his father with a grin.</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t remember ever being so hungry. She\u2019d been with James a week and had settled so contentedly into her new life it was almost as if she\u2019d always been there.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another piece of apple pie?\u201d James asked. \u201cBetter yet, why don\u2019t we buy the whole thing and take it home with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do that?\u201d Summer was sure her appetite must be a source of embarrassment to him. They were at a sidewalk restaurant on the Seattle waterfront. Summer couldn\u2019t decide between the French onion soup and the Cobb salad, so she\u2019d ordered both. Then she\u2019d topped off the meal with a huge slice of apple pie \u00e0 la mode.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask the waitress,\u201d James said as though it was perfectly normal to order a whole pie for later.</p><p>\u201cHave I embarrassed you?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice low.</p><p>James\u2019s mouth quivered. \u201cNo, but I will admit I\u2019ve rarely seen anyone enjoy her food more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James, you have no idea how good it is to be able to eat and keep everything down. I felt a thousand times better this past week than I did the whole previous two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Dad was right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe psychological effects of the pregnancy were taking their toll along with the physical. In other words, you were worried and making yourself more so. I could kick myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not guessing. You have to forgive me, sweetheart, I\u2019m new to this husband business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me one thing. Don\u2019t keep any more secrets from me, all right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d A striking-looking couple approached their table.</p><p>\u201cRich and Jamie Manning.\u201d Sounding genuinely pleased, James stood and exchanged handshakes with the man. Then he turned to Summer. \u201cThese are good friends of mine, Rich and Jamie Manning. This is my wife, Summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d Rich repeated, doing a poor job of hiding his surprise. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortly after New Year\u2019s,\u201d James explained. \u201cWould you care to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately we can\u2019t,\u201d Rich said. \u201cThe babysitter\u2019s waiting. But this is great news. I hope there\u2019s a good reason I didn\u2019t get a wedding invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very good one.\u201d James grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to let everyone know. But Summer just moved here from California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the word\u2019s out now,\u201d Jamie said, smiling at her. \u201cOnce Rich\u2019s mother hears about it, she\u2019ll want to throw a party in your honor.\u201d Jamie and her husband shared a private, happy look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better call your parents before I alienate them completely,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you soon,\u201d Rich said and patted James\u2019s shoulder as he passed by. \u201cBye, Summer.\u201d</p><p>James was silent for a moment, and Summer wasn\u2019t sure if he was glad or not that his friends had stopped to talk. She didn\u2019t think he intended to keep their marriage a secret, yet he hadn\u2019t made a point of introducing her around, either.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that I was hoping to give you some time to regain your strength before you met my friends.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s gaze followed the couple as they made their way toward the front of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich and Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He relaxed in his chair. \u201cThey came to see me a few years back with perhaps the most unusual request of my career.\u201d He smiled, and Summer guessed he must\u2019ve been amused at the time, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked me to draw up a paper for a marriage of convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d That seemed odd to Summer. Although she\u2019d just met the couple, it was clear to her that they were in love.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d come up with some harebrained scheme to have a baby together\u2014by artificial insemination. Rich would be the sperm donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they have a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Bethany was conceived the old-fashioned way without a single visit to a fertility clinic.\u201d</p><p>Summer shook her head. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. Why would two healthy people go to such lengths to have a child? Especially when they\u2019re perfectly capable of doing things...the usual way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does sound silly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes.\u201d</p><p>James leaned forward and placed his elbows on the table. \u201cJamie and Rich had been friends for years. Since their high school days, if I recall correctly. Jamie couldn\u2019t seem to fall in love with the right kind of man and, after a couple of disastrous relationships, she decided she was giving up dating altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the tricks life plays on people,\u201d Summer said, licking melted ice cream off her spoon. She looked across the table at the remnants on James\u2019s plate. \u201cAre you going to eat that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pushed the plate toward her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and blew him a kiss. \u201cGo on,\u201d she encouraged, scooping up the last bits of pie and ice cream. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Jamie was comfortable with her decision, except that she wanted a child. That\u2019s when she approached Rich about being the sperm donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust between friends, that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. At any rate, Rich didn\u2019t think it was such a bad idea himself, the not-marrying part. He\u2019d had his own ups and downs in the relationship department. But the more he thought about her suggestion, the more problems he had with being nothing more than a sperm donor. He suggested they get married so their child could have his name. He also wanted a say in the baby\u2019s upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jamie agreed to all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they asked you to draw up a contract or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I have to tell you I had my reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have two children now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this so-called marriage of convenience certainly worked out,\u201d Summer told him.</p><p>\u201cIt sure did.\u201d</p><p>While she was looking around the table for anything left to eat, she noticed that James was studying her. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA thousand times better.\u201d She smiled and lowered her voice so he alone could hear. \u201cIf what you\u2019re really asking is if I\u2019m well enough to make love, the answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cShall we hurry home, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>He paid the tab and they were gone. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked as he unlocked the car door and helped her inside.</p><p>Sitting in the passenger seat, Summer smiled up at her husband. \u201cAm I sure? James, it\u2019s been months since we last made love. I\u2019m so hot for you I could burst into flames.\u201d</p><p>James literally ran around the front of the car. He sped the entire way home, and Summer considered it fortunate that they weren\u2019t stopped by a traffic cop.</p><p>\u201cTorture...every night for the last week,\u201d James mumbled as he pulled into the driveway. \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust myself to even touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her time in Seattle hadn\u2019t started out well. The first morning, she\u2019d woken and run straight for the bathroom. James helped her off the floor when she\u2019d finished. He\u2019d cradled her in his arms and told her how much he loved her for having their baby.</p><p>Her first few dinners hadn\u2019t stayed down, either. But each day after her arrival, the nausea and episodes of vomiting had become less and less frequent. Now, one week later, she was almost herself again.</p><p>He left the car and came around to her side. When he opened the door, she stepped out and into his embrace\u2014and kissed him.</p><p>James groaned and swung her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCarrying you over the threshold,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cheated out of just about everything else when it comes to this marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve had the big church wedding and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to argue about that again? Really, James, I\u2019d rather we just made love.\u201d</p><p>He had a problem getting the door unlocked while holding her, but he managed. The minute they were inside, he started kissing her, doing wonderful, erotic things that excited her to the point of desperation.</p><p>Summer kicked off her shoes.</p><p>James kissed her and unsnapped the button to her skirt. The zipper slid down. All the while he was silently urging her toward the stairs.</p><p>Her jacket went next, followed by her shirt.</p><p>She made it to the staircase and held out her hand. James didn\u2019t need any more encouragement than that. They raced to the bedroom together.</p><p>Summer fell on the bed, laughing. \u201cOh, James, promise you\u2019ll always love me this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He tried to remove his shirt without taking off his tie, with hilarious results. Arms clutching her stomach, Summer doubled over, laughing even harder. It was out of pure kindness that she climbed off the bed and loosened the tie enough to slip it over his head. Otherwise, she was afraid her normally calm, patient husband would have strangled himself.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the most wonderful man alive. Will you always want me this much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine not wanting you.\u201d And he proceeded to prove it....</p><p>James was half-asleep when he heard the doorbell chime. He would have ignored it, but on the off chance it was someone important, he decided to look outside and see if he recognized the car.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Ralph Southworth was at his door.</p><p>James grabbed his pants, threw on his shirt and kissed Summer on the cheek. Then he hurried down the stairs, taking a second to button his shirt before he opened the door. \u201cHello, Ralph,\u201d he said, standing, shoes and socks in hand.</p><p>Ralph frowned. \u201cWhat the hell have you been\u2014never mind, I already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her a few minutes, and she\u2019ll be down so you can meet her,\u201d James told him. He sat in a chair and put on his shoes and socks. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA number of things, but mainly I\u2019d...\u201d He hesitated as Summer made her way down the stairs.

He slipped his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHello, Summer,\u201d Ralph said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ralph.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week.

That was when he saw her skirt draped on a chair, and her jacket on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Ralph,\u201d he said, ushering the other man into the den.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder and saw Summer delicately scoop up various items of clothing, then hurry into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cSomething amuses you?\u201d</p><p>James cleared his throat. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, James, I have to question your judgment. When you told me you married a showgirl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s an actress.\u201d</p><p>Ralph ignored that. \u201cAs I was saying, your judgment appears to be questionable.\u201d</p><p>This was a serious accusation, considering that James was running for a position on the superior court.</p> <p>Ralph\u2019s lips were pinched. \u201cIt worries me that you\u2019d marry some woman you barely know on the spur of the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove sometimes happens like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Ralph muttered. \u201cPersonally I wouldn\u2019t know, but James, how much younger is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as you think. Nine years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unsuitable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor whom? You? Listen, Ralph, I asked you to manage my campaign, not run my life. I married Summer, and she\u2019s going to have my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s pregnant, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the baby\u2019s due September twenty-third.\u201d</p> <p>Ralph\u2019s lips went white with disapproval. \u201cCould she have chosen a more inconvenient date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the primary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, James.\u201d Ralph shook his head. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. It just won\u2019t. Once people learn what you\u2019ve done, they\u2019ll assume you were obligated to marry the girl. The last thing we need now is to have your morals questioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph, you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you brought her here, after everything I said.\u201d</p><p>James gritted his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>Ralph paced back and forth for a moment or two. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I have any choice,\u201d he said with finality.</p><p>\u201cChoice about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resigning as your manager.\u201d</p><p>Summer appeared just then, carrying a tray. \u201cCoffee, anyone?\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Summer settled easily into life with James. She adored her husband and treasured each moment that they were together.</p><p>Her days quickly began to follow a routine of sorts. She rose early and, because she was feeling better, resumed her regular workout, which included a two-mile run first thing in the morning.</p><p>James insisted on running with her, although he made it clear he didn\u2019t like traipsing through dark streets at dawn\u2019s early light. But he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her running alone, so he joined her, protesting every step of the way.</p><p>James was naturally athletic, and Summer didn\u2019t think anyone was more surprised than he was by how enjoyable he started to find it. After their run, they showered together. Thankfully James\u2019s hot-water tank was larger than the meager one back in her Orange County apartment.</p><p>This was both good and bad. The negative was when James, a stickler for punctuality, got to court late two mornings in a row.</p><p>\u201cYou shower first,\u201d he told her after their Monday-morning run.</p><p>\u201cNot together?\u201d she asked, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be late this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll behave,\u201d she promised.</p><p>James snickered. \u201cI can\u2019t behave with you, Summer. You tempt me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but you shower first, and I\u2019ll get us breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, he walked into the kitchen, where Summer was pouring two glasses of orange juice. He wore his dark business suit and carried his briefcase, ready for his workday.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d he asked, downing the juice as he stood by the table. He sat down to eat his bagel and cream cheese and picked up the paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to send Julie a long e-mail. Then I thought I\u2019d stop in at the library and volunteer to read during storytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d he said, scanning the paper.</p><p>Summer knew reading the paper was part of his morning ritual, which he didn\u2019t have as much time for since her arrival. She drank the last of her juice and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs for my shower,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Have a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Oh, what time will you be home tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSix or so,\u201d he mumbled absently and turned the front page.</p><p>Summer hesitated. His schedule had changed. Rarely did he get home before eight the first week after she\u2019d moved in. It seemed that every night there was someone to meet, some campaign supporter to talk to, some plan to outline\u2014all to do with the September primary, even though it was still months away.</p><p>In the past week James had come directly home from the courthouse. Not that she was complaining, but she couldn\u2019t help wondering.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your campaign?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s under control,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>Summer wondered.</p><p>All at once James looked up, startled, as if he\u2019d just remembered something. \u201cWhat day\u2019s your ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursday of next week. Don\u2019t look so worried. You don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be there,\u201d he stated emphatically. \u201cOur baby\u2019s first picture. I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. Besides, I\u2019m curious to find out if we\u2019re going to have a son or daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said, chuckling. He reached out to stroke her abdomen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I love this little one, and he isn\u2019t even born yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d she asked, hands on her hips in mock offense.</p><p>\u201cA daughter would suit me just fine. Actually Dad\u2019s hoping for a granddaughter. It\u2019s been a long time since there\u2019s been a little girl in the family.\u201d</p><p>Summer pressed her hand over her husband\u2019s. She\u2019d never been this happy. It frightened her sometimes. Experience had taught her that happiness almost always came with a price.</p><p>Walter joined them for dinner Wednesday evening. From the moment she\u2019d met him, Summer had liked her father-in-law.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Summer could cook this well when you married her?\u201d Walter asked when they\u2019d finished eating.</p><p>She\u2019d found a recipe for a chicken casserole on the Internet and served it with homemade dinner rolls and fresh asparagus, with a fresh fruit salad made of seedless grapes and strawberries. For dessert she picked up a lemon torte at the local bakery.</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s full of surprises,\u201d James told his father. His eyes briefly met hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to say is no one knew how fertile I was, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best surprise yet,\u201d Walter said. He dabbed the corner of his mouth with his napkin in a blatant effort to hide a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is,\u201d James put in.</p><p>Walter studied her. \u201cHow are you feeling these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the doctor have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m in excellent health. The baby\u2019s growing by leaps and bounds. I haven\u2019t felt him move yet, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d James and Walter chimed in simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cOr her,\u201d she retorted, smiling. She stood and started to clear the table.</p><p>\u201cLet me do that,\u201d James insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helpless, you know,\u201d Walter added.</p><p>Both men leapt from their chairs.</p><p>\u201cGo have your coffee,\u201d Summer told them. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take me a few minutes to deal with the dishes.\u201d</p><p>Walter shrugged, then looked at his son. \u201cThere are a few things I need to discuss with James,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen off with you.\u201d She shooed them out of the kitchen.</p><p>James poured two cups of coffee and took them into the living room. He paused in the doorway and looked over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, honestly! Go talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t know Walter well, she sensed that something was on his mind. Throughout the meal she\u2019d noticed the way he watched his son. James was acting odd, too.</p><p>Walter wanted to discuss the campaign, but every time he\u2019d introduced the subject, James expertly changed it. He did it cleverly, but Walter had noticed, and after a while Summer had, too.</p><p>She ran tap water to rinse off the dinner plates before putting them in the dishwasher, and when she turned off the faucet she heard the end of James\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201c...Summer doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Apparently the two men didn\u2019t realize how well their voices carried. She didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop, but it did seem only fair to listen, since she was the topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do about it?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>It took James a long time to answer. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried reasoning with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James answered bitterly. \u201cThe man said he has doubts about my judgment. He\u2019s insulted me, insulted my wife. I don\u2019t need Southworth if he\u2019s got an attitude like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will need a campaign manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d James admitted reluctantly.</p><p>So that was what this was about. Summer leaned against the kitchen counter and closed her eyes. Ralph had resigned, and from the evidence she\u2019d seen, James had, too. Resigned himself to losing, even before the election. It didn\u2019t sound like him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Walter asked as if reading Summer\u2019s mind.</p><p>James lowered his voice substantially, and Summer had to strain to hear him. \u201cHe disapproves of Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Walter had no such compunction about keeping quiet. \u201cThe man\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a series of mistakes,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cMistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Summer.\u201d</p><p>The world collapsed, like a house falling in on itself. Summer struggled toward a chair and literally fell into it.</p><p>\u201cI should never have married her the way I did,\u201d James elaborated. \u201cI cheated her out of the wedding she deserved. I don\u2019t know if her mother\u2019s forgiven me yet. The last I heard, her family\u2019s planning a reception in November. By then the baby will be here and, well, it seems a little after the fact.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Summer for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d James remarked tartly. \u201cI blame myself. In retrospect I realize I was afraid of losing her. So I insisted on the marriage before she could change her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what any of this has to do with Ralph,\u201d Walter muttered.</p><p>\u201cRalph thinks Summer\u2019s too young for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also seems to think I\u2019ve done myself harm by not letting everyone know immediately that I was married. Bringing Summer here to live with me now, pregnant, and saying we\u2019ve been married all along, is apparently too convenient to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I know that, but there\u2019s already speculation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? People will always talk. Let them. But you\u2019ve got to do something about getting this campaign organized. There are worse things you could be accused of than marrying in secret or getting Summer pregnant before your wedding day. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Southworth\u2019s looking for excuses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI refuse to subject Summer to that kind of speculation,\u201d James said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked this over with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d The defeatist attitude was back in James\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019ve put it off longer than I should have.\u201d</p><p>After that, Summer didn\u2019t hear much more of the conversation between father and son. Their marriage had hurt her husband; it might have robbed him of his dreams, cheated him out of his goals.</p> <p>The phone rang long before she had time to gather her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d she called out to James, and reached for the extension in the kitchen. Her hand trembled as she lifted the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, her voice weak.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d came the soft feminine reply. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. My name\u2019s Christy Manning Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy...Manning?\u201d Summer said, stunned. She hadn\u2019t recovered from one shock before she was hit with another. \u201cJust a moment. I\u2019ll get James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. It\u2019s you I want to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your reaction, I\u2019d guess James has mentioned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Summer slumped down in a chair and closed her eyes. \u201cYou and James were engaged at one time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I understand you and James recently got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months ago,\u201d Summer said, embarrassed by how weak her voice still was. \u201cIn Las Vegas,\u201d she added a little more loudly.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me for being so forward. I talked it over with Cody\u2014he\u2019s my husband\u2014and he said since I felt so strongly about it I should call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo strongly about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you...and James. I\u2019ll always regret the way I treated James. He deserved a lot better, but I was younger then. Immature in some ways. At one time I thought I was in love with him. I knew he loved me, and my family thought the world of him. Then I met Cody.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI didn\u2019t phone to tell you all this. I\u2019m sure James filled in the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call?\u201d Summer was sure that under other circumstances she might have liked Christy Franklin.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you how happy I am that James found someone to love. I know it\u2019s presumptuous of me but I wanted to ask a favor of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA favor?\u201d The woman had a lot of nerve.</p><p>\u201cLove him with all your heart, Summer. James is a special, special man and he deserves a woman who\u2019ll stand by his side and love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cFor quite a while I despaired of James ever getting married. I can\u2019t tell you how pleased I was when Mom phoned to tell me Rich and Jamie had met you. Cody and I want to extend our very best wishes to you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but I do hope you\u2019ll keep Cody and me in mind when you count your friends. There\u2019s a place in my heart for James. He\u2019s been a friend to our family for years. He was a tremendous help to Paul when Diane died, and again later when he married Leah. James helped Rich and Jamie, too, and he\u2019s been a good friend to Jason and Charlotte, as well. We\u2019re all indebted to him one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love him so much.\u201d She was fighting back tears and not even sure what she was crying about. The fact that Ralph Southworth had resigned as James\u2019s campaign manager because of her? Or that James\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e still cared for him deeply?</p><p>Summer had just replaced the receiver when James stepped into the kitchen. He stood with one hand on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho was that on the phone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Summer met his look straight on, waiting to read any emotion. \u201cChristy Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d He looked more surprised than anything.</p><p>\u201cShe called to give us her and Cody\u2019s best wishes. She said it was high time you were married and she can hardly wait to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>Summer grinned. \u201cI said she\u2019s to keep her cotton-pickin\u2019 hands off my husband.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled, obviously delighted by her possessive attitude. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to get much of an argument from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing,\u201d she said, and slid her arm around his waist. Together they joined his father.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Summer muttered. She sucked in her stomach in order to close her skirt. \u201cI can barely zip this up. It fit fine just last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d James said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cThree months. I\u2019m not supposed to show yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d James\u2019s eyes left the mirror, his face covered with shaving cream. He carefully examined her rounded belly.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, James. If you were meeting me for the first time, would you guess I was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of those trick questions, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, then cleared his throat. He seemed to know intuitively that she wasn\u2019t going to like the answer. \u201cYou do look pregnant to me. But then you are pregnant, so I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fat already,\u201d she wailed, and felt like breaking into tears.</p><p>\u201cFat is not the word I\u2019d use to describe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m showing at three months, can you just imagine what I\u2019ll look like at nine?\u201d</p><p>His grin revealed pride and love. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019ll look like the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I love you so much,\u201d she told her husband, turning back to the closet. She sorted through the hangers, dismissing first one outfit and then another.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going that you\u2019re so worried about how you look?\u201d James asked.</p><p>Summer froze. \u201cAn appointment.\u201d She prayed he wouldn\u2019t question her further. She\u2019d arranged a meeting with Ralph Southworth, but she didn\u2019t want James to know about it.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t forget tonight,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Mannings\u2019 for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget,\u201d she promised. \u201cEric and Elizabeth, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Knowing Elizabeth, she\u2019ll probably spend the whole day cooking. She\u2019s called me at least five times in the past week. She\u2019s anxious to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m anxious to meet them, too.\u201d But not nearly as anxious as she was about this meeting with Southworth. In setting up the appointment, Summer hoped to achieve several objectives. Mainly she wanted Ralph to agree to manage James\u2019s campaign again. And she wanted to prove to James that he didn\u2019t need to protect her from gossip and speculation.</p><p>James left for court shortly after he\u2019d finished shaving. Summer changed into the outfit she\u2019d finally chosen, a soft gray business suit with a long jacket that\u2014sort of\u2014disguised her pregnancy. She spent the morning doing errands and arrived at Ralph\u2019s office at the Seattle Bank ten minutes ahead of their one-o\u2019clock appointment.</p><p>She announced her name to the receptionist and was escorted into Southworth\u2019s office a few minutes later.</p><p>Ralph stood when she entered the room. He didn\u2019t seem pleased to see her.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d she said brightly, taking the chair across from his desk. She wanted it understood that she wouldn\u2019t be easily dissuaded.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he responded curtly.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t object to my making an appointment to see you. I\u2019m afraid I may have, uh, misled your secretary into thinking it had to do with a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Are you in the habit of misleading people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she assured him with a cordial smile, \u201cbut sometimes a little inventive thinking is worth a dozen frustrating phone calls.\u201d</p><p>Southworth didn\u2019t agree or disagree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to the point of my visit,\u201d she said, not wanting to waste time, his or hers.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know why you\u2019ve resigned as my husband\u2019s campaign manager.\u201d</p><p>Southworth rolled a pencil between his palms, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI believe that\u2019s between James and me. It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the way I understand it,\u201d she said, grateful he\u2019d opened the conversation for her. \u201cI overheard James and his father talking recently, and James said something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you eavesdrop, as well?\u201d</p><p>He was certainly eager to tally her less than sterling characteristics.</p><p>\u201cYes, but in this case, I\u2019m glad I did because I learned that you\u2019d resigned because of me.\u201d</p><p>Southworth hesitated. \u201cNot exactly. I questioned James\u2019s judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout our marriage?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>Once again he seemed inclined to dodge the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t really think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Mr. Southworth. This election is extremely important to James. You\u2019re extremely important to him. When he first mentioned your name to me, he said you were the best man for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the best man for the job.\u201d The banker certainly didn\u2019t lack confidence in his abilities. \u201cI also know a losing battle when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wilkens, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what, Mr. Southworth? Tell me why you question James\u2019s judgment. Until he married me, you were ready to lend him your full support. I can assure you I\u2019ll stay right here until I have the answers to these questions.\u201d She raised her chin a stubborn half inch and refused to budge.</p><p>\u201cIf you insist...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re years younger than James.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNine years is hardly that much of a difference. This is a weak excuse and unworthy of you. I do happen to look young for my age, but I can assure you I\u2019m twenty-eight, and James is only thirty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that you\u2019re a showgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an actress and singer,\u201d she countered. \u201cSince I worked at Disneyland, I hardly think you can fault my morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorals is another issue entirely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d she said, finding she disliked this man more every time he opened his mouth. It seemed to her that Ralph Southworth was inventing excuses, none of which amounted to anything solid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...it\u2019s clear to me, at least, that you and James conveniently decided to marry when you recognized your condition.\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, and even if it were, all I need to do is produce our marriage certificate, which I just happen to have with me.\u201d Somehow or other she knew it would come down to this. She opened her purse and removed the envelope, then handed it to the man whom her husband had once considered his friend.</p> <p>Southworth read it over and returned it to her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the two of you did this. No one meets in Vegas, falls in love and gets married within a few days. Not unless they\u2019ve got something to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in love.\u201d She started to explain that she and James had known each other for a year, but Ralph cut her off.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mrs. Wilkens! I\u2019ve known James for at least a decade. There had to be a reason other than the one you\u2019re giving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me. Isn\u2019t that good enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Southworth seemed bored with the conversation. \u201cThen there\u2019s the fact that he kept the marriage a secret.\u201d</p><p>Summer had no answer to that. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why James didn\u2019t tell anyone about the wedding,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMy guess is that it\u2019s because he\u2019s a private man and considers his personal life his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow far along is the pregnancy?\u201d he asked, ignoring her answer.</p><p>\u201cThree months,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThree months? I don\u2019t claim to know much about women and babies, but I\u2019ve had quite a few women work for me at the bank over the years. A number of them have had babies. You look easily five or six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! I know when I got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, now?\u201d</p><p>Summer drew in her breath and held it for a moment in an effort to contain her outrage. She loved James and believed in him, but she refused to be insulted.</p><p>\u201cI can see we aren\u2019t going to accomplish anything here,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cYou\u2019ve already formed your opinion about James and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you, Mrs. Wilkens. It\u2019s unfortunate. James would\u2019ve made an excellent superior court judge. But there\u2019s been far too much speculation about him lately. It started with the black eye. People don\u2019t want a man on the bench who can\u2019t hold on to his own temper. A judge should be above any hint of moral weakness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames is one of the most morally upright men I know,\u201d she said heatedly. \u201cI take your comments as a personal insult to my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find your loyalty to James touching, but it\u2019s too little, too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Summer demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou want your husband to win the election, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d The question was ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cIf I were to tell you that you could make a difference, perhaps even sway the election, would you listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen,\u201d she said, although anything beyond listening was another matter.</p><p>Southworth stood and walked over to the window, which offered a panoramic view of the Seattle skyline. His back was to her and for several minutes he said nothing. He seemed to be weighing his words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already admitted I\u2019m the best man to run James\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said reluctantly, not as willing to acknowledge it as she had been when she\u2019d first arrived.</p><p>\u201cI can help win him this September\u2019s primary and the November election. Don\u2019t discount the political sway I have in this community, Mrs. Wilkens.\u201d</p><p>Summer said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhen James first told me he\u2019d married you, I suggested he keep you out of the picture until after the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did this for a number of reasons, all of which James disregarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he really didn\u2019t have much choice,\u201d she felt obliged to tell him. \u201cI turned up on his doorstep, suitcase in hand.\u201d</p><p>Ralph nodded as if he\u2019d suspected this had been the case. \u201cI can turn James\u2019s campaign around if you\u2019ll agree to one thing.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened, knowing before the words were out what he was going to say. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply disappear for several months. Stay away from Seattle, and once the November election is over, you can move back into his house. It won\u2019t matter then.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and lowered her head. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d James kissed her soundly and rushed up the stairs to change clothes.</p><p>He was late? She hadn\u2019t noticed. Since her meeting with Ralph Southworth, Summer had spent what remained of the afternoon in a stupor. She felt numb and sad. Tears lay just beneath the surface, ready to break free.</p><p>This decision should\u2019ve been far less difficult. She could give her husband the dream he\u2019d always wanted or ruin his life.</p><p>Five minutes later James was back. He\u2019d changed out of his suit and tie and wore slacks and a shirt and sweater. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner tonight with the Mannings. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. How could she have forgotten that? James was like a schoolboy eager to show off his science project. Only in this case, she was the project. She still wore her gray suit, so after quickly brushing her hair and refreshing her makeup, she considered herself ready\u2014in appearance if not in attitude.</p><p>He escorted her out the front door and into his car, which he\u2019d parked in front of the house. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had much campaigning to do lately,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Ralph have to say?\u201d she asked, wanting to see how much James was willing to tell her.</p><p>\u201cNot much. Let\u2019s not talk about the election tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to think about it. These people are my friends. They\u2019re like a second set of parents to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I won\u2019t need to tell them, will I?\u201d He gently patted her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen we get home this evening, I want to make love.\u201d</p><p>His gaze briefly left the road and he nodded.</p><p>The emptiness inside her could only be filled with his love.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>She made herself smile and laid her head against his shoulder. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something different about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d Just that her heart felt as if it had been chopped in half. Just that she\u2019d never felt so cold or alone in her life. Southworth had asked her to turn her back on the man she loved. He\u2019d asked that she leave and do it in such a way that he wouldn\u2019t follow. He\u2019d asked that she bear her child alone.</p><p>When they got to the Manning home, James parked his car on the street and turned to Summer. He studied her for an intense moment. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered in return. She felt close to tears.</p><p>James helped her out of the car. They walked to the front porch, and he rang the doorbell. When she wasn\u2019t looking, he stole a kiss.</p><p>A distinguished older gentleman opened the door for them. \u201cJames! It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, this is my wife, Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Summer.\u201d Instead of shaking her hand, Eric Manning hugged her.</p><p>They stepped inside, and all at once, from behind every conceivable hiding space, people leapt out.</p><p>They were greeted with an unanimous chorus of \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t understand what was happening. A large number of strange people surrounded her. People with happy faces, people who seemed delighted to be meeting her.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d James protested. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>The middle-aged woman hugged first James and then Summer. \u201cYou know how much I love a party,\u201d she told him, grinning broadly. \u201cWhat better excuse than to meet your wife? I\u2019m the mother of this brood,\u201d she told Summer proudly, gesturing around the room. There were men, women and children milling about. \u201cYou must be Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You must be Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I am.\u201d</p><p>Before she could protest, Summer was lured away from James\u2019s side. The men appeared eager to talk to James by himself. Summer looked longingly at her husband. He met her eyes, then shrugged and followed his friends into the family room.</p><p>Soon Summer found herself in the kitchen, which bustled with activity. \u201cI\u2019m Jamie. We met the other day in the restaurant,\u201d Rich\u2019s wife reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Summer told her, stepping aside as a youngster raced past her at breakneck speed.</p><p>\u201cThese two women with the curious looks on their faces are my sisters-in-law. The first one here,\u201d Jamie said, looping her arm around the woman who was obviously pregnant, \u201cis Charlotte. She\u2019s married to Jason. He\u2019s the slob of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s improving,\u201d Charlotte told her.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your baby due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cThis is our second. Doug\u2019s asleep. I also have a daughter from my first marriage, but Carrie\u2019s working and couldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a chance to meet her later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur baby\u2019s due in September,\u201d Summer said, ending speculation.</p><p>The women exchanged glances. \u201cYou\u2019re just three months pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Miserable, Summer nodded. \u201cI think something must be wrong. The first couple of months I was really sick. I\u2019m much better now that I\u2019m in Seattle with James. But I\u2019m ballooning. Hardly any of my clothes fit anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens like that sometimes,\u201d Elizabeth said with the voice of experience. \u201cI wonder...\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cI showed far more with Paul, my first, than I did with Christy, my youngest. Don\u2019t ask me why nature plays these silly tricks on us. You\u2019d think we have enough to put up with, dealing with men.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of agreement broke out.</p><p>Elizabeth took the hors d\u2019oeuvre platter out of the refrigerator. \u201cThe good news is I was blessed with three sons. The bad news is I was blessed with three sons.\u201d She laughed. \u201cMy daughters are an entirely different story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect with this baby,\u201d Summer told everyone, pressing her hand to her stomach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan to get pregnant so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet James is thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled and nodded. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Leah,\u201d Jamie said, introducing her other sister-in-law, who\u2019d just entered the kitchen. \u201cShe\u2019s Paul\u2019s wife. Paul\u2019s the author in the family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good,\u201d Leah said proudly. \u201cHis first book was published last year, and he\u2019s sold two more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d Jamie insisted, removing the platter from Elizabeth\u2019s hands. She carried it to the long table, beautifully decorated with paper bells and a lovely ceramic bride-and-groom centerpiece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a long time to use these decorations,\u201d Elizabeth said disparagingly. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t give me the opportunity. It all started with the girls. Neither one of them saw fit to have a church wedding. Then Rich married Jamie and Paul married Leah, again without the kind of wedding I always wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason and Charlotte were the only ones to have a big wedding,\u201d Leah explained. \u201cI don\u2019t think Eric and Elizabeth have ever forgiven the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re darn right, we haven\u2019t,\u201d Eric said, joining them.</p><p>\u201cThey made it up to us with grandchildren, dear,\u201d his wife interjected. \u201cNow, don\u2019t get started on that. We\u2019re very fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d sat down at a dinner table with this many people. A rowdy group of children ate at card tables set up in the kitchen. Twin boys seemed to instigate the chaos, taking delight in teasing their younger cousins. The noise level was considerable, but Summer didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>More than once, she caught James watching her. She smiled and silently conveyed that she was enjoying herself. Who wouldn\u2019t be?</p><p>There were gifts to open after the meal and plenty of marital advice. Summer, whose mood had been bleak earlier, found herself laughing so hard her sides ached.</p><p>The evening was an unqualified success, and afterward Summer felt as if she\u2019d met a houseful of new friends. Jamie, Leah and Charlotte seemed eager to make her feel welcome. Charlotte was the first to extend an invitation for lunch. Since they were both pregnant, they already had something important in common.</p> <p>\u201cA week from Friday,\u201d Charlotte reminded her as Summer and James prepared to leave. She mentioned the name of the restaurant and wrote her phone number on the back of a business card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d Summer told her and meant it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were home that she remembered her meeting with Southworth. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be in Seattle in another week, let alone available for lunch.</p><p>Sadness pressed against her heart.</p><p>James slipped his arm around her waist. He turned off the downstairs lights, and together they moved toward the stairs. \u201cAs I recall,\u201d he whispered in her ear, \u201cyou made me a promise earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to make love to you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...\u201d Shivers of awareness slid up and down her spine.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly hope you intend to keep that promise.\u201d</p><p>She yawned loudly, covering her mouth, fighting back waves of tiredness. \u201cI have no intention of changing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d They reached the top of the stairs, and he nuzzled her neck. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019ll always be like this,\u201d he murmured, steering her toward their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy desire for you. I feel like a kid in a candy store.\u201d</p><p>Summer laughed, then yawned again. \u201cI enjoyed meeting the Mannings. They\u2019re wonderful people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those yawns telling me something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m tired, James.\u201d But it was more than being physically weary. She felt a mental and emotional exhaustion that left her depleted.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love,\u201d James urged gently. He led her into the bedroom and between long, deep kisses, he undressed her and placed her on the bed. He tucked her in and kissed her cheek.</p><p>The light dimmed, and Summer snuggled into the warmth. It took her a few minutes to realize James hadn\u2019t joined her.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d She forced her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m taking a shower first.\u201d</p><p>A shower, she mused, wondering at his sudden penchant for cleanliness.</p><p>Then she heard him mutter, \u201cA nice, long, cold shower.\u201d</p><p>James had been looking forward to the ultrasound appointment for weeks. He\u2019d met Dr. Wise, Summer\u2019s obstetrician, earlier and had immediately liked and trusted the man, who was in his late forties. David Wise had been delivering babies for more than twenty years, and his calm reassurance had gone a long way toward relieving James\u2019s fears.</p><p>The ultrasound clinic was in the same medical building as Dr. Wise\u2019s office. He\u2019d said he\u2019d join them there, although James wasn\u2019t convinced that was his regular policy. Still, he felt grateful.</p><p>Summer sat next to him in the waiting room, her face pale and lifeless. She hadn\u2019t been herself in the past few days, and James wondered what was bothering her. He didn\u2019t want to pry and hoped she\u2019d soon share whatever it was.</p><p>They held hands and waited silently until Summer\u2019s name was called.</p><p>It was all James could do to sit still as the technician, a young woman named Rachel, explained the procedure.</p><p>Summer was instructed to lie flat on her back on the examining table. Her T-shirt was raised to expose the bump that was their child. As James smiled down on her Dr. Wise entered the room.</p><p>A gel was spread across Summer\u2019s abdomen. It must have been cold because she flinched.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about this time that women start to suggest the male of the species should be responsible for childbearing,\u201d Dr. Wise told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d James said, \u201cI like my role in all this just fine.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Wise chuckled. Rachel pressed a stethoscope-like instrument across Summer\u2019s stomach, and everyone\u2019s attention turned toward the monitor.</p><p>James squinted but had trouble making out the details on the screen.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the baby\u2019s head,\u201d Dr. Wise said, pointing to a curved shape.</p><p>James squinted again and he noticed Summer doing the same.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. Look at this,\u201d the physician continued. \u201cI\u2019m not altogether surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at what?\u201d James studied the screen intently.</p><p>\u201cWe have a second little head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy baby has two heads?\u201d Summer cried in alarm.</p><p>\u201cTwo heads?\u201d James echoed.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying,\u201d Dr. Wise returned calmly, \u201cis that there appear to be two babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly seems that way.\u201d As the ultrasound technician moved the instrument across Summer\u2019s abdomen, Dr. Wise pointed to the monitor. \u201cHere\u2019s the first head,\u201d he said, tracing the barely discernible round curve, \u201cand here\u2019s the second.\u201d</p><p>James squinted for all he was worth just to see one. \u201cTwins,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat explains a lot,\u201d Dr. Wise said, patting Summer\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s run a copy of this for you both,\u201d he said, and Rachel pushed a series of buttons.</p><p>Within minutes they had the printout to examine for themselves. While Summer dressed, James studied the picture.</p><p>\u201cTwins,\u201d he said again, just for the pleasure of hearing himself say it. He turned to Summer and smiled broadly. \u201cTwins,\u201d he repeated, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>She smiled, and James thought he saw tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d he said, then immediately regretted his lack of sensitivity. He wasn\u2019t the one carrying two babies, nor would he be the one delivering them. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to help,\u201d he quickly reassured her.</p><p>She gave him a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the day I married you, I\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d He couldn\u2019t seem to stop smiling. \u201cI can hardly wait to tell my father. He\u2019s going to be absolutely thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Summer stared at the ultrasound. \u201cCan you tell? Boys? Girls? One of each?\u201d Strangely, perhaps, it hadn\u2019t occurred to her to ask Dr. Wise.</p><p>James scratched his head. \u201cI had enough trouble finding the two heads. I decided not to try deciphering anything else.\u201d</p><p>They left the doctor\u2019s office and headed for the parking garage across the street.</p><p>\u201cThis calls for a celebration. I\u2019ll take you to lunch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of a nap.\u201d</p><p>James grinned and looked at his watch. \u201cIs there time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said, laughing softly. \u201cI meant a real nap. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Disappointment shot through him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to celebrate with a fancy lunch?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset with me. I guess I need time to think about everything.\u201d</p><p>That sounded odd to James. What was there to think about? True, Summer was pregnant with twins, but they had plenty of time to prepare. As for any mental readjustment, well, he\u2019d made that in all of two seconds. The twins were a surprise, yes, but a pleasant one.</p><p>\u201cThis news has upset you, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she was quick to assure him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...well, it changes things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again and didn\u2019t answer. James frowned, not knowing how to calm her fears or allay her doubts. She didn\u2019t seem to expect him to do either and instead appeared to be withdrawing into herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I tell my dad, do you?\u201d he asked. If he didn\u2019t share the news with someone soon, he was afraid he\u2019d be reduced to stopping strangers on the street.</p><p>She smiled at him, her eyes alight with love. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind if you tell Walter.\u201d</p><p>He walked her to where she\u2019d parked and kissed her, then walked the short distance back to the King County Courthouse. His thoughts were so full of Summer that he went a block too far before he realized what he\u2019d done.</p><p>In his office, the first thing he did was reach for the phone.</p><p>His father answered immediately. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he told Walter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll never guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday was Summer\u2019s ultrasound,\u201d James reminded him. Hiding his excitement was almost impossible.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, and what did you learn?\u201d</p><p>James could hear the eagerness in Walter\u2019s voice. \u201cI have the picture in front of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staring at your grandchildren right this second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>James couldn\u2019t help it. He laughed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t listen very well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, too, and I want to know\u2014what do we have? A boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be one of each,\u201d James informed him calmly.</p><p>\u201cTwins!\u201d Walter shouted. \u201cYou mean Summer\u2019s having twins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be! This is good news. No, it\u2019s great news. The best!\u201d</p> <p>James had never heard Walter this excited\u2014practically as excited as he was himself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t every day that a man learned he was having not one baby but two!</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t go directly home. Instead, she drove around for at least an hour, evaluating the situation between her and James. She loved him so much. The thought of leaving him, even when she knew it was the best thing for his career, brought her to the verge of tears.</p><p>What she wanted was to talk with her mother, but her parents were vacationing, touring the south in their motor home. They weren\u2019t due back for another month. Summer received postcards every few days with the latest updates and many exhortations to look after herself and their unborn grandchild. Wait till she told them it was grandchildren, she thought with a brief smile.</p><p>This vacation was good for them, but she really needed her mother now.</p><p>Without realizing she knew the way, Summer drove to the Manning family home. She parked, wondering whether she was doing the right thing.</p> <p>It took her a full five minutes to gather up enough nerve to get out of the car, walk up the steps and ring the bell.</p><p>Elizabeth Manning answered the door. Her face lit up with warmth. \u201cSummer! What a lovely surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I haven\u2019t come at an inconvenient time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Elizabeth said, ushering her in. \u201cI was making meatballs. It\u2019s Eric\u2019s favorite. Today\u2019s his bowling day, so he\u2019s out just now. Can I get you a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth sat down in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if we talked in the kitchen?\u201d Summer asked after an awkward moment.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...I\u2019m aware that you barely know me, and it\u2019s an imposition for me to drop in like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m delighted to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...my parents have a motor home,\u201d Summer said, wishing now she\u2019d thought this through more carefully before she approached James\u2019s friends. \u201cThey\u2019re traveling across the south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric and I do quite a bit of traveling in our own motor home. We visit Christy and her sister, Taylor, at least once a year. Montana\u2019s become like a second home to us.\u201d She dug her hands into the bowl of hamburger and removed a glob of meat. Expertly she formed it into a perfect round shape.</p><p>\u201cI really just wanted to thank you for everything you did the other night,\u201d Summer said. \u201cThe party for James and me...\u201d</p><p>She suddenly decided she couldn\u2019t burden this woman with her troubles. She would\u2019ve welcomed advice, but felt uncomfortable discussing her problems with someone who was little more than a stranger to her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you know me better,\u201d Elizabeth was saying, \u201cyou\u2019ll learn that I love throwing parties. James has always been a special friend to our family, and we were so happy to find out about his marriage. Naturally we wanted to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to love anyone so much,\u201d she confessed, and then because tears began to drip from her eyes, she stood abruptly. \u201cListen, I should go, but thank you. I\u2019ll see myself to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d Elizabeth called after her. \u201cSummer, is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Summer was in her car by the time Elizabeth appeared in the doorway. She hurriedly started the engine and drove off, sure that she\u2019d done more harm than good with her impromptu visit.</p><p>Wiping away tears, Summer went home. She walked into the house and up the stairs, then lay down on the bed and closed her eyes.</p><p>She had to leave, but she didn\u2019t know where to go. If she didn\u2019t do it soon, she\u2019d never find the courage. Only minutes earlier, she\u2019d declared to James\u2019s family friend how deeply she loved her husband. That was the truth, so doing what was best for him shouldn\u2019t be this difficult.</p><p>But it was.</p><p>Sobbing and miserable, Summer got up from the bed and pulled a big suitcase from the closet. She packed what she thought she\u2019d need and carried it down to the car.</p><p>At the last minute she decided she couldn\u2019t leave without writing James. She sat at his desk for several minutes, trying to compose a letter that would explain what she was doing and why. But it was all so complicated, and in the end she simply said he was better off without her and signed her name. She read it twice before tucking it in an envelope.</p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad, or so she attempted to convince herself. The babies would be less than two months old when the election was over, and then she\u2019d be free to return.</p><p>If James wanted her back.</p><p>James had seldom been in a better mood. He sat in the courtroom, convinced he must be grinning like a fool.</p><p>His assistant didn\u2019t know what to think. During a brief recess, he waltzed back to his office to phone Summer, whistling as he went.</p><p>His wife might not have wanted to celebrate with lunch, but their news deserved some kind of festivity. Dinner at the Space Needle. A night on the town.</p><p>While he was in his office, he ordered flowers for Summer with a card that said she\u2019d made him the happiest man alive. Twice. He wondered what the florist would make of that.</p><p>The phone rang four times before voice mail kicked in. James hung up rather than leave a message. He\u2019d try again later. Summer was probably resting; he hoped the phone hadn\u2019t disturbed her.</p><p>\u201cJudge Wilkens?\u201d Mrs. Jamison, his assistant, stopped him as he was leaving his office.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father phoned earlier. He wanted me to let you know he\u2019s been to the toy store and purchased two giant teddy bears. He also asked me to tell you he\u2019ll be dropping them off around six this evening. And he said he made dinner reservations in case you hadn\u2019t thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d James laughed and discovered his assistant staring at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cSee this,\u201d James said, taking the ultrasound picture from inside his suit pocket. \u201cMy wife and I just learned we\u2019re having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife? Twins for you and Summer. Why, Your Honor...\u201d Her mouth opened, then shut, but she recovered quickly. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d James said. Then, checking his watch, he returned to the courtroom.</p><p>The afternoon was hectic. James was hearing the sad case of a man who, crazed with drugs and alcohol, had gone on a shooting rampage. He\u2019d killed three people and injured seventeen more. The case was just getting underway but was sure to attract a lot of media attention. James knew the defense was hinging its case on a plea of temporary insanity.</p><p>A door opened at the rear of the courtroom. James didn\u2019t look up, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw a lone figure slip into the back row. Whoever it was apparently didn\u2019t want to be recognized. She wore a scarf and large sunglasses.</p><p>Twice more James found his gaze returning to the figure in the back of the courtroom. If he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think it was Summer.</p><p>Whoever it was stayed for quite a long time. An hour or more. He wasn\u2019t sure when the woman left, but James couldn\u2019t help being curious.</p><p>His best guess was that the woman was a reporter.</p><p>When he was finished for the afternoon, James returned to his office and removed his robe. His secretary brought in a stack of phone messages. The one that seemed most peculiar was from Elizabeth Manning. She\u2019d never called him at court.</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, he reached for the phone. \u201cHello, Elizabeth,\u201d he said cheerfully. It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her his and Summer\u2019s good news, but she cut him off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve been worried sick all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Summer.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes she baffled him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019re talking about. I will tell you that Summer and I were at the doctor\u2019s this morning and found out she\u2019s pregnant with twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d But Elizabeth seemed distracted. \u201cThat can\u2019t be it,\u201d she mulled aloud. \u201cShe was here, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Listen to me, James, there\u2019s something wrong. I knew it the minute I saw that girl. She was upset and close to tears. At first I thought you two might\u2019ve had an argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d James frowned. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe talked about her parents traveling in their motor home. I suppose I should\u2019ve realized she wanted to discuss something with me, but I started chattering, hoping she\u2019d relax enough to speak her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the part about her parents\u2019 vacation, she said she\u2019d come to thank me for the party, which we both knew was an excuse. Then she apparently changed her mind about talking with me and started to cry. Before I could stop her, she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone? What do you mean gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl literally ran out of the house. I tried to catch up with her, but with my bad leg, that was impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drove off without another word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Elizabeth sounded flustered. \u201cWhat could be wrong, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know. She was fine this morning.\u201d Or was she? James had no idea anymore. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call this evening,\u201d he assured Elizabeth. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Summer was very upset, James. Oh. That\u2019s odd....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember something else she said, and it was after this that she started to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d James asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cShe told me how much she loved you.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, when he\u2019d finished speaking to Elizabeth, James was more confused than ever. He tried calling Summer again\u2014but again there was no answer. He left the office abruptly, without a word to his staff.</p><p>When he got to the house he burst through the front door. \u201cSummer!\u201d he shouted, his heart racing.</p><p>He was greeted with silence.</p><p>He raced up the stairs, taking them two at a time. He searched every room but couldn\u2019t find her.</p><p>What confused him further was that her clothes still hung in her closet, but one suitcase was missing. Surely if she was planning to leave him, she\u2019d have taken more things. The only items that seemed to be missing were her toothbrush, slippers and a book about pregnancy and birth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Baffled, he wandered back downstairs. He scouted out the kitchen and the other rooms. The last place he looked was in his den. There he found an envelope propped against the base of the lamp.</p><p>James tore open the letter. It was brief and it made no sense. All he understood was that she\u2019d left him. He had no idea why, other than that she seemed to think she was doing what was best for him.</p><p>He immediately called her cell. No answer.</p><p>A sick feeling attacked his stomach. He sat numbly at his desk for what could\u2019ve been minutes or hours; he\u2019d lost track of time. The next thing he knew, the doorbell chimed. He didn\u2019t get up to answer. A moment later the door opened on its own and his father came into the house.</p> <p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve let me in,\u201d he grumbled, setting one huge teddy bear in the chair across from James. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He returned a couple of minutes later with the second bear.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d James asked, his voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a key, remember?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on around here?\u201d Walter asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter-in-law who\u2019s giving me twin grandkids?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently Summer has decided to leave me. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Walter protested. \u201cWhat do you mean, gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone, Dad,\u201d James said bitterly, \u201cas in packed-a-suitcase-and-walked-out-the-door gone.\u201d</p><p>His father quickly sat down. \u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>James couldn\u2019t answer that; silently he handed Walter the brief letter Summer had left him.</p> <p>Walter read it, then raised questioning eyes to James. \u201cWhat\u2019s this supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve said something,\u201d Walter insisted. \u201cThink, boy, think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but think, and none of this makes sense. I thought at first that she was upset about the twins. I realize now that whatever it is has been worrying her for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you didn\u2019t ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Walter glared at him in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing I learned after I married your mother. She never told me a thing that I didn\u2019t have to pry out of her with a crowbar. It\u2019s a man\u2019s duty, a husband\u2019s lot in life. When you didn\u2019t ask, Summer must\u2019ve assumed you didn\u2019t care. She probably figures you don\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>In spite of his heavy heart, James smiled. \u201cTrust me, Dad, Summer has no fear of speaking her mind, and as for my loving her, she couldn\u2019t have doubted that for an instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you.\u201d Walter\u2019s words were more statement than question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d James said. He felt secure in her love. Or he had until now.</p><p>\u201cWhere would she go?\u201d</p><p>This was the same question he\u2019d been debating from the moment he discovered her letter. He shrugged. \u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried her cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe turned it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you contact her parents?\u201d</p><p>He would have, but it wouldn\u2019t help. James rubbed his face, tired to the very marrow of his bones. \u201cThey\u2019re traveling across the Southwest in their motor home. Half the time they don\u2019t have cell phone coverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about friends she\u2019s made since the move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re more acquaintances than friends. She\u2019s planning to volunteer at the library, but she\u2019s only mentioned the children\u2019s librarian in passing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Walter frowned. \u201cWhat about the Mannings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went over to talk to Elizabeth earlier this afternoon. Elizabeth phoned me and said Summer started to cry and then left in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Walter\u2019s look was thoughtful. \u201cSounds as if she was trying to reach out for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only other person I can think of is her former roommate, Julie. I\u2019ll call her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie, of course,\u201d his father said as if he should\u2019ve thought of her himself.</p><p>James looked up the number and spoke to Julie\u2019s new roommate for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cJulie\u2019s contract with Disney was up at the same time as Summer\u2019s,\u201d he said as he hung up. \u201cNow that I think about it, Summer did say something about Julie being on tour with a musical group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019d be staying in hotels. Unlikely Summer would go to her.\u201d</p><p>James closed his eyes. His wife had walked out on him into a cold, friendless world.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her brother?\u201d</p><p>After another quick call, James shook his head. \u201cAdam and Denise haven\u2019t heard from her. All I did was scare them,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cDid you check the airlines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would she go?\u201d James asked, losing his patience.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Walter admitted reluctantly. He began pacing.</p><p>His movements soon irritated James. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, will you kindly sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can and you will,\u201d James insisted, making a decision. \u201cI\u2019ll take the car and drive around, see if I can find her. You stay here by the phone in case she calls or we hear something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Check in with me every half hour.\u201d</p><p>James nodded. As he climbed into the car, he felt as if he was setting out on a journey without a map. Essentially he was, he thought as he drove through the narrow neighborhood streets. Try as he might, he couldn\u2019t figure out where she\u2019d go. He tried to put himself in her shoes. Alone in a strange city with few friends.</p><p>The only thing he could do was ask God to guide him.</p><p>The wind blew off Puget Sound and buffeted Summer as she stood at the end of the pier. The waterfront was one of her favorite places in all of Seattle. Not knowing where else to instruct the taxi to take her, she\u2019d had the driver bring her here.</p><p>She loved to shop at the Pike Place Market. Every Saturday morning James came down to the waterfront with her, and they bought fresh fruit and vegetables for the week. He\u2019d been wonderfully patient while she browsed in the tourist shops that stretched along the waterfront. Some of their happiest moments in Seattle had been spent on this very pier.</p><p>How she hated to leave this city. It was as if everything in her was fighting to keep her in Seattle. Her husband was here, her home, her very life.</p><p>The instant she\u2019d walked into James\u2019s large house, she\u2019d experienced a powerful sense of homecoming. She\u2019d never said anything to her husband\u2014he might think her reaction was silly\u2014but Summer felt that his house had always been meant for them together.</p><p>She\u2019d like to think that somewhere in James\u2019s subconscious he\u2019d known he was going to fall in love and marry. The house had been his preparation for her entry into his life.</p><p>Tears blinded her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to focus on her unhappiness, so she turned her attention to the water. The pull of the tide fascinated her. The dark, murky waters of Elliott Bay glistened in the lights overhead. A green-and-white ferry chugged into the terminal.</p><p>Summer closed her eyes, willing herself to walk away. Except that she didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d go. One thing was certain; she couldn\u2019t spend the night standing at the end of the pier. She\u2019d need to find herself a hotel. In the morning her head would be clearer and she could make some decisions.</p><p>She was about to reach for her suitcase when she sensed someone approaching. Not wanting company, even the nonintrusive sort, Summer turned away from the railing. She kept her eyes lowered, but that didn\u2019t prevent her from recognizing James.</p><p>He sauntered to the railing several feet from where she stood. Wordlessly he stared into the distance.</p><p>Summer wasn\u2019t sure what she should do. She couldn\u2019t very well walk away from him now. It had been difficult enough the first time. She didn\u2019t have the strength to do it again.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d...how\u2019d you find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He continued to stare into the distance. \u201cLucky guess,\u201d he finally said in cool tones.</p><p>Summer doubted that James felt lucky being married to her just then. He was furious with her. More furious than she\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>She wanted to explain that she was a detriment to his career, but couldn\u2019t force the words through her parched throat.</p><p>The tears that had flowed most of the day returned. She brushed them away with her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWas I such a bad husband?\u201d he demanded in the same chilling tone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something so terrible you can\u2019t forgive me for?\u201d</p><p>Sobbing, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen out of love with me,\u201d he suggested next.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she cried. If she\u2019d loved him any more than she already did, her heart couldn\u2019t have stood it.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why you walked out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy letter...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...explained nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d She was trembling so much she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>James walked over to her and reached for her suitcase. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the house and we\u2019re going to talk about this. Then, if you\u2019re still set on leaving, I\u2019ll drive you to the airport myself. Understand?\u201d</p><p>All she could manage was a weak nod.</p><p>Thankfully, he\u2019d parked the car close by. Summer felt disoriented. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t be this happy that James had found her, but she was. Even if he was angry with her, she was grateful he was taking her home.</p><p>James opened the car door for her and set her suitcase in the backseat. He didn\u2019t speak so much as a single word on the drive home.</p><p>When they pulled into the driveway, Summer saw Walter\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>James didn\u2019t answer her. Nor did he need to. Walter was already out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you find her?\u201d he asked, bolting toward them.</p><p>\u201cThe waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d her father-in-law murmured, guiding Summer inside and into a chair. She felt she was about to collapse and must have looked it, too.</p><p>\u201cNow what the hell is this all about?\u201d James said roughly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to her like that,\u201d Walter chastised. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the poor girl\u2019s had the worst day of her life?\u201d He turned to Summer, smiling gently. \u201cNow what the hell is this all about?\u201d</p><p>Summer looked from one man to the other. \u201cWould it be all right if I spoke to James alone?\u201d she asked her father-in-law. She couldn\u2019t deal with both of them at the same time.</p><p>It looked for a moment as if Walter wasn\u2019t going to leave. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he agreed with reluctance. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the other room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalter,\u201d Summer said, stopping him on his way out the door. \u201cI take it the two teddy bears are your doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded sheepishly. \u201cThe car\u2019s loaded with goodies. I\u2019m afraid I got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese babies are going to love their grandpa.\u201d</p><p>Walter grinned, then walked out, closing the door.</p><p>James stood by the fireplace, his back to her. Summer suspected he was preparing a list of questions. She wasn\u2019t even sure she had all the answers; she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted him to ask them. She decided to preempt his interrogation.</p> <p>\u201cI...I went to see Ralph Southworth,\u201d she said in a quavering voice.</p><p>James whirled around. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I overheard you and your father talking not long ago and I learned that Southworth resigned as your campaign manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d James said thoughtfully. His eyes hardened. \u201cWhat happened between the two of us had nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, please, I know otherwise. I...I knew from the start that Ralph disapproved of me. I\u2019m not sure why, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. Because Southworth doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t believe that. \u201cAfterward, it seemed like you\u2019d given up on the election. In the last two weeks you haven\u2019t made a single public appearance. When I ask, you don\u2019t want to talk about it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings you wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>James sat across from her and leaned forward, elbows on his knees. He didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to think?\u201d she cried when he didn\u2019t explain. \u201cBeing a judge is the most important thing in the world to you. You were born for this.... I couldn\u2019t take it away from you. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about something. Being a superior court judge means nothing if you\u2019re not with me. I guarantee you, my career\u2019s not worth losing my wife and family over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to come back,\u201d she whispered, her eyes lowered. \u201cAfter the election...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to say you were going to deliver our babies on your own? Do you honestly think I wouldn\u2019t have turned this city upside down looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t know what to think. Ralph said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even tell me.\u201d A muscle leapt in his jaw. \u201cI can well imagine what he said. The man\u2019s a world-class idiot. He saw you as a liability when you\u2019re my greatest asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you truly believe that, then why did you throw in the towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d he told her. \u201cI took a few days to think about it and decide who I\u2019ll ask to manage the rest of my campaign. It seems there are several people who want the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Southworth said he could sway the election for you.... He claims to have political clout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe seems to think he does,\u201d James said tightly.</p><p>\u201cWe made a deal,\u201d she whispered, lowering her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthworth agreed to manage your campaign if I left Seattle until after the election.\u201d</p><p>James snickered. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate you didn\u2019t check with me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Southworth anywhere near my campaign.\u201d</p><p>Summer bristled. \u201cYou might\u2019ve said that earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d James admitted slowly. \u201cBut I wanted everything squared away before I announced that I\u2019d changed campaign managers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who did you choose? Who\u2019s your new manager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric Manning. He\u2019s not only an old friend, he was a successful businessman and he\u2019s very well connected.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve asked him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, that\u2019s wonderful! I like him so much better than Ralph.\u201d</p><p>James reached for her hands and held them in his own. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t understand is that I wouldn\u2019t have taken Southworth back under any circumstances. First of all, I won\u2019t allow any man to talk about my wife the way he did. It\u2019s true I made some mistakes when we first got married. I blame myself for not publishing our wedding announcement immediately. Frankly, I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either. And remember, we were talking about an April ceremony back then.\u201d Summer wasn\u2019t willing to have him accept all the blame.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder that someone as beautiful and talented as you would choose to marry me. Ralph made it sound as if we should keep you under wraps until after the election, which is utterly ridiculous. I\u2019m angry with myself for not taking a stand sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the election?\u201d She didn\u2019t care to hear any more about Southworth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that in a minute. When Southworth said he questioned my judgment, I realized what a fool I\u2019d been to listen to the man for even a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish, sweetheart. The best thing I ever did in my life was marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was impulsive and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cI don\u2019t need Southworth to win this campaign for me. He had me convinced I did, but I know otherwise now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his political friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a laugh. A man as narrow-minded and self-righteous as Ralph Southworth can\u2019t afford the luxury of friends. He has none, but he doesn\u2019t seem to know it. If he hadn\u2019t decided to leave my campaign, I would\u2019ve asked him to resign.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing Summer was sitting down. \u201cYou mean to say I went through all that grief and left you for nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>James gathered her in his arms. \u201cSummer, whatever I am, whatever I may become, I\u2019m nothing without you.\u201d</p><p>Summer sobbed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWinning the election would be an empty victory if you weren\u2019t standing at my side. I want you to share that moment with me. I love you, Summer, and I love our babies, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James, I\u2019ve been so unhappy. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me again. It was like I\u2019d lost my mind, my heart\u2014everything\u2014until I saw you standing at the end of that pier.\u201d</p><p>Summer tightened her arms around him.</p><p>Walter tapped on the door. \u201cCan I come in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James growled.</p><p>\u201cSo have you two settled your differences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Summer called out.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave you to your reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Dad,\u201d James said in what was an obvious hint for his father to leave.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, kids. Kiss and make up, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot more than kiss,\u201d James whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises, promises,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou can bet I\u2019ll make good on these.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cThis is my wife, Summer,\u201d James said, his arm around her thick waist. Although she was only six months pregnant, she looked closer to nine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to meet you,\u201d the older woman said.</p><p>\u201cWho was that again?\u201d she whispered to James.</p><p>\u201cEmily Rohrbaugh, president of the League of Women Voters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I don\u2019t know how you remember all these names. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more impressed that you can remember all your lines in Beauty and the Beast,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s my little trick for recalling names. I try to tie them in with something else,\u201d James told her. \u201cSome kind of object or action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRohrbaugh is something of a challenge, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Summer raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cRoar and baa,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cThink of a lion and a lamb. A lion roars and a lamb goes baa. Rohrbaugh.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s face lit up with a bright smile. \u201cNo wonder I married you. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you won\u2019t have a problem remembering Emily the next time you meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good friend of Elizabeth Manning\u2019s,\u201d James said, feeding his wife a seedless grape. It was a test of his restraint not to kiss her afterward. One would assume his desire for her would fade after all these months; if anything, quite the opposite had occurred. She was never more beautiful to him than now, heavy with their children.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Manning?\u201d Summer repeated. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be the political type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t,\u201d James said. They mingled with the crowd gathered on the patio of an influential member of the state senate. \u201cBut the two of them have been friends since high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to sit for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she groaned. \u201cStop worrying about me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her abdomen. \u201cHow are Mutt and Jeff?\u201d</p><p>She circled her belly with both hands. \u201cI swear these two are going to be world-class soccer players.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled, reaching for an hors d\u2019oeuvre from one of the several platters set around the sunny patio. He gave it to Summer.</p><p>\u201cJames, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve met your wife.\u201d</p><p>James recognized the voice\u2014William Carr, the president of the Bar Association. He quickly made the introductions. He never worried about Summer saying the wrong thing or inadvertently embarrassing him. She had a natural way about her that instantly put people at ease. She was charming and open and genuine. These political functions weren\u2019t her idea of a good time, but she never complained. She seemed eager to do whatever she could to aid his campaign and had proved to be the asset he knew she would be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you,\u201d she said warmly as they exchanged handshakes.</p><p>The obvious topic of conversation was Summer\u2019s pregnancy, which they discussed but only briefly. She managed to deftly turn the conversation away from herself, and soon Carr was talking about himself, laughing over the early days when his wife was pregnant with their oldest child.</p><p>After ten minutes or so, Summer excused herself.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an excellent conversationalist,\u201d William Carr commented as she walked away.</p><p>James did his best to hide a smile. It amused him that Carr could do most of the talking and then act as if Summer had been the one carrying the discussion.</p><p>\u201cIt seems strange to think of you as married,\u201d the attorney said next.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with Summer, I wonder why I ever waited so long.\u201d</p><p>Carr shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cIf I\u2019d given you advice before you were appointed to the court, it would\u2019ve been to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d This came as a shock to James.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fine young man, and I expect great things from you. Just between you, me and the fence post, I think you\u2019re doing an excellent job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d James said, but there were some who weren\u2019t as confident as William Carr. Generally those under the influence of Ralph Southworth. To James\u2019s surprise, Southworth had managed to prejudice several supporters against him.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of myself thirty years back,\u201d Carr told him.</p><p>James considered this high praise. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you needed a little softening around the edges. You came off as strong and unbending. Not a bad thing for a judge, mind you, but being a little more human wouldn\u2019t have hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d James didn\u2019t like hearing this but knew it was for his own good, however uncomfortable it might be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to sit in judgment of others when you live in an ivory tower.\u201d</p><p>James frowned uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you married Summer, your life was a bit...sterile. Protected. If you don\u2019t mind my saying so...A married man knows how to compromise. I imagine you\u2019ve done things to make your wife happy that you wouldn\u2019t normally do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIn my opinion, marriage matures a man. It helps him sympathize and identify with his fellow humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me I was a stodgy stuffed shirt before I married Summer?\u201d James asked outright.</p><p>William Carr seemed taken aback by his directness, then grinned. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d James reached for a tiny crab puff.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I wanted to congratulate you on a job well done. That multiple homicide was your first murder trial, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d To be honest, he was happy it was over. The ordeal had proved to be exhausting for everyone involved. The jury had found the young man guilty, and after careful deliberation, James had pronounced the sentence.</p> <p>His name and face had appeared on television screens every night for weeks. It went without saying that a lot of people were watching and waiting to see how he\u2019d rule. Liberals were looking for leniency, and hard-liners wanted the death penalty. James had agonized over the sentence.</p><p>There were more victims than the ones who were shot during those hours of madness. Three families had lost loved ones. Seventeen others would always carry the mark of a madman\u2019s gun. Innocent lives had been forever changed.</p><p>James had delivered a sentence he felt was fair. He didn\u2019t try to satisfy any political factions, although the outcome of the election could well rest on his judgment. He\u2019d sentenced the killer to life without the possibility of parole, with mandatory psychiatric treatment.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been impossible to keep everyone happy, so his decision had been based on what he considered equitable for all concerned. Some were pleased, he knew, and others were outraged.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d James said, \u201cI appreciate your vote of confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe decisions won\u2019t get any easier,\u201d William Carr told him. The older man grabbed a stuffed green olive and popped it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe bar will be taking their opinion poll about the time your wife\u2019s due to have those babies of yours.\u201d</p><p>James knew that whether or not the results were published was at the discretion of the bar. The vote could sway the November election.</p> <p>Summer returned just then, looking tired. Despite her smile, William Carr seemed to realize this. He wished them his best and drifted away.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201d His mistake was in asking her; he should\u2019ve known to expect an argument.</p><p>He made their excuses, thanked the host and hostess and urged Summer toward their parked car. Her progress was slow, and he knew she was uncomfortable, especially in the heat.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte\u2019s due in two weeks,\u201d she said when he helped her inside. She sighed as she eased into the seat. The seat belt barely stretched all the way around her.</p><p>James paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that comment about Charlotte about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envy her. Look at me, James!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking at you,\u201d he said, and planted a kiss on her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better, because it wouldn\u2019t take much to convince me to prove it right here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being honest.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and he couldn\u2019t resist kissing her a second time.</p><p>After they got home, Summer sat outside in the sunshine. She propped her feet on a stool, and her hands rested on her stomach.</p><p>James brought her a glass of iced tea.</p><p>She smiled her appreciation. \u201cYou spoil me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I enjoy it.\u201d He sat down next to her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve thought about packing up and leaving me lately?\u201d</p><p>Summer giggled. \u201cOnce or twice, but by the time I finished dragging out my suitcases, I was too tired to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of suitcases, do you have one ready for the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we being a little premature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what Mutt and Jeff are thinking.\u201d James\u2019s hand joined hers. It thrilled him to feel his children move inside her. \u201cAnd this time you might want to take more than your toothbrush, a book and your bedroom slippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes to show you the mental state I was in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again,\u201d James said firmly.</p><p>Summer propped her head against his shoulder and sighed. \u201cNever again,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>The day of the September primary, Summer woke feeling sluggish and out of sorts. Getting out of bed was a task of monumental proportions. She felt as if she needed a forklift.</p><p>James was already up and shaved. He\u2019d been watching her carefully all week. To everyone\u2019s surprise, including her doctor\u2019s, Summer hadn\u2019t delivered the twins yet. She\u2019d read that twins were often born early. But not Mutt and Jeff, as they\u2019d been affectionately named by James.</p><p>\u201cMost babies aren\u2019t born on their due dates, so stop looking so worried. This is your day.\u201d She sat on the edge of the bed and pressed her hand to the small of her back.</p><p>James offered her his arm to help her upright. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d The pain at the base of her spine had kept her awake most of the night. It didn\u2019t seem to go away, no matter how often she changed her position.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we voting?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing this morning,\u201d James told her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that good?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cDo you think today\u2019s the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, stop! I\u2019m in perfect health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone nine months pregnant with twins, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Summer swore that somehow, God willing, she\u2019d make it through this day. James was so tender and endearing, but she didn\u2019t want him worrying about her during the primary.</p><p>They gathered, together with Walter, at the large Manning home for the election results that evening. Summer was pleased for the opportunity to be with her friends.</p><p>Jason and Charlotte, along with their toddler and infant daughter, Ann Marie, were among the first to arrive. Many of the friends who\u2019d worked so hard on James\u2019s campaign showed up soon after, shortly before the first election results were announced.</p><p>Summer planted herself in a chair in the family room and didn\u2019t move for an hour. The ache in her back had intensified.</p><p>Feeling the need to move about, she made her way into the kitchen. She was standing in front of the sink when it happened. Her eyes widened as she felt a sharp, stabbing pain.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she cried in panic, gripping the counter. Water gushed from between her legs and onto the floor. \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d James stood in the doorway, along with at least ten others, including Elizabeth Manning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, looking at James. \u201cBut I think it might be time to take me to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She saw her husband turn and stare longingly at the election results being flashed across the screen. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cJames...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The pain that had been concentrated in the small of her back had worked its way around her middle. Summer held her stomach and closed her eyes, surprised by the intensity of it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d James demanded, \u201cfor what?\u201d He moved quickly and placed his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get her to the hospital,\u201d Elizabeth advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone the doctor for you,\u201d Eric added.</p><p>James shouted out the number he\u2019d memorized, and five or six Mannings chanted it until Eric found a pad and pen to write it down.</p><p>Summer felt as if everyone wanted to play a role in the birth of their twins.</p><p>\u201cToss me the car keys, and I\u2019ll get the car as close to the front door as I can,\u201d Jason Manning shouted.</p><p>James threw him the keys, and Jason hurried out the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the election returns?\u201d Summer asked, gazing at the television.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them later,\u201d James said as if it meant nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave messages on your cell phone,\u201d Charlotte volunteered, \u201cand James can call us when he has an update on Summer and the babies.\u201d</p><p>Summer bit her lip at the approach of another contraction. It hurt, really hurt. \u201cJames.\u201d She squeezed his hand, needing him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, sweetheart. I won\u2019t leave you, not for anything.\u201d</p><p>Jason reappeared, and the small entourage headed for James\u2019s car. It was parked on the grass, close to the front door, the engine running.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said you should go directly to the hospital,\u201d Walter said breathlessly. \u201cHe\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Summer, this isn\u2019t his first set of twins,\u201d Elizabeth said in a reassuring voice.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but they\u2019re mine,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d Summer looked at her husband and noticed how pale he\u2019d suddenly become. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment; instead, he helped her inside the car and strapped her in. Before long he was sitting next to her, hands braced on the steering wheel. Summer saw the pulse in his neck pounding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feel a whole lot better once we get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall us,\u201d Charlotte shouted, standing on the steps, waving.</p><p>Summer waved back, and no fewer than fifteen adults crowded onto the Mannings\u2019 front porch, cheering them on.</p><p>\u201cJames, are you okay to drive?\u201d Summer asked when he took off at breakneck speed. He slowed down and stayed within the speed limit, but there was a leashed fear in him that was almost palpable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay once we get you to the hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe birthing process is perfectly natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is for a woman, but it isn\u2019t as easy for a man.\u201d</p><p>With her hands propped against her abdomen, Summer smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can bear to see you in pain,\u201d he said, wiping his face as they stopped for a red light.</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you saw the films in our birthing class. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d she said, and giggled.</p><p>James\u2019s fingers curled around her hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a laughing matter. I\u2019ve never been more frightened in my life. No, only once,\u201d he amended. \u201cThe night I came home and found you gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe babies and I are going to be just fine,\u201d she said again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, James, please. This is your night to shine. I\u2019m just sorry Mutt and Jeff chose right now to make their debut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, the election is the last thing on my mind. None of it matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to win the primary,\u201d she insisted. Summer knew the competition had been steep, and Ralph Southworth had done what damage he could, eager to prove himself right.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost at the hospital,\u201d James said, sounding relieved.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d she said, and as it turned out, her words were a reminder to herself. The next contraction hit with unexpected severity, and she drew in a deep breath trying to control the pain.</p><p>\u201cSummer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p> <p>James pulled into the emergency entrance at Virginia Mason Hospital and raced around the front of the car. He opened the door, unsnapped the seat belt and lovingly helped her out.</p><p>Someone rolled a wheelchair toward her, and while Summer sat and answered the questions in Admitting, James parked the car.</p><p>She was on the maternity floor when he rejoined her, looking pale and harried.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying,\u201d she scolded him.</p><p>James dragged a chair to the side of her bed and slumped into it. \u201cFeel my heart,\u201d he said and placed her hand over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like a machine gun,\u201d Summer said, smiling. She moved her hand to his face and cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI need you so much,\u201d James whispered.</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t speak due to a strong contraction. James clasped her hand and talked to her in soothing tones, urging her to relax. As the pain ebbed, she kept her eyes closed.</p> <p>When she opened them, she found James standing by the hospital bed, studying her. She smiled weakly and he smiled in return.</p><p>Dr. Wise arrived and read her chart, then asked, \u201cHow are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Summer assured him.</p><p>\u201cNot so good,\u201d James said contradicting her. \u201cI think Summer needs something for the pain, and frankly I\u2019m not feeling so well myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Summer told him yet again.</p><p>\u201cWhat your husband\u2019s saying is that he needs help to deal with seeing you in pain,\u201d the physician explained.</p><p>\u201cDo something, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Wise slapped James affectionately on the back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let Summer be the one to decide if she needs an epidural? She\u2019s a better judge than either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d But James\u2019s agreement came reluctantly.</p><p>For Summer the hours passed in a blur. Her labor was difficult, and she was sure she could never have endured it if not for James, who stood faithfully at her side. He encouraged her, lifted her spirits, rubbed her back, reassured her of his love.</p><p>News of the primary filtered into the room in messages from Charlotte and various nurses, who caught snippets on the waiting room TV. In the beginning Summer strained to hear each bit of information. But as the evening wore on, she became so consumed by what was happening to her and the babies that she barely heard.</p><p>She lost track of time, but it seemed to her that it was well into the wee hours of the morning when she was taken into the delivery room.</p><p>James briefly left her side and returned a few minutes later, gowned in surgical green. He resembled a prison escapee, and she took one look at him and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>James drew in a deep breath and held Summer\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she breathed softly. \u201cReady or not, we\u2019re about to become parents. I have the feeling this is going to be the ride of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been that way for me from the night I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d he repeated. \u201cNo way!\u201d Leaning over, he kissed her forehead. \u201cMy only regret is that I didn\u2019t marry you that first New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Wise joined them. \u201cWell, you two, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here, shall we?\u201d He grinned at James. \u201cCongratulations, Your Honor. You won the primary. This is obviously a night for good news.\u201d</p><p>Two months later Summer woke to the soft, mewling cry of her infant daughter. She climbed silently out of bed and made her way into their daughters\u2019 nursery.</p><p>There she found James sitting upright in the rocker, sound asleep with Kellie in his arms. Kerrie fussed in her crib.</p><p>Lifting the tiny bundle, Summer changed Kerrie\u2019s diaper, then sat in the rocker next to her husband and offered the hungry child her breast. Kerrie nursed eagerly and Summer ran her finger down the side of her baby\u2019s perfect face.</p><p>Her gaze wandered to her husband and she felt a surge of pride and love. The election had been that night, and he\u2019d won the court seat by a wide margin. During the heat of the last two weeks of the campaign, James had let her compose and sing a radio commercial for him. Summer had been proud of her small part in his success, although she didn\u2019t miss life on the stage. Her twin daughters kept her far too busy for regrets.</p><p>James must have felt her scrutiny because he stirred. He looked up and saw Summer with Kerrie.</p><p>\u201cI might as well feed Kellie, too,\u201d she said. Experience had taught her that the minute one was fed and asleep, the other would wake and demand to be nursed. Her twin daughters were identical in more than looks. Even their sleep patterns were the same.</p><p>James stood and expertly changed Kellie\u2019s diaper.</p><p>When Kerrie finished nursing, Summer swapped babies with him. James gently placed his daughter on his shoulder and patted her back until they heard the tiny burp.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d Summer asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping so soundly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was quite a night, Your Honor,\u201d she said, looking over at her husband. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more thrilled for you, James. Your position on the bench is secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he said with feeling. \u201cYou and Kerrie and Kellie. The voters fell in love with the three of you. Those radio commercials you sang were the talk of the town. I\u2019m the envy of every politician I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you\u2019re my wife.\u201d His eyes were dark, intense. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you, Summer. I still can\u2019t believe how much you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, James.\u201d Summer closed her eyes. It had started almost two years ago in Vegas, when it felt as if her heart was breaking. Now her heart was filled to overflowing. Life couldn\u2019t get any better than it was right then, she decided.</p><p>But Summer was wrong.</p><p>Because the best was yet to come. </p> </body></html>"]
