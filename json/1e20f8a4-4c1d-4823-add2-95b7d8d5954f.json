Then he hesitated while a lifetime of caution warred with the hope he felt because of Lady Cassidy, the Queen who now ruled the Territory of Dena Nehele.</p><p>Because there was hope, and fledgling trust, Ranon took a breath and began to play a greeting to the sun\u2014a song that had not been heard outside of the Shalador reserves for many, many years. Even there, it had not been played openly.</p> <p>His grandfather had taught him this song and every other song the Tradition Keepers had held on to since the Shalador people fled the ruins of their own Territory generations ago and settled in the southern part of Dena Nehele. The people had thrived there and put down roots, respecting the traditions of Dena Nehele but never forgetting their own\u2014and hoping, always hoping, that someday they would have a Territory of their own again.</p><p>It had been good land once, and a good place to live when it had been ruled by the Gray-Jeweled Queens. Then Lia died, and Dena Nehele\u2019s decline began. Queens who were backed by Dorothea SaDiablo, Hayll\u2019s High Priestess, gained control within a couple of generations. Dorothea hated the people of Dena Nehele for holding out against her for so long, but she hated the Shalador people even more because of Jared, the Red-Jeweled Shalador Warlord who had been husband and Consort to Lia Grayhaven, the last Gray Lady to rule Dena Nehele.</p><p>Because Dorothea hated Jared\u2019s people, her pet Queens ground away a little more of what was uniquely Shalador with each generation. The boundaries of the reserves where the Shaladorans had settled were whittled away until now they struggled to grow enough crops to feed themselves. The Shalador traditions were forbidden. The dances, the music, the stories\u2014all were taught in secret and at great risk.</p><p>His paternal grandfather was a Tradition Keeper of music. A strong, quiet man, Yairen had been\u2014and still was\u2014a respected leader in Eyota, the village where Ranon had grown up. He was also a gifted musician who believed it was his duty to teach the young how to play the songs that had shaped the Shalador heart.</p><p>The Province Queen who controlled that reserve broke Yairen\u2019s hands as punishment for teaching the forbidden\u2014and then broke them twice more. When they healed the last time, Yairen could barely hold a flute, much less play one. But he still taught his grandson, and he taught him well, despite the crippled hands.</p> <p>So this music had been a secret for most of Ranon\u2019s life. Even when he admitted to playing the flute, he never played within the hearing of anyone he couldn\u2019t trust\u2014and even then, he rarely played the songs of Shalador.</p><p>Did the Queen he now served understand how much trust was required for him to stand here and play the music of his people? Probably not. Lady Cassidy had recognized his reluctance to play, but not even Shira, the Black Widow Healer who was his lover, understood how deeply fear and hope had twined in his heart these past few days as the flute\u2019s notes floated on the air and became a part of the world. Yes, he was afraid, but the hope of something new and better was the reason he stood here, in a place that had been a stronghold for the twisted Queens, and played music that had been forbidden.</p><p>As one song followed another, Ranon let his heart soar with the notes and fill with a joyful peace.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have to spend serenading the little green things before you can have breakfast?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and lowered the flute. The peace he\u2019d felt a moment before vanished as Theran Grayhaven stepped out on the terrace.</p><p>He and Theran didn\u2019t like each other. Never had. But he detected nothing in the question except polite interest.</p> <p>\u201cA quarter of an hour.\u201d Ranon glanced at the hourglass hovering in the air next to him. Judging by how much sand was in the bottom of the glass, he\u2019d played twice that long. \u201cGray says it will help the honey pear trees grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he really think they\u2019ll wilt and die if you don\u2019t stand out here playing music?\u201d Theran asked as he studied the thirteen pots that were sheltered by the raised flower beds that formed the terrace wall.</p><p>Ranon\u2019s heart gave a hard bump at the thought of any of the little honey pear trees dying, but he wouldn\u2019t admit to anyone how much the living symbols of the past meant to him.</p><p>Jared had brought six honey pear trees to this land. One of them had been planted here at Grayhaven for Lia and had remained in the gardens long after it died as a mocking symbol of the Gray-Jeweled Queens who had once ruled. But that dead tree had hidden thirteen honey pears, carefully preserved. Lia had hidden them; Cassidy had found them as the first step to locating the Grayhaven treasure. Because of that, those little trees were a thread of shining hope that linked the past and the present.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what Gray thinks,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cIt is the Queen\u2019s pleasure that I play the flute each morning for the honey pears, so I play.\u201d</p><p>He knew the phrasing was a mistake the moment he said it.</p><p>\u201cWell, we all play for the Queen\u2019s pleasure in one way or another, don\u2019t we?\u201d Theran said. Then he glanced at Ranon and added with a touch of malice, \u201cBetter play faster or there won\u2019t even be porridge left by the time you get to the table, let alone meat and eggs.\u201d</p><p>I guess we\u2019re not trying to get along anymore,Ranon thought. Since he made no secret of it, everyone in the court knew he hated porridge. Which meant Theran had said that in order to jab at him. Why? Because they didn\u2019t like each other, and the effort to be civil rarely lasted for more than a few minutes at a time?</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire. Grayhaven had been running hot and cold since Cassidy found the treasure and proved she was meant to rule here, but they were all committed to working together for the good of the land and the Queen.</p><p>For the good of the land, anyway. The other eleven men who made up the First Circle knew Theran didn\u2019t feel the same commitment to Cassidy that they felt. Serving in her court was part of the agreement Theran had made in order to bring a Kaeleer Queen to Dena Nehele. That didn\u2019t mean hewanted to serve her, despite his recent efforts to work with her instead of opposing her.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Theran added. \u201cI\u2019ll save my share of the porridge for you.\u201d</p><p>An edge of temper. A slash of heat in the air between them. And an unspoken invitation to spill some blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-seven,\u201d Ranon said coldly. \u201cI\u2019m thirty. We\u2019re both too old to indulge in a pissing contest over porridge.\u201d</p><p>Theran jerked back as if he\u2019d been slapped. Then, snarling, he took a step forward.</p><p>Using Craft to vanish the hourglass and flute, Ranon instinctively took a step to the side to give himself more room to maneuver.</p><p>He wore an Opal Jewel; Theran wore Green. They were both Warlord Princes, aggressive predators born to stand on the killing fields. If they unleashed their psychic strength against each other, they could destroy the Grayhaven mansion and kill many of the people living here before anyone else knew there was danger. Even without using the power that made the Blood who and what they were, they could cause a lot of harm to each other with just muscle and temper.</p><p>But if either of them was damaged so badly he couldn\u2019t serve, the court would break, and Ranon\u2019s hope for the Shalador people would break with it.</p><p>Remembering that, he backed away from the fight, indicating with a subtle shift of his body that Theran was the dominant male. Which was true, as far as the Jewels were concerned. But only as far as the Jewels were concerned. And that, too, Ranon conveyed with that subtle shift.</p><p>Fury flashed in Theran\u2019s green eyes. Instead of accepting that Ranon had yielded, he took another step forward. Then . . .</p><p>*Theran? Theran!*</p><p>Saved by a Sceltie,Ranon thought as he watched Theran\u2019s hasty retreat into the mansion moments before the small brown-and-white dog bounded up the terrace\u2019s steps.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lady Vae,\u201d Ranon said with more courtesy than was required.</p><p>The little bitch growled at him.</p><p>Glancing at the Purple Dusk Jewel half hidden in her fur, Ranon offered no challenge. Vae was kindred\u2014the name given to the Blood who were not human\u2014and he\u2019d seen her pull down a full-grown man in a fight. His caste outranked hers, since she was only a witch, and his Jewels outranked hers. On the other hand, she had speed, strong jaws, and sharp teeth.</p><p>*You are not usually so foolish as other human males, so I will not nip you this time,* Vae said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He also appreciated the implied threat that the next offense would earn him more than a nip.</p><p>Vae trotted into the mansion, no doubt intending to administer her own brand of justice on the other foolish male.</p><p>Ranon sighed. He\u2019d come close to spoiling something that was as delicate as the honey pear seedlings growing in their pots.</p><p>Give her the best you have, Ranon,the Shalador Queens had told him when they left yesterday evening.Show her that Shalador\u2019s heart and honor are worthy of such a Queen.</p><p>Cassidy was a Rose-Jeweled Queen from Dharo. A tall, gawky woman with red hair and freckles, she was nothing like the image of the beautiful, powerful Queen that Theran had painted when he\u2019d told the surviving Warlord Princes about his plan to save Dena Nehele.</p><p>But when Ranon saw her that first day, he had felt the bond between Warlord Prince and Queen grab hold of his heart and gut, had felt theright-ness of handing over his life to her will. In the few weeks since her arrival, she had shown herself worthy of that trust, and in the wake of all she had done in the past week\u2014fighting against a Warlord and his two grown sons to defend a landen family, as well as discovering the treasure that had been hidden on the Grayhaven estate\u2014even the Warlord Princes who had been disappointed when they had first seen her were reassessing the Queen behind the long, plain face.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like Theran. He never would. But because he was grateful for Cassidy\u2019s presence\u2014and because he knew how he would have felt if he\u2019d been required to serve a Queen he didn\u2019t believe in\u2014he would do what he could to keep peace between himself and Theran.</p><p>And to bring back a little of the peace that had been spoiled, he called in his flute and played a while longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Theran paused in the dining room doorway and took a moment to watch the people around the table. Despite their commitment to serve, the men who made up the First Circle of Cassidy\u2019s court had been wary of her. They had seen too much brutality done at the command of the twisted Queens who had ruled here. And no matter what they said, he knew they had been disappointed in their Queen\u2019s lack of beauty and power.</p><p>Then Cassidy found the treasure that had been hidden by Lia and Thera, the Black Widow who had been Lia\u2019s closest friend. Not only did that discovery restore the Grayhaven family\u2019s personal wealth, it had uncovered journals and portraits that gave him and the other men in the First Circle a glimpse of the past that had helped to shape them\u2014because the people in those portraits had known what it meant to have honor. And Cassidy, by her actions, had shown herself to be a Queen of the same caliber as Lia.</p><p>Because of those things, he had made the choice to be Cassidy\u2019s First Escort in more than name, to serve her as if he felt the bond that the rest of the First Circle felt. But he didn\u2019t feel that bond, and despite his best intentions, serving her scraped at him. He was grateful for what she had accomplished so far, but he still believed that if Cassidy could do this much, the kind of Queen he had wanted for Dena Nehele could do so much more. The Blood who saw Cassidy had to get past that plain face and Rose Jewel in order to consider if she had anything to offer the land or the people\u2014and most of the Blood would be disappointed enough not to bother.</p> <p>Her contract to rule Dena Nehele is only for a year,Theran thought as he walked over to the table and took a seat.I can put up with serving her for a year. And it gives me time to find the right Queen for Dena Nehele.</p><p>The right Queen wouldn\u2019t stick a Shalador Warlord Prince in his face every damn day. His only excuse for his behavior this morning was that Ranon\u2019s presence scraped at him even more than Cassidy\u2019s. He\u2019d spent his whole life beingGrayhaven, the last descendant of the Gray Queens\u2019 bloodline and the man destined to becomethe male leader\u2014the Warlord Prince the other men would follow. Until he brought Cassidy to Dena Nehele and she formed her court, that was exactly who he had been. Now people looked at the dark hair and golden skin that proclaimed Ranon\u2019s heritage. Then they looked athim, and instead of seeing Grayhaven, they sawShalador.</p><p>Worse than that, when men saw him with other members of the First Circle, they responded to him asa leader, but not asthe leader. They acted like the Grayhaven name no longer meant as much now that Cassidy was here.</p><p>Feeling spiteful and pissed off at everyone, he started to help himself to a double serving of steak, eggs, and potatoes\u2014taking Ranon\u2019s share as well as his own\u2014but as he stabbed the second piece of steak, Cassidy held out a clean plate and smiled at him. Noticing how sharply the other men around the table were watching him, he had no choice but to give her half of everything.</p><p>When she set the plate in front of herself and didn\u2019t eat, resentment bubbled up. If she hadn\u2019t wanted the food, why had she preventedhim from having it?</p> <p>At least Ranon is still stuck with the porridge.Then Theran glanced at his cousin Gray and remembered another reason to try to get along with Cassidy.</p><p>Gray had been damaged in body and mind by the Queen who had captured and tortured him when he was fifteen. Now, twelve years later, Gray was finally changing emotionally and mentally from boy to man. A boy couldn\u2019t be Cassidy\u2019s lover, and that desire, thatneed was the force driving Gray\u2019s transformation.</p><p>The proof of that was a simple thing: When they had first come back to Grayhaven, Gray had been too afraid of being inside the mansion to eat with them. Now he was here, sitting beside Cassidy, talking about . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Theran almost dropped the coffeepot. \u201cWe\u2019re doingwhat ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to the Shalador reserves,\u201d Cassidy replied calmly. \u201cThe Shalador Queens invited me. They want me to see the land their people are subsisting on, want me to see the truth of their concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d Theran said. It had been his automatic response to all of Cassidy\u2019s attempts to get out among the people, but this time he really was concerned about her safety and not what people would think about the Queen who now ruled them.</p> <p>He poured his coffee and began to eat because he needed to fill his belly.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s up to Talon as Master of the Guard and Ranon as his second-i n-command to make it safe,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cIf we were going to the southern or western reserves, I would agree with Theran,\u201d Shira said. \u201cThey border other Territories, and the people there are as desperate as we are when it comes to repairing their lives and land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you concerned about?\u201d Cassidy asked Shira. \u201cThat they\u2019ll try to abduct me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Silence around the table. A sharpening of psychic scents as the Warlord Princes who served in the First Circle put an edge on tempers that were always well-honed.</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate your value, Lady,\u201d Shira said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much a good Queen is worth in Terreille. Especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn abducted Queen isn\u2019t worth anything,\u201d Cassidy countered. \u201cYou can\u2019t force her to rule.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut abducting a Queen could start another war.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy leaned back, clearly startled by that possibility.</p><p>\u201cRanon\u2019s home village is in the eastern reserve, far enough away from other Territory borders to be safe, and it\u2019s backed by the Tamanara Mountains,\u201d Shira said. \u201cProtected on all sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not protected from what\u2019s inside,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador people have no reason to wish Lady Cassidy harm,\u201d Shira said coolly.</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven, you can debate this all you want, but my decision is made,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cFive days from now, I\u2019ll be staying at the Shalador reserve. You, Powell, and Talon will discuss what needs to be done in order to accomplish that.\u201d</p><p>She would have backed down a fortnight ago, Theran thought. She would have respected that he knew more about what Dena Nehele needed than she did\u2014and the other Warlord Princes who served her wouldn\u2019t have opposed him.</p><p>Aleader, but no longerthe leader.</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d lost something too elusive to name, but the sense of loss was real.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll get started on the plans,\u201d Theran said, pushing away from the table. He picked up his plate and coffee mug. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll finish my breakfast while I work.\u201d</p><p>He barely waited for her nod of dismissal, but he waited because Protocol required it. Then he walked out of the dining room to finish his meal away from the woman he\u2019d brought into his land.</p><p>Cassidy might do some good during the year she was contracted to rule here. But letting the Shalador people think they were more significant than the rest of Dena Nehele wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.</p><p>That was Ranon\u2019s doing. He never let anyone forget that the Shalador people had borne the brunt of the cruelty that Dorothea\u2019s Queens had heaped on the people of Dena Nehele.</p><p>And Ranon never lethim forget that if his family name had been anything but Grayhaven, Theran would have been living the same desperate life on one of the reserves as the rest of the Shalador people.</p><p>Which implied his life had been easy, and that wasn\u2019t true. As the last of the Grayhaven line, he\u2019d grown up in the rogue camps that were hidden in the Tamanara Mountains, living among men who would fight to the death and beyond rather than serve a Queen who wanted them to whore their code of honor. He\u2019d been trained by Talon, a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince who had been demon-dead for almost three hundred years\u2014and who had been a friend to both Jared and Blaed, the Warlord Prince who had helped Jared elude Dorothea SaDiablo\u2019s guards and get Lia back to Dena Nehele.</p><p>Not an easy life by any measurement, but other men had survived worse. Gray, for one.</p><p>It was only for a year, he thought as he ducked into a room to finish his meal. Notthat much could change.</p><p>As he ate, he ignored the little whisper telling him that a great deal had changed already.</p><p>The only thing left on the table was porridge.</p><p>Ranon suppressed a sigh and took a seat beside Shira. That put him across from Cassidy, who had a full plate of steak, eggs, and fried potatoes.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Shira asked, holding up the pot.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He scraped what was left of the porridge into a bowl. It was food, and he was thankful to have it.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he had to like it.</p><p>As he dug in, Gray turned to Cassidy and asked, \u201cWill you be coming out to the garden to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this morning,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cI\u2019m going with Shira to check on the landen girl who was injured.\u201d</p><p>Ranon tensed. So did every other man who was still at the table. But no one challenged that statement, which was a welcome change since Theran was always yapping whenever Cassidy wanted to leave the estate.</p><p>Archerr, an Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince, said, \u201cPrince Spere and I have escort duty this morning. If you think the First Circle should show a stronger presence, I can ask Prince Shaddo and Lord Cayle to stand as escorts too.\u201d</p><p>Archerr kept his eyes on Cassidy, but Ranon knew the question was directed at him as Talon\u2019s second-in-command. He tipped his head in a subtle nod. Additional escorts weren\u2019t needed to ensure Cassidy\u2019s safety during this visit, but it didn\u2019t hurt to remind the townspeople that the Queen was served and protected by strong men.</p><p>Then Gray said, \u201cPerhaps Lady Vae would be willing to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us could stop her,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Ranon snorted softly. Before Cassidy\u2019s arrival, no one here had seen a Sceltie. Vae had been an education for all of them.</p><p>Powell, the Prince who was the Steward of the court, pushed away from the table. \u201cWith your permission, Lady, we\u2019ll leave you to begin the day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy nodded. \u201cWhen I return, I\u2019ll stop at your office to review anything that requires my attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCertainly. Ranon? When you have a moment, I\u2019d like to discuss the Lady\u2019s visit to your home village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you shortly,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cLady Shira and I will be ready in half an hour,\u201d Cassidy told Archerr.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Gray said, brushing a fingertip over the back of Cassidy\u2019s hand.</p><p>He\u2019s come so far so fast,Ranon thought as Gray and the rest of the men left the dining room.Now he\u2019s acting more like the Warlord Prince he should have been.</p><p>When the last man left the room, he pushed aside the half-eaten bowl of porridge\u2014and Cassidy pushed the full plate of food in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI ate,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve agreed to live lean and not cook more than we need for each meal. You were out with the honey pear trees, and I had a feeling that there might not be anything left by the time you got here.\u201d</p> <p>Living lean. In the reserves, winter was called the Season of Hunger, so he knew about not wasting food. And he knew the unspoken rule of this court: Once everyone was served, what was left could be eaten by anyone who wanted more. The Blood\u2019s bodies needed more fuel than landens\u2019, and the darker the Jewel a person wore, the more food that person needed in order to remain a healthy vessel for the power that lived within. So everyone was willing to eat another helping when it was available.</p><p>Because he\u2019d been late, and because of Theran\u2019s remarks, he hadn\u2019t expected to get more than porridge that even hunger barely made tolerable.</p><p>\u201cIf you have no objection to a solitary meal, Shira and I really should be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no objection,\u201d he said. He touched his fork to the edge of the plate. \u201cThanks for this.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Cassidy and Shira left. Then he began eating with enthusiasm. As he poured the last of the coffee from the pot, it occurred to him that Cassidy had not only saved some food for him, she had used a warming spell on the plate so the food wouldn\u2019t get cold.</p><p>A small thing, perhaps. A simple courtesy. But when simple courtesies came from a Queen, it said a great deal about how she would treat her people\u2014and, hopefully, how she would treat his.</p> <p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Lying facedown on the large bed, Daemon Sadi groaned with relief as his wife\u2019s skilled hands coaxed his back muscles to relax. The warming spell Jaenelle was using to ease the tightness didn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>\u201cTell me again how you did this,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>A typical wife question, particularly when said inthat tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cDaemonar was stuck in a tree,\u201d Daemon mumbled. Then, \u201cOh. Right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. That is a very nasty knot.\u201d She said nothing for a minute while she worked on that part of his back. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking about Daemonar Yaslana. Your nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your nephew too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he is. And he\u2019s Eyrien. Which means he has wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has wings.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She was going to hold on to that little detail like a Sceltie herding a single sheep.</p><p>\u201cSince he is little,\u201d Jaenelle continued. \u201cHow did he get up in the tree? He wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the lower branches to climb up like you did.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He knew a trick question when he heard one.</p><p>\u201cHe flew up, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cUsing his wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re starting to sound like a Harpy,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cOw!\u201d That because she dug her thumbs into his back\u2014which he deserved for the Harpy comment.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just admit that climbing a tree in those shoes you usually wear instead of using Craft to float up to the branch where your erring nephew was waiting for you, and most likely giggling, was a dumb idea?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to admit to anything. Especially when ithad been a dumb idea. He\u2019d known that when he was doing it. He\u2019d known it even better when he watched Daemonar flutter down to find out what he was doing flat on the ground. But it had been a matter of pride. Jaenelle understood about male pride. She might find it amusing or irritating, depending on the consequences, but she understood it. So she should understand that, at that moment when the boy was looking down at him, he saw himself as the uncle who used Craft instead of muscle, who didn\u2019t participate in the physical world the way his brother Lucivar did. In that moment, he didn\u2019t want to be seen asless by a boy who wasn\u2019t old enough to appreciate the power and skills hedid have.</p><p>So he\u2019d climbed the damn tree.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t actually hit the ground,\u201d Daemon muttered. \u201cI did remember to create a shield and use the air walking spell.\u201d Which saved him from serious injury since he landed on a cushion of air instead of hard ground, but it didn\u2019t spare him from having the wind knocked out of him\u2014or having a back full of tight, aching muscles.</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d Jaenelle said, her voice so dry there was no question she was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Fine. I was an idiot.\u201d Which was a story he was sure the servants at SaDiablo Hall would share for many years to come, since a couple of them had witnessed the little drama. They wouldn\u2019t share the story with outsiders, because anyone who worked at the Hall knew the private lives of the SaDiablo family remainedprivate. But he could see someone like the footman Holt taking a young servant aside and telling him that story as an assurance that the powerful, dangerous,lethal Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince of Dhemlan could also be a man who acted like a bumbling uncle with good intentions and a shortage of brains.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He couldfeel her smile, and the fact that she didn\u2019t need to comment was more than sufficient comment.</p><p>She kissed him between the shoulder blades, and that simple contact between lips and skin warmed him in other ways, and the next stroke of her hands down his back had him purring instead of groaning.</p><p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI\u2019m almost done. By tomorrow you\u2019ll be your usual wonderful self, and if you can remember that you\u2019re a grown-up, you should be able to get through the last day of your nephew\u2019s visit without doing any more damage to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her hands glided over his back, more a caress than a Healer\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not relaxing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very relaxed,\u201d Daemon purred. Most of him, anyway. He\u2019d been sore enough that he hadn\u2019t focused on anything besides not hurting. Now he was aware of a few other things.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He heard the concern in her voice. That meant she was looking at him as a Healer and not a woman\u2014and he wanted the woman\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re sitting on my ass. There are parts of me that find that very interesting and don\u2019t want to relax yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sitting on your ass,\u201d Jaenelle huffed. \u201cI\u2019m straddling you to work on your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close enough that I can tell you\u2019re not wearing anything under that shift, so I call that sitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can tell what I\u2019m not wearing because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you brush against me, it tickles.\u201d</p><p>A too-thoughtful pause. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully sassy all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame it on my beautiful wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyo, I don\u2019t think your back will take what you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just roll over. Since you\u2019re already straddling me, you can give us both a ride.\u201d</p><p>She snorted out a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic when you\u2019re exhausted, but I\u2019ll take you up on your offer. Just to help you relax completely, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still for another minute.\u201d</p><p>Her hands glided over his back, the warm, sensuous caress of a lover.</p><p>Jaenelle Angelline. The living myth. Dreams made flesh. The former Queen of Ebon Askavi. And his wife. His wonderful, longed-for wife.</p><p>\u201cDaemon?\u201d</p><p>In another minute he would roll over and touch her body. He would use a psychic thread to link with her, mind to mind, and consummate their lovemaking with more than his body, touching her in ways he had never touched another woman.</p><p>\u201cDaemon?\u201d</p><p>He could picture her fair-skinned hands gliding over his golden brown chest as she sheathed him in silky fire.</p><p>In just another min . . .</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, former Warlord Prince of Dhemlan and still the High Lord of Hell, set aside the current stack of books he was sorting in the restricted part of the Keep\u2019s library, leaned against the large blackwood table, and watched the son who was a mirror prowl restlessly around the room.</p><p>Not physically a mirror. Not quite. They had the same thick, black hair and gold eyes\u2014although his hair now held wings of silver at the temples. They had the brown skin of the long-lived races, but Daemon\u2019s skin was a golden brown\u2014more Dhemlan than Hayllian in color.</p><p>He had always been considered handsome. Daemon, on the other hand, was beautiful and moved with a feline grace that drew the eye and aroused the senses.</p><p>The foolish lusted after that body, forgetting that the man inside the skin was a powerful predator with a cold, killing temper.</p><p>Which made him wonder about the reason for this visit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here early,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cWent to sleep early, got up early,\u201d Daemon replied.</p><p>Back and forth. Ceaseless movement. If it was Lucivar, he wouldn\u2019t think twice about the prowl. But Daemon?</p><p>Daemon stopped moving and stared at the wall. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Fear clamped around Saetan\u2019s heart, but he asked calmly, \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>A few weeks ago, Theran Grayhaven came to Kaeleer and asked Daemon for help. Disturbed by the physical resemblance between Theran and his old friend Jared, Daemon had slipped into painful memories, confusing the past with the present. No one had known there were deep emotional scars connected to the years after Daemon helped Jared and Lia elude Dorothea\u2019s guards. No one had suspected there was anything wrong\u2014until Daemon attacked Jaenelle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since that night, Daemon was quick to hone his temper when anyone questioned his mental or emotional stability, so the subject had to be approached with caution.</p><p>He understood that. When the witch Vulchera had tried to compromise Daemon\u2019s honor by playing her particular brand of blackmail games, something had snapped inside ofhim, and he\u2019d slid into the Twisted Kingdom where his rage had found an insane and terrible clarity. It wasn\u2019t the snap and slide that had disturbed the family; it was the deliberate way he had executed the bitch that had scared them.</p><p>So the whole family was still feeling a bit raw\u2014and Lucivar going into rut so soon after didn\u2019t help.</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>Daemon turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m only seventeen hundred years old. I\u2019ve been married for a year to the woman I love with everything in me\u2014a woman I\u2019ve waitedcenturies to be with. So when that woman indicates she wants to make love with me, I shouldnot be falling asleep between the thought and the deed!\u201d</p><p>Relief made Saetan\u2019s knees weak\u2014and he needed every drop of his fifty thousand years of self-discipline and control to keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cLucivar is in rut,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Daemon replied, sounding as if he\u2019d like to whack his brother\u2019s head against a wall a few times because of it.</p> <p>\u201cWho is looking after Daemonar?\u201d</p><p>Daemon frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s staying at the Hall with us. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of where he\u2019s staying. Who is looking after him?\u201d</p><p>Daemon shifted his weight from one foot to the other. In and of itself, it was an insignificant movement\u2014except thatDaemon had done it, and Daemon rarely showed any sign of uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cI am, for the most part. Well, Hell\u2019s fire, Jaenelle can\u2019t hold the leash on that little beast.\u201d</p><p>Of course she could,Saetan thought. Even now, when she no longer had the abundance of physical energy she used to have, Jaenelle was probably one of the few people whocould keep up with a small Eyrien boy. Not to mention that Daemonar loved his Auntie J, sensed on some level that she couldn\u2019t take rough play, and now had his young Warlord Prince instincts tugging at him to protect the Queen.</p> <p>\u201cHolt is also taking shifts watching the boy,\u201d Daemon added.</p><p>\u201cHolt?\u201d Saetan wondered if the footman was writing out his resignation. Which would be a shame, because the man was an asset to the household.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s young, strong, and has the experience of having several nieces and nephews,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cHe also gets double wages for any day he assists in looking after the boy\u2014and an extra day off with pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerous,\u201d Saetan murmured. \u201cIf those are the terms you offered, you should have plenty of volunteers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after the first hour,\u201d Daemon growled.</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh,he told himself.You know exactly what this is like, so do not laugh at him.</p><p>But he wanted to laugh. So he gave himself a stern mental shake and cleared his throat.</p><p>The rut wasn\u2019t a laughing matter. Once or twice a year, the fierce sex drive that always simmered in a Warlord Prince intensified to a need that eclipsed sanity, and a man who could normally control his predatory nature became a danger to everyone except the woman he\u2019d fixed his attention on\u2014and sometimes, if she wasn\u2019t careful around him, even she wasn\u2019t safe from a temper that had no leash.</p> <p>It changed when a Warlord Prince had a strong relationship with a woman, particularly when that woman was his lover. She, at least, could usually penetrate the sexual madness and provide a little control during those three days. And a Warlord Prince who was a father could usually tolerate his own children\u2019s presence when they were infants or toddlers, as long as he didn\u2019t have to interact with them.</p><p>But Daemonar had begun the transition from toddler to boy last autumn and now had the unmistakable psychic scent of a Warlord Prince. Now Lucivar saw a rival instead of a son. So the boy could no longer stay in the eyrie when his father was in rut. Which meant Daemon took Daemonar for those days in the same way Saetan had taken Andulvar\u2019s son, Ravenar, and Andulvar had taken Mephis and Peyton.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of a small boy who is in motion almost every moment he\u2019s awake, and you think there is something wrong with you because you fell asleep before making love to Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he goes down for an afternoon nap, do you have sense enough to take an hour of that time to get some sleep yourself?\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s gold eyes flashed with annoyance. \u201cI do have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you haven\u2019t taken that hour.\u201d</p><p>His son snarled softly. \u201cLucivar doesn\u2019t take naps.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. This wasn\u2019t a competition. Or maybe it was. Except for these past few years when they had been reunited with him, the only measuring stick they had for what was \u201cnormal\u201d for a male with so much power was each other.</p><p>\u201cLucivar is Eyrien,\u201d Saetan said, his patience starting to fray.</p><p>\u201cHalf Eyrien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, the Eyriens are a very physical people, and your brother is no exception. Besides, Lucivar catches quick naps throughout the day. Haven\u2019t you seen him stand perfectly still with his eyes focused on some distant spot while you\u2019re talking to him and then realize he hasn\u2019t heard anything you\u2019ve said?\u201d</p><p>Daemon shrugged, a movement full of dismissal and irritation.</p><p>\u201cHe was asleep,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Daemon jerked. \u201cWhat? He waswhat ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsleep. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something Eyrien males are born knowing how to do or if they\u2019re trained, but they can sleep on their feet with their eyes open. Just a few minutes at a time. For a warrior, being able to snatch those moments of rest can mean the difference between surviving a battle or being one of the dead.\u201d Saetan paused, then added, \u201cAndulvar used to do that sometimes when I was talking to him. He even had the balls to tell me my voice was a soothing drone.\u201d</p><p>Daemon snorted in an effort to hold back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any comfort to you, I know for a fact there are nights when Lucivar flops on the bed and is so deeply asleep by the time Marian comes in that she can\u2019t shift him, so she throws a blanket over him and sleeps somewhere else. A few hours later, he wakes up, realizes she isn\u2019t there, and goes and fetches her to tuck them both in for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t think something was wrong with him,\u201d Daemon muttered.</p><p>Saetan raised an eyebrow. \u201cThen why do you think I know about it?\u201d</p><p>Daemon blinked. Blinked again. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a sigh. \u201cIs that it? Anything else? I noticed you\u2019re a bit stiff this morning.\u201d When Daemon mumbled a response, he put some paternal steel in his voice. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell out of a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He didn\u2019t\u2014and he wasn\u2019t going to ask about it. But even knowing the response he was about to provoke, he decided to trespass. \u201cHow are you otherwise?\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat was all it took for Daemon to switch from being a son to being a Warlord Prince whose cold temper could be as elegant as it was deadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Daemon replied, a warning chill in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m your father,\u201d Saetan replied, \u201cas well as the High Lord of Hell. I\u2019ll have an honest answer this time, Prince.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other, assessing, measuring. Then Daemon leashed the Warlord Prince in order to be a son again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like knowing there are places where I\u2019m fragile,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cI don\u2019t like admitting I can be vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man does. But very few men, if any, could have survived having their mind shattered twice and come back from it. Everything has a price, Daemon. Knowing there are some things you can\u2019t do seems like a small price to pay for getting your life back.\u201d Saetan studied his son. \u201cThere\u2019s something else. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going into rut sometime in the next few weeks,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that worries you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it worry Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Daemon shifted his shoulders. \u201cCould you talk to her? Make sure she\u2019s willing after . . .\u201d</p><p>. . . after the attack.</p><p>Daemon took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. \u201cI need to get back. Jaenelle was sure she and Holt could deal with the boy for a few hours, but I don\u2019t want to be away too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Daemon nodded. \u201cIf Lucivar gets Marian pregnant again . . .\u201d</p><p>They both sighed.</p><p>\u201cIf that happens, we\u2019ll all deal with it,\u201d he said. And hope for a girl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Eyriens created the hunting camps just to train boys to become warriors,\u201d Daemon said thoughtfully. \u201cI think they created them to send young males away from home because that was the only way Eyrien males would have siblings other than older sisters.\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou could be right. Yes, I think you could be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, witch-child.\u201d Saetan pushed the books aside and turned to lean on the blackwood table. He\u2019d been expecting her. That was why he hadn\u2019t retired to his suite to rest during the harsher midday hours that were so draining for a Guardian.</p><p>\u201cHello, Papa,\u201d Jaenelle replied.</p><p>She didn\u2019t come to him for a hug. She didn\u2019t look away. In fact, the fingers twining around and around one another was the only sign of nerves.</p><p>The living myth. Dreams made flesh. The daughter of his soul. They had almost lost her when she purged the Realms of the Blood who were tainted by Dorothea and Hekatah. Now she was whole and healthy again, if still a bit too thin in his opinion. The golden hair, cut short while she was healing, looked shaggy now. He couldn\u2019t tell if that was a deliberate style or the result of letting it grow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was the sapphire eyes that held him now as they had held him the first time he met her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is said between father and son is private, and I appreciate that,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cBut I need to know if Daemon is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking about his back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know about his back, Saetan.\u201d</p><p>And there it was\u2014that hint of caverns and midnight in her voice that told him he was no longer talking to his daughter; he was talking to his Queen. To Witch.</p><p>\u201cDaemon Sadi is the most powerful male in Kaeleer,\u201d Witch said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince with a temper that cannot be dismissed or taken lightly. He\u2019syour equal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he\u2019s dominant,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cHis power is a little darker than mine. Which makes himthe most powerful male in the history of the Blood. I\u2019m aware of that, Lady. What is your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slunk out of the bedroom this morning. Heslunk out, Saetan. I need to know why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was embarrassed because he had fallen asleep before making love to you last night. He thought there must be something wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s mouth fell open. She stared at him. Finally she said, \u201cWell . . . Hell\u2019s fire. He\u2019s been chasing after Daemonar for two days. Why was he surprised that he fell asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, like his brother, he hasn\u2019t taken into account that having the stamina to run other grown men into the ground is not the same thing as trying to keep up with a small, bright boy who leaps into exploring the world with all the arrogance of his race\u2014to say nothing of having inherited Lucivar\u2019s confidence in being able to meet any challenge the world foolishly chooses to toss at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you disappointed that you didn\u2019t make love last night?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dry smile. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not sure either one of us could have stayed awake through the whole thing if we\u2019d tried.\u201d</p> <p>End of discussion,Saetan thought. Except it wasn\u2019t. Not quite. \u201cHe\u2019s also concerned about how you\u2019ll respond to him the next time he goes into rut\u2014which will be fairly soon.\u201d</p><p>The look in her sapphire eyes sizzled along his nerves. He was her adopted father, and he had never thought of her physically in any other way. But he was also a man and a Warlord Prince, and there was always a sexual awareness between a Warlord Prince and his Queen, even when there was no desire to do anything with that awareness.</p><p>When Daemon was caught in the rut\u2019s sexual madness, how much of his relief came from physical sex and how much came from the knife-edged dance of being with Witch in the Misty Place deep in the abyss\u2014of being with the living myth when she revealed the Self that lived within the human body? The Self that was not completely human.</p><p>The sizzle faded. He had to clear his throat before he could speak. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Daemon not to worry about the rut.\u201d</p><p>*I\u2019ve never worried about the rut,* she told him using a psychic thread.</p><p>Now he understood why she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jaenelle closed the distance between them and hugged him. Then she gave him a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019d better get back to the Hall before Daemonar gets his Unka Daemon into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Daemonar had given up the baby talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he has for the most part. But he likes the sound of \u2018unka,\u2019 and his uncle doesn\u2019t insist that he say the word correctly.\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled. \u201cI see. Off you go, witch-child. Try to keep them both out of the trees, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>Later, when he was alone in his suite, preparing to sleep through the midday hours, he allowed himself to remember her in that moment when she showed him a side of Witch a father would never see.</p><p>And he allowed himself one moment to envy his son\u2014and to wish he could have been the lover instead of the father.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Propped up on one elbow, Ranon watched Shira\u2019s slow return to awareness after the climax that was the finale of a long, slow, intense evening of lovemaking.</p><p>Before coming together in Cassidy\u2019s court, they\u2019d had five years of fast, furtive coupling because his interest would have drawn the wrong kind of attention to the Black Widow Healer. Five years when he\u2019d tried to stay away from her and had been unable to resist being with her. Five years of love always being entwined with fear.</p><p>Twice that five years, actually, if he counted the years before they became lovers. He had been twenty and still adjusting to the Opal power that coursed through him after he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness. She had been sixteen\u2014a young Black Widow, born to the Hourglass Covens, who was just beginning the secret training that would hone the Craft she instinctively knew, as well as the open training required to be a Healer.</p><p>They had both been visiting friends in a village that wasn\u2019t home to either of them. They had met by chance when their companions had chosen the same dining house for the midday meal. And that meeting had shaped their hopes and dreams for the next ten years.</p><p>Now, thanks to Cassidy, he and Shira could spend time together openly, could spend the night together, could begin to build alife together. That alone would have earned Cassidy his loyalty. The fact that she was proving to be a far stronger ruler than any of them had expected from a Queen who wore a Rose Jewel had earned his respect and a different kind of love. Her will was his life, and he would do everything he could to help her rule Dena Nehele\u2014and by doing so he would do more than he\u2019d dreamed possible for the Shalador people.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Shira asked, her dark eyes reflecting the pleasure of their lovemaking as well as amusement.</p><p>His thoughts had drifted beyond her bedroom, but his eyes had been focused on her breasts.</p><p>He lowered his head and placed one warm kiss between her breasts before saying, \u201cA Shalador beauty.\u201d</p><p>Her response was a little snort. \u201cI know what I look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t see what I see,\u201d Ranon said. He was considered a handsome man. The sharp features typical of his people gave his face a rugged handsomeness that went well with a warrior\u2019s lean body, and he had the dark eyes, dark hair, and golden skin that made Shaladorans distinct from the brown-skinned, long-lived races or the fair-skinned races like the people of Dena Nehele.</p><p>She had the look of their people, too, and many men had thought the sharp bones of her face and the curves that lacked abundance made her less appealing as a lover\u2014and her sharp tongue and temper discouraged most men from getting close to her. But it was exactly those things about her that excited him in ways no other woman had, and he understood why Gray could look at Cassidy\u2014whom even the most generous supporter could not call pretty\u2014and see a beautiful woman.</p><p>Shira turned her head away from him, an evasive movement that wasn\u2019t typical of her.</p><p>He considered his words.You don\u2019t see what I see. Then he considered the nature of a Black Widow\u2019s Craft and felt a chill settle in his belly.</p><p>\u201cShira? Have you seen something in a tangled web?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t, won\u2019t. The words make no difference.\u201d</p><p>They made a difference to him. His voice went flat. \u201cYou saw something in a web of dreams and visions. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak of it, Ranon. None of us will speak of it.\u201d</p><p>The chill in his belly turned to jagged ice. \u201cHow many Black Widows have seen this?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, a sound full of exasperation and a hint of anger.</p><p>He shifted away from her, sat up, and wrapped his arms around his bent knees. He had no right to push. If she felt he needed to know, she would have told him. Hell\u2019s fire! She was the one who had pushed him to come to Grayhaven when Theran had first summoned the Warlord Princes to talk about bringing a Queen from Kaeleer. She hadn\u2019t told him anything then, either. She\u2019d just said he had to go.</p><p>The Hourglass didn\u2019t divulge what they saw in their tangled webs. Not very often, anyway. And not directly. But a Black Widow never made a suggestion about an action to take without a reason.</p><p>\u201cIs it something to do with Cassidy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShira . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to ask.</p><p>Finally Shira asked quietly, \u201cWho has your loyalty, Prince Ranon? Tell me the list in order.\u201d</p><p>His heart ached, but she had asked. Because he would give her nothing less than honesty, the words had to be said. \u201cI love you with everything I am, but my first loyalty is to my Queen. Then you, then our people, then Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and pressed a hand against his face. When he looked at her, she said fiercely, \u201cRemember the order of that list. Hold on to it with everything you are.\u201d</p><p>Was she warning him that something might happen to Cassie when they went to the Shalador reserves?</p><p>\u201cHold on to it the same way you\u2019ve held on to your honor,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>And that was the answer: Cassidy the Queen came before anything and everything else\u2014his lover, his people, his land.</p><p>The visions seen in tangled webs didn\u2019t always come true. Sometimes they were warnings of what might be. Shira was telling him that his choices would make a difference.His choices. And she had told him, without breaking her own code of honor, what his choice had to be.</p><p>That night, while Shira slept and he lay awake staring at the dark ceiling of her bedroom, he realized that fear could entwine with hope as well as love, and all he could do was give his best to the two women who were now the center of his life.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon rounded a corner and let out a roar\u2014which only made his quarry pump those little legs faster.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. He\u2019d only looked away for a minute while he was packing up the things Daemonar would take home. One damn minute! That\u2019s all it had taken for the boy to shoot out of the bedroom like an arrow released from a bow.</p><p>Well, if this was going to be their last pissing contest during this visit, he wasnot going to lose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was going to lose.</p><p>When he realized the stairs leading down to the informal receiving room\u2014and beyond that, the great hall\u2014were up ahead, heran. The boy was going too fast to get down those stairs without a bad tumble.</p><p>Almost in reach. If he couldn\u2019t stop Daemonar . . .</p> <p>The boy spread those little membranous wings and launched himself over the railing.</p><p>Daemon gave a moment\u2019s thought to leaping over the railing and using Craft to make a controlled slide on air, but that wasn\u2019t an easy bit of Craft to do, despite how simple Jaenelle always made it seem, and since it wasn\u2019t something he did on a regular basis\u2014until lately, anyway\u2014a miscalculation could end with a broken leg. Or worse.</p><p>At least the door to the great hall was closed, Daemon thought as he pounded down the stairs. At least the little beast didn\u2019t know how to make a pass through a solid object. At least he\u2019d only be chasing a flying boy around a contained space.</p><p>Which was when Holt opened the door\u2014and Daemonar dove right at the footman\u2019s head. Startled, Holt dove for the floor, and Daemonar flew past him into the great hall and let out a happy squeal.</p><p>Damn! Did someone just open the front door? If Daemonar got outside, it might takehours to catch him.</p> <p>Leaping over Holt, Daemon skidded into the great hall.</p><p>And there was Lucivar, with his arms full of happy boy.</p><p>\u201cHello, boyo,\u201d Lucivar said, giving his bundle of boy a smacking kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cPapa! Papa!\u201d</p><p>Daemon braced one hand on the wall and sucked in air while he watched the reunion.</p><p>\u201cWere you a good boy?\u201d Lucivar asked Daemonar. He gave Daemon what might have been a sheepish look\u2014if it had been anyone else but Lucivar.</p> <p>\u201cGuess what, Papa! Unka Daemon fell out of a tree!\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s face burned with embarrassment.</p><p>Lucivar kept his eyes on his son. \u201cWhat was Uncle Daemon doing in the tree?\u201d</p><p>Daemonar suddenly turned shy and began playing with the gold chain that held Lucivar\u2019s Birthright Red Jewel.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Uncle Daemon doing in the tree?\u201d Lucivar asked again.</p><p>Daemonar hesitated. \u201cFalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>*Is Marian pregnant?* Daemon asked on a Red psychic thread.</p> <p>*We won\u2019t know for a few weeks,* Lucivar replied.</p><p>You know, you prick,Daemon thought. And Lucivar not giving him a straight answerwas an answer.</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s gold eyes brightened when Jaenelle stepped into the great hall.</p><p>\u201cHey, boyo.\u201d Jaenelle smiled at Daemonar. \u201cAre you going home without reading one last story with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Put me down, Papa!\u201d</p><p>When Lucivar didn\u2019t respond fast enough, Daemonar rammed his feet into his father\u2019s gut and launched himself at Jaenelle.</p><p>Too fast, Daemon thought as the boy winged toward Jaenelle. But Daemonar backwinged an arm\u2019s length from his beloved auntie. He dipped and wobbled, but he landed without slamming into Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cExcellent backwinging.\u201d Jaenelle held out her hand as she gave Daemon and Lucivar a warm, amused look. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll sit in Uncle Daemon\u2019s study and read a story while he and your papa have a little chat.\u201d</p><p>When boy and Queen disappeared into the study, Lucivar rubbed his belly. \u201cWell, so much for my minute of being important.\u201d</p><p>Daemon didn\u2019t reply. He just crossed the great hall and went into the formal receiving room.</p><p>Thank you, Beale,he thought when he saw the tray that held a decanter of brandy and two glasses. Normally he wouldn\u2019t consider a drink before the midday meal, but today . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a bit rough, old son,\u201d Lucivar said as he came into the room and closed the door.</p><p>Daemon poured himself a hefty glass of brandy and took a generous gulp. \u201cIf you got Marian pregnant, you damn well better have a girl, because if you don\u2019t, I will twist your cock off. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t get a smart-ass reply, he turned and looked at his brother\u2014and the look on Lucivar\u2019s face made his heart pound. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is Marian all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s good. Father is at the eyrie now, pampering her.\u201d Lucivar made a face. \u201cWhen I do something, it\u2019s fussing. When he does the same damn thing, it\u2019s pampering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a way with women,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cLucivar . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it that hard?\u201d Lucivar asked. \u201cI know the boy is a handful. Hell\u2019s fire, Bastard, I know he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did all right,\u201d Daemon said sourly.</p><p>Lucivar sighed. \u201cLook, next time I\u2019ll leave him with the Eyriens and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not.\u201d Daemon\u2019s voice chilled. \u201cYou and I were given a particular code of honor when we were very young\u2014a code that isn\u2019t known by many, if any, who come from Terreille. And that is the code of honor our family will live by. So when your boy needs to spend some days away from you, he comes here. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all Eyriens view honor as something they can bend to suit themselves,\u201d Lucivar said cautiously.</p><p>Falonar.The name of Lucivar\u2019s former second-in-command wasn\u2019t spoken, but it hung in the air between them.</p><p>Then the moment, and the tension, were gone.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Daemon said, setting the brandy aside. \u201cI\u2019m just pissing and moaning. I fell out of a damn tree. I\u2019m entitled to piss and moan. And I feel . . . inadequate.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire, it bruised his ego to admit that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Eyrien, old son,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cYou never will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d Lucivar studied him. \u201cWe knew Daemonar couldn\u2019t stay with us anymore when I went into rut, and when Marian recognized the signs and got him down to Merry and Briggs before I . . .\u201d He raked a hand through his black hair. \u201cThe boy wantedyou. His Uncle Daemon. Who isn\u2019t Eyrien. Who doesn\u2019t fly or fight\u2014at least in a way he understands yet\u2014but who knowslots of things. He doesn\u2019t want you to be Eyrien. He wants to be with you because he loves you.\u201d</p><p>Hearing those words relaxed the knot of expectations he\u2019d inflicted on himself\u2014and filled him with warm pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get the little beast home. His mother misses him.\u201d Turning, Lucivar reached for the doorknob, then stopped and looked at Daemon. \u201cYou really fell out of a tree?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI really did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was up in the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have climbed it for any other reason,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s face was filled with baffled amusement. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell him to come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>Even more baffled. \u201cSince you told him to come down and he didn\u2019t obey, why didn\u2019t you use Craft to haul his ass down? I would have.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy closed her eyes and concentrated on breathing.</p><p>Nerves and excitement. Her first official visit among the people she ruled. And the first time people outside the town of Grayhaven would see her First Circle working together as a First Circle.</p><p>She glanced at Theran. Ever since she had found the treasure hidden in the attic at Grayhaven, he had made an obvious effort to act like he wanted to serve in her court. But his forced courtesy was a daily reminder that he didn\u2019t belong to her the way the other men in her First Circle did.</p><p>In fact, his effort to serve felt too much like her previous court. They had lavished her with forced courtesy too\u2014right before they broke her court and left her to serve another Queen.</p><p>This visit to Eyota, Ranon\u2019s home village, was harder for him to accept than it was for the rest of the First Circle. They had spent the days prior to this trip discussing the details of what was required to guard their Queen in an unfamiliar place. Theran had offered no comments, no suggestions, nothing. He had, in fact, voiced none of the concerns that a First Escort should have. Was he distancing himself because she had refused to cancel this visit\u2014or because being on a Shalador reserve would make him look at the other side of his heritage? He was proud to be descended from Jared, but he seemed to resent having to acknowledge that Jared came from Shalador.</p><p>Then there was Gray, who was clinging to her hand despite the fact they were in a Coach that had a driver experienced with controlling a long, enclosed, furnished box designed to ride the Winds, those psychic webs through the Darkness. It wasn\u2019t being dependent on someone else\u2019s power and skill that made Gray cling to her. Captured at fifteen and given to Dena Nehele\u2019s Queen, he had survived two years of torture before being rescued. It had taken courage for him to go back to Grayhaven when Theran and Talon had announced they were going to live there with the new Territory Queen. And she knew it had taken even more courage for him to leave Grayhaven and come with her to a place that was unfamiliar and spend time among strangers.</p><p>\u201cThe boardinghouse looks shabby, but it\u2019s solid, has running water and a kitchen, and it\u2019s big enough to accommodate all of the First Circle,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Since this was the fourth time he\u2019d told her that\u2014and sounded both defensive and apologetic\u2014Cassidy figured the Shalador Warlord Prince wasn\u2019t as calm or confident about this visit as he appeared to be. And Shira\u2019s composure had become more frayed as this day approached.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine, Ranon,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d She hoped so, because the success of this visit would determine if she would be allowed to be a Queen to these people in the truest sense or only a symbol the Warlord Princes would use to try to rebuild Dena Nehele. The witch storm unleashed by Jaenelle Angelline two years ago had swept away the Blood who had been tainted by Dorothea SaDiablo, and the landen uprisings that followed had killed so many more. The survivors not only had to worry about keeping peace within their own Territory, they had to remain strong enough to stop any Blood from other Territories who might try to encroach on Dena Nehele\u2019s land and take whatever resources could be won from a fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Shira echoed.</p><p>Noticing the way Ranon stopped himself from looking at Shira, as if a look at that moment might betray some confidence, Cassidy wondered what the Black Widow knew that could make the two Shaladorans so doubtful that anything would be fine.</p><p>They were a proud, ragged people.</p> <p>Since he wasn\u2019t an official member of Cassie\u2019s First Circle, Gray stood back and watched as Lady Nimarr, the eldest Shalador Queen, formally introduced Cassie to the other Queens who ruled in the Shalador reserves. Cassie had met several of the women a few days before when they came to Grayhaven and requested an audience, so Gray figured this introduction was for the benefit of the people who had gathered to get a look at the Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>Then some of the Tradition Keepers were introduced, including Ranon\u2019s grandfather Yairen, who was a Keeper of Music.</p><p>Gray looked at Theran, whose face seemed frozen in an expression between stubbornness and forced courtesy, then at Ranon, who stood tall and proud\u2014but not confident, despite his effort to appear so. Too much depended on this meeting for Ranon to feel confident of the outcome.</p><p>Gray watched Cassie talk to the Tradition Keepers. Her eyes never left Lord Yairen\u2019s face, but he knew her well enough to appreciate how much effort it took for her not to look at the old man\u2019s crippled hands. And he was certain she understood that the crippling hadn\u2019t been caused by age or accident.</p><p>The Queens wore new dresses that were simple in design. Over those dresses were finely embroidered vests\u2014old vests that were tended carefully and probably only worn for special occasions. The Tradition Keepers had worn their best clothes too, but even skilled seamstresses couldn\u2019t hide all the mending and patches in those clothes, and Gray admired the men and women for not using illusion spells to cover one truth about the reserves.</p> <p>He had lived a rough life in the rogue camps hidden in the Tamanara Mountains. These people had lived a desperate life, had endured more\u2014and worse\u2014than anyone else in Dena Nehele because of Dorothea SaDiablo\u2019s hatred for Jared.</p><p>Was it any wonder that Ranon felt so bitter and angry about the way his people had been treated? Was it any wonder that he took every opportunity to call attention to the way the Shaladorans lived\u2014and what they lived without?</p><p>But was Ranon hoping for more than Cassie could give?</p><p>Thank the Darkness, the ceremonies were over. At least until that evening when she would be the special guest at a feast held in her honor.</p><p>Honor,Cassidy thought as she brushed her hair. The Shaladorans had held on to honor when they could hold on to nothing else. She saw that truth in their dark eyes, heard it in the quiet voices. Unlike Ranon, who was vocal on his people\u2019s behalf, the Queens and elders had said nothing. They didn\u2019t have to. Just looking at them, just hearing the dignity in their voices told her more than words.</p><p>The boardinghouse told her even more. Shabby? Yes. But there was a new mattress on the bed in her room, new linens. The room had been scrubbed free of every speck of dirt, although the wallpaper still showed signs of water stains. Andeverything was free of psychic scents. There was no psychic residue on the bed or linens or carpets to reveal the previous owners.</p> <p>Who in the village had given up these new things in order to furnish this room for her visit?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how much she could do for these people, but she knew where to begin\u2014if the Shaladorans, and Theran, would let her do this much.</p><p>She looked at the door that opened into the adjoining bedroom. By rights it should have been her First Escort\u2019s room, but Ranon must have said something to the elders, and Gray had been assigned that room. His need to be close to her had been so obvious, Theran had said nothing about taking the room on the other side of hers\u2014the room without an adjoining door. Ranon and Shira were across the hall from her, sharing a room. At some point she would ask Shira if the elders\u2019 eyes had widened because it was a Black Widow and a Warlord Prince sharing a room or just because it was unusual in the reserves for unmarried lovers to share a room so openly.</p><p>For now, she would go outside and take a look at the boardinghouse\u2019s gardens and see what she could do.</p><p>When she opened the bedroom door, there were no guards waiting for her in the hallway, there were no escorts. There were no males of any kind.</p><p>But there was a Sceltie, who took one look at her and said, *Hat, Cassie.*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just\u2014\u201d</p><p>*Hat.*</p> <p>She fetched the brown, open-weave hat she had bought for this visit. Gray insisted she wear a hat to protect her skin, and Shira had talked her into shopping for one and had gone so far as to buy a hat too, laughingly saying it would become a trademark of the court\u2014any Lady serving in the First Circle would wear a hat as a symbol of her service to the Queen.</p><p>At the time, Cassidy had accepted the teasing and Shira\u2019s purchase of a hat without a second thought. Now she wondered how dear the cost of the hat had been for the Shalador witch.Her hat had been put on the court account, and its price would be deducted from the tithe the shopkeeper owed at the end of summer. But Shira had paid for her own hat.</p><p>Prince Sadi had offered to help pay some of her expenses while she was in Dena Nehele. Would he be willing to extend the Queen\u2019s gift to a small loan so she could pay her First Circle an advance against their quarterly wages? Would she have the courage to ask him?</p><p>*Cassie?*</p><p>She plunked the hat on her head and scowled at Vae. \u201cSee? I\u2019m wearing the hat.\u201d</p><p>*Yes.* Vae gave Cassidy a tail-tip wag. *Now Gray will not worry about your face molting.*</p><p>The image of pieces of skin fluttering to the ground like discarded bird feathers made her queasy. Kindred tended to describe things in relation to an animal, but that wasn\u2019t always a comfortable picture for humans when they were the subject of the conversation.</p><p>Vae headed for the stairs, pausing long enough to make sure Cassidy was following her.</p><p>*Gray is outside with Ranon and a young male who is a Warlord Prince,* Vae said. *He is family to Ranon, and Ranon wants you to see him, but there are worry smells too.*</p><p>\u201cRanon has probably spent a lot of years keeping his relative hidden from the Queens,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cIt can\u2019t be easy for him to bring a young Warlord Prince into the open.\u201d</p><p>*Why? You are Ranon\u2019s Queen. You are Dena Nehele\u2019s Queen. The pup belongs to you.*</p><p>You can\u2019t claim what you can\u2019t find,Cassidy thought.Hide some of the Queens so there will be someone left to rule. Hide the young Warlord Princes so that another generation can survive long enough to stand on a killing field and fight for their land.</p><p>The world was simple for Vae. Not because she was a dog, but because she had grown up in the village the Queen of Scelt called home. Even if only a few actually served in a court, a Territory Queen held the life of every person in her hands, as well as the land itself. Lady Morghann was a strong Queen and a close friend of Jaenelle Angelline, and Morghann\u2019s husband, Lord Khardeen, ruled the village of Maghre on his Lady\u2019s behalf. So Vae had no reason to doubt that praise and punishment would be given fairly\u2014and both would be given when deserved.</p><p>Vae wouldn\u2019t hesitate to bring someone who mattered to her to the attention of the Queen she served. For Ranon to bring the boy within sight of a Queen was a huge act of trust.</p><p>Cassidy stopped at the door leading outside as she thought about this young male Ranon had brought to the boardinghouse. Brother? Or son? Was that the reason he and Shira had been acting so uneasy? Was ittheir son or justhis son?</p><p>Neither, Cassidy decided as she rounded the side of the house and saw the three men. The boy was in his late teens\u2014too old to be anything but a brother or cousin to Ranon.</p><p>Gray\u2019s smile was warm and open when he saw her walking toward them. Ranon\u2019s expression was somewhere between determined and hopeful. And the youngster . . .</p><p>How many friends had he seen taken away only to return broken or crippled\u2014or never to return at all? She had no sense that the Shalador Queens had mistreated their own people, but the Shalador Queens had had little power, controlled as they had been by the Province Queens.</p><p>She stopped when there was enough distance between her and the men that Ranon could dismiss the young Warlord Prince before approaching her, eliminating the requirement of an introduction.</p><p>She watched Ranon assess the distance, and knew the moment when he realized what it meant. A moment later, he signaled the youngster and approached her.</p><p>\u201cLady, may I introduce my younger brother?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cYou may,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>\u201cLady, this is Prince Janos. Our father was Lord Yairen\u2019s son. Janos, this is Lady Cassidy, the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is an honor to be introduced to so great a Queen,\u201d Janos replied, bowing too low for the act to be respectful since his Summer-sky Jewel outranked her Rose.</p><p>*You bow too low,* Vae said. *That is rude. Sniffing female parts is rude too. That is confusing because there are good smells there, but it is something you must learn or you will get smacked on the nose. Or nipped.*</p><p>Janos\u2019s face turned dusky red as he snapped upright, making it clear that the insult had been unintentional. Ranon\u2019s coloring wasn\u2019t much better.</p><p>And Gray looked a bit too curious about female smells.</p><p>Thank the Darkness,Cassidy thought when the back door opened and a young woman walked out. Sixteen years old. Maybe seventeen. And beautiful in a way that made the breath catch when she moved. Long dark hair and green eyes. And a Purple Dusk Jewel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Reyhana?\u201d Ranon growled.</p><p>Surprised by his animosity, Cassidy stared at him. Yes, he outranked the girl, but she was a Queen and should be shown some respect unless Reyhana had done something to earn his anger.</p><p>\u201cI asked the elder Queens if I could work here as a service to the new Queen,\u201d Reyhana replied, her voice a shade too defiant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Queen. You shouldn\u2019t be doing servants\u2019 work,\u201d Ranon snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>The silence was more startling than a thunderclap would have been at that moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ranon said. \u201cShe\u2019s a Queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen who doesn\u2019t know how to work is of no use to her people,\u201d Reyhana said.</p><p>\u201cWell put, Sister,\u201d Cassidy said. Ranon looked like he\u2019d been clobbered with a fence post, and she was sorry for what she was about to do to him, but the girl was her priority now. \u201cMy family is not aristo, Prince Ranon. We never had servants. And even though by caste I am a Queen, I am also a daughter. So when my mother pulled out the rags and mops on cleaning day, I dusted and polished furniture, and mopped the floors right along with her. And when it was my turn to clean the bathroom, I had very bad thoughts about my brother.\u201d She looked Ranon right in the eyes. \u201cWhy is it that a man can hit the center of a bull\u2019s eye at one hundred paces and yet can\u2019t manage to get all of his stream in the toilet bowl when he\u2019s standing right over it?\u201d</p><p>Janos and Gray stood there with their mouths hanging open. Ranon, poor man, looked ready to slink away.</p> <p>But it was the suppressed snort from the young Queen that told Cassidy she had achieved her goal. She\u2019d talk to the girl later about the proper way to address a Warlord Prince when his Jewels were dominant.</p><p>She smiled at all of them. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I want to take a look at the vegetable garden.\u201d As she walked away, she added on a distaff thread, *Vae, keep an eye on the males. Make sure they\u2019re still breathing.*</p><p>One, two, three . . .</p><p>*Ranon? Ranon! Are you breathing?*</p><p>There, Cassidy thought. By the time Ranon, Gray, and Janos untangled themselves from Vae\u2019s attention, Reyhana would be safely among the older women\u2014the ones Prince Ranon would not dare offend without good reason.</p> <p>When she reached the vegetable garden, she stopped.</p><p>It should have been good soil, but it was parched, almost barren, and the plants struggling to grow wouldn\u2019t yield the bounty needed to feed these people. Not parched for water; the ground was still soft, a sure sign that there had been a long, soaking rain sometime in the past day or two. No, it was parched for the connection with a Queen, for that necessary give-and-take that kept the land healthy.</p><p>Why had the Shalador Queens neglected this? Cassidy wondered as she knelt at the edge of the bed. Surely they were aware of the need. Had they been so afraid to call attention to themselves that they hadn\u2019t done this one thing that would have helped so many? Or had they stopped because they realized that if they made this land richer than the rest of Dena Nehele by following traditions, it would have been taken away? Ranon had told them that the reserves were half the size they had been when Lady Grizelle and Lia had established those parts of Dena Nehele as a place that belonged to the Shalador people.</p><p>Well, it was time everyone stopped denying one of the duties of a Queen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn around. If she looked at him, Gray would join her\u2014and raise too many objections. Ceremony could come later. First she would show themwhy ; then she would show them how.</p><p>Cassidy called in a short-bladed knife and made a cut on each palm. As the blood flowed, she vanished the knife and pressed her hands into the soil\u2014and sent her Rose-Jeweled power flowing through her blood and into the ground.</p> <p>So parched. So needy. So empty for so long.</p><p>Power flowed, spreading through the vegetable garden like sweet rain.</p><p>The land was the true root and heart of the Blood\u2019s power. They were the caretakers of the Realms. That was more than society and cities. It was more than music and literature, more than ruling over the landens. A connection to the land was an important part of what made the Blood who and what they were, and the Queens were the bridge because their power supported the land.</p><p>So parched. So needy. Soaking up everything she was willing to give. She could feel the land responding under her hands, wanting more. Wanting everything.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>A little more. She could give a little more. Saturation would come soon, and the land would stop draining her.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>So parched. So needy. To be wanted so much.</p> <p>Then the power was draining too fast, too much. But she couldn\u2019t pull away, couldn\u2019t turn away when there was so much need.</p><p>Just a little\u2014</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>The ground felt soft and smelled lightly of herbs. She didn\u2019t remember seeing herbs in the vegetable garden.</p><p>Groaning, Cassidy rolled onto her side. Her eyes felt sleep-crusted, but it was too much effort to pry them open. One hand pressed on the surface next to her head. Pillow. Was she in bed? How did she get there? What in the name of Hell happened? Every muscle ached, and she felt parched, like she had been wrung so dry she was hollow.</p><p>Quiet rustling. Movement. Then a weight settled beside her on the bed.</p><p>Had to be Shira since the psychic scent was female, but she couldn\u2019t tell anything beyond that\u2014a sure sign thatsomething was wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Cassidy muttered with her eyes still closed. \u201cAm I late for the evening\u2019s feast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy about two days,\u201d said a voice that wasn\u2019t Shira\u2019s but held a vaguely familiar tartness.</p><p>She rubbed the crustiness from her eyes and looked at the woman sitting beside her. Short, spiky, white-blond hair. A thin face that looked a decade older than the woman\u2019s real age. Gray Jewel and Hourglass pendant. And a wicked smile that curved unpainted lips but didn\u2019t reach the glacier blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cLady Karla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss kiss.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy struggled to prop herself up on one elbow\u2014and failed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking after you. I was at the Keep visiting Uncle Saetan when Vae arrived howling that you were dying and needed help from a Healer who knew about Queen things. Being a Healer and a Queen, I figured I would know how to deal with whatever happened. So here I am.\u201d She paused, then added, \u201cLucivar is here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy groaned. \u201cNot Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not the worst of it.\u201d Another pause. \u201cMaybe he is the worst of it, but he\u2019s not all of it.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an idiot.\u201d</p><p>It was said lightly, but Cassidy heard the anger under the words.</p><p>\u201cYou let your power flow without restraint, without limit,\u201d Karla said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always done that,\u201d Cassidy protested.</p><p>\u201cThen you missed a step in your education.\u201d Karla\u2019s voice stung like a slap. \u201cThat did you no harm in Dharo, where the give-and-take of power is done so often it doesn\u2019t take that much power to renew what had been used. But this land wasempty, Cassidy. I don\u2019t think anyone has made that kind of offering here for generations. You were a drop of power away from breaking your Rose Jewel. Not just draining it,breaking it. If that Warlord Prince hadn\u2019t had the sense to pick you up and get you into the house to break the connection to the land completely, at best you would have been broken back to your Birthright Tiger Eye. At worst . . .\u201d Karla shook her head and sighed heavily. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason to dwell on that, is there? You still wear the Rose. And thank the Darkness for that.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Thank the Darkness for that.</p><p>Information began to sink in. Cassidy huffed and grunted, but she got herself propped up on one elbow. \u201cTwo days? I\u2019ve been asleep fortwo days ?\u201d</p><p>Karla nodded. \u201cWe can call it \u2018sleeping,\u2019 which is a very generous word to use since even the deepest healing sleep usually isn\u2019t that deep\u2014not when there\u2019s hope of the person coming out of it. I was about to call Lucivar and arrange to bring you to the Keep so Jaenelle could look at you. Then you shifted to a more natural sleep, and I decided to wait a few more hours. Which was fortunate for you\u2014and this village.\u201d</p><p>Keep? Jaenelle? Damn. If Lucivar was here, she couldn\u2019t brush this off in her next report to Prince Sadi. And if she had been \u201cill\u201d for the past two days . . .</p><p>\u201cThe First Circle,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t figure out how to declare war on a vegetable garden, so they\u2019re waiting for some indication that you\u2019re going to recover. The only reason this room isn\u2019t filled with hysterical males watching every breath you take is because I wear the Gray and outrank them all. Also, I threatened to rip the balls off any male foolish enough to enter without my permission\u2014and Lucivar threatened to break all the bones of any man who eventried to enter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucivar threatened my court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourt, family, village. He was too pissed off about what happened to you to be particular about whose bones were going to meet his fist.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy flopped on her back. This was getting worse and worse. Then she struggled upright again. \u201cFamily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, father, brother\u2014and your cousin Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd may the Darkness be merciful. My darling, everything has a price, and scaring the shit out of that many Warlord Princes . . . Well, how you\u2019re feeling physically is only the first part of the payment. There were so many who wanted to express an opinion about what you did, they ended up drawing straws. The two short straws get to yell at you.\u201d Karla called in a small hourglass and set it on the bedside table. \u201cHere. A gift. Ten minutes of sand in the glass. That\u2019s how long each of them is allowed to voice his full opinion of what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon and Gray drew the short straws. However, I\u2019ll warn you now that I don\u2019t think your father is going to hold back his thoughts on the matter. And neither is Lucivar.\u201d Using Craft, Karla floated a mug over to the bed. \u201cHere, drink this. When you showed signs of finally waking up, I made this tonic for you.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy leaned back against the headboard and took the mug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have the remainder of today to rest and recover. After that, darling, you face your family and court. And Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy took a sip of the tonic and fought the desire to gulp it down. Her body craved whatever was in this brew. Craved it as much as the land had craved the connection with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took another sip, then remembered the last thing she\u2019d seen before the world had gone dark. \u201cGray. Is he all right? He must have been upset when I . . . fell.\u201d</p><p>A strange look came into Karla\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou woke up more than the land, Cassidy. Much more.\u201d</p><p>Ranon cautiously approached the vegetable garden. He didn\u2019t want to deal with Lucivar\u2019s thunderous temper or Prince Aaron\u2019s snarling restraint\u2014or the worry he saw in Lord Burle\u2019s eyes. And even though the boardinghouse\u2019s grounds gave him plenty of room to maneuver, he didn\u2019t want to be caught alone with the witch who had brought Cassidy\u2019s family to Eyota. The Gray-Jeweled Queen was intimidating enough, but she had stayed inside with Cassidy. Surreal SaDiablo was a long step past scary as far as he and all the other men were concerned, andshe had been prowling the house and grounds\u2014and the village.</p> <p>Going down on one knee, he reached out to brush a fingertip over the leaves of one little plant. A strong, healthy plant growing vigorously now. All the plants in the garden were growing vigorously now\u2014had started growing within hours of Cassidy\u2019s collapse.</p><p>Gray had noticed the blood soaked into the ground, but the cuts on Cassidy\u2019s palms hadn\u2019t looked that deep, and Shira hadn\u2019t thought Cassidy had lost enough blood to account for losing consciousness. Andnothing Shira or the Queens knew could explain what had drained Cassidy\u2019s Rose Jewel to such a dangerous level so quickly.</p><p>If there had been some kind of attack, why hadn\u2019t she called for help? And how could she have been attacked when he and the others had been standing right there? Gray was the first to realize something was wrong, had snatched her up and run into the boardinghouse. But they still didn\u2019t know what had happened\u2014or why.</p><p>Shira wouldn\u2019t talk about the vision she\u2019d seen, wouldn\u2019t confirm if this was the danger that might have cost them the first Queen to give them hope since Lia.</p><p>Was this his fault somehow? Had he failed in his duties? How?How?</p> <p>Ranon felt the other presence, picked up the psychic scent, and knew who was about to join him.</p><p>Theran gave them all cold silence, which was understandable since Daemon Sadi was holding him personally responsible for Cassidy\u2019s well-being and Grayhaven hadn\u2019t wanted her to come to Eyota in the first place. But Gray\u2019s anger and distress was a hot, pulsing, living thing. Until they knew what was wrong with Cassidy, Gray was an unsheathed weapon, and no one knew the sharpness of that blade or how deeply it could cut.</p><p>He waited until Gray knelt beside him. Neither of them could resist coming out to this spot several times a day.</p><p>\u201cThey grew even more overnight,\u201d Ranon said, keeping his voice quiet. \u201cWe\u2019ll actually get a decent crop from this garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do it again,\u201d Gray snarled. \u201cThis almost killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d And he did. He also knew the Queens had looked upon this garden in shock initially, thenalmost understood how this had happened. Almost.</p> <p>\u201cCompany,\u201d Gray said, not turning his attention away from the plants.</p><p>Ranon looked over his shoulder and sighed. Reyhana and Janos. The young Queen had been out to look at this garden as much as he and Gray, and Janos had assigned himself as Reyhana\u2019s escort whenever she left the boardinghouse.</p><p>Then he stiffened and tapped Gray\u2019s arm before rising to his feet. \u201cMore company.\u201d</p><p>Gray sprang to his feet. Ranon grabbed one arm to keep Gray from rushing toward Lady Karla\u2014especially because Aaron stepped out of the house and leaned against the wall, clearly not interfering and just as clearly standing watch over the Gray-Jeweled Queen who walked with a measured step that had nothing to do with dignity and everything to do with needing the support of a cane.</p><p>Whatever was wrong with her body, there was nothing wrong with her mind\u2014or her power.</p><p>Grizelle had been like this,Ranon thought.Lia had been like this.</p><p>He\u2019d grown up on stories of Grizelle and, especially, Lia. Had grown up fantasizing about what it would be like to be in the presence of a Gray-Jeweled Queen. He\u2019d always thought of Grizelle and Lia as protectors of Dena Nehele\u2014and they had been\u2014but it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that the power that protected the land also made those women very dangerous witches. Not until Karla had stepped out of the Coach that had brought her to Eyota.</p><p>\u201cPrince Gray,\u201d Karla said when she reached them. \u201cPrince Ranon.\u201d She tipped her head in a silent greeting to Reyhana and Janos.</p> <p>Janos hesitated, still not certain of how to respond to a Queen who wasn\u2019t from the Shalador reserves. Reyhana, on the other hand, took the greeting as an invitation to join the adults.</p><p>\u201cCassidy is awake,\u201d Karla said, looking at Gray. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She needs to stay quiet for the rest of today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cI won\u2019t yell at her yet. I just want to see her.\u201d</p><p>Karla\u2019s lips curved in a wicked smile. \u201cDarling, her body has been working hard to regain its balance and, quite frankly, the girl smells a bit ripe. Until she has a chance to bathe and clean her teeth, you\u2019re the last person she\u2019s going to want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Gray paused. Looked thoughtful. \u201cOh. Because I\u2019m courting her? But I don\u2019t care if she smells.\u201d</p><p>Karla stared at Gray until he muttered, \u201cWell, Idon\u2019t care.\u201d But the stare ended that part of the discussion.</p><p>\u201cI think Cassidy would appreciate some assistance from her mother and the court\u2019s Healer,\u201d Karla said. \u201cAnd I think everyone with a penis should stay away from that hallway and those rooms for the next couple of hours. Is that clear enough?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Lucivar come around the corner, Ranon said, \u201cThat\u2019s clear. Can you tell us what happened to Lady Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it in simple terms?\u201d Karla asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Gray snarled and took a step toward Karla.</p><p>Aaron sprang away from the house but stopped and looked at Lucivar, who held up a hand to signal Aaron to stay back while he headed for their happy little group\u2014slowly.</p><p>\u201cShe ignored her training and her common sense and almost damaged herself beyond repair,\u201d Karla said. \u201cWhat would you call it? There was no need for what happened. In fact, there was every reason for caution and restraint. She could have made her point without risk to herself, and without the anguish she caused all of you. It was an irresponsible thing for a Queen to do, and the Darkness only knows what possessed her to do it.\u201d Her eyes turned a colder blue as she focused on Gray. \u201cAnd if you think I\u2019m being harsh, go up to the Keep and talk to the High Lord. Having been on the receiving end of one of his verbal lashings when I did something stupid, I can tell you Cassidy is getting off lightly.\u201d</p><p>Gray took a step back. \u201cThe High Lord would have yelled at Cassie?\u201d \u201cWhen he\u2019s really pissed off about something, the High Lord does not yell,\u201d Karla said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard him yell,\u201d Gray said. \u201cSort of yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you heard surface temper, which is a very mild thing compared to his real temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I learn to do that?\u201d Reyhana asked, pointing to the garden.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon, Gray, and Janos said.</p><p>Karla looked at the men and shook her head. \u201cYes. I can show\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Reyhana said.</p><p>Ranon turned on the girl. Reyhana was the most promising young Queen in the Shalador reserves, and bringing her to Cassidy\u2019s attention was enough of a risk. The girl could not be allowed to challenge a Queen as strong as Karla.</p><p>Before he could say anything, Reyhana raised her chin and took a step toward Karla.</p><p>\u201cI mean no disrespect, Lady,\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cBut if I am worthy of learning this Queen\u2019s duty, I should be taught by the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>The men held themselves tense and silent as the two witches measured each other.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told by Prince Aaron, the last young Queen who apprenticed with Cassidy caused her a great deal of pain,\u201d Karla said. \u201cThat kind of betrayal isn\u2019t easy to forget. What Cassidy did here is important for you to learn. Vital, in fact, for the land as well as benefiting you. If she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable teaching you, then I will before I return to Glacia.\u201d</p><p>Reyhana hesitated, and in that breath between one moment and the next, Ranon saw a young Queen mature a little more.</p><p>\u201cIs that what happened to your legs?\u201d Reyhana asked. \u201cBetrayal?\u201d</p><p>Karla nodded. \u201cI was poisoned by a member of my court. Someone who was loyal to my uncle instead of being loyal to me. I should have died from that vicious stew of poisons. Damaged legs are a small price to pay for surviving.\u201d She raised a hand, a simple gesture that ended that conversation. \u201cNow. If the young Lady is going to learn this particular bit of Craft, you three\u2014yes, that includes you, puppy\u2014need to learn how to deal with a Queen. Lucivar will teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach them what?\u201d Lucivar asked, finally stepping up to join them.</p><p>\u201cTeach them what to do when a Queen is being stupid,\u201d Karla replied.</p><p>\u201cBefore or after you knock her on her ass to get her attention?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>Karla bared her teeth in what might have been a smile and said, \u201cKiss kiss.\u201d</p><p>Ranon blinked. He\u2019d never heardanyone say that and have it mean \u201cshove a knife up your ass.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar bared his teeth in an equally insincere smile. \u201cCassidy\u2019s awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Karla said, her whole demeanor changing from challenging to cautious as she studied Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else is staying with her for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to talk to Devra and Shira about giving Cassidy a bit of company and assistance.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar nodded. \u201cFine. Then you can strip down and sweat a little. I want to have a look at those legs when they\u2019re working.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitchling, what part of that sounded like a choice?\u201d</p><p>Gold eyes locked with glacier blue.

You\u2019re helping me with this.\u201d</p><p>Ranon felt an odd twitch in the belly. Surreal was standing in the yard, halfway between the house and their group. Open ground. Sure, she had probably used a sight shield to get that close without being noticed. Sure, Lucivar and Karla had been a distraction, but . . .</p><p>Lucivar had known she was there.</p><p>. . . this wasn\u2019t a witch a man wanted coming up on him without warning.</p> <p>\u201cHelping you with what?\u201d Surreal shouted back.</p><p>\u201cWith making this lot sweat,\u201d Lucivar replied.</p><p>Surreal laughed. \u201cIn that case, sugar, I\u2019ll go hone a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Karla laughed and headed for the house, while Surreal moved to join her.</p><p>Lucivar gave Ranon a lazy, arrogant smile. \u201cShow some balls, Ranon. You\u2019re not afraid of one little assassin, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAssassin?\u201d Reyhana squeaked. Or maybe that was Janos.</p><p>Lucivar shrugged. \u201cSurreal is Dea al Mon. I think they\u2019re born knowing what to do with a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Ranon muttered\u2014but not until Lucivar walked away. Then he looked at Gray, who was staring at the house with a strange, thoughtful expression in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCassie has some interesting friends,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Interesting,Ranon thought as the four of them separated for a few minutes before joining Lucivar for whatever lessons the Eyrien had in mind. Yes, the Blood from Kaeleer were certainly interesting. But he wondered if Theran was paying any attention to their visitors and the influence they were having on the people here. They were both the forge and the fire that could shape the Blood in Dena Nehele into bright steel\u2014or leave them broken. And he wondered if, like himself, Theran was paying attention to the kind of man Prince Jared Blaed Grayhaven was becoming in the heat of that forge.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a reason to be concerned about Karla?\u201d Surreal asked.</p><p>\u201cA particular reason?\u201d Lucivar shook his head. \u201cHer Master of the Guard works with her to help her maintain strength in her legs, and I won\u2019t step on the man\u2019s territory. But that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t take an opportunity to assess her for myself and send along a suggestion or two if I think something needs more of his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre her legs getting weaker?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, but the day will come when they won\u2019t support her.\u201d Considering what Jaenelle had to do in order to save Karla, the fact that Karla could walk at all was testimony to Jaenelle\u2019s skills as a Healer and Karla\u2019s strength of will. But the ever-present cane and the face aged beyond its years were a reminder that even the best Healer and the strongest will couldn\u2019t eliminate the effects of terrible poisons that should have destroyed a Gray-Jeweled Queen. \u201cI\u2019ll help her postpone that day for as long as possible,\u201d Lucivar added quietly. Then he smiled at Surreal. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good.\u201d And since she hadn\u2019t tried to knife him, he figured she\u2019d finally forgiven him for the time she had spent in Ebon Rih.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling more comfortable about a lot of things,\u201d she replied. \u201cAbout myself. About this.\u201d She called in a stiletto.</p><p>Lucivar tensed\u2014which seemed to amuse her.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d she said, vanishing the stiletto. \u201cWhen I first arrived at Chaosti\u2019s clan, Grandmammy Teele gave me some old sacks. I spent the evenings embroidering your name on them, then stuffed them with rags, tied them to a tree, and stabbed them until my arm cramped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Lucivar said. He\u2019d pushed her because he cared. He hadn\u2019t meant to push her so much she hated him.</p><p>Surreal laughed. \u201cYou should see your face. Breathe easy, Yaslana. I was just teasing. I would never spend that much time on embroidery.\u201d</p><p>This time he swore in Eyrien and said a whole lot of things he didn\u2019t want her to understand.</p><p>\u201cI do recognize some of those words,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She grinned at him.</p><p>He stared at the people gathering in the yard. They stared back at him and Surreal like dumb sheep facing a couple of wolves.</p><p>Dumb sheep.</p><p>Lucivar frowned. \u201cWhere is Vae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Surreal replied. \u201cShe came with me as far as Dharo when I went to fetch Cassidy\u2019s family, then continued on to Scelt instead of coming back with us.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar looked at Surreal. Surreal looked at him. They headed for their flock of two-legged sheep.</p><p>\u201cNot our problem,\u201d Surreal said.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not our problem,\u201d Lucivar agreed. Especially when he had a wife who wouldn\u2019t appreciate dealing with morning sickness and a small boy all by herself for more than a couple of days.</p><p>Assuming there would be morning sickness. And thatwould be his problem. And his fault. And a few other things, depending on whether Marian felt happy about being pregnant or bitchy about throwing up. So he wasn\u2019t going to wonder what Vae was doing in Scelt.</p><p>But he was certain that whatever the Sceltie was up to was going to besomeone\u2019s problem.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie! Are you allowed to do that?*</p><p>Cassidy closed her eyes and counted to ten to stop herself from throwing the weeding claw at the Sceltie. All she wanted was an hour to work in the garden while she answered some of Reyhana\u2019s questions. \u201cYes, Vae. I\u2019m allowed to do this. I\u2019mfine. \u201d</p><p>*Gray? Is Cassie allowed to do that?*</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to listen to you?\u201d Reyhana whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Sceltie,\u201d Cassidy grumped. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t listen to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe listens to Prince Gray,\u201d Reyhana pointed out.</p><p>And that particular alliance of Warlord Prince and Sceltie had been an unrelenting pain in the ass ever since Lucivar, Karla, and the rest of the Blood from Kaeleer left two days ago. The biggest difference between dog and man was that Vae never stopped yapping at her unless she was sitting or sleeping, and Gray wouldn\u2019t speak to her. Hadn\u2019t said one single word to her after Karla said she was well enough to leave her room in the boardinghouse. But he was always nearby, watching everything she did. Judging everything she did.</p><p>*Gray? Should I nip?*</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy said, dropping the weeding claw and rising from the spot she and Reyhana had been weeding. \u201cYou shouldnot nip. Gray, tell her!\u201d</p><p>There was a wild look in Gray\u2019s green eyes, a look that hadn\u2019t been there before she collapsed. This wasn\u2019t the boy who had been damaged by torture and frozen emotionally and mentally. And it was more than the man Gray had been becoming since she\u2019d met him. This was a sharp-tempered stranger who was pissed off with her but refused to discuss the reason for his anger.</p><p>Well, fine.</p><p>No,not fine.</p><p>\u201cGray, I\u2019d like a word with you,\u201d Cassidy said, heading away from the rest of the men who were hovering in the garden, standing guard over her. When he didn\u2019t move, she snarled, \u201cJared Blaed,attend !\u201d</p><p>Thatgot his attention. His eyes blazed hot as he strode to where she waited, and it took everything in her not to back down in the face of what was heading toward her.</p><p>Warlord Prince.Most of the time it was easy to forget Gray belonged to that caste of males. She never forgot what kind of man she was dealing with when she was around Theran or Talon or Ranon, but caste hadn\u2019t been the dominant psychic scent when she was with Gray. Until now.</p><p>\u201cDo you think using my real name is going to intimidate me into doing what you want?\u201d Gray snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the other men. They were all paying attention to this little drama, so she kept her voice low. \u201cI made a mistake, an error in judgment. It happens. I\u2019m sorry it upset you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn error in judgment.\u201d His voice was hard as stone. \u201cYou almost kill yourselffor no reason , and you think it\u2019s nothing more than an error?\u201d</p><p>He started to walk away. She grabbed his arm\u2014then jerked her hand away in shock when he snarled at her.</p><p>\u201cGray, talk to me,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>Her temper snapped. She could feel the heat of it rising through her body until she was sure her hair was going to stand on end like a fan of fire.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to talk to me, then you damn well better talk to somebody because I\u2019ve had enough of your temper and your silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d As he walked away from her, Gray shouted, \u201cVae! You\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that will get both of you out of my hair,\u201d Cassidy muttered as she stomped back to the garden.</p><p>Reyhana looked away, wrestled with a weed, and swore politely when the top of the plant broke off, leaving the tap root.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pull the tap roots of those weeds out unless you do it after a soaking rain,\u201d Cassidy said, kneeling beside the younger woman. \u201cBut you can use Craft to create a slick shaft around the root so you can pull it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you show me?\u201d Reyhana asked.</p><p>\u201cI can show you,\u201d Cassidy replied, then added silently,Without those two yapping at me.</p><p>Ranon watched Gray head right for him. Prudence and training told him he should shield when another warrior came toward him in a way that screamed aggression. But this was Gray, so he held his ground until the other man took that last step and grabbed a fistful of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou guard her, Ranon,\u201d Gray said, his voice so rough it was hardly recognizable. \u201cYou hear me? First Escort or not, Theran doesn\u2019t care enough about her to do what\u2019s right, so you guard her until I get back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Gray\u2019s smile was razor-sharp. \u201cI\u2019m following my Queen\u2019s command. I\u2019m going to talk to somebody.\u201d</p><p>*I will take care of Gray,* Vae said, using a private psychic thread aimed at him.</p> <p>Ranon waited until Gray rounded the corner of the house. Then he rubbed his hands over his face and sighed. After days of observing Gray and Cassidy\u2019s silent argument, he wanted to talk to someone too. But he\u2019d have to wait until Gray returned\u2014or until Talon rose this evening and could take over the watch. Then he would go to his grandfather\u2019s house, and Yairen would make a brew of spiced whiskey and coffee, a drink the old man only made when men needed to speak to other men about difficult matters.</p><p>He had no right to interfere between a man and a woman, but Cassidy was also his Queen, and he needed guidance in order to walk this particular knife\u2019s edge.</p><p>He crossed the yard and knelt on the other side of Cassidy, who ignored him and continued to explain to Reyhana something about drawing out the full root of a weed.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ranon said quietly, \u201cyou probably don\u2019t want anyone with a cock within twenty paces of you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Cassidy said, still not looking at him.</p> <p>\u201cIf you promise that you\u2019ll do nothing to hurt yourself because you\u2019re upset with Gray, I\u2019ll leave you in peace.\u201d Soon after she\u2019d come to Dena Nehele, she\u2019d worked her hands into a bloody mess because she was distraught over something Theran had done. The court had learned a hard lesson that day, and he wasn\u2019t about to let it happen again. \u201cCassidy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she hurt herself over a man?\u201d Reyhana said, bristling with challenge.</p><p>His temper sharpened. Reyhana wore Purple Dusk; he wore Opal. He couldn\u2019t allow a challenge to go unanswered, even if the girl was a Queen.Especially because the girl was a Queen.</p><p>\u201cSister, you\u2019re being disrespectful,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cPrince Ranon has reason to ask the question, and as one of my First Circle, he is within his rights to challenge me if he believes I am acting in a way that will cause me harm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Reyhana said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking as one of my First Circle?\u201d Cassidy asked, finally looking at him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m asking as a friend.\u201d</p><p>Emotions flashed in her hazel eyes, which turned tear-bright for a moment\u2014and he wondered if anyone in her previous court had given her more than duty.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I give you my word as a friend that I won\u2019t act imprudently because of this quarrel with Gray.\u201d She hesitated, then added on a psychic thread. *This quarrel with Gray upsets me, but it hasn\u2019t hurt me.*</p><p>He nodded to indicate he understood the difference. \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave you Ladies to your work.\u201d</p><p>When he turned toward the boardinghouse, he froze for a moment before he strode across the lawn. With the exception of Talon and Theran, the rest of the First Circle was waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cIs the Queen all right?\u201d Powell asked when he joined them.</p> <p>Ranon nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we should do?\u201d Archerr asked. \u201cPowell, you\u2019ve read those Protocol books more thoroughly than the rest of us. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave her word that she wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt herself,\u201d Ranon said quietly\u2014and felt some of the tension ease in the other men.</p><p>\u201cCan we scrounge a couple of chairs and a small table from somewhere?\u201d Shaddo asked.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>\u201cI noticed flagstones under the big tree,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cThey\u2019re grown over some, but I think that area used to be a place for people to sit out under the shade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Powell smiled. \u201cChairs, a small table, cold drinks, and something to nibble. A subtle invitation to balance work and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we start cleaning up the flagstones and hauling furniture out to the tree, won\u2019t it be obvious what we\u2019re doing\u2014and why?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cBut sometimes a suggestion made by actions instead of words is more easily heard\u2014and also less likely to offend.\u201d</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>*High Lord? High Lord!*</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Saetan muttered. Setting aside the book and just-warmed glass of yarbarah, he pushed out of the comfortable stuffed chair. Didn\u2019tanyone remember that he had retired from the living Realms? \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>But it was Gray, not Vae, who walked into the room. One look at the young Warlord Prince\u2019s face, and Saetan knew the reason for this particular visit.</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy said I need to talk to someone,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>I\u2019ll bet she did,Saetan thought. Noticing the way Gray eyed the furniture and seemed ready to burst, he sent a thought to Draca, the Keep\u2019s Seneschal. *I need some firewood in one of the courtyards now and refreshments in about thirty minutes.*</p><p>*I thought ass much,* Draca replied. *It iss already prepared.*</p><p>*You don\u2019t have to sound so amused,* Saetan grumbled. Taking Gray\u2019s arm, he said, \u201cWe will talk, but first things first.\u201d</p><p>Sun and shade, Saetan thought as he marched Gray out to the courtyard. Being in sunlight would have given him a vicious headache this late in the morning, but staying in the shade would give him enough time to deal with Gray before he needed to retire.</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d Saetan said. He picked up a piece of the firewood, held it over a large, wooden half barrel, released one tiny blast of Red power through his hands\u2014and turned a piece of firewood as big as his thigh into wood chips.</p><p>Gray looked inside the barrel and frowned.</p><p>\u201cNow you do it,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the youngster until Gray picked up a piece of firewood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Yes, you do.Placing his hands below Gray\u2019s, he taught the boy how to destroy an object using power. Nothing Gray couldn\u2019t do just by following instinct. But unleashing power and letting it destroy whatever was in its path wasn\u2019t the same as unleashing it with control and purpose.</p><p>Once Gray had the sense of how much Purple Dusk power to use in order to blast the firewood into wood chips of an acceptable size, Saetan settled in the shade and watched Gray drain away the anger that had grown to the point of needing a target.</p><p>The barrel was half-filled with wood chips before Gray paused and said, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you afford to replace furniture if you blast it into pieces?\u201d Saetan asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this. Chopping wood and using muscle instead of Craft works too, as long as you remember to shield before you pick up the ax. There is no reason to be careless or stupid just because your mind is chewing on a problem. In this case, you\u2019re working off some temper by changing firewood into wood chips.\u201d Saetan paused, then added, \u201cWhich, I\u2019m told, are an excellent mulch in a garden.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s mouth fell open. Then he began sputtering. \u201cGarden? I\u2019m making mulchfor a garden ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Gray huffed. He paced. He blasted a few more pieces of firewood into wood chips.</p><p>Finally he growled, \u201cI guess Cassie is going to have plenty of mulch for her gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know several Queens who always have plenty of mulch for their gardens,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Gray stared at the barrel and sighed, the sign Saetan had been waiting for to indicate that enough of the boy\u2019s temper was spent.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some water on the table over there,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cPour a glass for yourself. You could use it by now.\u201d</p><p>There was more than water on the table. There was a basin of warm water, soap, and a towel; a plate of fruit, cheese, and small sandwiches; and a ravenglass goblet filled with yarbarah.</p><p>He watched Gray as the boy washed up before pouring a glass of water and drinking it. Strength and scars\u2014and the temper that made a Warlord Prince a law unto himself. And a little something more.</p><p>Gray refilled the water glass, hesitated a moment over the plate of food, then picked up the yarbarah and brought it to him.</p><p>A simple choice, but it confirmed for him why Jared Blaed Grayhaven had made the journey from Dena Nehele to the Keep in Kaeleer in order to talk to him instead of talking to Talon or anyone else in Cassie\u2019s court.</p><p>Gray had come for the same reason Khardeen, Aaron, Chaosti, and Elan had come to him when they needed to talk out frustration caused by a woman who was a lover as well as a Queen. He had been the Dark Court\u2019s honorary uncle as well as the Steward, even before the court had officially formed. Those young men had come to him because they trusted his advice. They hadn\u2019t always liked it, but they knew they could trust it.</p><p>Using Craft, Saetan floated the plate of food over to the bench where Gray sat, drinking water and staring at the flagstones.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk or listen?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>Gray shrugged.</p><p>Not a surprising response. Now that the anger had dimmed, unhappiness was settling in.</p><p>\u201cEverything is supposed to befine now,\u201d Gray muttered.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Cassidy is tired of you being angry with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So I\u2019m not supposed to be angry anymore.\u201d Gray\u2019s hand tightened around the glass. \u201cWell, I am angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your anger,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s your choice how long you hold on to it. But people make mistakes. Most of the time, mistakes can be forgiven. Some mistakes do enough harm to break what two people feel for each other. Sometimes the anger doesn\u2019t go away, and that means you need to walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk away from Cassie?\u201d Gray looked shocked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to accept that she made an error in judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t care enough about us to take care of herself.\u201d Saetan drank the yarbarah and let chilling silence fill the courtyard. Gray eyed him and wisely offered no other comment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe cares, Prince,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cIf you think otherwise, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d</p><p>Gray hung his head. \u201cI know she does. I just don\u2019t understand why she let the Craft go on so long that she hurt herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whip that drives Cassie was shaped before she arrived in Dena Nehele. It left scars.\u201d</p> <p>Gray raised his head and looked at him.</p><p>No, Saetan thought,not Gray. Jared Blaed . Two sides of one person. Gray was the man who loved Cassie and gardens. Jared Blaed was the Warlord Prince committed to his Queen.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jared Blaed asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s of no importance,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cNeither are the men who chose her over Cassidy. Whatis important is that the hurt still festers inside Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to prove to us that she has something to offer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so. That\u2019s why a simple thing that Queens do all the time in Kaeleer almost turned into a tragic error.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a mistake,\u201d Gray said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she cares so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gray sighed.</p> <p>Crisis over,Saetan thought, draining the goblet.Until the next time. \u201cEat. Then go home and smooth things over with Cassie.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave him a sideways look. Assessing. Measuring. \u201cIt would smooth things over a lot faster if Cassie and I could have sex.\u201d</p><p>Saetan said dryly, \u201cBoyo, we\u2019re pretty sure Marian is pregnant, and she\u2019s very queasy today. Daemonar senses there is something wrong with his mama and is acting out, and Lucivar is ready to chew stone trying to deal with his misbehaving boy. Today isnot the day to ask him about sex.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cIf we hadyour permission . . .\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cNot a chance, puppy. Lucivar had good reasons for setting firm boundaries for what you and Cassie can and can\u2019t do, and he\u2019ll be the one who decides when you\u2019re ready for the next stage.\u201d It didn\u2019t sound like Gray needed as much emotional protection as he\u2019d needed a few weeks ago, but that didn\u2019t mean he had the maturity yet to be a Queen\u2019s lover.</p><p>Still, the fact that the boy was starting to question those boundaries was a good sign that Gray was growing into a healthy man instead of remaining a wounded boy. Knowing how firmly the leash needed to be held while a young Warlord Prince made the transition to adult male, Saetan added, \u201cAnd from where I\u2019m sitting, boyo, those reasons still apply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Gray looked disappointed, but only for a moment. Then he gave his attention to the plate floating beside him and ate every bit of food with a young man\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>Vae appeared on the edge of the courtyard. *Gray? Gray! Draca says it is time to go home. The High Lord will open the Gate for you. Then he needs to sleep because this is his sleep time.*</p> <p>Gray sprang to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I didn\u2019t mean to keep you from your rest.\u201d</p><p>Saetan hesitated. In some ways, what he was about to do was a small thing, a simple choice. But the offer, and all of its underlying significance, would ripple through Dena Nehele if it was accepted. \u201cYou can call me Uncle Saetan, if you like.\u201d</p><p>The words were absorbed. The significance was understood. And one more inner layer of defense that had protected Gray the boy but hobbled Jared Blaed the man was sloughed off.</p><p>On the walk through the Keep to the Dark Altar and the Gate, Gray talked about the Shalador village and the people he\u2019d met there. It was clear that Ranon was becoming a good friend and that he and Gray were settling into a working relationship that was typical of a strong, healthy court where the males liked and respected each other\u2014the kind of working relationship he\u2019d seen in the Dark Court.</p><p>What wasn\u2019t clear was how Theran was responding to any of the drama taking place in Eyota.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran tried to ignore the sick feeling in his gut\u2014and tried not to think about the last time Gray had disappeared. Judging by the tight expression on his face and the grim look in his eyes, Talon was trying not to think about that too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s not in the village?\u201d Talon asked for the third time.</p><p>Ranon shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked. I even checked the house that accommodates unattached males. He\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night. \u201cShould one of us go back to Grayhaven?\u201d Theran asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the only place he knows in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have gone back to the rogue camps in the Tamanara Mountains,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Theran said. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t have gone alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cHe took Vae with him.\u201d</p><p>As if speaking the name had conjured the dog, Vae rounded the corner of the boardinghouse and bounded over to them.</p><p>*Where is Cassie?* Vae asked. *Gray is looking for her.*</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m looking for Gray,\u201d Talon growled.</p><p>Vae\u2019s tail stopped moving midwag. She spun around to face the way she had come. *Gray? Gray! Talon is looking for you!* Then she trotted off as if she had no more time for humans.</p><p>Gray rounded the corner, looking more relaxed than he had since Cassidy\u2019s collapse. Maybe hehad gone to that house for sex.</p><p>Now that he knew Gray was safe, worry gave way to temper. Theran shouted, \u201cWhere in the name of Hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t flinch, just gave him a steely look before focusing on Talon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been worried about you, boy,\u201d Talon said with strained control. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to talk to someone about Cassie,\u201d Gray said. \u201cSo I went to the Keep to talk to Uncle Saetan.\u201d</p><p>Ranon\u2019s eyes widened, but he said nothing.</p><p>The words felt like icy claws ripping up Theran\u2019s spine. Uncle Saetan?Uncle Saetan?</p><p>He glanced at Talon, not sure how to read the older man\u2019s expression. \u201cI see,\u201d Talon said quietly. \u201cIt would have been courteous to tell someone where you were going. These are still uneasy times. A man shouldn\u2019t go off alone without leaving a direction to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you need to search,\u201d Gray said just as quietly.</p><p>Talon nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, sir. I was angry and didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were all right riding the Winds?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cI asked Vae to go with me and show me which radial and tether lines to ride on the Purple Dusk Wind in order to reach the Keep from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Good? Theran stared at Talon. What was going on? Sure, they had to be careful. A few harsh words was all it took to have Gray whimpering in a corner, but Talon should be ripping his ass for all the hours the court had spent scrambling to find Gray while concealing his disappearance from Cassidy. Instead, Talon was almost respectful and that wasn\u2019t right. Hell\u2019s fire, Talon hadraised the two of them, taught them, protected them.</p><p>Ranon turned his head, everything about the man on alert for a moment before he relaxed. \u201cCassidy, Shira, and Reyhana are back from their walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease ask Lady Shira to convey my request for an audience with the Queen,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Already feeling off balance, Theran rocked back on his heels and wondered if the man standing in front of them really was his cousin Gray. A good illusion spell could fool the eye. Hell\u2019s fire, they had lost enough men to that kind of trickery\u2014which should have proved that the twisted Queens who were allied with Dorothea SaDiablo had Black Widows serving in their courts.</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy will meet you under the tree,\u201d Ranon said a moment later.</p><p>Gray looked at the tree and smiled. \u201cYou cleaned up that sitting area.\u201d Ranon shrugged. \u201cIt was a way to stay close but not underfoot.\u201d Gray shifted, as if he was about to walk away. Then he looked at Talon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I worried you and the rest of the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost times it\u2019s the Steward or the Master of the Guard who is informed, but anyone in the First Circle would do,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Gray walked over to the tree to wait for Cassidy.</p><p>All three men watched him. Then Talon rubbed his hands over his face. \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>Turning his back on Gray and struggling to keep his voice low, Theran fixed his anger on Talon. \u201cWe spent half the day searching this village for him, and you\u2019repolite when he comes strolling back? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo words,\u201d Talon replied. \u201c \u2018Uncle Saetan.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Ranon huffed out a breath. \u201cYeah, that changes a few things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Talon agreed.</p><p>\u201cChanges what?\u201d Theran demanded.</p><p>\u201cGray is not a boy anymore,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI taught him what I could. Now the High Lord of Hell will teach him the rest. Theran, no one would callthat man \u2018uncle\u2019 without being invited to do so. And the simple truth is, he understands Gray better than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lethim go looking the next time Gray acts like an ass,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>He walked away. Had to. Nothing was the way he\u2019d hoped it would be. This visit to Eyota had shown him just how unsuitable Cassidy was to rule Dena Nehele. She had no sense of style, no sense of decorum, nosense. She was a handyman\u2019s daughter who, through some freak combination of bloodlines, happened to be a Queen.</p><p>He had promised to try to be a good First Escort, but every day the court had spent here had made it harder to keep that promise.</p><p>The problem was there wasn\u2019t any other choice.</p><p>She was wearing a hat. So were Shira and Reyhana, even though their skin wouldn\u2019t burn in the sun the way Cassie\u2019s did.</p><p>She removed the hat and vanished it the moment she reached the shade under the tree, which made him grin.</p><p>\u201cYou requested an audience, Prince?\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>Still bitchy. Well, he probably deserved that.</p><p>\u201cDoes turning firewood into wood chip mulch work for female temper or just male?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A moment\u2019s puzzlement. Then her eyes widened as if the question suddenly made sense. \u201cGray, exactly where did you go today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to see\u2014\u201dUncle Saetan. Saying that to Talon was a message. Saying it to Cassie might be bragging. \u201c\u2014the High Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but . . .\u201d She stuttered over to a chair and sat down. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d She raised a hand. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t answer. What is said between you is private.\u201d</p><p>He was glad she appreciated that a man needed to keep some thoughts and feelings private\u2014even from the woman he loved.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say much,\u201d he offered, taking the other chair. \u201cMostly he taught me how to use Craft and power to change firewood into wood chip mulch.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked around. Then she shook her head. \u201cSaDiablo Hall has acres of gardens and interior courtyards, and they all had this woody mulch I thought was wonderful. I remember asking Tarl, the head gardener, where I could find some for my mother\u2019s garden, and he asked if I had a brother. But he never explained further. You don\u2019t think . . . ?\u201d</p> <p>Gray snorted. \u201cI filled half a barrel before the High Lord decided I had worked out enough of the temper. I think he\u2019s a practical man whose groundskeepers get a lot of help for free.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the sound of it eased something inside him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to yell at me?\u201d he asked. He saw warmth and humor in those wonderful hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d she replied.</p><p>A ritual question and answer, something that belonged to them.</p><p>He held out his hand. She slipped her hand into his without hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading back to Grayhaven tomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s time. Powell will send some of the Protocol books so Reyhana, Janos, and a few others can start learning the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanos? I thought he\u2019d be more interested in weapons than books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d Cassie\u2019s smile widened. \u201cBut he has an older brother who has decided that he will learn Protocol\u2014or else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon\u2019s going to be at Grayhaven,\u201d Gray pointed out. \u201cEasy enough to forget about the books when the older brother isn\u2019t breathing down your neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder to forget the books when he\u2019ll be tested the next time I come to visit and his ability will determine whether or not he\u2019ll be Reyhana\u2019s escort, since she\u2019ll also come back to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Bribery.\u201d He looked at the boardinghouse. It needed attention, but he felt good in this house, in this village. As if he belonged. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be coming back to visit?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll have a chance to meet some of the other Queens who survived the witch storm and are ruling pieces of Dena Nehele. If they don\u2019t know about siphoning power into the land, it\u2019s something I can teach them.Carefully. \u201d</p> <p>A psychic tap on the shoulder had him looking toward the house. \u201cRanon\u2019s signaling. I guess it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the dining room hand in hand. Gray noticed how every man in the First Circle deliberately moved to catch his eye and offer him a nod or a smile.</p><p>Every man except Theran.</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>The study door opened without a knock or any other kind of request to enter.</p><p>Mildly annoyed at the intrusion, Daemon looked up\u2014and annoyance gave way to warm pleasure. He pushed away from the desk and glided to the spot where Surreal waited for him.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Daemon said, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back,\u201d she replied, hooking her long black hair behind one delicately pointed ear. \u201cAlthough I may have caused a small domestic crisis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Daemon raised one eyebrow. Since no one had come pounding into the study to report on the crisis, it couldn\u2019t be that bad.</p><p>\u201cThe Dea al Mon have very . . . fluid . . . ideas about what kind of greenery belongs inside their homes. When Beale escorted me up to my suite here a few minutes ago, I got so excited about not having a tree growing in the middle of my bedroom . . . Well, I hugged him.\u201d</p><p>Daemon laughed. \u201cHe\u2019ll survive. And under the circumstances, I think Mrs. Beale will forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m standing behind you.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. Surreal tended to fight her own battles. A feminine body that looked delicate but had sinewy strength. A lovely face and sun-kissed skin. Black hair. Gold-green eyes. And those delicately pointed ears. She got her coloring from her Hayllian sire, but her looks came from her mother\u2019s people and were all Dea al Mon.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle is in Halaway with Sylvia, Tersa, and Rainier. Mikal is performing in a music recital, and they\u2019re all attending,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you got out of attending by . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to Mikal\u2019s rehearsals and figuring out twenty-seven ways of saying \u2018that was good but it still needs work.\u2019 I sent Rainier as my representative so there would be a male presence\u2014and I promised my wife outstanding sex tonight if I could skip the festivities.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t you give your wife outstanding sex every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but outstanding is a bit more special on some nights,\u201d he purred.</p><p>She blinked. Swallowed hard. \u201cShit, I don\u2019t even want to think about that without a tub full of cold water nearby.\u201d</p><p>He kept a straight face, but it took effort. He\u2019d been worried about her. Being trapped in that damn spooky house last autumn and the time it had taken for her to recover from the injuries she had sustained\u2014and the fact that Rainier never would fully recover from his own injuries\u2014had left emotional wounds.</p><p>Her time with the Dea al Mon had done her good. Physically, she looked to be in glowing health. Emotionally, he had the sense that some rough edges had been smoothed out. And there was something else about her now. Something more.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d He indicated the informal side of the study. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Beale to bring in a tray unless you want a more substantial meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have something to discuss.\u201d Surreal tipped her head to indicate the blackwood desk. \u201cBut over there. Refreshments can wait.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked at the blackwood desk, then at Surreal. \u201cAll right.\u201d He took his seat behind the desk, crossed his legs at the knees, and steepled his fingers, resting the forefingers against his chin. He watched her settle into the chair on the other side of the desk.</p><p>Formal. Official. Whatever she wanted to say would be said to the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, not Daemon Sadi.</p><p>They sat quietly, studying each other, both comfortable with the silence. Both aware of the tension building in the room.</p><p>\u201cYears ago, when you found me again after Titian was killed, you arranged for me to train in a Red Moon house,\u201d Surreal said.</p><p>He swallowed the anger now as he\u2019d swallowed it then. \u201cYou were little more than a child, and you were whoring on the streets to stay alive. That wasn\u2019t the place for you. I had no right to dictate your choice of profession, but I had the means of providing you with an education that would give you more choices\u2014and a better living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have accepted your friendship or assistance if you had tried to impose your will over mine.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known that.</p><p>\u201cThe reason you gave for helping me was that my dual bloodline meant I\u2019d live for centuries. Two thousand years. Maybe more. That might be half the usual lifetime of the long-lived races, but it\u2019s a very long time compared to everyone else.\u201d She shifted in her seat. \u201cThat didn\u2019t have much significance for me because I kept traveling all around Terreille, working in Red Moon houses and honing my skills as an assassin. It might be a decade or more before I circled back to a particular city. I saw young men who counted me as their first experience with sex turn into old men. Didn\u2019t mean much. They were a passing moment in my life.\u201d</p><p>She was working up to something, so he waited, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cThese weeks I\u2019ve spent with the Dea al Mon . . .\u201d Surreal sighed. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Sadi. I was having breakfast one morning with Grandmammy Teele, and I realized she was an old woman. Then I looked at Gabrielle\u2014a beautiful, vibrant Queen in her late twenties\u2014and I knew the day would come when I\u2019d be visitingher and see an old woman. And Chaosti. Powerful. Virile. Guarding his land, his people, and his Queen. Loving his wife and son. They aren\u2019t temporary people in my life. They\u2019re the other side of my family, and I\u2019ll see them grow old. I\u2019ll see them die. And even if they become demon-dead for a while, most likely they\u2019ll no longer be a part of my life.\u201d</p><p>There was a lump clogging Daemon\u2019s throat. He swallowed it before he could speak. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe visit with my mother\u2019s people helped me decide what I\u2019m going to do with the next few decades of my life.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow as a silent question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work for you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected, but it wasn\u2019t this. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d Surreal said quietly.</p><p>The truth of those words jabbed his heart.</p><p>\u201cDaemon, you waited seventeen hundred years for a dream. You\u2019ve got, at best, a few decades to be with the love of your life. Whether you admit it or not, there must be an hourglass inside your head, and every day that ends is one more grain of sand falling to the bottom half of the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time to investigate minor problems reported by Province Queens or District Queens\u2014or time for petty shit like the game Vulchera tried to play.\u201d She smiled coldly. \u201cFor a people who keep themselves isolated, the Dea al Mon are surprisingly well informed when they choose to be. So I did hear about the party at Lady Rhea\u2019s country house and how Vulchera foolishly tried to ensnare the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan in a bit of sexual blackmail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did you also hear how the High Lord of Hell killed her?\u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be your second-in-command.\u201d Something fierce and feral flashed in those gold-green eyes. \u201cA second-in-command you can trust to guard your back.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak the name. They didn\u2019t need to.</p> <p>\u201cI figure I\u2019ll work from the town house in Amdarh at least half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed being in a city?\u201d Daemon asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, yes. Taking a bath under a canopy of leafy vines is romantic in its own way\u2014until a large bug falls off a leaf and into the bathwater.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to tease her and ask if it was a beetle, but that would have been unkind, and he understood the generosity of the offer she was making. He needed to work, needed the challenge of taking care of the SaDiablo family\u2019s estates and fortune, needed the demands of ruling Dhemlan. If he spent his time and strength on nothing but Jaenelle, he would smother her and give her no opportunity for a life beyond what they shared. But letting someone else take the burden of routine visits to the Province Queens meant being able to spend time at Jaenelle\u2019s house in Scelt\u2014and spend time with the friends who would be only memories a century from now.</p><p>\u201cI also plan to look for a residence here in Halaway,\u201d Surreal said. \u201cMaybe see if Rainier would like to share a house.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon narrowed his eyes. \u201cThere is plenty of room here at the Hall. And wings far enough from the family suites that they would qualify as a separate residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a man who buys property all the time, you\u2019re being dense. I want a place of my own. I want a place that doesn\u2019t belong to the SaDiablo family or you. I want a place that has my name on the deed. Since I hired Lord Marcus to be my man of business because he is yours, I figure you know well enough that I can afford just about any kind of house I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus would never reveal confidential or privileged information,\u201d he said with a warning bite in his voice.</p><p>\u201cTo anyone else? No, he never would,\u201d Surreal agreed. \u201cWould he refuse to answer any question from you?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s like thinking that the firm who handles the family\u2019s investments wouldn\u2019t answer a question from Uncle Saetan about any member of this family.\u201d</p><p>True, but he wasn\u2019t going to acknowledge it out loud.</p><p>\u201cSo you know I can afford my own residence,\u201d Surreal said. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re going to pay me an outrageously generous salary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other. Then Daemon\u2019s smile faded. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me what I\u2019m going to get out of this\u2014and I\u2019m grateful. What do you get out of this arrangement besides an outrageously generous salary?\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded too. \u201cI miss Rainier,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSurreal . . .\u201d</p><p>She laughed quietly. \u201cRelax. I know he\u2019d rather flirt with you than with me, except he doesn\u2019t have a death wish. But he\u2019s a friend unlike any other. And love isn\u2019t always about sex. Talking to Karla about the family she formed with her adopted daughter and her Master of the Guard helped me see that. Rainier matters to me, Daemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you set up your own residence, you\u2019ll hire servants?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cDamn right I\u2019ll hire servants. I don\u2019t want to do the cooking and cleaning by myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Then Mrs. Beale and Helene won\u2019t be complaining about you the way they complain about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they complaining about Rainier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he keeps a room at one of the inns in the village instead of having a suite here at the Hall. Which means he isn\u2019t being looked after properly. They won\u2019t go so far as to actually criticize the cook or housekeeper at the inn since these are women they socialize with; they simply insist that it is inappropriate for the secretary of the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan to be making do with a room at an inn instead of having a proper residence and servants to look after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he need looking after?\u201d</p><p>He heard the concern in her voice and made a rude noise. \u201cNo more than you do, but real need isnever the point of these conversations.\u201d</p><p>Her expression changed from concern to cautious delight. \u201cJust how often do you get pinned to the wall because Rainier obstinately refuses to recognize this particular duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeekly. So if you\u2019re serious about being my second-in-command, you\u2019re shouldering this particular nuisance.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she rose and stepped up to the desk. \u201cDone.\u201d Then she pressed her hands on the blackwood and leaned toward him, that fierce and feralsomething back in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne question. Does Lucivar have to worry about Falonar coming up behind him in any way?\u201d</p><p>Ice ran in his blood, and he knew his gold eyes had turned glazed and sleepy. No one else had dared ask that question. Not even Lucivar. A few weeks ago, before she spent time with the Dea al Mon, Surreal wouldn\u2019t have dared ask that question either.</p><p>He smiled at her\u2014a cold, brutally gentle smile\u2014and the Sadist said too softly, \u201cNo one has to worry about Falonar anymore.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Gray watched Cassie from the corner of his eye and tried not to hover and fuss. Uncle Saetan had sent a note by special messenger warning him that hovering and fussing too much could turn even the most mild-tempered woman into a snarling bitch. Not that Uncle Saetan had put it in those terms, but that was the message.</p><p>It was hard not to hover when he was sitting with Cassie, Ranon, and Shira in one of the four-seat squares in the Coach. Powell had claimed one of the seats around the table so he could catch up on paperwork, the other men were split into small groups to talk or not, and Vae was sprawled on the floor where she\u2019d be in the way of the most people, snoring lightly. Talon was in the small bedroom at the back of the Coach. Cassie had insisted he take it so he could stay inside until sunset and not be disturbed by the rest of them when they returned to Grayhaven.</p><p>It was hard not to hover when they were sitting side by side. Even harder not to fuss, but she hadn\u2019t snarled at him yet, so he figured he was keeping that tendency fairly well leashed.</p><p>Until she marked her spot, vanished the book she was reading, and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Gray asked, trying to keep his voice casual while everything in him went on alert.</p><p>\u201cJust feeling lazy,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He glanced at Ranon, whose attention had also sharpened.</p><p>Then Shira said, \u201cThank the Darkness. I wasn\u2019t sure you even knew the word.\u201d</p><p>Cassie smiled\u2014and Gray relaxed. He slipped his arm around her and shifted them both so her head rested on his shoulder. He brushed his lips against her hair. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do for the next little while, so rest, Cassie. Rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon, why don\u2019t you play for us?\u201d Shira said.</p><p>Ranon glared at his lover. Before he could make some excuse or just refuse, Cassie said, \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Trap set and sprung,Gray thought, fighting to keep a straight face while looking at his friend\u2019s sour expression. Then Ranon called in the Shalador flute and began to play.</p><p>The notes meandered like a stream winding its way through a summer meadow. Soft. Easy. Gray wasn\u2019t sure if it was a song or just one note following another. Either way it was peaceful. Within minutes, both women were asleep.</p><p>The rustle of paper and the murmur of male voices twined with the flute, and Gray sensed the men relaxing. Their Queen was safe and she was content, so they could afford to let down their guard and rest.</p><p>*They\u2019re proud of her,* Ranon said on a psychic spear thread. *She scared the shit out of all of us when she drained herself like that, but there\u2019s a feeling of pride now. Even more than when she defended that landen family.*</p><p>*Why wouldn\u2019t they be proud to serve Cassie?* Gray asked.</p><p>Ranon didn\u2019t answer for a minute, but the music became bittersweet. *We\u2019ve all seen too much, Gray. We\u2019ve all done too much in defense of our people to trust without reservation. When she stood in front of us that first day, we knew we belonged to her, and that scared every one of us. We didn\u2019t know what kind of woman claimed our loyalty and honor. Now we\u2019ve got a better measure of what kind of Queen we serve, and we\u2019re proud to be in her First Circle, almost to the last man.*</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Theran sat across from Powell, his face turned to the Coach\u2019s outer wall, shutting them all out, holding himself separate from the rest of them.</p><p>It was a shame that Cassie and Theran were back to strained tolerance with each other. The tentative peace that had begun between them after she found Lia\u2019s treasure broke under the strain of her draining her power into the land. They were all back to enduring Theran\u2019s undisguised unhappiness with the Queen he had brought from Kaeleer.</p><p>He was sorry that Theran was unhappy, but everyone else at Grayhaven\u2014including the servants\u2014was pleased to be serving Cassie, so Theran was the one who needed to accept the way she ruled. Hopefully once Theran saw how her understanding of the Queen\u2019s connection to the land would help all their people, he would be able to accept her as the Lady who could restore Dena Nehele.</p><p>\u201cDo you play chess?\u201d Cassidy asked Shira as they walked from the landing web up to the Grayhaven mansion.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Shira replied at the same time Ranon said, \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy laughed. \u201cI was told chess is not a game that should be played between genders. Our style of playing is too different to be compatible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyle of playing?\u201d Ranon muttered. \u201cBeing irrational is not a \u2018style.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Dark Court, if a male couldn\u2019t behave himself when playing chess with a female, he was required to play a game of cradle with her as compensation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCradle?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>\u201cA card game Jaenelle played when she was young and then expanded on later. Well, she and the coven expanded on the basic game. The men loathed playing it because their thinking just wasn\u2019t flexible enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gray snorted. Ranon growled.</p><p>Cassidy looked at Shira, who winked at her but otherwise kept a straight face.</p><p>She felt good. Rested. Ready for the next challenge. Tomorrow she would write a general letter to all the Queens in Dena Nehele, gently reminding them of the basic ritual for enriching the land with power. If they, like the Shalador Queens, no longer remembered that ritual, they would be welcome to come to Grayhaven where she would teach them.</p> <p>She would ask Powell to help her smooth out the writing\u2014or find someone who had skill with words. There had to be a wordsmith or two in a town this size.</p><p>As she pondered that, the door opened and Dryden, the butler, stared at her with a peculiar look of relief. For a moment, she thought he was going to lift her off her feet and hug her. Since she was almost as tall as he and had a bit more muscle, the intensity of his psychic scent and expression made her shift her weight and take a step back, bumping into Gray.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Dryden said.</p><p>One word. Gray stiffened, but she felt the change in Ranon and knew the Shalador Warlord Prince was rising to the killing edge in response to Dryden\u2019s voice. She reached back and planted her hand against Ranon\u2019s chest, her touch a light chain that was the only thing holding him back.</p><p>The other men, who had been loitering to stretch their legs after the Coach ride, moved with purpose now, and the Warlord Princes among them were all rising to the killing edge. As Talon\u2019s second-in-command, if Ranon\u2019s temper snapped the leash, the others would go with him.</p> <p>And she sensednothing that would explain the reaction of any of the men\u2014until she began to probe the mansion and picked up psychic scents that were familiar . . . and painful.</p><p>\u201cYou have visitors, Lady,\u201d Dryden said. \u201cFrom Dharo. They arrived two days ago. I did inform the Lady that you were not at home, but she said she was a friend and insisted that you were expecting her. Her Consort and escorts confirmed the invitation.\u201d</p><p>There was a pleading look in Dryden\u2019s eyes, but it was a struggle just to breathe, and whatever he was trying to tell her was beyond her ability to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>The violence that vibrated in Gray\u2019s voice woke her up, snapped her out of her own bog of disbelief. If he, who was still learning to fit into the skin of an adult Warlord Prince, was that close to attacking her \u201cvisitors,\u201d Ranon must be a heartbeat away from slaughter.</p><p>And because a part of her wanted to step aside and give Ranon a target for his barely leashed temper, she said briskly, \u201cSince they\u2019ve been here this long, I won\u2019t keep my visitors waiting. Lady Shira, with me, please. Gentlemen, if you two will stand escort then the other men can settle in.\u201d</p> <p>Having Gray and Ranon with her would be bad enough without the rest of them crowding into the room. Thank the Darkness Theran was still in the Coach. She didn\u2019t needhim witnessing this meeting.</p><p>As Dryden stepped aside to let them enter, she felt the full weight of male temper at her back and realized that even a direct order now wouldn\u2019t stop any of her First Circle from coming in with her.</p><p>She walked into the large parlor and her heart clenched so hard she feared it would stop beating.</p><p>The woman who sprang up from one of the stuffed chairs looked as pretty and dainty as ever. The man standing beside her was as handsome as she remembered, but shouldn\u2019t Jhorma look more satisfied? After all, he was pleasuring the woman he\u2019d lusted after. The other three men who had served in her previous court looked embarrassed.</p><p>As well they should.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla,\u201d Cassidy said with frigid courtesy.</p><p>\u201cOh,la, Cassidy,\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cIs that any way to greet a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p> <p>Kermilla blinked and looked taken aback.</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you again,\u201d Jhorma said.</p><p>\u201cSince you were never pleased to see me, a lie dipped in honey is still a lie,\u201d Cassidy snapped.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Who was this bitch who had taken control of her tongue?</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie! Gray wants to know why we don\u2019t like this Queen.* Vae paused. *Ranon wants to know too.*</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kermilla cooed. \u201cIs that a Sceltie? Oh, Iso envy you having one of the kindred.\u201d</p><p>Vae snarled, and the Craft-enhanced sound rumbled through the room.</p><p>The men tensed. Kermilla\u2019s smile wobbled.</p><p>The thought of locking Kermilla in a room with Vae for a few hours provided just enough humor to smooth out a few of the rough edges of Cassidy\u2019s temper. But not enough of those edges for her to hold on to civility.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Kermilla. I\u2019ll grant you a few minutes of my time, and you can say what you came to say.Privately. \u201d Cassidy turned and looked at Ranon to make sure he got the message.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it.Hated her being in a room alone with a stranger who might be an enemy. But he gave her a curt nod to indicate he would stand aside. Then he focused on the four men who had come with Kermilla, and Cassidy understood the danger. Ifanything went wrong, those four men were forfeit. The Warlord Princes in Dena Nehele had survived the twisted Queens who had ruled here, and they had survived two years of war against the landens. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to tear her former court apart.</p><p>They might attack anyway if they realized those menwere from her former court. Warlord Princes were possessive and territorial, and no one had been prepared for this visit.</p><p>\u201cKermilla, with me,\u201d Cassidy snapped as she turned and walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cMay I remind you that I outrank you?\u201d Kermilla snapped back.</p><p>\u201cMay I remindyou that you don\u2019t addressour Queen in that tone of voice if you want to keep your tongue?\u201d Ranon snarled. \u201cAnd if rank is the pissing contest you want to have, then you may outrank her butI outrankyou. \u201d</p><p>*Ranon,*Cassidy said, putting as much steel in her voice as she could.</p><p>Those dark eyes blazed with fury. He wasn\u2019t backing down.</p><p>*I don\u2019t like her, so please let me hear her out and be done with this,* she told him.</p><p>*You don\u2019t need to waste another minute on her.*</p><p>He\u2019ll kill her,Cassidy thought, shocked by the truth. It was one thing tothink about standing aside and letting him rip into these people; it was quite another to let him do it for no better reason than feeling bitchy and upset.</p><p>*No,* Cassidy said. *Prince Ranon, I\u2019m asking you to step back from the killing edge. Let me deal with this, Queen to Queen.*</p><p>He struggled to pull back, struggled to obey. Finally, *Your will is my life.*</p><p>Words of surrender, of service.</p><p>Having gotten that much of a concession from him, she knew he would hold the other men back. But she didn\u2019t dare look at Gray because what she was picking up from his psychic scent wasn\u2019t good. She could only hope that he wouldn\u2019t do anything imprudent in the few minutes she needed to deal with Kermilla.</p><p>As she walked out of the room, she brushed past Theran, who looked pale and dazed. Until she dealt with whatever trouble Kermilla had brought to Dena Nehele, she didn\u2019t have the energy to wonder how much Theran had heard, or if it was her temper or Ranon\u2019s that had shocked him. Either way, he said nothing; just watched as she led Kermilla to the smaller parlor that had become the \u201cLadies\u2019 Room.\u201d</p><p>Theran stared at the beautiful young woman struggling to maintain her dignity as she followed Cassidy into the Ladies\u2019 Room. Dark curls framed a triangular face with dainty features and expressive blue eyes.</p><p>He felt a burn in his gut and a pull on his heart, and felt the breathless certainty that he had found the Queen he was meant to serve. Now he understood why Archerr, Shaddo, and some of the other Warlord Princes were so enamored with Cassidy. They\u2019d been desperate to serve a Queen,any Queen, and had deluded themselves into believing they felt that burn for Cassidy because they\u2019d had no opportunity to choose between her and another. But now he\u2019d seen the Queen who should have come back with him, who could truly claim the loyalty of the men who formed the First Circle.She was the one he had hoped to find when he went to Kaeleer to beg Daemon Sadi for help.She was the Queen who should be ruling Dena Nehele.</p><p>She was the answer to his hopes and dreams.</p><p>A friend of Cassidy\u2019s come for a visit? A long visit, he hoped. A lifetime visit, if he could convince the Lady to stay.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Kermilla?\u201d Cassidy demanded as soon as the other Queen shut the parlor door.</p><p>\u201cI came to see you,\u201d Kermilla replied, her eyes wide and innocent\u2014and on the verge of being filled with an expression of wounded dignity that was as false as everything else about the woman.</p><p>Cassidy wondered if Jhorma had figured out by now that there wasn\u2019t much substance once you got past the things that were directly related to Kermilla\u2019s pleasure and personal gratification.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t fair. After all, a flighty young Queen could mature into a solid ruler. But Cassidy wasn\u2019t much interested in being fair anymore where Kermilla was concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Kermilla did her sexy pout, but the usual \u201caren\u2019t I being naughty?\u201d twinkle wasn\u2019t in her blue eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my letters, so what choice did I have but to interrupt my own duties and come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t answer because I have nothing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla stamped her foot. \u201cQueen\u2019s gift, Cassidy. I need the money you owe me for taking over the court.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known she could be this furious, hadn\u2019t known this much anger lived inside her. \u201cI owe you nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do! Queen\u2019s gift\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs agift, not an obligation. And you didn\u2019t take over a court from a retiring Queen, Kermilla. Youtook my court. There\u2019s a vast difference, and if you can\u2019t see that I suggest you have someone explain it to you.\u201d Someone with big, hard boots that could leave an impression where it might do the girl the most good. \u201cThe village treasury has the same amount of marks as when I came to Bhak. A little more, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s thevillage treasury. Every copper spent from there has to be reported to the Province Queen. Those marks aren\u2019t Queen\u2019s income. I have expenses, Cassidy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo did I, and I had no more than you when I started. Merchants are willing to run an account for a Queen\u2019s personal expenses and court expenses. Those accounts are billed quarterly and deducted from that merchant\u2019s tithe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re sendingbills !\u201d Kermilla shouted.</p><p>Which meant the girl had already spent past the summer tithe owed by those merchants. Once the tithe was met, a Queen and her court were expected to pay for goods like everyone else in the village.</p> <p>\u201cThen I suggest you curtail your spending until the harvest tithe,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you,\u201d Kermilla snapped. \u201cI know what it takes to look like a Queen and dress like a Queen andact like a Queen. Those things takemoney. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk to your Steward. He\u2019ll tell you how much income you can expect after you settle your obligations to the Province Queen and village treasury, and pay your court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat my answer. You rule Bhak and Woolskin. Your income comes from their tithes.\u201dAnd may the Darkness have mercy on those people. \u201cI have work to do, and despite what you told Dryden, you are not a welcome guest. You\u2019ve had your say. Now go. I don\u2019t want you in my Territory.\u201d</p> <p>Kermilla looked stunned.</p><p>Cassidy strode to the door and reached for the handle.</p><p>\u201cCassidy . . . wait.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait. Her stomach burned and her bowels were turning to liquid. \u201cGet out of my Territory,\u201d she said harshly. \u201cAnd take your cocks with you.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy brushed past Theran, who was lingering in the hallway, and snapped at Ranon when he intercepted her on the way to her suite and tried to ask if she was all right.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t all right. Wouldn\u2019t be all right until Kermilla was back in Dharo and she could lock away all the painful memories. Again.</p> <p>Kermilla dabbed her eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief.</p><p>Cassidy had been soangry. She hadnever seen Cassidy like that! And so unwilling tolisten.</p><p>It had been a mistake bringing Jhorma with her. She had thought bringing her Master of the Guard might appear too much like a threat, and her Steward had to stay in Bhak to take care of all theboring details. That left Jhorma to represent the Queen\u2019s Triangle\u2014the males who were dominant in a court because they dealt with the Queen directly.</p><p>When she\u2019d decided to come to Dena Nehele, she\u2019d thought that reminding Cassidy thatshe was the Queen Jhorma had chosen to serve and pleasure would intimidate Cassidy a little. At least enough that Cassidy wouldn\u2019t keep ignoring the Queen\u2019s gift whichshould have been left as the seed money for Kermilla\u2019s personal expenses.</p><p>But Cassidy had seen Jhorma and gotten soangry . And that dark-eyed Warlord Prince was soscary ! He looked like he wanted to rip out her throat with histeeth !</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fun being a ruling Queen. It should have been, but it wasn\u2019t. Being in Cassidy\u2019s court for her training had been great fun. She had danced and flirted and talked and attended the luncheons with the\u2014well, they weren\u2019t aristos, but they were the most influential people you could find in a place like Bhak. Sure, she had to follow Cassidy around to \u201clearn\u201d how to be a Queen, as if she didn\u2019tknow how to be a Queen, and she had made careful notes about what duties she would keep and what duties\u2014theboring duties\u2014she would require the Ladies in her First Circle to shoulder.</p><p>Then she found out she\u2019d have to pay anyone who was officially in her First Circle, so she\u2019d limited that Circle to the necessary twelve males. Which meantshe had to take care of the boring duties, and since theywere boring, she hadn\u2019t bothered with them half the time. And lately it seemed like her Steward was handing her a list of complaints every day. And her Master of the Guard . . . Well, he\u2019d seemed so charming when he\u2019d first begun to serve her, and he\u2019d been adarling when she\u2019d been training with Cassidy. Now she dreaded talking to him because he looked grim grim grim when he reminded her that she was the village\u2019s moral center and shecould not allow rowdy young Blood males to use the landens for sport. There was already trouble because of alittle mischief, but he\u2019d wanted to publicly strap those boys because a landen had gotten hurt\u2014and he hadn\u2019t looked at her with any kind of warmth after she forbade him to punish the boys. And that merchant! Whining over a broken window and wanting the Warlord\u2019s family to pay for the damages. Well, she couldn\u2019t order that, could she? The Warlord\u2019s sister was one of her closest friends. And then the merchant wanted to deduct the cost of the damages from the tithes andher Steward let him. Without asking her. Saying it was the only thing to do if she wasn\u2019t going to hold the Warlord responsible.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a big enough court. That was the problem. There should be people taking care of these things so that she could be aQueen .</p> <p>She\u2019d spent some of the village treasury, which she shouldn\u2019t have done and wouldn\u2019t have needed to do if Cassidy hadn\u2019t been selfish. So now she had to have the Queen\u2019s gift in case the Province Queen\u2019s Steward asked her Steward for a financial report. She had to replace what she\u2019d taken, orshe would end up having to justify her expenses to Lady Darlena.</p><p>Even worse, because she was only twenty-one and this was her first court, Lady Sabrina, the Queen of Dharo, had given her Bhak to rule for one year. A proving ground, Sabrina had called it. If the villages, Bhak and landen Woolskin, prospered under her rule, she could keep them. If not, Sabrina would declare her court broken and arbitrarily reassign her males to other courts, and she would have to form a new court and find another village to rule since Bhak and Woolskin would be given to another Queen.</p><p>It was allvery distressing.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She gasped at the sound of a strange male voice, then turned to face him, dabbing at her eyes so she looked as woeful as she felt.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>The shock of it rocked her, that pull, thatdemand that she be the one to hold the emotional leash that would keep him balanced. She\u2019d never felt anything like this. Was shesupposed to feel anything like this?</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cA little distressed is all. I seem to have come at a bad time and upset Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>He was so handsome with that dark hair and those dreamy green eyes and that golden brown skin. There was a hardness to him that saidwarrior . More than being a Warlord Prince who was ready to fight, this man hadfought, had been on killing fields thatmattered.</p><p>She was already a little in love with him, and she didn\u2019t even know his name.</p><p>\u201cWho . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Kermilla.\u201d She offered her hand.</p><p>He raised her hand to his lips andkissed it. Not lips held a breath away from skin, but a real kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you distressed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Cassidy and I had a little disagreement, and she ordered me to leave.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>Maybe she had an ally in this place after all. She gave him a wobbly smile. \u201cAs in, \u2018Get out of my house.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A weird, chilling heat filled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not her house. She has no right to toss you out as if you were a landen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . doesn\u2019t she live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my family home. I offered its use for the Queen\u2019s residence, but this is stillmy house, not hers. And if Lady Cassidy has forgotten her manners, I have not. I would be honored if you would bemy guest for as long as you want to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that is most kind of you, Prince Grayhaven. Or may I be so bold as to call you Theran?\u201d</p><p>His smile made her feel wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI would be honored to be addressed as a friend.\u201d</p><p>She vanished the handkerchief, then slipped her arm through his. \u201cIn that case, perhaps you would indulge me by showing me around and telling me about the history of this place and your family.\u201d Men usually liked talking about such things.</p><p>He searched her face, but she had no idea what he searched for\u2014or if he found it.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>No, but she could see it mattered to him. \u201cYes, I really want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>He sounded like he meant it, and wasn\u2019t that the loveliest thing of all?</p><p>Gray yanked out weeds with controlled savagery. A few days gone at this time of year and the weeds crept in. Had to be vigilant. Always vigilant. Or the weeds crept in.</p><p>Snarling, he twisted around and threw the weeding claw as hard as he could.</p><p>Ranon shouted and swore as the claw hit the shield he threw around himself.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Gray! What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Ranon roared. \u201cNo one shields on the home ground. You threw that damn thing hard enough to hook into someone\u2019s gut.\u201d</p><p>Gray rose to his feet and waited for Ranon to get within reach. \u201cMaybe everyone better start shielding, home ground or not.\u201d</p><p>Ranon stopped. Stared. Looked at the mansion\u2014and swore. \u201cYou feel it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t turn my back on her,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ranon stared at the flower bed. \u201cGot no proof she\u2019s a bitch, except the snotty way she spoke to Cassidy. Got no proof she\u2019s done any harm to her people. But I wouldn\u2019t trust her with anyone I cared about. She\u2019s . . . off. Not twisted, not evil like the Queens who had ruled here before the witch storm swept them away. But something isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVae says Kermilla smells bad. Not her body, her psychic scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked toward the mansion\u2014and went rigid. \u201cWhat in the name of Hell is Theran doing? I thought she was supposed to leave.\u201d</p><p>But there was Kermilla, walking arm in arm with Theran, who had the balls to point to the place where the dead honey pear tree had stood for so long\u2014until Cassie had started unlocking the spells that revealed the treasure hidden within Grayhaven.</p><p>A treasure that included thirteen honey pears that had survived centuries and were now the seedlings that would be the start of new orchards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGray, don\u2019t,\u201d Ranon said softly. \u201cCassidy isn\u2019t feeling well. Too much upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a fool would expect her to sit down at the same table withthat. \u201d And he had a sick feeling that Theran was going to expect exactly that\u2014and be pissy about Cassie not coming to the table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have dinner in her suite tonight with Shira,\u201d Ranon said.</p> <p>Gray nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Gray. Both of us need to let it go. Whatever business Kermilla had with Cassidy is done. Tomorrow she\u2019ll go back to where she came from, and we\u2019ll get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded again.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to sleep inside tonight?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>He hesitated. Drought. Plague. Weeds creeping in and choking the good plants. That\u2019s what he felt when he looked at Kermilla. He didn\u2019t want to get anywhere near her, didn\u2019t want to be locked behind walls where she could reach him. The old fears gnawed at him, but something else, something new pushed at him harder.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think Cassie would mind if I slept on the sofa in her suite?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she would understand if you felt uncomfortable being in the family wing.\u201d</p><p>With no one but Theran nearby, and the \u201cguest\u201d too close for comfort.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid to sleep alone tonight, but that\u2019s only part of it,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other part?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Ranon. \u201cIf I\u2019m sleeping on the sofa, the only way someone can get to Cassie is by going through me.\u201d</p> <p>Talon leaned against a tree, another dark shape in the night, and waited. Which one of the First Circle would come out to find him?</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. He\u2019d gone to sleep in a Coach full of men feeling hopeful and pleased, and woke to find the Grayhaven mansion inhabited by two armed camps that were barely obeying the command to keep the peace. Ranon and Theran looked ready to tear out each other\u2019s throats, and Gray . . . He wasn\u2019t sure what was going on inside Gray\u2019s head, and that was a worry\u2014especially since Cassidy had retired to her suite before dinner, claiming to feel ill.</p><p>And all of this was because of the visitors from Dharo.</p><p>When he saw the man coming toward him, he was a little surprised that it was Powell instead of one of the Warlord Princes, but when he gave it a moment\u2019s thought, he realized it wouldn\u2019t have been anyone else. The Steward would be the one to approach the Master of the Guard to discuss how to direct the rest of the First Circle to best serve the Queen.</p><p>\u201cTalon,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>A middle-aged man whose left hand had been badly broken by the last Queen he\u2019d served, Powell\u2019s steadier temper was proving to be a good balance for the more volatile members of the court.</p><p>\u201cOut to get some air?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cStorm\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMight blow over.\u201d They weren\u2019t talking about the weather. Talon huffed out a breath. \u201cWhat in the name of Hell happened? All I\u2019ve heard from both sides is a lot of crap.\u201d</p><p>Powell tensed.</p><p>Dangerous ground,Talon thought.Two Queens in the same house and all the men wary or edgy or just plain ready to kill. \u201cPut caste aside for a moment and tell me what you\u2019d say if this was about social standing.\u201d</p><p>Powell relaxed. \u201cAh. Well. Plain girl. Comes from a simple family and expects to work for her keep. Earns the friendships she makes by being a friend. At a social gathering, she\u2019s never asked by a handsome man for any of the romantic dances unless he\u2019s an escort in training and is required to dance with the girls who wouldn\u2019t have a partner otherwise. Her heart\u2019s probably bruised because of that, but she\u2019s learned to accept it.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the pretty girl. Spoiled and pampered. Her father\u2019s darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Talon interrupted. \u201cFather\u2019s darling would apply to both girls.\u201d Having met Lord Burle, it was clear he was more than proud of Cassidy, and not because she was now the Queen of a whole Territory. That pride was for hisgirl, who just happened to be a Queen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Powell agreed. \u201cHowever, the pretty girl is used to getting her own way, is used to being preferred over the other girls, always has her dance card filled before she arrives at the dance, and if she snubs one partner in favor of someone more polished or aristo, she expects to be forgiven\u2014and her actions defended\u2014because she is an aristo darling.</p><p>\u201cThese two girls have competed in the same social arena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when the plain girl did get a dance partner the pretty girl wanted, the pretty girl stole him just because she could,\u201d Talon said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s clear enough there is some history between Kermilla and Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran made no effort to hide his preference. Cassidy told Kermilla to leave; Theran said she could stay. That had to hurt Cassidy\u2019s pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the pretty girl wins again.\u201d Talon sighed.Sweet Darkness, please let it be that simple. \u201cRanon and Gray have an intense dislike for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich has made the others edgy and politely hostile toward our guests.\u201d Powell paused, then added, \u201cI have to say, Warlord Princes are the only caste of males who can act politely and still leave \u2018I want to kill you\u2019 hanging unspoken in a room. Ranon and Gray are the most attuned to Cassidy. Kermilla makes her unhappy, so they\u2019re going to dislike her, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Theran? Is it a young man\u2019s cock lusting for a pretty girl, or is it a Warlord Prince feeling the pull of a Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Until he\u2019d met Cassidy and had felt that pull himself, he hadn\u2019t realized how powerful a chain that connection between Queen and Warlord Prince could be. If that was the reason Theran was reacting to Kermilla . . .</p><p>Talon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cShe came here for a reason. No matter what she says, Kermilla didn\u2019t come here to visit a friend, so she was expecting to getsomething .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, and I don\u2019t think she got what she came for. But she did win something by Theran inviting her to stay. The First Escort countermanding the Queen\u2019s order for his own pleasure? Can we allow that, Talon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his house. He\u2019s right about that. And Kermilla being a Queen might not mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means something to Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d But was the rivalry between Queens or women? If he took Kermilla back to the Keep tonight, which is what he should do to soothe his Queen, Theran would blame Cassidy for Kermilla\u2019s departure, and the tension between them could grow to an animosity that would cripple the court. If this was nothing more than a physical attraction between Theran and Kermilla, it could burn itself out in a few days anyway, and he would have widened the rift already present in the court for nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Powell asked.</p><p>\u201cWe wait\u2014and we watch,\u201d Talon replied.And hope I\u2019m not hurting Cassidy too much by letting Theran take the lead on this and have the time to get to know the girl.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy slowly made her way up to her suite. Her head ached and her stomach burned. Not an unusual combination these days. All it took was hearing \u201cOh,la \u201d for the pain to start.</p><p>Shira had a tonic that could soothe the stomach and medicine that could ease the headache. But she couldn\u2019t go to the Healer. Not again. The first time, Shira had performed her duties without comment. The second evening it happened, those dark eyes held a sharp reminder that Shira was a Black Widow as well as a Healer, and poisoning a \u201cguest\u201d would be a simple thing to do.</p><p>She had to write her report to Prince Sadi, and she didn\u2019t know what to say. Didn\u2019t know what shedared to say.</p><p>It was happening again. She had failed. Again.</p><p>Kermilla shone. She dazzled. Just like the last time. She flattered and flirted, wore a different gown every evening that had the men\u2019s eyes popping out, and hinted that she was on the primary guest lists of the most influential aristos in Dharo.</p><p>Which may or may not be true, but there was no way to call Kermilla on it without sounding churlish.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but it had been a shock to have Theran come up to her suite that first day and inform her that Kermilla was nowhis guest, just asshe was his guest, and he expected her to act her age instead of behaving like a pouting adolescent.</p><p>That statement coming from a man whose pants tented every time he was in the same room as Kermilla might have been funny in a dark, painful way if the rest of the court hadn\u2019t started acting just like her old court had done. They looked at Kermilla and then at her as if they were judging her and finding fault. Seeing her and Kermilla in the same room . . . The difference between a draft horse and a thoroughbred, Jhorma had once said when he had escorted her and Kermilla to a small party. He\u2019d said it in a tone of voice that was supposed to mean he was joking, but everyone in the room had known he meant it. And everyone must have known that he resented riding the draft horse when he lusted for the thoroughbred.</p><p>Everyone but her.</p><p>Even when he said things like that\u2014and justified saying things like that\u2014she hadn\u2019t understood his enthusiasm in her bed had to do with getting his own relief and nothing to do with a commitment to take care of his Queen.</p><p>Did he enjoy taking care of Kermilla?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about that. She did her best to ignore the other Queen by spending time in the garden with Gray and working with Powell to send out messages to the surviving Queens in Dena Nehele.</p><p>At least one good thing had come from Kermilla\u2019s visit: Theran was too preoccupied withher to pay attention to the fact that Cassidy was reaching out to the other Queens in Dena Nehele.</p><p>Ranon stared at the special flower bed Gray had made for Cassidy\u2014the plants were similar to ones found in Dharo but were native to Dena Nehele. The common ground, Gray called it.</p><p>He\u2019d been coming out here every night since Theran had givenLady Kermilla an open-ended invitation to stay at Grayhaven. Shira was acting peculiar in a way that unnerved him. He loved the woman with everything in him, but he didn\u2019t forget he was sleeping with a Black Widow, and there was a reason why that caste of witch was feared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThought I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>He half turned toward the voice, but didn\u2019t speak for a minute. \u201cSomething is draining the heart out of Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think we\u2019ve all figured out what that something is,\u201d Talon said. He kept walking, but he lifted his chin to indicate the stone storage shed where Gray used to live because he was too frightened to enter the house.</p> <p>His heart pounding, Ranon glanced at the house before drifting toward the back of the shed. What did the Master of the Guard want to say to him that couldn\u2019t be said inside the house?</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d he began.</p><p>Talon raised his left hand. The two missing fingers were a reminder that this man had not lived a soft life\u2014even after he became demon-dead.</p><p>A minute later, Archerr, Spere, and Shaddo slipped behind the shed. A minute after that, Bardric and Cayle joined them.</p><p>\u201cBurne, Haele, and Radley are providing a presence in the parlor this evening,\u201d Talon said. \u201cArcherr, you\u2019ll relay instructions to Burne and Haele. Cayle, you\u2019ll keep Radley informed.\u201d</p> <p>*I\u2019m your second-in-command,* Ranon said, using a tight spear thread to direct the words only to Talon.</p><p>*I know what you are,* Talon replied sharply. *You have the task of keeping Gray and the Black Widow leashed. And yourself.*</p><p>Shit. *You don\u2019t ask for much.*</p><p>*If you don\u2019t have the balls for it, tell me now.*</p><p>Stung by the verbal slap, Ranon didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Powell?\u201d Archerr asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep the Steward informed,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>*What did Powell say?* Ranon asked, wondering if anyone else had noticed a slight hesitation in Talon\u2019s reply.</p><p>*Later.* \u201cOur Queen is distressed. The visitors are the reason. We need to find out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does Kermilla know Lady Cassidy?\u201d Spere asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that the two of them have anything in common except caste,\u201d Shaddo said.</p><p>\u201cShe reminds me of a carrion eater picking at the bones,\u201d Bardric said.</p><p>Shaddo nodded. \u201cAnd Dena Nehele is the bones. We\u2019ve seen bitches like her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s entertaining,\u201d Cayle said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s false. You can see it in her eyes. What\u2019s she looking for here?\u201d</p> <p>Archerr snorted. \u201cControl over the rest of us. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she did have that control?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Ice swept through Ranon, but a steely look from Talon kept him silent.</p><p>The other men shifted their feet and looked uncomfortable. Finally Spere said, \u201cThose escorts aren\u2019t fighters. Got some training\u2014every escort does\u2014but they\u2019re Warlords, not Warlord Princes.\u201d</p><p>Shaddo nodded. \u201cTake them out fast and hard. Have someone coming in behind the others who is strong enough to take out the witch\u2014burst heart and brain with a blast of power that will break her Jewels and finish the kill.\u201d</p><p>Ranon swallowed hard. He thought he\u2019d been the only one thinking along those lines. Apparently not.</p><p>Talon nodded, as if they\u2019d told him what he\u2019d expected. \u201cNot yet. She\u2019s a Queen from another Territory. Another Realm. We made the mistake of not looking for social connections to dark power when Cassidy first came here. Kermilla keeps hinting that she has powerful friends, so let\u2019s not make that mistake again. Cayle, Bardric, you two are least likely to be perceived as a threat, so I want you to spend time with the Warlords who came with Kermilla. Find out what you can about her court and about her connection to Cassidy. They\u2019re not friends, so let\u2019s find out exactly what they are to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could force open the inner barriers of the lightest Jeweled Warlord and find out everything we want to know,\u201d Archerr said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd become no better than what we fought against all those years?\u201d Talon shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to anyone but an enemy, and we don\u2019t know yet that these men are enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know their presence is upsetting Cassidy,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cYes, we know that,\u201d Talon agreed.</p><p>Ranon heard regret\u2014and maybe a little guilt?\u2014in Talon\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWhen we find out more, we\u2019ll decide what to do about it,\u201d Talon continued. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Any information you find out comes to me or Ranon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t mention any of this to Theran?\u201d Spere asked.</p><p>Even in the dark, Ranon saw the sadness in Talon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mention this to Theran,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just lust that\u2019s making him stupid, but if he feels the same pull for Kermilla that we feel for Cassidy, we can\u2019t trust him to stand for the Queen he promised to serve.\u201d</p><p>One by one, the men wrapped themselves in sight shields and slipped away until Ranon and Talon were alone.</p><p>\u201cPowell,\u201d Ranon said quietly. \u201cHe said something. That\u2019s why you\u2019re giving these orders.\u201d He waited. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s starting to feel like old times, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 And may the Darkness have mercy on us, Ranon, I think he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Talon walked away.</p><p>Ranon leaned against the shed, feeling sick.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t come to that. Itwouldn\u2019t . Not while Cassidy ruled Dena Nehele.</p><p>Theran sat in the parlor, happier than he had ever been.</p><p>Kermilla was wonderful, was everything he dreamed a Queen should be. The sound of her voice quenched a raging thirst inside him, and there was a spot on her neck that had a scent that aroused him and yet gave him peace.</p><p>She had been careful not to say anything outright, but she\u2019d made it clear to him that, having come from an aristo family, the training that had honed her innate abilities as a Queen had been far more extensive than Cassidy\u2019s\u2014the kind of training given to someone destined to be a Territory Queen.</p><p>Damn Ranon for stirring everything up so much that the other men were wary about getting to know her. But they would come around.</p><p>Sooner or later they would recognize the treasure that had come to Grayhaven.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>She had to get out of here. Her hands shook, her stomach burned, and dinner was nothing but a foul smell in the toilet. She couldn\u2019t do this again, couldn\u2019t watch this happen again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand to hurt this much again.</p><p>Go. Run. Get away from this place.</p><p>Because this time she might lose someone who truly mattered, and it was ripping her heart out.</p><p>This time, betrayal might truly kill her.</p><p>Ranon stood outside Cassidy\u2019s door, trying to leash his rage because hehad to. There was no one else. Theran\u2019s verbal barbs had turned cruel enough to drive Cassidy out of the parlor in tears, so Talon had his hands full controlling Gray and making sure the two cousins didn\u2019t set eyes on each other before tempers had settled. Powell had walked out of the parlor and locked himself in his office. No one was sure what the man was doing in there, but they were all hoping the worst he was doing was getting stinking drunk. And Theran . . .</p><p>Couldn\u2019t the bastard see that Cassidy wasn\u2019t comfortable around Kermilla? But he kept insisting that Cassidy \u201cdo her duty\u201d as a Queen and not leave the other Queen without company\u2014especially since Cassidy was the lower-ranking Queen.</p><p>Damn Grayhaven to the bowels of Hell for slipping the verbal knife in every chance he got. Kermilla was pretty; Cassidy was not. Kermilla was vivacious\u2014the kind of Queen who would appeal to the Blood; Cassidy was there because they hadn\u2019t been given a choice. Cassidy wore Rose; Kermilla wore Summer-sky, which made her dominant.</p><p>Dominant his ass. Sure it gave her a little more power since Summer-sky was one rank darker than Rose, but that wasall it gave her. The little bitch was just good at playing people and presenting herself to advantage. At least they had gotten a couple of answers from tonight\u2019s little drama. The four men who had come with Kermilla had all served in Cassidy\u2019s court\u2014and had abandoned a real Queen in order to serve pretty gilt.</p><p>Jhorma had been Cassidy\u2019s Consort. They all agreed they wouldn\u2019t mentionthat bit of information to Gray. Hell\u2019s fire! What had Cassidy been thinking? The woman couldn\u2019t have beenthat desperate for a lover to have settled forhim.</p><p>You\u2019re here to make sure she\u2019s all right. You can\u2019t do that from this side of the door.</p><p>He knocked. No answer. He knocked harder, certain she was in her suite. \u201cCassidy?\u201d He turned the door handle. The door wasn\u2019t locked, so he walked in\u2014and caught her pulling back, as if she\u2019d lunged for the door to lock it but didn\u2019t react in time.</p><p>No color in her face except the freckles standing out on milky ice and the dark shadows under her eyes. She stood there, frozen, so he looked around\u2014and saw the trunks. The lids were open, and the trunks were full of her clothes and possessions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Cassidy?\u201d he asked, putting an Opal lock on the door as he closed it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He thought about the past few days and what he had learned tonight. Her former First Circle had broken her court in order to serve another Queen. And now that same Queen had come to Dena Nehele and was making herself very comfortable in the Queen\u2019s residence\u2014and Cassidy was breaking down under the hammer of Theran\u2019s words and his blatant preference for Kermilla.</p><p>Cassidy . . . running.</p><p>He grabbed her arms, and it was only the years of training that kept his savagery controlled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving us? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay!\u201d Cassidy wailed.</p><p>He shook her and roared,\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran doesn\u2019t want me to stay. He wants Kermilla to be the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gives a piss what Theran wants?\u201d Ranon shouted. \u201cForget him! What about the rest of us, Cassie? What about the eleven other men who are loyal to you and want to serve? Are you going to walk away from us too? Are you going to walk away from Gray? Are you going to walk away from the people who are starting to hope again that a Queen will rule fairly?Are you walking away from all of us because one man wants to hump a little bitch? \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him, shocked, and finally whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>He eased his hold on her, certain her arms would be bruised black by morning, but he didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Tears spilled down her pale, pale face. \u201cRanon, I can\u2019t watch Kermilla take over another court. And it will kill me when Gray starts falling in love with her.\u201d</p> <p>Idiot woman. Couldn\u2019t she see that Grayloathed Kermilla?</p><p>He looked at her, really looked, and realized she couldn\u2019t see anything right now\u2014not Gray\u2019s love, not his own loyalty. Nothing.</p><p>He gentled his hands, and forced himself to gentle his voice. \u201cCassie, do you trust me? As a friend, do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen listen. Please listen. I\u2019m begging you not to walk away from Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>If she got to Dharo, they would never get her back. Hell\u2019s fire, if she got to theKeep in her present state, Sadi and Yaslana would never let her come back even if she was willing.</p><p>Then he remembered the last thing Lucivar had said to the First Circle before heading back to Kaeleer: \u201cThe Queen comes before anyone else. You take care of her, the rest usually falls into place.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy was focused on getting out, so he would take care of his Queen and get her out\u2014and do his best to take care of Dena Nehele as well.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand. You need to get away from those people. I do understand. But you don\u2019t have to go too far away. I\u2019ll take you back to Eyota, back to the boardinghouse. You didn\u2019t mind staying there, did you? You\u2019re already packed. I\u2019ll take you tonight. Now. We\u2019ll slip out. No one else needs to know until you\u2019re ready for them to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Queen, Cassie.Our Queen, and the Queen\u2019s residence is any place the Queen chooses to live. You don\u2019t want to stay here, you don\u2019t have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray will worry if I leave without saying anything,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Shira enough so that she can reassure him. And I\u2019ll come back and talk to him as soon as you\u2019re settled at the boardinghouse. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset, and rightly so.\u201d Ranon took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He couldn\u2019t force her to stay, but he was sure if he could get her to Eyota, he would buy enough time to convince her that there were people who didn\u2019t care if a face was pretty or not when the woman behind that face was special. \u201cCome with me. Give yourself time to rest and breathe before making a decision. Please.\u201d</p><p>She called in a handkerchief and sniffled into it. \u201cShould I leave a note? It\u2019s proper to inform the Steward and Master of the Guard.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so lost, so wounded.</p><p>He knew it was proper. As the Master\u2019s second-in-command, he should inform Talon at the very least. But if he involved anyone else in the court right now, most likely Cassidy would be talked into staying here\u2014and the next time she decided to run, she wouldn\u2019t delay long enough to pack her things or leave a note. They\u2019d find out about it when Yaslana landed on their doorstep demanding answers.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one needs to know where you are. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t convinced her, and he didn\u2019t know what else to say. But he could think of one thing to do.</p><p>Using Craft, he closed the lids on her trunks\u2014and vanished them.</p><p>Cassidy stared at the empty floor. \u201cYou took my trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Getting his mouth to smile felt like he was trying to bend stone, but he did it. Or close enough. \u201cI\u2019ll give them back when we reach the boardinghouse.\u201d</p><p>She studied him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sniffled into the handkerchief once more, then vanished it. \u201cFor a moment there, you sounded like Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>He decided to take that as a compliment. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll talk to Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I hope you won\u2019t be upset if he decides to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he would?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Cassie. Are you hurting so much you can\u2019t remember that he loves you?\u201cI do, darling. I really do.\u201d</p><p>Ranon and Cassidy slipped out of the house, wrapped in an Opal sight shield to lessen the number of people who might be able to detect her. He trusted her to go down to the gate while he went to the stables to get a horse\u2014praying to the Darkness that she didn\u2019t walk onto the landing web, catch the Rose Wind, and run to the Keep. Riding double to the Coaching station, they rented a small Coach, giving the driver who should have gone with them a generous tip to watch the horse\u2014and not ask questions.</p><p>Riding the Opal Winds, switching from radial to tether lines whenever needed, they finally reached the landing web on the northern end of his home village.</p><p>And through the whole of the journey, Cassidy never said one word.</p><p>*Grandfather,* Ranon called as soon as he dropped the Coach from the Opal Web and skimmed over the landing web. He could handle a small Coach when riding the Winds, but using Craft and power to hold one steady as it skimmed above the road was an untested skill. *Grandfather!*</p><p>*Ranon?* Yairen sounded muddled. Then the voice on the psychic thread sharpened. *Ranon?*</p><p>*I need help.* He could picture his grandfather pushing himself up and swinging his legs over the side of the bed. After all, anyone in their right mind who wasn\u2019t demon-dead would be asleep at this hour. *I brought Cassidy. There\u2019s been some trouble.*</p><p>*Is she wounded?*</p><p>The genuine concern in Yairen\u2019s voice told Ranon that he\u2019d made the right choice. *Not her body, but her heart is wounded.*</p><p>*Gray?*</p><p>*No. It\u2019s . . . complicated. She was going to leave us, Grandfather. I convinced her to come here instead.*</p><p>*Where?*</p><p>*The boardinghouse.*</p><p>*Go slowly, grandson. Give this old man a little time to prepare. I will meet you at the house. Janos will come too.*</p><p>*Thank you.*</p><p>Yairen broke the link. Ranon slowed the Coach to the pace of an ambling walk\u2014and hoped Cassidy wouldn\u2019t ask him why the Coach was suddenly wobbling so much.</p><p>By the time he set the Coach down on the street in front of the boardinghouse, there were lamps shining in the windows of several rooms, and doors and windows were open to let in cool night air.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he said, holding out a hand.</p><p>She slipped her hand in his, still saying nothing as she followed him out of the Coach and into the house.</p><p>His grandfather waited for them in the front parlor.</p><p>\u201cThe Rose has come back to us,\u201d Yairen said, smiling. \u201cIt grieves me to know you sorrow, but you are among friends here.\u201d He gestured to two chairs and a table. \u201cCome and sit with an old man.\u201d</p><p>She sat, and she seemed so empty Ranon wondered if he\u2019d brought more than a husk to Eyota.</p><p>Yairen waved a hand over the table. Two mugs and a carafe appeared. Using Craft, Yairen poured dark, steaming liquid from the carafe into the mugs.</p><p>\u201cThis is a special drink,\u201d Yairen said. \u201cI usually make it when strong men need to speak of things that are troubling their hearts, but I think tonight your heart could use this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can speak,\u201d Cassidy whispered.</p><p>Yairen smiled gently. \u201cEven silence has a voice. Drink. Perhaps we will talk. Perhaps not. Perhaps I alone will talk and tell you more about the music of my people, even give you the first lesson in how to play a drum.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy took a sip of his grandfather\u2019s special brew of spiced whiskey and coffee. She took another sip. \u201cI would like to hear more about your music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Yairen looked at Ranon. \u201cAre you still here, troublemaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroublemaker?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d Yairen waved one hand gently in front of his face. \u201cThe stories I could tell you about that one. Go on, now,\u201d he added, pointing at Ranon. \u201cLeave us to talk without your bothersome presence.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy snorted and took another, larger sip of the brew.</p><p>*Tend to your business, grandson,* Yairen said. *The Rose will be safe here among us.*</p><p>*Don\u2019t tell her too many stories.* He looked at Cassidy. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised to give me back my trunks when we got here,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cOh. I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d This time his smile wasn\u2019t forced. He called in her trunks and set them at the other end of the parlor.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Yairen said, laughing. \u201cTroublemaker.\u201d</p><p>An hour before sunrise, most of the First Circle gathered in a meeting room.</p><p>Ranon had figured he would face anger. He\u2019d figured he would face temper.</p><p>What he faced was so much worse.</p><p>There was a chilling blankness in Gray\u2019s eyes, and Ranon couldn\u2019t shake the conviction that what was under that blankness was a violence that even the Blood would find shocking. There was a smoldering fury in Shira\u2019s eyes, and he hoped with everything in him that he wasn\u2019t the target.</p><p>He brushed lightly against the first of her inner barriers\u2014and found nothing comforting.</p><p>*My first loyalty is to the Queen, remember?* he asked her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but he sensed a little less tension in her. He didn\u2019t blame her for being angry. All he\u2019d told her was that he and Cassidy were leaving the mansion and she should inform Gray so he wouldn\u2019t be searching for her and alarm the First Circle. Of course, Shira and Gray had assumed Cassidy would be with him when he returned.</p><p>The other men looked a little pissed off at being summoned so early in the morning. Except Powell, who sat quietly, staring at his hands\u2014especially at his left hand, which a Queen had broken because he cared more about people who needed food and clothes than about the Queen\u2019s purse.</p><p>Then Talon entered the room and put Sapphire shields around the room and a Sapphire lock on the door.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Ranon,\u201d Talon said. \u201cYou were very specific about who should attend this meeting\u2014and who should not. We\u2019re here. Now talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard temper that was chained\u2014but not for long. Not if he said the wrong thing. Talon outranked all of them, had centuries of fighting experience, and had locked them all in a room with the strongest predator in Dena Nehele.</p><p>Had lockedhim in a room with the strongest predator.</p><p>\u201cI took Cassidy to Eyota, to the boardinghouse,\u201d Ranon said.</p> <p>Gray snarled and took a step toward him.</p><p>Powell raised his head and stared at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to turn his back on Talon, but Gray was the more volatile threat, so he faced the Warlord Prince who had been a friend\u2014and might now be an enemy.</p><p>\u201cShe was going to leave us, Gray,\u201d he said quickly, wanting them to hear him, to know why he made this choice before someone\u2019s temper snapped the leash. \u201cShe was going to leave all of us. When I went up to her suite to check on her, her trunks were packed. She was going back to Dharo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave without telling me,\u201d Gray said too softly as he took another step toward Ranon. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave without me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to get her out of here, get her hidden so she would feel safe. I promised to come back and tell you, and I have, Gray. As soon as I got her settled at the boardinghouse, I came back. To talk to you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have talked to us first,\u201d Talon growled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should have.\u201d Ranon turned enough to address Talon and still keep track of Gray. \u201cBut she was focused on getting out of this house. I did what the Queen needed, rather than what the court required.\u201dSweet Darkness, please let Talon understand the difference.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sick,\u201d Shira said, her voice oddly hollow. \u201cShe tried to hide it, but there\u2019s so much pain in her it\u2019s like a poison. She knew I could feel it. That\u2019s why she stopped coming to me for help. She didn\u2019t want anyone sensing that pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Steward, I must censure Prince Ranon for not informing the Master of the Guard that he was taking the Queen away from the protection of her escorts,\u201d Powell said quietly. \u201cHowever, I also applaud the speed in which he acted on the Queen\u2019s behalf\u2014and on the court\u2019s behalf. And I\u2019m wondering if, despite the reason it came about, this might not be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>They all turned toward Powell.</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Powell pulled on one earlobe. \u201cFrom the day she formed her court, Cassidy has been hobbled by Theran\u2019s resistance to every attempt she has made to be a Queen to our people. He brought her here, so we have deferred to him, letting him dictate what she could and could not do. But I, for one, would like to see what Cassidy can do as our Queen without those hobbles.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to see that too,Ranon thought.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAre we moving the Queen\u2019s residence to the boardinghouse? If that\u2019s the case, some work will need to be done to some of the rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what we\u2019re talking about?\u201d Archerr looked at Ranon. \u201cA permanent move to a Shalador reserve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ranon replied, feeling the need to tread carefully. \u201cI just wanted to get her away from Kermilla and those Dharo bastards so Cassidy could rest without having that bitch in her face every time she turned around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we booted Lady Kermilla out of Dena Nehele?\u201d Shaddo asked.</p><p>\u201cOr buried her,\u201d Spere said.</p> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a Queen from Kaeleer and a guest in this house,\u201d Talon said. \u201cAnd despite the pain her presence causes Cassidy, Kermilla hasn\u2019t done anything to justify execution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, Kermillawas involved in something that harmed Cassidy back in Dharo,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSomething that made her feel she was less of a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whip that drives Cassie,\u201d Gray said softly.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d Ranon said just as softly. The blankness faded from Gray\u2019s eyes, replaced by a steely anger.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went up to the Keep to talk to the High Lord, he said the whip that drives Cassie was shaped before she arrived in Dena Nehele\u2014and left scars. That\u2019s why she drained herself too much and got hurt. She was trying to prove she could be a good Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all have a good idea now whose hand held that whip,\u201d Talon said, his voice rumbling like icy gravel.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to keep Lady Cassidy away from this house while Theran\u2019s guest is in residence,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>Talon looked at Powell, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Talon said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Eyota, and we\u2019ll go with the assumption we won\u2019t be coming back to Grayhaven, whether we stay in that village or not. And we have to move fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIt would be best if we depart before Theran realizes Cassidy is gone. And it would be best not to leave any of the court\u2019s records behind.\u201d</p><p>A long beat of silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cThat for a Queen who rules a small village in another Realm and is supposed to be a guest, Lady Kermilla is asking inappropriate questions about the tithes a Queen here could expect.\u201d Powell looked at Talon, whose mouth thinned to a grim line.</p><p>Watching the two men, Ranon wondered what else the Steward might be telling the Master of the Guard.</p><p>\u201cWe work the same way as if we needed to make a fast move from one camp to another,\u201d Talon said. \u201cGrab your personal gear first. Make sure you take what you don\u2019t want to lose. That goes for all of you. Bardric, Cayle, and Radley, you\u2019re in charge of getting our horses and tack. Get them saddled and down to the gate. Use aural shields around their feet to keep the hooves silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Cayle said, looking at Bardric and Radley, who both nodded.</p><p>\u201cArcherr. Spere. You\u2019ll give Shira a hand packing up the Healer\u2019s supplies.\u201d Talon looked at the Healer. \u201cWe can\u2019t take anything that belongs to this house, only what you\u2019ve acquired on behalf of the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Shira said, getting to her feet.</p><p>\u201cShaddo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honey pears,\u201d Gray said, breaking whatever Talon was about to say. \u201cWe aren\u2019t leaving the honey pears withher. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take them all, Gray,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>A slashing look was Gray\u2019s only response.</p><p>\u201cShaddo, you give Gray a hand,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThe honey pear that was planted in the wish pot stays here. Gray, if you\u2019d feel easier taking the other twelve, then bring them. Ranon, once you pack your gear, you\u2019ll give Powell a hand with the court papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cBurne. Haele. You back up anyone who needs help. And keep watch. No reason to think the guests will be up this early, but I want the rest of you on your way before I inform Theran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell him?\u201d Powell asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Cassidy\u2019s First Escort,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cHe needs to know where his Queen is residing. And there are a few other things Prince Grayhaven needs to know.\u201d</p><p>They all heard the threat under the words.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cA moment of your time, Talon,\u201d Powell said, rising.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk while you start packing.\u201d</p><p>The men rose and slipped out of the room, warriors breaking camp.</p><p>Ranon waited, wanting a moment to talk to Shira, but she looked at Gray, who was lingering, and shook her head.</p><p>*Pack up my things along with yours,* she said.</p><p>*Is there anything private I shouldn\u2019t touch?* Ranon asked.</p><p>*Like personal supplies?*</p><p>She found it amusing that a warrior who didn\u2019t flinch when looking at the carnage of a battlefield got skittish around clean moontime supplies. He didn\u2019t find it amusing at all.</p><p>He winced. *I meant hourglass supplies.*</p><p>*No,* she replied, all amusement gone. *What is private I carry with me.*</p><p>He nodded as she left the room. Which left him alone with Gray.</p><p>\u201cShe was really leaving?\u201d Gray asked, his eyes full of hurt bewilderment. \u201cWithout me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s confused, Gray.\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of any other way to say it, so he said it straight out. \u201cShe thought you were going to fall in love with Kermilla.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhy would she think that? Did I do something?\u201d</p><p>Ranon shook his head. \u201cTheran\u2019s been making such an ass of himself, I guess Cassidy figured the rest of us were attracted to Kermilla too.\u201d</p><p>Gray shuddered. Ranon shared the feeling.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pack up and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon?\u201d Gray did a nervous shuffle from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite her to this meeting, so which one of us is going to tell Vae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Powell?\u201d Talon asked as soon as they were alone in the Steward\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWere you aware that Theran has been driving Kermilla all around town, introducing her to the aristo families here and . . .\u201d Powell cleared his throat and suddenly got busy stacking account ledgers into neat piles before vanishing them.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . ?\u201d Talon prodded. When Powell didn\u2019t answer, anger began to simmer under a reluctance to understand. \u201cHe\u2019s introducedher as the Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s introduced her as a Queen from Dharo and has not corrected people who made the wrong assumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of game is he playing?\u201dWhat kind of game did I allow him to play? Cassidy\u2019s pain\u2014and the fact that it ran so deep she\u2019d been ready to run\u2014was as much his fault as Theran\u2019s.</p><p>Powell sighed. Calling in some small slips of paper, he handed them to Talon. \u201cKermilla wanted to do some shopping. Theran ordered the merchants to open accounts for her since she hadn\u2019t brought sufficient marks with her to pay for extra expenses. So she said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich means Theran will end up paying those bills from the treasure Lia hid for the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Theran told the merchants all of Kermilla\u2019s expenses would be covered by the town\u2019s tithe to the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKermilla spent more in a day than Cassidy spent in all the weeks she\u2019s been here.\u201d Powell paused. \u201cThe merchants wanted confirmation that they could deduct Kermilla\u2019s purchases from the tithe. I told them I would let them know as soon as I had a chance to discuss this with the Queen. The merchants who remained in Grayhaven are well aware of the dangers of dealing with a Queen. By not giving immediate confirmation, I\u2019ve warned them to be wary of further transactions.\u201d</p><p>Talon prowled the room for several minutes while Powell packed up the maps he\u2019d been gathering for Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll concede the town of Grayhaven,\u201d Talon said. \u201cTheran can have fifty percent of the tithe to use as he pleases. The other half goes to the treasury to pay the guards\u2019 wages and maintain the town. I\u2019ll clear it with Cassidy, but I\u2019ll ask her to accept my decision and give up that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for what?\u201d Powell asked.</p><p>Talon shook his head. In exchange for nothing. At least, nothing he was willing to discuss with Powell.</p> <p>He felt a respectful tap on his first inner barrier. \u201cRanon is on his way down. The boy cleared out his room fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to be gone.\u201d Powell rubbed his left hand. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Talon sighed. \u201cI raised Theran, taught him as best I could. Tried to hold on to the Old Ways even when I could feel them slipping away with each generation. I fought to keep him safe. I killed to keep him safe. You don\u2019t know how much it hurts to see him giving himself to Kermilla. I can\u2019t decide if protecting him from the twisted Queens all his life has made him blind to the kind of woman Kermilla is, or if he senses that something isn\u2019t right but is defending her because he can\u2019t admit he might be wrong about her. I can\u2019t decide\u2014but tonight I\u2019m wondering if men wasted their lives by defending the Grayhaven bloodline.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and raised a hand, indicating he didn\u2019t want a response.</p><p>A moment later, Ranon walked into the room\u2014and Talon walked out.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p> <p>TERREILLE</p><p>*Talon,* Cayle said. *We\u2019ve got the horses loaded in the livestock Coach. Haele and Burne are at the station. Everyone else is gone.*</p><p>*Then go,* Talon replied. *I\u2019m last man out.*</p><p>*See you in Eyota.*</p><p>*Yes, you will. May the Darkness embrace you.*</p><p>Standing outside the Grayhaven mansion, Talon watched the sun rise\u2014and felt the light begin to drain the power from his demon-dead flesh. Smarter to stay here until sundown, but once he delivered his message, it would be best for all of them if he left. He\u2019d need fresh human blood, not yarbarah, by the time he reached Eyota, but now he knew how to ask for it without feeling shame for what he was taking from the living.</p><p>He walked the hallways, delaying the moment when he would reach the family wing. Servants were already stirring. Dryden and Elle would be in the kitchen with Maydra, having a simple breakfast while the three reviewed the day\u2019s schedule. Birdie, who mostly looked after the rooms of the Queen, Steward, and Healer, gave him a sleepy smile as she passed him in a hallway. She was shy as a rabbit when she first came to work here a few weeks ago, but was getting braver because the Queen she served treated her with respect.</p><p>\u201cBirdie,\u201d he called before she disappeared around a corner.</p> <p>\u201cPrince Talon?\u201d She returned, looking uncertain since he\u2019d never asked her for anything before.</p><p>He called in a half sheet of paper and the stub of a pencil, and wrote, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s residence has moved to Eyota, a village in the eastern Shalador reserve.\u201d</p><p>He folded the paper into quarters and handed it to her. \u201cGive that to Dryden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Birdie started to leave, then hesitated. \u201cSir? Do you think Maydra should make up a tray for Lady Cassidy? The Lady\u2019s stomach has been a mite tender, and maybe a peaceful breakfast would help.\u201d</p><p>A stab of guilt. The Warlords and Warlord Princes who had lived in the Tamanara Mountains had swept into villages to get supplies, visit friends and family, and hunt down the men who willingly served the Queens they viewed as enemies. Then they swept out again, back to their guarded camps in the mountains, leaving the villagers behind to endure the Queen\u2019s grace.</p><p>What would being at Kermilla\u2019s beck and call do to a girl like Birdie?</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy won\u2019t need a tray this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to give that to Dryden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019ll do it right away.\u201d</p><p>He watched her go, a spring in her step. There was no spring in his. He needed to finish this task and get out.</p><p>When Theran answered the sharp rap on the bedroom door and blocked the view into his room, Talon wondered if there was someone with him\u2014and who it might be.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen\u2019s court is no longer in residence,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThe Queen\u2019s court now resides in Eyota.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s eyes remained sleepy and blank a moment too long. And that moment too long told Talon everything he needed to know about Theran\u2019s loyalty to Cassidy\u2014and also confirmed another truth that had been hidden under his own strength and the Grayhaven name: Theran didn\u2019t have that subtlesomething that made a man a true leader.</p><p>Theran\u2019s face darkened with anger. \u201cWhy should we move there and inconvenience everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone being your guest?\u201d Talon asked with a mildness that hid heartache and anger.</p><p>\u201cKermilla, yes, but the court as well. Why should we have to pack up just because Cassidy is acting like a spoiled child?\u201d</p><p>Talon snarled. \u201cBe careful what you say, boy. You\u2019re talking about the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you expect me to leave my family\u2019s home and go live in a Shalador reserve?\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome there.\u201d He said the words because they were true.</p><p>Theran\u2019s eyes widened. He looked stunned, hurt.</p><p>\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to be, Theran. Trust that I mean everything I say.\u201d No response but wariness. At least the boy had sense enough to be wary. \u201cYou will remain as First Escort so that the court remains intact. You promised to serve Cassidy for one year. That promise was witnessed by the most powerful men in all the Realms. But they aren\u2019t here. I am, and I will hold you to that promise. What you do the day after that contract is fulfilled is your own business, but you will do nothing to break this court. If you do, I will kill your whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla isnot a whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for keeping your oath of service, you will rule the town of Grayhaven on the Queen\u2019s behalf. All the tithes from the town will be your income to do with as you please. Half should go to the treasury, but no one is going to ask for an accounting of your expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalon, you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>He heard a hint of panic in Theran\u2019s voice. Good. The boy was finally understanding that he no longer had the support that had always guarded his back.</p><p>\u201cWhile she stands on Dena Nehele land, Kermilla will be confined to this town,\u201d Talon continued. \u201cThe Queen ordered Kermilla out of her Territory. You disregarded that command and made her your personal guest. The shame is on the rest of the First Circle, and especially me, that we let you do that. Because the fault is ours as well as yours, we will not raise a hand against Kermilla while she remains in Grayhaven. However, by sunrise tomorrow, every Warlord Prince in Dena Nehele will know she is considered an enemy of the Queen and tolerated only so long as she remains in the town under your rule. The moment she steps beyond that line, we will deal with her as we have dealt with every other enemy.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked shocked. \u201cKermilla is the Queen we should have had. She\u2019s the one who should have been here from the beginning, not Cassidy. I know you have to fulfill your contract with the court, and I respect that, but don\u2019t turn your back on the Queen you can serve next spring.\u201d</p><p>Sadness filled Talon. He\u2019d faced this moment before with friends, but he had never felt this bitter. And now that he felt the bond that drove a Warlord Prince to serve a particular Queen, he finally understood why good men had served bad Queens\u2014and had become twisted because of that service. He could only hope that the bond Theran felt broke before something in Theran did. \u201cKermilla is your Queen, isn\u2019t she? Something about her calls to you to cherish and protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the right Queen for Dena Nehele. For all of us. If you\u2019d just take the time to get to know her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my Queen, Theran,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe never will be. I look at her and see the same kind of Queen I fought against for three centuries. Nothing is going to change that, boy. We\u2019re standing on opposite sides of a line now. I\u2019m sorry for that, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d Theran said urgently. \u201cA year from now, Kermilla will be the Queen of Dena Nehele, and she may not forgive you for treating her this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be. If she does take control of Dena Nehele . . .\u201d Talon shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life as a rogue in the Tamanara Mountains. If it comes to that, I\u2019ll finish my life the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. Youcan\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean every word. Don\u2019t tell yourself otherwise.\u201d</p><p>They stood in a doorway, both feeling something break between them that would never truly mend.</p><p>\u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Theran.\u201d He hesitated, then felt he had to say one last thing, try one last time. \u201cI\u2019ve taught you what I could about honor, about the Invisible Ring. The day may come when you have to make a choice, so I want you to remember this: it is better to break your own heart than to break your honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you ever make that choice?\u201d Theran asked bitterly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right here. Right now.</p><p>Talon walked away from one of the boys he loved, walked out of the mansion, and headed for the landing web beyond the gate. The sun\u2019s fist beat on him with every step until he caught the Sapphire Wind and rode it through the Darkness, heading for Eyota.</p><p>Part of him wanted Theran to come after him. Part of him hoped the boy would stay away until he was free of Kermilla.</p> <p>And part of him had the sick feeling that Theran would use the Grayhaven name to justify breaking all of their trust.</p><p>Theran stood on the terrace, staring at the single remaining honey pear seedling. Gray had watered it, had given it that last bit of care before taking the other twelve.</p><p>Grayleft. Even more than Talon, Gray\u2019s misguided loyalty to Cassidy hurt. Hell\u2019s fire, it hurt. Ranon? He didn\u2019t give a damn if he ever saw the man again, but if Ranon was gone that meant Shira was gone\u2014and he needed to find someone else to act as Kermilla\u2019s personal Healer.</p><p>Probably for the best. He wasn\u2019t sure he would trust Kermilla\u2019s well-being to a Healer who was also a Black Widow.</p><p>\u201cOh,la. There you are.\u201d Kermilla slipped her arm through his and gave him a sunny smile. \u201cWhy the sour face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGray took the honey pears.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled as she looked at the marks on the terrace where the other pots had been. \u201cJust as well. That was such a hodgepodge of pots it was very unattractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose honey pears are a legacy, Kermilla. Their existence means a great deal to the Dena Nehele people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said contritely. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she realize? He had told her the story of how those pears were found after being buried for centuries. Of course, a guest would listen to the story as astory \u2014entertaining, but not important. But a Queen preparing to rule a Territory with a past like Dena Nehele\u2019s needed to understand the significance of those seedlings.</p><p>Just because Cassidy probably would have understood the significance didn\u2019t make her a better Queen. She was older and liked to grub around in the dirt. Kermilla, being younger, just needed more guidance in some areas.</p> <p>\u201cKermilla, would you have breakfast with me in private?\u201d He\u2019d tell her about the honey pears again\u2014and about Cassidy\u2019s rude departure.</p><p>\u201cOh,la. \u201d She gave him a delighted smile. \u201cYou are being sonaughty. My Consort will be jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Her expression immediately turned woeful. \u201cOh. I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Was she hinting that she\u2019d like to have him as her lover? He was willing.More than willing. Even if he had to dance around the damn Consort\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things I need to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are some possibilities we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t break Cassidy\u2019s court and risk Talon going after Kermilla. But he would make the best use of the time to prepare the ground for theright Queen.</p><p>A wet swipe across her cheek. A slurp across her closed eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAarhhh. Uuhhh.\u201d</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie! Gray says you must wake up so you can go to sleep.* A pause. *That is confusing, so it must be a human thing.* \u201cWha . . . ?\u201d</p><p>*Wake up!*</p><p>\u201cVae?\u201d Cassidy grunted. Groaned. \u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>A warm hand covered hers.</p><p>She smacked her lips\u2014and made a face. \u201cHell\u2019s fire. Did I swallow a cat?Vae. \u201d That because a Sceltie nose almost poked inside her mouth.</p><p>*I do not smell cat.*</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask, Cassie?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>Bastard sounded like he was laughing at her. \u201cMy tongue feels fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many cups of that brew did you give her?\u201d</p><p>Ranon\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cEnough to soothe a heart,\u201d Yairen said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Shira asked. \u201cDo you want anything?\u201d</p><p>Since no one else answered, Cassidy decided the questions had been directed at her. \u201cToast. Scrambled eggs. Bath.\u201d And something to scrape the fuzz off her tongue. \u201cWho is here?\u201dAnd where is here? Oh. Yes. Boardinghouse. She had meant to go to Dharo but had ended up here because Ranon took her trunks. The prick.</p><p>\u201cAlmost the whole First Circle,\u201d Gray answered, sounding tense.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cassidy said. Then her eyes popped open and she jackknifed to a sitting position. \u201cThecourt is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Gray said. \u201cTalon hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bedroom is ready,\u201d Shira said. \u201cWhat you need now is more sleep. After your bath, toast, and scrambled eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can . . .\u201d What? She was pretty sure she wasn\u2019t hungover, but she wasn\u2019t feeling smart either. \u201cI can stay here.\u201d</p><p>*You are in the way,* Vae said. *But we are not supposed to tell you that because you are the Queen.*</p><p>\u201cCome on, darling,\u201d Gray said, snorting in the effort not to laugh out loud. \u201cLet\u2019s get you up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gray hauled her to her feet. She felt a lot more tipsy now that she was standing up, so she didn\u2019t protest when Gray wrapped an arm around her waist and steered her toward the hallway and the stairs.</p><p>\u201cRanon, give me a hand,\u201d Gray said when they reached the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIf he puts his hands on my ass and pushes, I\u2019ll punch him,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not much of a threat when you can\u2019t keep your eyes open long enough to see him,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cI can . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>Thattone of voice coming from Gray woke her up.</p><p>Something in those green eyes. Something that warned her this was one of those times a smart woman yielded to male sensibilities.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to swear at me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A slow smile, male and satisfied, because the question told him he had won. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>So she had a bath. She had toast and scrambled eggs. And she asked one question.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I need to know about today?\u201d</p><p>Shira pulled back the covers on the bed. \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>She got into bed and let the world slip away for a few more hours.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of composing a note on the Queen\u2019s behalf, and asked Spere to deliver it to the Keep,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>Ranon frowned. \u201cWhy alert them that there\u2019s trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo avoid the potential for more trouble. And to prevent the messenger coming from Kaeleer from delivering Cassidy\u2019s correspondence at Grayhaven. They\u2019re going to know sooner or later. I thought it better to make the move sound matter-of-fact.\u201d</p><p>Ranon glanced at the clock on the mantel. Where in the name of Hell was Talon? Yes, he was the last man out, but riding the Sapphire Wind, he should have arrived right behind them.</p><p>Janos tapped on the door of the room Powell was using as a temporary office until they worked out the logistics of having a court take up long-term residence in a building that wasn\u2019t meant to hold a court.</p><p>\u201cA messenger arrived with this,\u201d he said, holding out a wax-sealed note to Ranon. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>He broke the seal. Simple message. \u201c \u2018Gone to ground,\u2019 \u201d he read. \u201c \u2018Will join you this evening. Talon.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cA prudent decision,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>Ranon placed a hand on Powell\u2019s shoulder and smiled. \u201cSo was sending that message to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>They had a good court. They had a good Queen.</p><p>Now they needed to do whatever it took to keep both.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>\u201cWhat do you make of this?\u201d Daemon asked, handing the paper to his father.</p><p>Saetan called in the half-moon glasses and read the message. Twice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very carefully worded,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cToo carefully worded.\u201d</p><p>He had the same impression. \u201cFirst time we\u2019ve received a message from Cassidy\u2019s Steward. Do you think there\u2019s trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly. And just as certainly, they don\u2019t want us asking questions right now about why the Queen has suddenly changed her residence from a mansion in Dena Nehele\u2019s capital to a boardinghouse in a small village located in a Shalador reserve.\u201d</p><p>Daemon frowned as he stared at the note. The report Cassidy had sent after her return from Eyota had been too brief for his liking, but he\u2019d sensed nothing from her words that couldn\u2019t be explained by simple fatigue. Now . . .</p><p>\u201cHas she gone back to Eyota to fix a problem, or has she left Grayhaven to get away from one?\u201d</p><p>Handing the message back to Daemon, Saetan removed his glasses and vanished them. \u201cLet\u2019s see what Cassidy says in her next report. What she doesn\u2019t say about this move will be as revealing as what she does say.\u201d</p><p>Daemon vanished the paper. \u201cI\u2019ll ask my second-in-command to deliver the next batch of letters to Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He smiled dryly. \u201cSurreal. She\u2019s decided she\u2019s going to work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can figure out, whatever she damn well pleases. She hasn\u2019t told me exactly what I\u2019m paying her for this privilege, only that I\u2019m going to be outrageously generous. I can send her and Rainier to Eyota. Between them, they\u2019ll find out everything we need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of everything we need to know, I understand Jaenelle and Ladvarian went to Scelt to talk to Morghann and Khary. Do you have any idea why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cand I\u2019m not asking.\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled. \u201cMy darling, you\u2019re not only becoming a wise man, you\u2019re becoming a smart husband.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>The evening after their return to Eyota, Cassidy drank the restorative brew Shira had made for her and listened to the men argue, discuss, and sometimes snarl as they tried to figure out how to shoehorn a court into the boardinghouse. And that wouldn\u2019t do at all. It would be like having too many guests crammed into her mother\u2019s house at Winsol\u2014fine for a few days when everyone was feeling cheerful and accommodating, but not something she would want to live with permanently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which meant drawing a line and refusing to let them shift it.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Gray was the first to focus his attention on her; Ranon was a close second, followed by Talon and Powell, which forced the others to swallow their opinions so they could hear what she had to say.</p> <p>\u201cA court is formed when twelve males make the commitment to serve a Queen and offer her their strength, their skills, and their loyalty. There is nothing in any book of Protocol that says they have to live with her. In Kaeleer, most Queens who rule a District\u2014which is anything from one to a handful of villages\u2014don\u2019t live in a home large enough to accommodate the whole court.\u201d She smiled at them.</p><p>Twelve men frowned at her. So did Shira\u2014and Reyhana, who had returned to Eyota to be of service to the Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>\u201cRanon, do the Shalador Queens live in houses large enough to accommodate their whole First Circle?\u201d Cassidy asked, hoping he\u2019d give her the answer that would help make her point.</p><p>\u201cThere are no official courts in the Shalador reserves,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cThe Queens merely help the elders keep the people under control so they will not offend the Province Queens or Territory Queen.\u201d Then he stopped, and his expression revealed a man torn between loyalties.</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean is, in order to protect the Queens and the men who were loyal to them, the Shalador Queens have no official-lookingcourts that might have been viewed as a challenge,\u201d Cassidy said gently. \u201cA Queen who can\u2019t form an official court has no more power than any other witch because the court is the instrument by which she rules.\u201d</p> <p>Ranon said nothing. It was one thing for him to deny the truth about the Shalador courts once. That was an instinctive effort to protect his people, and probably something he\u2019d been doing since he was a boy. But denying it twice would mean lying to her and that would be a break in trust.</p><p>\u201cI have met the Shalador Queens, Ranon,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure their courts arevery official. But not obvious to an outsider who expects a Queen to have a big house and lots of frills and ruffles.\u201d</p><p>*Which is Ranon?* Shira asked. *A frill or a ruffle?*</p><p>Cassidy couldn\u2019t hold back the quick burst of laughter that had all the men looking from her to Shira and back again.</p><p>Shira kept her head down and her hands folded in her lap. She would have looked demure if she could have stopped smiling.</p><p>\u201cThe point, gentlemen,\u201d Cassidy said, not daring to look at any of them yet, \u201cis that this court\u2019s living accommodations should follow the arrangements that are typical for a Queen living in a small village.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t rule a small village, Cassidy,\u201d Powell said respectfully. \u201cYou rule the Territory of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorghann is the Queen of Scelt\u2014a Territory in Kaeleer. She lives in a small village not much bigger than this one. The only member of her First Circle who lives with her is Khardeen, the Warlord of Maghre. And the only reason he lives there is because he\u2019s her husband as well as her Consort. Their house is divided between family and court. There are offices for her and the Steward, a smaller office for the Master of the Guard, a large meeting room, and a room where the First Circle can gather to relax, plan, or do whatever is needed. There is a large dining room that can accommodate the whole First Circle for a meal\u2014or be used for social functions. The rest of the house belongs to the Queen and her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where does everyone else live?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the village,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m proposing we do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d Half the Circle growled that opinion\u2014including Ranon.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I had in mind.\u201d Cassidy raised her voice in order to be heard above the growls and mutters. \u201cTalon and Powell will reside here with me. So will Gray, Shira, Ranon, and Reyhana since a young Queen training in a court requires a chaperon, and that is one of the duties of the First Circle. There are several cottages on this street and nearby streets that look abandoned, and they\u2019re all close enough to the stable we\u2019re using for the horses. If the village elders have no objections, the rest of the men can take up residence in those cottages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Kaeleer, why don\u2019t those men want to stay close to their Queen?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cMost of them have families,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cFor the First Circle, their work is the court. They\u2019re paid from the tithes. They have families. They have expenses. They have a life just like everyone else in the village.\u201d She looked around the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen this, have you?\u201d</p> <p>Talon didn\u2019t respond, but the rest of them shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cRanon, you must have seen this in the Shalador villages where the Queens lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe Queens\u2019 safety depended on the rest of us not asking too many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen is entitled to a private life too,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>Suddenly no one was looking at Cassidy\u2014or Gray.</p><p>Powell cleared his throat. \u201cWell, if such living accommodations are customary in Kaeleer, we can . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a wife,\u201d Shaddo said suddenly. He stared hard at the surface of the table. \u201cI have two sons. There\u2019s no formal marriage contract. We couldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisk it?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe other Queens used to hold a wife or child hostage to try to force a Warlord Prince to surrender and subject himself to being controlled by a Ring of Obedience,\u201d Talon said grimly. \u201cHalf the time, if the man gave in, the woman or child was killed anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Cassidy whispered. No wonder these men had been so wary of her.</p><p>\u201cMy oldest son will have his Birthright Ceremony this autumn,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cSoli wasn\u2019t going to acknowledge the paternal bloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your son would be considered a bastard,\u201d Gray said. \u201cHe\u2019d have no social standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019d be alive,\u201d Shaddo said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cA village close to the western border. A little north of the western reserve, actually,\u201d Shaddo replied.</p><p>Cassidy swallowed tears, and her voice was huskier than usual because of them. \u201cShaddo, your wife should not be without her husband, and your sons should not be without their father. Unless the village elders have some objection, there is no reason why they can\u2019t be here with you.\u201d</p><p>Twelve men studied her, and she knew they heard the tears she couldn\u2019t quite hide.</p><p>\u201cThe elders won\u2019t object,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cBut thisis one of the reserves. I doubt we can offer the kind of life they\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of those cottages is better than what they\u2019re living in now,\u201d Shaddo said.</p><p>\u201cI have a sister,\u201d Archerr said. \u201cShe has three children, two boys and a girl. Their village was burned during the landen uprisings. They survived because they weren\u2019t home that day. They\u2019d been out picking berries, and when they saw the smoke, they hid. She\u2019s doing the best she can, but she needs some help to make a new start for herself and the children.\u201d</p><p>And neither of you mentioned these women and children in the weeks since the court was formed?Cassidy wanted to rail at them for not speaking sooner. She couldn\u2019t because she knew exactly what Lucivar and her cousin Aaron would say: defend and protect. For Shaddo and Archerr, the best way to protect the people they loved wasnot to bring them to her attention.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cShaddo, if you want, take one of your Brothers in the court to help you get your family packed and moved here. While you\u2019re in the west, you can deliver messages to any of the Queens you can contact. Powell and I had sent messages about using the Queen\u2019s Gift to help the land. The Ladies should be told where they can find me if they need instructions. That goes for you, too, Archerr. Powell, you\u2019ll be responsible for converting the rooms the court needs for offices and gatherings.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. Now the fight began. \u201cThe rest of you will assist me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d Gray asked, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>He was getting too damn good at sensing when she was about to throw water on a bag of cats, as her father would say.</p><p>\u201cThis is the growing season,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThe land is in desperate need of help. The Queens need to do something to increase the harvest, and they need to do itnow .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cGray\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>His voice thundered in the room as he leaped to his feet, knocking the chair over.</p><p>Cassidy pushed away from the table and rose. Since he\u2019d been sitting on her left, there was nothing but the corner of the table between them. So all they needed to do was lean forward a little to be nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDoing that almost destroyed you, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was careless. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. But it isvital to take care of the land and to do it now. Gray, youknow it\u2019s vital. What the Queens can do will make a difference for everyone in Dena Nehele. And this is a ritual. This is part of the Old Ways you all said you wanted to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the risk of you getting hurt again!\u201d Gray snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Gray,\u201d Ranon said, starting to get to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou sit down!\u201d Cassidy pointed at him.</p><p>Ranon froze. Then he looked at Talon for instructions, which really pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Ranon!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou too!\u201d She gave Gray a push. It wasn\u2019t much of a push, but the look on his face had Ranon reaching across Shira to clamp a hand on Gray\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d said a voice full of biting laughter, \u201cthis sounds just like home.\u201d</p><p>The men whipped around to face the doorway. Shira had a look in her eyes that made Cassidy wonder if the woman was preparing to use some of the Black Widows\u2019 Craft. Reyhana looked fearful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strap some steel to your spine.Cassidy turned and stared at the black-haired woman who had delicately pointed ears and the handsome man who leaned on a cane.</p><p>Mother Night, what was Surreal doing here?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it sound like home, Rainier?\u201d Surreal asked her companion.</p> <p>\u201cIt does,\u201d he replied. \u201cAlthough these two are clearly still novices. When Jaenelle and Lucivar used to go at it, they could make the glass in the windows shake\u2014until their father had enough of listening to them and roared them into silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle Saetan is very impressive when he lets his temper slip the leash,\u201d Surreal said.</p><p>\u201cLady Surreal,\u201d Cassidy said, hoping no one had been foolish enough to stand in Surreal\u2019s way when she came through the house. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>Surreal called in a stack of envelopes and held them up. \u201cI\u2019m delivering your letters. And I\u2019m here to have a little chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and the Ladies go into the parlor for your chat while I stay here and answer the gentlemen\u2019s questions?\u201d Rainier said.</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any questions,\u201d Gray snarled. \u201cCassie isnot doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Gray,\u201d Cassidy said. Then to Surreal, \u201cThank you for bringing the letters, but there is nothing for us to chat about. This is Terreille, not Kaeleer, and I don\u2019t have to discuss anything with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, sugar, you don\u2019t want to be summoned to the Keep to explain whatever this is to Sadi. Or Yaslana. Or the High Lord. Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be as flexible as I\u2019m willing to be. Comes from them having cocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Rainier said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a cock too, so beg all you want,\u201d Surreal said. *Sugar, do this with grace because you don\u2019t have a choice. You either talk to me here or you talk to Sadi.*</p><p>Since Cassidy doubted Daemon Sadi would like what he heard, she also doubted he would stand aside after that \u201cchat\u201d and let her return to Dena Nehele.</p> <p>Surreal was right. Talking to another witch was a much better choice. \u201cLadies, let\u2019s adjourn to the parlor and leave the men to their own discussion,\u201d Cassidy said. She walked past Surreal and Rainier, then waited for Shira and Reyhana.</p><p>As Surreal closed the door, she heard Rainier say, \u201cSo what is it that Lady Cassidy isn\u2019t going to do?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon settled in the chair behind the blackwood desk, crossed his legs, steepled his fingers, and tried to decide if his second and his secretary, who werefinally coming to report, deserved a verbal ripping or if he should hold his tongue and his temper.</p><p>Surreal gave him a smile that dared him to say anything. Rainier gave him a panickydon\u2019t expect me to control her look.</p><p>\u201cMy darlings,\u201d he said with a mildness that would frighten any intelligent person\u2014excluding females. \u201cBreakfast is served here at the Hall every day. You didn\u2019t have to bypass the family seat last night and go all the way to Amdarh to get a meal this morning.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he minded them going on to Amdarh instead of coming to the Hall, even though that would have been more sensible since the Hall was closer to the Keep and its Gate. What pissed him off was that neither of them had sent a message last night to let him know they were safely back in Kaeleer. No, it was Helton who\u2019d had sense enough to send a message to Beale early this morning.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted some time to think before coming here\u2014and I chose to do my thinking in the family\u2019s town house in Amdarh,\u201d Surreal said with equal mildness.</p><p>She\u2019d had plenty of time to think on the journey back from Dena Nehele, so she\u2019d probably wanted a little more time to consider what she was\u2014and wasn\u2019t\u2014going to say.</p><p>Daemon raised one eyebrow and waited.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go first?\u201d Surreal said to Rainier.</p><p>Rainier gave her a long look, then shrugged. \u201cOur arrival interrupted a full-volume discussion between Cassidy and a Warlord Prince named Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s reached that stage, has he?\u201d Daemon asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting this?\u201d Rainier hesitated. \u201cGray is . . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was held captive by a Queen and tortured for two years,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cHe was fifteen when he was taken.\u201d</p><p>Rainier nodded. \u201cThat explains the schism. I felt like I was listening to an adolescent who was still innocent enough to blurt out every thought and complaint, but it was a Warlord Prince around my own age who was absorbing the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about right.\u201d</p><p>Rainier shifted in his chair. \u201cAnyway, there were twelve men around that table, and every one of them resented me asking questions abouttheir Queen andtheir court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey resented me too,\u201d Surreal said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rainier said, \u201cthey were afraid ofyou. Me they would have buried without hesitation if they thought they would survive the retaliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Surreal said.</p><p>\u201cSomething is going on, and no one wants to talk about what that something is,\u201d Rainier said. \u201cHowever, Gray was more than willing to complain about Cassidy wanting to use the Queen\u2019s Gift of having a connection to the land to boost the potential harvest\u2014and also teach the other Queens how to do the same thing. They all sat there with their mouths hanging open when I said Cassidy and the other Queens had left it a bit late since all the Queens in Kaeleer had done this in the spring. I told them how it\u2019s usually part of the spring planting festival most villages have and there\u2019s usually music and dancing in the evening\u2014a bit of fun before people settled in to the summer work. And I mentioned that Queens habitually drain a little of their power into the land before their moontime because it makes them more comfortable physically. They didn\u2019t know about that either\u2014and considering how many of those men blushed when I said the word \u2018moontime,\u2019 I have the feeling not many of them have had much experience living with women for more than a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of Cassie\u2019s court are rogues as well as warriors,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cSo you\u2019re probably right that this is all much newer ground than any of us realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey also didn\u2019t know about the tradition of fussing,\u201d Rainier said. \u201cSo I took the liberty of explaining it\u2014especially as it applies to a Queen and her court.\u201d</p><p>Daemon laughed. Oh, Cassie was going to have some comments aboutthat in her next report. Then his humor faded as he looked at Surreal.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cStone in a pond. Cassidy seems frustrated by how little she\u2019s done in the weeks she\u2019s been in Dena Nehele. My sense is she\u2019s done enough already to send ripples through the whole Territory\u2014including taking a young Shalador Queen into the court for training. I met the girl the last time I was in Eyota. With the right hand to guide her, Reyhana will be a strong, impressive ruler in a few years. She didn\u2019t say a word while Cassidy and Shira talked, but she listened fiercely\u2014and I had the impression she was hearing some of the same things that weren\u2019t being said that I was. And didn\u2019t like them any better.\u201d She paused, then added, \u201cTheran Grayhaven wasn\u2019t in residence, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Daemon said, watching her carefully. Those gold-green eyes held the ruthless chill of a first-rate assassin.</p><p>\u201cDoes the name Kermilla mean anything to you?\u201d Surreal asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Should it?\u201d</p><p>Surreal shrugged. \u201cThis is what I was told. A Lady Kermilla arrived at Grayhaven to have an audience with the Queen. Audience was granted, and Kermilla\u2019s request was denied. Instead of leaving as she should have, Kermilla has become Theran Grayhaven\u2019s \u2018personal guest,\u2019 over Cassidy\u2019s objections. So Queen and court removed themselves from the Grayhaven mansion and have taken up residence in Eyota, where Cassidy is determined to do some good for these people during her year in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s not set on leaving at the end of that year,\u201d Rainier said, \u201cbecausemy impression is that, however this started, her court is no longer thinking of her presence in Dena Nehele as temporary or as just a year to train someone else. They\u2019re starting to dig in, and they\u2019ll challenge anyone who tries to take her away from them. And that, Prince Sadi, includes you.\u201d</p><p>Good,Daemon thought. \u201cSo Cassidy relocated her court because of Theran\u2019s lover? I\u2019m assuming \u2018personal guest\u2019 equals lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it does,\u201d Surreal replied. \u201cBut she must mean something if Theran chose her over the Queen he swore to serve.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cKermilla is the key to this break between Cassidy and Theran because everyone was being very careful not to tell me where Kermilla came from or her caste. You don\u2019t know her. Maybe Jaenelle does. You should ask her.\u201d</p><p>Why don\u2019t you?He knew the answer to that. As strong as she was, as powerful as she was, and as fierce as she was, Surreal did not want to be the one who asked Jaenelle Angelline that question.</p><p>He waited until the midday meal. Surreal and Rainier had . . . fled, to be accurate, leaving him to ask what seemed a simple question.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Lady Kermilla?\u201d he asked as he cut into his beef.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Her voice\u2014that midnight, sepulchral, lightning-filled voice\u2014ripped icy claws down his spine.</p><p>And not just his spine, Daemon thought as he put down his knife and fork. There were ice crystals on his food, and the water in the glass was frozen solid. And when he looked up, the sapphire eyes staring at him were filled with cold rage.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cI asked a simple question, Lady,\u201d he said, keeping his own voice quiet and respectful.</p><p>\u201cShe is someone who will never be a guest in this house if you want me to continue living here,\u201d Witch replied.</p><p>Had Surreal guessed this would be Jaenelle\u2019s reaction? A little more warning would have been appreciated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Jaenelle, whois she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Queen who took Cassie\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . .\u201d Oh, shit.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you asking about Kermilla, Prince?\u201d</p><p>The look in her eyes and the lethal purr in her voice made him put a double Black shield around himself before he said, \u201cShe\u2019s in Dena Nehele, staying at the Grayhaven estate.\u201d</p><p>Daemon removed his shoes and socks. He checked one foot, then the other. He didn\u2019t respond to the knock on his study door, but the door opened anyway. Jaenelle walked in, carrying a large tray.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, sounding contrite.</p><p>\u201cCounting my toes.\u201d</p> <p>A pause. \u201cThey\u2019re all there, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Thank the Darkness.</p><p>She set the tray down on the low table in front of the sofa, then sat close to him.

Well, even a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince can have the shit scared out of him\u2014especially when one moment he was sitting at a large blackwood dining table and the next he was surrounded by a table, chairs, dishes, silverware, glasses, and food that had all been reduced to a pile of uniform pieces no bigger than grains of rice.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the table exploding that upset him. It was the uniformity of the debris that was proof of the depth of her rage. And that rage, and whatever blend of power she had been channeling through Twilight\u2019s Dawn at that moment, had been strong enough to crack his outermost Black shield.</p> <p>That was something he needed to talk to Lucivar about.Soon.</p><p>\u201cYou were wrapped in a double Black shield,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d Now that he\u2019d gotten over the shock of it, her slash of temper was starting to piss him off. But he leashed that because there had to be a reason for this. Jaenelle didn\u2019t explode like that as some kind of twisted entertainment. And the strength of her reaction got him thinking.</p><p>He rubbed his forehead to ease the headache building behind his eyes, then shifted and turned so he was close to her.</p><p>\u201cQueens lose men or courts to rivals all the time. And even though Cassidy is a friend and losing her court did leave her bruised, that doesn\u2019t equal your rage. If Cassidy doesn\u2019t have enough spine to tell Kermilla to take a piss in the wind, then she\u2019d better acquire some. From everything Surreal and Rainier told me, her court is becoming a solid team committed to their Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Jaenelle asked softly.</p><p>\u201cExcept Theran Grayhaven.\u201d He brushed fingertips over her shoulder. \u201cJaenelle, what aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>Those sapphire eyes studied him. \u201cThere is nothing you can do about this. Neither of us have any right to interfere in this. Is that understood?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, he didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spun a tangled web after Cassidy discovered the treasure in the Grayhaven attics. I wasn\u2019t going to share what I saw with anyone, but I owe you that as an explanation for how I reacted.\u201d</p><p>Sweet Darkness. A tangled web. Dreams and visions.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDena Nehele is going to fall.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Why now, when they had survived everything Dorothea SaDiablo had done to them? \u201cBecause Kermilla went there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore because Kermilla is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bury the bitch,\u201d he said too softly, opening his eyes to stare into hers. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Terreille, no matter the price, and bury the bitch if that\u2019s what you want. Or I\u2019ll let Surreal go. She\u2019d be willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her fingers brushed through his hair, soothing. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them now. Their decisions. Their choices. Sorrow and joy, Daemon. There is sorrow and joy in what I saw.\u201d</p><p>How can there be joy?But he trusted her, and if she said there could be joy in Dena Nehele\u2019s fall, he would believe her.</p><p>\u201cSo there is nothing we can do for them,\u201d he said, making it a statement rather than a question.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t interfere with another Queen\u2019s Territory. That would violate Blood law and our code of honor. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is nothing we can do. In fact, I\u2019ve already helped make arrangements for a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that different from interfering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the first instance, I gave only the help requested by someone living in Dena Nehele. In the second, I\u2019m simply making available something I think Cassie and her court will find useful. What they do with the material is up to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds intriguing.\u201d He looked at the food on the tray. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we eat the soup while it\u2019s hot, and you can tell me all about it?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran,\u201d Dryden said. \u201cThere are some Ladies here to see the Queen.\u201d</p><p>Theran tried to relax his jaw. He\u2019d spent the morning gritting his teeth as he waded through all the crap the Steward should be doing. He was going to have to hire someone to deal with the paperwork\u2014and complaints\u2014until he could get a new court established. Of course, hiring someone meant paying wages, and he still had to figure out how much income he would get from the tithe and what part of that was already committed to paying the guards who protected the town and its citizens. Now that Cassidy was no longer in residence, he also had to figure out if the servants could be paid out of the tithe or if he\u2019d have to pay their wages out of the Grayhaven inheritance.</p><p>\u201cWhat Ladies?\u201d he growled. \u201cWhy are they here to see Kermilla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are Queens. They do not wish to offer their names or where they live, and as a courtesy to them, I did not press for that information. They said they received a letter from Lady Cassidy about some Craft the Queens can do to help increase the harvest. She offered to teach them.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. \u201cWell, tell them . . .\u201d</p><p>An opportunity. A chance for the other Queens to meet Kermilla\u2014and a chance for Kermilla to show the Queens and, through them, the Warlord Princes that she had as much, if not more, to offer the people of Dena Nehele as Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cTell them Lady Kermilla and I will join them shortly.\u201d Theran pushed away from the desk and the nagging paperwork.</p><p>He found Kermilla in the parlor, playing cards with Jhorma and two of the escorts.</p><p>\u201cOh,la. You must be cheating, Jhorma,\u201d Kermilla said, throwing down her cards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cheating,\u201d Jhorma replied with tight courtesy.</p><p>\u201cYou must be! I haven\u2019t won anything in the last six hands!\u201d</p><p>After playing cards with them a couple of times, Theran realized Jhorma cheated in order to ensure shedid win a few hands. The man must not be in an accommodating mood today.</p><p>\u201cKermilla, I need your help for an hour or so,\u201d Theran said, glad he could offer an interruption. A display of bad temper was exactly what they didn\u2019t need with other Queens in the mansion.</p><p>\u201cI might as well help you,\u201d Kermilla said, leaving the table. \u201cJhorma isn\u2019t beingany fun.\u201d</p><p>Good,Theran thought. He wasn\u2019t sure how to approach a Queen to find out if she wanted to have sex, but if her Consort wasn\u2019t entertaining her sufficiently, Kermilla might be receptive to another man\u2019s interest.</p><p>She slipped her arm through his as he led her from the room. \u201cAre we going to a party or one of those quaint outdoor concerts?\u201d Her laugh tinkled through the hallway. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to make fun but,la, the musicians aren\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to wince. There wasn\u2019t much in the town that could entertain a vivacious young woman who was used to finer amusements. Since Cassidy had been so keen to attend one of the outdoor concerts, he\u2019d figured Kermilla would enjoy going to one.</p><p>That evening only emphasized the differences between the two women. Kermilla might be younger, but she was far more aristo and sophisticated. Which made it difficult when the town, and the remaining aristo families, had so little to offer.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is something else,\u201d Theran said. \u201cSome Queens have arrived to learn that Queen\u2019s Craft of using power to enrich the land.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla rolled her eyes. \u201cOh.That. Every Queen knows how to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. The Queens here have forgotten. They need someone to lead them, to teach them.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sexy pout that always made him wonder what her mouth would taste like, but there wasn\u2019t time for distractions.</p><p>\u201cCassidy offered to show them,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cThen let Cassidy show them,\u201d Kermilla snapped. \u201cShe always liked digging in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>Theran hesitated. He couldn\u2019t make promises, couldn\u2019t give her assurances yet, but hecould hint strongly enough that she wouldn\u2019t mistake his meaning. Not after the other hints he\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cA Territory Queen needs to be a strong leader, needs to teach the skills that will benefit the people.\u201d He stopped walking and looked at her intently so she would understand this was important. \u201cWhen Cassidy\u2019s contract ends next spring, the Warlord Princes will need to select another Queen to rule Dena Nehele. They\u2019ll take the opinions and preferences of the Queens who are here today into account.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>Several seconds later, her eyes widened. \u201cOh. Isee . Well then, since Cassidy isn\u2019t here to perform her duties, I will be happy to assist you, Theran. It would be a shame if my Sisters made a journey here for nothing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, relieved. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Surreal took his face between her hands and smiled. \u201cYou have a penis, and it makes you strange. Try not to be an ass on top of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019mnot an ass,\u201d Gray muttered as he watched Cassidy explain to another group of Queens the different ways of using their power to enhance the crops in a field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you still snarling about that?\u201d Ranon asked, also keeping close watch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be snarling too if she\u2019d said it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Ranon replied, smiling. Then he sighed. Gray heard so much relief in that sound.</p> <p>\u201cLast one,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThen we can go home.\u201d</p><p>They had fought it out for hours after Surreal and Rainier left. Powell had tried to keep things courteous, but it felt like yelling was the only way to bridge the gap between what Cassie wanted to do and what the court was willing to let her do.</p><p>In the end, neither side was happy, but the compromise was something they could all live with.</p><p>Thirty villages in five days, spread over the three Shalador reserves and the two southernmost Provinces. Fifteen Blood and fifteen landen. Cassie had insisted that the landens be included.Every man had been opposed tothat\u2014 until Vae nipped Ranon in the ass. So Cassie, backed by Vae\u2019s teeth, had won that part of the argument.</p><p>Gray hadn\u2019t fought in the landen uprising. Hadn\u2019t seen the bodies in the burned villages. Hadn\u2019t found what was left of people he\u2019d loved. But he understood why the other men had argued. It had been hard for the Warlord Princes especially to watch Cassie open a vein and fill that small offering cup to benefit landens.</p> <p>But after the first landen village, they all understood why she had fought to do this. The landens were hostile and wary\u2014and sure that a Queen\u2019s presence meant pain. Mother Night, the looks on their faces when they realized Cassie and the Queens who came with her were doing something that would benefit their village and increase their crops so they could pay the tithe and still feed their children through the coming winter.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t erase generations of suffering and two years of war in a couple of hours,\u201d Ranon said quietly. \u201cBut, sweet Darkness, Gray, the people in this village won\u2019t look at the Blood the same way the next time we ride in.\u201d</p><p>Because of the Queen with hazel eyes and sunset hair.</p><p>The Queens walked the field, dipping into the barrels of water that floated behind them and sprinkling the ground with water enhanced with their blood and power. First and last plant in each row got a dipper full of water. Gray could already see a difference in the first rows that had been given the Queens\u2019 touch.</p><p>A gift. A part of what it meant to be a Queen. The ritual cup of blood made the water richer and nourished the land faster, but power alone could be released into the water or directly into the land. The results weren\u2019t as dramatic, but it was less physically demanding for the Queen and something they could do often without endangering themselves.</p><p>Learning about that option had almost started another quarrel between him and Cassie over her first careless release of power. Probably just as well that Surreal and Rainier had already gone home before he found out about it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad there\u2019s a way the Queens can use their gift without spilling their own blood,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cShira is pleased about that too,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t happy about Cassidy opening a vein every time to siphon some power into the land. The men who serve can accept blood being given once a year in a ceremony when the rest of the time it\u2019s just the Ladies releasing a bit of power into the land or water.\u201d He paused. \u201cEven using restraint and letting other Queens demonstrate, Cassidy has drained herself more than she should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go home andrest for a day,\u201d Gray said, feeling his temper sharpen at the thought of her collapsing again.</p><p>Ranon snorted. \u201cGood luck getting her to do that.\u201d</p><p>Gray closed his eyes and began counting. \u201cHer moontime is coming. Shehas to rest during those first three days. It\u2019s arule. \u201d</p><p>He could feel Ranon watching him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that fussing thing,\u201d he said, opening his eyes enough to keep track of Cassie. \u201cThat first time, Lucivar said something about being allowed to fuss during those days, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>He heard Ranon try to choke it back, but the laughter burst out.</p> <p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Gray,\u201d Ranon said when he was able to speak again. \u201cYou\u2019re turning into a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Something inside him shifted, settled. Felt solid\u2014and right. He looked at his friend and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m turning into a Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla lay back on her bed and smiled.</p><p>The Queen of Dena Nehele. She finally understood what all of Theran\u2019s circling had been about. He wanted to know if she was interested in ruling Dena Nehele after Cassidy\u2019s contract ran out. He didn\u2019t want Freckledy; he wantedher.</p><p>A Territory Queen.La, wasn\u2019t that wonderful? All right, it wasn\u2019t a rich, exciting Territory, and itwas in Terreille, but the tithes had to be worth the responsibilities, so they would beso much better than that little sheep-shit village of Bhak or, worse, Woolskin. She\u2019d try for a five-year contract. Theran would get it for her. And she wouldn\u2019t shirk her duties. Really, she wouldn\u2019t. But she\u2019d make sure there was somefun too.</p><p>It had been satisfying to teach those other Queens about draining power into the land. Such a basic thing, and they didn\u2019t know it.La! They weren\u2019t much better than landens. Not that she\u2019dsaid that. She supposed they were nice enough, but most of them were older than her and they looked so tatty and didn\u2019t talk about anything interesting. How could they expect anyone to take them seriously as Queens when they dressed like that and didn\u2019t know how to be interesting?</p><p>She would set an example, even set the fashion trends. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? Of course, because Freckledy had gotten into a snit, she was stuck here in Grayhaven, which was supposed to be the capital of Dena Nehele and an Important Town. There wasn\u2019t anything here thatshe considered impressive. If this was the best they could do, maybe she didn\u2019t want to rule here after all.</p><p>No, of course she wanted to rule here. When would she get another opportunity to rule a whole Territory? Sabrina was going to be ruling Dharo for years and years, and there were too many other strong Queens to choose from when it came time for a successor. She could continue to rule Bhak and keep a connection with Dharo that way. A few days each season would be sufficient for whatever required her attention. Her Steward could run Bhak and landen Woolskin the rest of the time and just send her reports\u2014and the all-important income from the tithes. Then, if she decided not to stay in Dena Nehele and nothing better turned up in Terreille, she could go home, a seasoned Queen who might not be offered a Province\u2014yet\u2014but should be given her pick of the larger cities that could offer more diversity in terms of society and entertainment\u2014and shops.</p><p>If she was going to stay here, she would need more company. Nottoo much company, since Theran was more than a bit stingy and he would have to support any Ladies who were her companions. But that one young Queen who had come with the others\u2014she and Correne had become friends within minutes, and the girl was enough like her to fit right in. At sixteen, Correne wasn\u2019t a baby, but she was still too young to be serious competition, despite being pretty. No Queen was serious competition until she had her Virgin Night and could offer some enticement to the males without risking her own power.</p><p>A knock on her door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said gaily.</p><p>Jhorma slipped into the room and closed the door.</p><p>Kermilla watched him as he approached the bed. He was a handsome man and a skilled lover, but there wasn\u2019t the heat in his eyes for her that there had been while he was chained to Cassidy\u2019s bed. Oh, he came to her bed hungry to please\u2014and to take his own relief as a reward\u2014and he never made excuses to get out of performing the way he did with Freckledy toward the end of his contract. But he didn\u2019t look at her the way Theran did. She was getting the impression that Jhorma could swap her with any female body and be just as thorough and enthusiastic\u2014as long as he got his own pleasure at the end. Theran looked at her as if she was the only one he wanted, the only one who could satisfy him.</p><p>Jhorma didn\u2019t remove his jacket before sitting beside her on the bed, didn\u2019t make any move to touch her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>She ran a finger down his arm and smiled playfully. \u201cSex first, talk later.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cHow much longer are we going to be stuck in this place?\u201d</p><p>Her smile soured to a frown. \u201cFor as long as I say we stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy isn\u2019t here, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s coming back. When you decided to come here, you told Gallard we would be gone a couple of days. Three at the most. He assigned the escorts according to that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAston and Ridley have families. They want to go home. They wouldn\u2019t have been given this assignment if the Steward had known we\u2019d be away this long.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, stung that Jhorma was more interested in talking about Aston and Ridley than in having sex with her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cTell the whiny boys who are missing the nipple that they can go home.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in his eyes before he hid it.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shown her anger since he\u2019d signed a contract to serve as her Consort, but he hadn\u2019t hesitated to give her a verbal slap when she\u2019d been training in Freckledy\u2019s court and had said something cutting about one of the other men.</p><p>But he\u2019d always smiled indulgently when she\u2019d referred to Cassidy as Freckledy. She\u2019d just forgotten how testy the males could be when you made fun of one ofthem.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was uncalled for. It\u2019s just . . . I don\u2019t feel like I have any support here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe we should all go back to Dharo.\u201d</p><p>But I have a chance to rule a whole Territory.</p><p>Not something she could say to him.He wouldn\u2019t be part of that court. She didn\u2019t pay attention when Theran began droning on and on about Dena Nehele, but she did understand that he and the other Warlord Princes here never would tolerate a ruling court made up of outsiders. Something about courts like that ruling here before and making a mess of things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe she could go back to Dharo and return here next spring when Cassidy\u2019s contract ended. No, she couldn\u2019t. She had to show these people she was the better Queen, and she couldn\u2019t do that unless she was hereshowing them she was the better Queen. Just like she\u2019d done in Bhak when she\u2019d won over Freckledy\u2019s court.</p><p>\u201cThere are reasons why I need to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Aston and Ridley need to return to Dharo, they can go. But two others from the First Circle should take their place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll convey the message,\u201d Jhorma said. \u201cDo you want sex now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I do not want sex now.\u201d Especially when he might have been asking her if she wanted a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cAs you please.\u201d Jhorma rose and walked out of the room.</p><p>Shehad wanted sex, but he\u2019d spoiled her mood.</p><p>So maybe she\u2019d take a walk in the moonlight with Theran this evening and see if he had any experience behind that enthusiasm.</p><p>Accepting Gray\u2019s assistance, Cassidy stepped out of the carriage and looked at the boardinghouse. Queen\u2019s Residence, she reminded herself. Somehow, while dealing with the snarls and grumbles that had been a constant background during this journey, she had agreed that the boardinghouse now be referred to as the Queen\u2019s Residence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home,\u201d she said\u2014and wondered if she would recognize the inside of the place. After all, she\u2019d been gone five days and had told Powell he could do pretty much as he pleased.</p><p>\u201cThose cottages across from the Residence weren\u2019t occupied when we left,\u201d Ranon said, studying the street while offering Shira a hand. \u201cShaddo and Archerr must be back.\u201d</p><p>The door of the Residence opened. Talon stepped out and strode over to them.</p><p>The way he looked her over\u2014as if assessing a warrior he\u2019d sent out on a difficult mission who had finally returned\u2014she wondered how many reports, and complaints, the Master of the Guard and Steward had received in the past five days.</p><p>\u201cShaddo and Archerr are back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cLady Shira, tomorrow will be soon enough, but I think a visit from the court Healer would be in order for both families. Those people have not had an easy time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould I go over and welcome them?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The finality of that statement shook her.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow afternoon is soon enough for them to have an audience with the Queen,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cSurely we don\u2019t have to be so formal\u2014\u201d She swallowed the rest of her protest. It was clear Talon thought there was reason for that formality.</p><p>\u201cPowell has worked out a schedule of afternoons when you are available to give audiences,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cAfternoons?\u201d Cassidy stammered. \u201cAudiences? Hell\u2019s fire! I thought Powell was going to rearrange the furniture, not my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p> <p>The amusement under the dry words made her take a step back. \u201cIs tomorrow morning soon enough to go over my social calendar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Talon replied.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then there\u2019s enough time for a quick bite to eat before I meet Lord Yairen for my drumming lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201dRanon backed away from her, his dark eyes filled with fear. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Staggered by his distress, she said nothing as he strode down the street toward his grandfather\u2019s house. Then she turned to Shira.</p><p>\u201cYairen offered to teach you?\u201d Shira asked, her voice breaking as tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes. When Ranon brought me back here, Yairen stayed with me and we talked. He offered to teach me the drums. He said drums were a woman\u2019s instrument because they were the sound of the land\u2019s heartbeat. Shira, why is Ranon so upset? Is it against Shaladoran customs to teach an outsider?\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled over. Shira shuddered with the effort to maintain some control. \u201cWe weren\u2019t forbidden music or stories or dances as long as they were from Dena Nehele\u2014or Hayll. But anything that came from Shalador, that came from the hearts ofour people was forbidden. Ranon\u2019s grandfather is a Tradition Keeper of Music. He taught people how to play drums and the flute. He wasn\u2019t as skilled with the fiddle and only taught the basics. But he defied the Queens who ruled here and taught the Shalador drum rhythms and the Shalador songs. So they broke his hands as punishment. And when his hands healed the first time, he continued to teach the music of our people. So they broke his hands again. The third time, the Queens\u2019 Healers made sure the fingers healed wrong so that Yairen could no longer play. Ranon was a small boy the last time Yairen\u2019s hands were broken. But, somehow, Yairen still taught Ranon to play the Shalador flute\u2014and taught him the songs of our people.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy stood frozen while Shira dried her eyes and the men shifted uneasily.</p><p>How much trust had gone into what she\u2019d thought was Yairen\u2019s friendly offer? How much fear had ridden alongside that trust?</p><p>\u201cI want all the Tradition Keepers in this village here within the hour,\u201d Cassidy said quietly.</p><p>\u201cCassie . . .\u201d Gray began.</p><p>She raised a hand, cutting him off. Then she looked at her Master of the Guard. \u201cSee that it\u2019s done, Prince Talon.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the Residence. Powell took one look at her face and swallowed whatever greeting or comment he intended to make.</p><p>She went up to her room, blind to whatever changes had been made in her absence. All she could see was the fear on Ranon\u2019s face before he walked away.</p><p>Cassidy stood in the street in front of the Queen\u2019s Residence. The Tradition Keepers stood before her in their shabby best clothes. Filling the streets around them were the people of the village.</p><p>\u201cLord Yairen.\u201d Cassidy used Craft to enhance her voice. She wanted everyone who had come to stand witness to hear her words.</p><p>Yairen stepped forward, standing tall. \u201cHow may I serve the Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have just learned today that your people have been forbidden to play the music that was born of Shalador, that you have been forbidden to perform the traditional dances, or teach the young the stories of your people. Is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true, Lady,\u201d Yairen said. \u201cAll have been forbidden for many generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Tradition Keepers have remembered these forbidden things?\u201d</p><p>Yairen hesitated. How many times had one of the Keepers been cornered into answering a question that would condemn them?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an actual psychic link to Ranon, but his psychic scent was filled with distress. Wouldn\u2019t know it to look at him, standing cold and arrogant with the rest of her First Circle, but the worry that he might have misjudged her was eating his heart out.</p><p>\u201cSome things have been lost,\u201d Yairen finally said, \u201cbut those of us who are the memory of our people have held on to enough.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy nodded. \u201cIn that case, as of this hour, the music of the Shalador people will be taught and will be played openly. The dances of the Shalador people will be taught and performed openly. The stories of the Shalador people will be taught and told openly. The Queens in the Shalador reserves will be given a written decree so they will know these words are true. But it will be up to the Tradition Keepers to return Shalador\u2019s heart to its people. This is my will.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Finally one of the Tradition Keepers raised his hand. \u201cDoes this mean we can perform the circle dances this autumn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>Then Yairen pressed one of his crippled hands to his chest. \u201cOur hearts are too full for words tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy swallowed hard. \u201cThen return to your homes. We will speak more of this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, a clear signal this audience was over.</p><p>Ranon broke away from the rest of the First Circle. Hugging his grandfather, he put his head on the old man\u2019s shoulder and wept.</p><p>A hand linked with hers. Looking to her left, she saw Reyhana trembling with the effort not to cry\u2014and felt the girl\u2019s hand tighten.</p><p>\u201cThe circle dances mean so much to my people,\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cToour people.\u201d She choked, but went on. \u201cSomeone will write a song about how Shalador\u2019s Lady gave the heart back to the people, and all the children will learn it, and someday I will tell my grandchildren I was there and heard the words as they were spoken.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>A familiar touch on her shoulder. She looked at Gray, hoping for some help, but his eyes were too bright, too wet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go inside now,\u201d she said.</p><p>It was Talon who nudged Reyhana aside and gripped Cassidy\u2019s arm to lead her into the house before she ended up weeping too.</p><p>\u201cI told Ranon to spend the night with his grandfather,\u201d Talon said once he got her to the parlor. \u201cHe\u2019ll be better for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything, witchling. Don\u2019t. I knew Jared. I\u2019ve seen the circle dances. I know what the bitches took away from these people\u2014and I know what you just gave back to them. I think it\u2019s best if you Ladies have a quiet evening for yourselves.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek, then said, \u201cGray, let\u2019s see what can be put together for a meal.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy curled up on the sofa, stunned by the emotion that had swirled around her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you got kicked in the head,\u201d Shira said when she and Reyhana came in a minute later.</p><p>\u201cI thought the Tradition Keepers would be happy that they could teach openly again,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThey are happy,\u201d Shira replied. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling too much right now to be just happy.\u201d</p><p>And her First Circle was going to want time to consider the ramifications of what she\u2019d done tonight.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the men would be upset if I went out and gardened for a little while?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s still light out.\u201d The sun had set, but they were still into the longest days of summer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGray will have a fit if you pick up a weeding claw,\u201d Shira said. \u201cAnd so will I.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy huffed. \u201cThere\u2019s too much feeling. I need todo something.\u201d Shira eyed Reyhana, who looked confused about what she was supposed to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you play drums?\u201d Shira asked Reyhana.</p> <p>The girl shook her head. \u201cBut I\u2019m supposed to start learning. Shalador Queens all learn to drum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Tradition Keeper,\u201d Shira said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been drumming since I was a girl. I can start teaching the basics to both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t have drums,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cWe do have a wooden table,\u201d Shira replied, pointing at the table in front of the sofa. \u201cAnd tonight, that\u2019s all we need.\u201d</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p> <p>Saetan signed his name to the message, then waited for the ink to dry before folding the paper and sealing it.</p><p>Daemon had asked to be informed of anything to do with a Dharo witch named Kermilla. Having two of her escorts show up at the Keep, wanting assistance to go through the Gate and return home, certainly qualified as something of interest\u2014especially since heknew those men hadn\u2019t gone through this particular Gate to get to Terreille. Granted, there were thirteen Gates that linked the three Realms, and those men could have used any of them\u2014except this one and the one that was next to the Hall\u2014without causing too much interest in their business. And granted, there weren\u2019t many Priestesses left in Terreille who knew how to open the Gates to let someone move from one Realm to another, so this was the best choice if someone wanted to get back to Kaeleer and not mistakenly end up in Hell.</p><p>But Daemon\u2019s interest in this witch sounded a warning inside Saetan because it carried the feel of a predator analyzing potential prey. And Daemon\u2019s refusal to say why he wanted information sounded a more ominous warning\u2014because there was only one person who could muzzle Daemon Sadi.</p><p>What did Jaenelle know?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t ask\u2014and didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>He folded the paper, melted the black wax, and added a touch of Black power as he pressed the SaDiablo seal into the wax. Black to Black ensured that this would be a private message, since Daemon was the only person who could open it.</p> <p>His task completed, he placed the message in the basket with the rest of the mail that would be collected in the morning and taken to the message station.</p><p>Then he went to his suite and vanished everything from the surface of his desk. He placed a small wooden frame in the center of the desk and called in several spools of spider silk, different weights.</p><p>Since he could not ask Jaenelle or Daemon for answers about Kermilla, he would find his own answers. After all, he, too, was a Black Widow\u2014one of only two males in the history of the Blood who belonged to that caste.</p><p>So during the silent, dark hours, Prince Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, High Priest of the Hourglass, spun his own tangled web of dreams and visions.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Ranon rode up to the Queen\u2019s Residence, dismounted, and gave his horse a pat.</p><p>Most mornings this past week, he\u2019d loaded the horse and gear into the two-horse livestock Coach and headed out to one of the other Shalador reserves to ride through a village or two. He\u2019d listened to the elders and Tradition Keepers, answered questions about things they had heard about the Rose Queen\u2014and assured them that he, Shalador\u2019s only adult Warlord Prince, had heard Cassidy give Shalador\u2019s heart back to the people.</p> <p>Today, he\u2019d been assigned the ride through Eyota. It lifted his heart to see the people he\u2019d grown up with smile and raise a hand in greeting when a member of a Queen\u2019s court rode by. That had never happened before in anyone\u2019s memory. He would never admit it, but every day he gave silent thanks to Theran Grayhaven for being enough of an ass to send Cassidy running so that she ended up here, among the people who needed her the most.</p><p>A quick psychic probe told him the only people in the house were Powell, Talon, and Vae, which meant Cassidy and Gray weren\u2019t back from their planned ride, and Shira wasn\u2019t back from her inspection of the nearby cottages. She wanted a Healer\u2019s House\u2014a place where she could take care of people without intruding on Cassidy\u2019s privacy. There was only one other fully qualified Healer in Eyota, so even though Shira was supposed to be the court\u2019s Healer, she and Cassidy agreed to expand that to the court and their families.</p><p>He flicked an \u201cI\u2019m home\u201d thought along a psychic thread aimed at Shira\u2019s sharp, loving\u2014and sometimes dangerous\u2014mind.</p><p>*Almost done myself,* Shira replied.</p><p>*Find anything?*</p><p>*Maybe.*</p><p>But she sounded more resigned than excited, so he didn\u2019t press her. Besides, the sound of another horse had him turning, his temper instinctively sharpening as Shaddo rode up to the Queen\u2019s Residence.</p><p>It was a Warlord Prince\u2019s nature to rise to the killing edge. Since coming to Eyota, all of them had discovered that their instincts were more keenly honed when they were around their Queen or her home. Even with each other, there was still a bristling moment when temper was poised between predatory instinct and conscious loyalty to the Queen and their Brothers in the court.</p><p>Watching Shaddo, who made no move, Ranon nodded to acknowledge that he had his temper leashed.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asked. Shaddo had spent the day in the western Province where his wife and boys had lived, riding through a couple of villages to see who might want to talk to a member of Cassidy\u2019s First Circle.</p><p>\u201cLots of circling around questions no one was brave enough to ask,\u201d Shaddo replied, dismounting. \u201cBut everyone is interested in the special magic Queens can do to help the harvest. And I ran into a handful of Warlord Princes. I had the feeling they hadn\u2019t met up in that particular village by chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean trouble for us?\u201d</p><p>Shaddo shook his head. \u201cI think . . . Hell\u2019s fire, Ranon, remember when Cassidy first talked about having the Warlord Princes step up and rule on behalf of the Territory Queen because there weren\u2019t many Queens left in Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least not many living in the open or having a visible court,\u201d Ranon said. In the past few days, Powell had received tentative messages from men in a dozen villages, all asking if they could see this special magic. Reading between the lines, there were Queens out there who wanted to learn but weren\u2019t willing to trust their lives and what little structure was left in Dena Nehele to a Queen who was still unknown. But men who served those Queens would come to watch and learn\u2014and report back to their Ladies.</p><p>\u201cBasically, they wanted to know how Cassidy would respond if they divided a Province based on who was available \u2018to rule on behalf of the Queen.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d be relieved to have the Warlord Princes rule whatever the surviving Queens couldn\u2019t handle,\u201d Ranon said. Or didn\u2019t want to handle because it would call attention to themselves.</p><p>\u201cI told them the Steward was trying to figure out how to divide the Provinces into Districts, but he was working blind because he didn\u2019t know how many of the Warlord Princes were willing to step up to the line and help their people.\u201d</p><p>Ranon winced. \u201cThose words must have stung.\u201d</p><p>Shaddo shook his head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, and that surprised me too since I\u2019d meant them to sting. But word is spreading about what Cassidy did for the Shaladorans\u2014and about her going into landen villages as well as Blood to do that special magic. Every man who had fought in the uprisings wanted to know how we could let her do something that dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you told them we don\u2019tlet her do anything,\u201d Ranon grumbled.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t much of a grumble. Cassie might chafe at the boundaries the First Circle set for her protection, but the men were smart enough to keep expanding those boundaries as they settled down to a life here in Eyota. Besides, according to the Protocol Powell was studying every night, even the First Circle\u2019s right to protect the Queen had some limits.</p><p>\u201cPapa! Papa!\u201d</p><p>Ranon felt Shaddo\u2019s fierce joy as his two boys came running toward them, but he also saw the stern face and the hand quickly raised to stop them.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about running toward horses?\u201d Shaddo said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d Eliot, the younger one, scuffed one shoe on the street.</p><p>\u201cCan we walk the horses to the stables?\u201d Eryk asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Saying nothing, Ranon handed his reins to Shaddo.</p><p>\u201cYou can walk them,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll all take care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Hearing an odd whistle on the \u201cs,\u201d Ranon studied Eliot. \u201cSomeone lost a tooth.\u201d</p><p>Eliot grinned, showing off the gap. \u201cMother is making a special tooth treat.\u201d</p><p>Eryk muttered something and looked sulky.</p><p>Eliot scowled. \u201cShe made special treats foryou when you lost a tooth.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t knock one out to get a treat,\u201d Eryk said, just loud enough to assure the men heard him.</p><p>\u201cI didnot knock it out,\u201d Eliot said.</p><p>\u201cDid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201dShaddo said.</p><p>They obeyed the tone instantly.</p><p>*I\u2019m impressed,* Ranon said, trying not to grin.</p><p>*Yeah, well, having me around all the time is still new to them,* Shaddo replied. *I figure the pissing contests will start soon enough.*</p><p>He watched Shaddo and the boys until they went into the stables. Then he smiled.</p><p>Tomorrow was a rest day, thank the Darkness. No work, no traveling, nothing but his woman and a sweet summer day. Maybe Cassidy and Gray would be interested in riding over to Mariel\u2019s Pond to swim and have a picnic. Or maybe he and Shira would go alone so they could have long talks and sweet kisses before coming back to their room for a different kind of talking and kisses that were hot instead of sweet.</p><p>With those thoughts in mind, he turned to go into the Residence to get a glass of ale and see if there was anything in the larder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Ranon, I\u2019m at the northern landing web. We\u2019ve got company, and they\u2019re heading for the Queen\u2019s Residence.*</p><p>Ranon tensed in response to the sharp edge in Archerr\u2019s voice. *How many?*</p><p>An odd hesitation. *Depends on who you\u2019re counting.*</p> <p>What?*Shaddo, someone\u2019s coming. Keep your boys out of sight.* As soon as Shaddo acknowledged the order, Ranon sent a command to Gray. *Keep Cassidy away from the Residence until you hear from me.*</p><p>He stepped out into the middle of the street, made a quick descent to the level of his Opal Jewel, and waited a heartbeat away from the killing edge for their \u201cguests\u201d to come into sight.</p><p>Then Vae raced out of the Residence, her joy sending out an almost staggering punch.</p><p>*They\u2019re here!* Vae shouted along a common psychic thread that could be heard by anyone within range\u2014which was probably half the village. She raced down the street toward the northern landing web. *They\u2019re here!*</p><p>Who\u2019s here?Ranon wondered.</p> <p>The answer to that question turned a corner and came down the street a few minutes later. One man, wearing a vest and jacket over a shirt\u2014too many clothes for the season and the weather. A Sceltie trotted beside him on his right. A few paces ahead of him, Vae bounced and danced with so much excitement it made Ranon tired just to watch her. And behind the man . . .</p><p>Twelve of them, spread out in a V that covered the whole street\u2014and gave every one of them a clear line of sight. Scelties. If men had been coming toward him in a fighting V, he\u2019d know what to do. Faced with dogs, he wasn\u2019t sure how to respond\u2014but a sudden memory of Vae pulling down a full-grown man in a fight had him creating a skintight shield around himself. Just in case.</p><p>Three of the Scelties spotted him and broke their position, dashing toward him. A barked order\u2014literally\u2014from the Sceltie trotting beside the man had them wheeling round, tails down in response to the reprimand, and returning to their position.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon to you,\u201d the man called.</p><p>Curly brown hair, handsome face, lean body. Not much of a fighter, since he was approaching a stranger with his hands in his trouser pockets as if he were taking a simple stroll in his home village. But the stew of power Ranon was sensing from that group couldn\u2019t be dismissed, and there was something in the man\u2019s blue eyes that said this Warlord knew how to stop trouble\u2014and how to make trouble.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Ranon replied.</p> <p>*They\u2019re here!* Vae bounced and danced, but the men ignored her.</p><p>\u201cWould you be Gray?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ranon, First Circle in Lady Cassidy\u2019s court and the Master\u2019s second-in-command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, since you were the second man I was asked to see, I think you\u2019ll do as well for both.\u201d</p><p>Both what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Khardeen, Warlord of Maghre. And this is Lord Ladvarian.\u201d Khardeen held out a hand.</p><p>Ranon clasped the hand\u2014and felt a quiver of fear when he saw the Sapphire ring on Khardeen\u2019s right hand. This man could rip through his Opal shields and tear him apart with a single thought.</p><p>Then he glanced down and got another shock. The dog staring up at him wore a gold chain around its neck. A Red Jewel shone against the white ruff.</p> <p>The human wasn\u2019t the most dangerous Warlord to walk into their village.</p><p>Ladvarian looked at Vae.</p><p>*Ranon? Ladvarian wants to see the yard.*</p><p>\u201cUh . . . sure.\u201d Since she\u2019d been bouncing a minute before, he was uneasy about Vae sounding so subdued\u2014and cautious.</p><p>Khardeen took a step to the side as Vae came around to position herself on Ladvarian\u2019s left\u2014the subordinate position. That done, fourteen Scelties trotted off and disappeared behind the Queen\u2019s Residence.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to dig, are they?\u201d Ranon asked. \u201cGray will have a fit if they start digging in the gardens he\u2019s been restoring back there. So will Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Khardeen replied. \u201cLadvarian was First Circle in the Dark Court. He knows about not digging in a Queen\u2019s garden. Of course, some of the youngsters will need to have it explained to them more than once, but they\u2019ll understand it sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Khardeen\u2019s blue eyes twinkled. Ranon\u2019s stomach sank in response.</p><p>\u201cI gather Vae didn\u2019t tell you about this?\u201d Khardeen asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, having been here long enough to assess the situation, Vae didn\u2019t think she could take care of all the humans who needed a Sceltie\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cShe talked to Ladvarian about helping her find other Scelties to take care of the other humans while she took care of the court. Then those two talked to Morghann and Jaenelle, and there you are\u2014twelve youngsters who wanted the challenge of taking care of humans who have no kindred of their own.\u201d</p><p>No. Oooh, no. \u201cWho\u2019s Morghann?\u201d He\u2019d heard the name before, somewhere, but it was the only question Ranon could think to ask. The only safe question, anyway.</p><p>\u201cMorghann is the Queen of Scelt.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Now he remembered. Cassie had mentioned Morghann when she was explaining court living arrangements in Kaeleer. And she\u2019d mentioned Morghann\u2019s husband, Khardeen.</p><p>The Queen of Scelt and the former Queen of Ebon Askavi had hand-picked these dogs to live here? How was he going to convince Khardeen to take them back? No matter what Vae thought,she was all thehumans could handle.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they supposed to do?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll figure that out,\u201d Khardeen said with a breeziness that was a bit terrifying. \u201cThey\u2019re good at herding, and they\u2019ll herd anything\u2014sheep, ducks, goats, cows, children . . . stubborn males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you take them back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d Khardeen said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be the one who will have to explain it to the Ladies, and any man who knows either of those Queens isn\u2019t going to get within a mile of you while you do it.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>A wave of fur came around the Residence and spread out, tails wagging while they busily sniffed their surroundings.</p><p>Then one of the Scelties raced up to him and began dancing on its hind legs.</p><p>*My human! This is my human!*</p><p>It was the homeliest little dog Ranon had ever seen. He\u2014because Ranon had picked up the caste of Warlord\u2014had the Sceltie face and the Sceltie body, but the fur looked like it had been taken from the leftovers of a dozen different dogs and patched together any which way. There was white, tan, brown, black, and three shades of gray. Hodgepodge dog.</p><p>*I will take good care of him. I am going to live with him!*</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d The words were honest and out before Ranon thought about it.</p><p>The dog stared at him for a moment, those brown eyes full of heart-breaking woe. Then the whimpering started, turning to whines and keening and . . .</p><p>*My human doesn\u2019t want me!*</p><p>Ranon glanced at Khardeen. There was still some amusement and sympathy in those blue eyes, but underneath was the bite of anger.</p><p>*Can\u2019t you do something*? Ranon asked Khardeen.</p><p>*I\u2019m not the one who hurt his feelings.*</p><p>That anger made him uneasy, although Khardeen made no overt threat. Then he discovered he had a lot more reasons to worry.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen them, hadn\u2019t sensed them coming toward him. One moment he had one whining Sceltie sitting in front of him; the next he was surrounded\u2014and the thirteen pairs of brown eyes staring at him held more than a bite of anger.</p><p>*Of course he wants you,* Vae said. *But he is male and human, and sometimes he gets confused. Don\u2019t you?*</p><p>Ranon glanced at Khardeen.</p><p>*There is only one correct answer,* Khardeen said. *So take the kick in the balls, apologize to your little brother, and assure him that he can live with you.*</p><p>*Is there any other choice?*</p><p>*Not if you want to stay healthy. Darkmist is a year older than his little brother and isn\u2019t someone you want to tangle with,* Khardeen said.</p><p>Darkmist? Ranon scanned the Sceltie faces. The dogs were a variety of colors, but there were three that might fit the name\u2014if the name was meant to fit. Two were a silver-gray and white, and the third . . .</p><p>Pewter and white with black speckles on the face. And an Opal Jewel.</p><p>Warlord Prince.Ranon stared at the dog who matched him, caste and rank. Then he swallowed hard and went down on one knee, aware he was putting his throat a lot closer to all those sets of teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked, tentatively extending a hand to the homely little dog.</p><p>Woeful brown eyes looked at him, but the tip of the tail gave a hopeful little wag. *Khollie.*</p><p>\u201cWell, Khollie, Vae is right. I am confused. I\u2019ve never seen so many Scelties, and I guess I didn\u2019t realize . . .\u201d What? Then inspiration struck, and with a silent apology to his beloved, he added, \u201cYou can help me take care of my mate.\u201d</p><p>More tail wagging. Woeful began to lighten to happy as Khollie slipped his head under Ranon\u2019s hand for a pat.</p><p>*You have a mate? I will help you!*</p><p>Suddenly his arms were full of chin-licking, tail-wagging dog\u2014and he really hoped Shira was going to forgive him for siccing a Sceltie on her.</p><p>\u201cVae, why don\u2019t you show Ladvarian and Khollie where Khollie will be staying,\u201d Khardeen said. The mild tone didn\u2019t make the words any less of a command.</p><p>Crisis over, the Scelties scattered to continue their sniffing exploration of the cottages and vegetation near the Queen\u2019s Residence, leaving the two humans alone.</p><p>Khardeen said nothing, giving Ranon time to regain some balance and think.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Khardeen finally said. \u201cA month from now, you won\u2019t remember what it was like to live in a village without Scelties.\u201d</p><p>What a terrifying thought. But it was remembering the look in Darkmist\u2019s eyes and thefeel of the dog that had Ranon watching the way they moved, spreading out from the Residence. Too orderly. More like a troop of warriors spreading out to get the most information about a place in the least amount of time. Which made him wonder about the twelve dogs that were going to be living among his people\u2014and made him remember a comment that almost passed by his notice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said Ladvarian was First Circle in the Dark Court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Khardeen replied. \u201cHe was one of Lady Angelline\u2019s escorts.\u201d</p><p>Ranon looked Khardeen in the eyes. \u201cHe was trained to fight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy Lucivar Yaslana, the Demon Prince, and the High Lord, among others,\u201d Khardeen said softly. \u201cIn turn, Ladvarian trained each of the youngsters who have come here. Don\u2019t underestimate Darkmist, Ranon. A Warlord Prince is a Warlord Prince, whether he stands on two legs or four, and Mist has received the best education when it comes to knowing what to do in a fight.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re all going to live . . . ?\u201d Ranon looked at the Queen\u2019s Residence.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll work that out. I suspect most of them will come back here for the first few days. Then they\u2019ll find their own place in the village\u2014as well as their special humans.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness.</p> <p>He was not a coward. He knew that about himself. But the thought of living in the same house with more than two Scelties made his knees weak.</p><p>\u201cAbout Khollie,\u201d Khardeen said. \u201cDo you have any brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. Younger by ten years.\u201d Could he extend Khollie\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d to Janos as well?</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what it\u2019s like to talk to a four-year-old boy?\u201d</p><p>Ranon nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen you should have no trouble.\u201d Khardeen gave him a sharp smile. \u201cJust think of Khollie as a bright four-year-old boy, and you\u2019re the older brother who needs to explain things to him so that his behavior doesn\u2019t cause trouble for him or the people around him.\u201d</p> <p>Great. Just what he needed when there was already so much to do\u2014a furry baby brother.</p><p>Khardeen called in a large metal trunk that immediately began to sweat in the heat, along with a large metal canister. \u201cHere\u2019s a cold box of meat for them. And that\u2019s the oatmeal that is made into a gruel as part of their feed a couple of times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVae doesn\u2019t eat that,\u201d Ranon said. Although, now that he thought about it, some mornings the porridge bowls left on the table looked a little too clean. Like someone had licked them clean.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Khardeen said, looking toward the house. \u201cIt\u2019s time we were heading back. I\u2019m expected for dinner at the Keep.\u201d</p><p>Ladvarian, Vae, and Khollie came trotting out of the Residence\u2014using Craft to pass through the door, Ranon noted. Which meant he wouldn\u2019t need to get up in the middle of the night if the dog wanted to pee.</p><p>Ladvarian gave the two youngsters a lick on their muzzles. Khardeen tipped his head, said good-bye, and the two Warlords headed back up the street to the landing web.</p><p>Then Khardeen stopped and turned to face Ranon.</p><p>*There was that second thing to tell you,* he said. *Lady Cassidy\u2019s report will go to the Keep three days from now?*</p> <p>*Yes.*</p><p>*You\u2019re to be the messenger.*</p><p>*Why?*</p><p>*Because the Queen wants to see you.*</p><p>No doubt aboutwhich Queen was commanding his presence. No doubt at all. And no question that he would obey that command.</p><p>*I\u2019ll be there.*And may the Darkness have mercy on me.</p><p>He watched them until they were out of sight. Then he felt a flash of frustration and temper. He looked to his right and saw one of the Scelties\u2014a witch by what he could sense\u2014staring at empty air, gently wagging her tail.</p><p>A moment later, Archerr dropped the sight shield that should have kept him hidden and strode over to Ranon, quickly followed by Shaddo, who was trailed by his two boys.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Archerr said as the witch trotted away and a Warlord headed toward them. \u201cWhat good is a sight shield if a dog is going to smell you and let everyone know you\u2019re there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Ranon said. But damn useful if an enemy was trying to sight shield to get close enough to attack. With two Scelties living at the Residence, they were less likely to have any unwelcome company showing up to bother Cassidy.</p><p>*Boy puppies!* The black-and-white Warlord with a splash of white on his muzzle and tan markings on his face raced toward Shaddo\u2019s boys.</p><p>Shaddo swore mildly but didn\u2019t interfere with the meeting. Then he swore with more heat when his wife Soli stepped out of their cottage.</p><p>\u201cShaddo? What\u2019s going on? Is it all right for the boys to be out?\u201d</p><p>The Sceltie turned toward the sound of her voice and froze. Dog and woman stared at each other.</p><p>Soli smiled. \u201cAren\u2019t you the sweetest boy?\u201d</p><p>The human boys were abandoned in a heartbeat. The Sceltie launched himself into the air and ended up sitting in front of Soli, with one paw raised to shake\u2014floating on air waist high.</p><p>\u201cHello, there,\u201d Soli said, holding the paw while she petted and cooed. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Where did you come from?\u201d She frowned a little. \u201cYou\u2019re Darcy from the Isle of Scelt?\u201d She looked up at Shaddo, her eyes full of wonder. \u201cHe talks?\u201d</p><p>*I talk,* Darcy said proudly. *But only to my special humans.*</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Shaddo,\u201d Archerr said, choking back a laugh. \u201cThat sure looks like love at first sight to me. I think you just adopted a furry boy-child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho isnot going to be sleeping in our bed,\u201d Shaddo growled. But there was resigned humor in his eyes as he watched Soli introduce the dog to the boys. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep her company, so yeah, looks like I\u2019ve got another boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is already trained to fight,\u201d Ranon said quietly.</p><p>The humor drained out of the other two men.</p><p>He nodded in response to the unspoken question. \u201cIt\u2019s one step removed, but some of that training is courtesy of Lucivar Yaslana\u2014and one of the Scelties is an Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Archerr said softly.</p><p>\u201cOnce Talon rises, we all need to talk about this. For now, you two pass along the all clear, especially to Gray so he knows it\u2019s safe for Cassidy to come back to the Residence. I\u2019ll try to explain this to the village elders.\u201d</p><p>Shaddo said, \u201cWho would send us a pack of warriors?\u201d</p><p>Ranon felt a knot of tension ease as he answered the question. \u201cThe same person who understood why we needed Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Gray led the newest member of the household out to the corner of the yard that sheltered the pots containing the twelve honey pear seedlings. Going down on one knee, he waited for the Sceltie to join him.</p><p>Compared to Vae, who had more self-assurance than a dozen people combined, Khollie seemed so . . . breakable. Or maybe the dog was still feeling bruised by Ranon\u2019s initial rejection and was afraid of being sent away.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Khollie,\u201d Gray said gently.</p><p>Woeful eyes. Hopeful tail-tip wag.</p><p>\u201cSee these?\u201d Gray pointed to the pots. \u201cThese are honey pears. They are very special trees. You do not pee on them.\u201d</p><p>*I did not pee on the little trees. Only the big trees.*</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t pee on them\u201d\u2014yet\u2014\u201cbut I want you to understand that wenever pee on these trees.\u201d</p><p>*Humans too?*</p><p>\u201cYes, humans too. These trees are very, very special, and we all have to protect them.\u201d</p><p>The head came up, the ears came up, and the tail began wagging in earnest. *I will help you protect the little trees when I am not helping Ranon protect Shira.*</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s protecting what?\u201d Ranon asked, carrying a mug of coffee in each hand.</p><p>*Ranon!* The shout went out on a common psychic thread. *Do not pee on the little trees or Gray will bite you.*</p><p>Oh, the look on Ranon\u2019s face.</p><p>Gray bit his lip to keep from laughing until Khollie trotted off to check the boundaries of his and Vae\u2019s personal territory, which was the land that belonged to the Residence.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there is anyone in the surrounding cottages who didn\u2019t hear that?\u201d Ranon asked in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gray\u2019s voice broke with the effort not to laugh. \u201cI thinkeveryone on this street and the next two over knows not to pee on the little trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Ranon handed him one of the mugs.</p><p>\u201cHe bruises easily,\u201d Gray said quietly. \u201cHis feelings, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that out, Gray. Not soon enough, but I did figure that out. It just takes a lot longer to fix the damage than to do the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they made a mistake with him? Maybe he\u2019s too young to be away from people who understand Scelties.\u201d</p><p>Ranon shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now. He\u2019s here. Would you want to be sent home from your first assignment?\u201d</p><p>Gray looked away, feeling his own heart ache a little.</p><p>Ranon swore. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had a first assignment\u2014or any assignment. My training stopped when I was fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to resume that training?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Gray nodded. He\u2019d spent a lot of time thinking while he\u2019d worked in the gardens here. \u201cI want to be able to protect and defend. That\u2019s what I was meant to do. I grew up being told I was Theran\u2019s blade, and I was educated to protect the Grayhaven line\u2014until I was captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were Theran\u2019s blade, and now you want to be Cassie\u2019s blade. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>They sipped their coffee and watched Khollie and Vae flush a rabbit out of the kitchen garden and herd it right into Darcy\u2019s jaws.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Ranon asked as the three Scelties snarled at one another for a minute before Darcy and Vae each grabbed a rabbit leg and the three dogs trotted away with their kill. \u201cKhollie and Vae want the rabbit for us, and Darcy wants the rabbit for Soli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take it to Cassidy, who will figure out a way for both households to have some of the meat so all three Scelties will be happy,\u201d Gray replied.</p><p>\u201cThe duties of a Queen.\u201d Ranon drained his mug. Then he sighed. \u201cI came out here to ask a favor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s something I wanted to ask you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Mine. Shira is supposed to take a last look at the cottages she was interested in. Something about this is making her unhappy, but she won\u2019t talk to me or Cassidy about it. I was hoping, if you attached yourself as her escort, she might talk to you. I\u2019d go with her and try again to find out what\u2019s wrong, but I have to go to the Keep today. I\u2019m just waiting for Cassidy to finish a letter to her mother before I head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep Shira company,\u201d Gray said.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to learn the Fire Dance.\u201d He saw Ranon\u2019s initial surprise change to thoughtful assessment.</p><p>\u201cHave you and Cassidy . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Yaslana\u2019s rules about you having sex?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head again. \u201cWhen Cassie looks at me, she doesn\u2019t see a man. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. We kiss and we touch, and it\u2019s good. Mother Night, it\u2019s good. But there is something in me that is holding her back from letting me be her lover all the way. So I thought the Fire Dance . . .\u201d</p><p>Ranon\u2019s hand felt warm on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cAnd this autumn, when that full moon rises, you\u2019ll dance with your Brothers.\u201d</p><p>They walked back to the house, left the mugs in the kitchen, and went their separate ways.</p><p>As Gray went to find Shira, it occurred to him that Ranon wouldn\u2019t have asked a man he thought was deficient in any way to stand escort to the woman who held his heart.</p><p>Kermilla looked through her mail again and sighed.</p> <p>There were the usual reports from her Steward, saying the same things he said every time about the length of her visit to Dena Nehele\u2014but hinting more strongly this time that it would be in all of their best interests if she returned to Bhak and took care of the villages she ruled. As if she were another Freckledy who reallywanted to rule a sheep-shit village. Why did she need to be there? The men in her First Circle had been working that village for the five years they\u2019d served Cassidy. They knew how to keep the landens in Woolskin leashed and how to discourage any complaints the Blood in Bhak might have about how the village was being ruled. If the person couldn\u2019t be discouraged from complaining, her males should make certain the complaint went no further than her own Steward. After all, their reputations and ambitions were as much at stake as hers, and were, in fact, dependent on hers.</p><p>But this time, along with all the dull reports, there were letters from a couple of aristo friends. Those letters talked about parties and picnics, moonlight rides and concerts\u2014and hinted about a daring new gown being designed for the autumn season.</p><p>What couldshe write about? She was stuck in a town that thought outdoor concerts and having a dozen people for dinner at an aristo\u2019s house was outrageous and daring. And the clothes! Hell\u2019s fire, she was from Dharo,the Territory for weaving and fabric of the finest quality. Even the meanest cloth that was only fit for landens in Dharo was better than the best she could find in this dung-gray town.</p><p>And Theran was alwaysbusy . Doing what? Who could tell! Nothing interesting. Maybe she should summon Jhorma. Playing with her Consort would fill an hour or so. But they would need to be discreet. She\u2019d invited Theran to her bed two nights ago, and now he seemed to think that gave him an exclusive claim. Maybe if he was bedding a merchant\u2019s daughter who wanted to climb the social ladder, but it would take a more lucrative offer than having him as a lover before she would consider giving him anything exclusive. Besides, enthusiasm couldn\u2019t replace skill, and a lover who brought his heart to the bed didn\u2019t provide the same pleasure as a man who had been trained to please a woman\u2019s body.</p><p>Despite the impression he gave of being in charge, Theran really didn\u2019t have much understanding about how courts worked, and the privileges that were hers simply because she was a Queen. But he really did care about her even if he was rather dull most of the time, and she did want to help him rule this land and make it wonderful again. For a few years, anyway.</p><p>But that was the exciting future when she would be the Queen of Dena Nehele, and this was the boring, boring,boring now.</p><p>A sigh made her look up at the only other person in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou really study this all the time?\u201d Correne asked, closing the book of Protocol she\u2019d been staring at for the past hour.</p> <p>Kermilla nodded. \u201cFrom the first year of schooling to the last. And anyone who actually serves in a court studies even more because court Protocol is more demanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when I set up my court, I\u2019m going to forbid anyone from using all these tedious, stiff phrases.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla sat up, alarmed. \u201cOh, no, Correne. Youmust use Protocol, andeveryone in your court needs to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Correne asked, pouting. \u201cIt\u2019s sodull. \u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you know how to use them correctly, some of those phrases can stop a Warlord Prince from killing someone, or command him to step back from the killing edge before he attacks. Males arecontrolled by Protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the things males can demand from females because of Protocol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. A smart woman can figure out how to get aroundthose. \u201d Kermilla smiled at the younger Queen. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go into the town and do some shopping.\u201d</p><p>Correne looked more unhappy. \u201cCan\u2019t. I spent all the marks I was given, and my father won\u2019t send more until next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her smile turned sly. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to purchase a few things without having to pay a single copper for any of it.\u201d</p><p>Gray studied the two-story house and the neighboring one-story building, and said, \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d He glanced at Shira, who seemed painfully unhappy as she looked at the place that would be a wonderful residence for a Healer. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look around.\u201d</p><p>She followed him with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, but he led her around to the back. The small barn was big enough for a couple of horses, and its paddock bordered the pasture for the court\u2019s stables. The backyard had plenty of land for a kitchen garden, a Healer\u2019s garden, and the private garden a Black Widow would find useful, and still had enough space for children or dogs to romp. Best of all, this property backed the land belonging to the Queen\u2019s Residence, with only a low stone wall separating the two. And this place, unlike the others he had seen with Shira today, was inside what Ranon and Talon called the \u201cQueen\u2019s square\u201d\u2014the perimeter of streets and houses that would be the most heavily shielded and defended if the village was attacked.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this,\u201d Shira said. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Residence.\u201d</p><p>Gray studied her, bewildered by the pain he saw in her dark eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s perfect,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nothing I can have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She turned on him, her hands clenched. He should have feared her. After all, she was a Black Widow, which meant she had that snake tooth under her right ring fingernail. His Jewels outranked hers\u2014Purple Dusk against Summer-sky\u2014so her venom wouldn\u2019t necessarily kill him, but it might cripple him even if he survived.</p><p>\u201cI have no money, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d He called in the paper the village elders had given to Powell. It was a list of land and buildings all around Eyota that the court could have for the asking\u2014property that had no surviving family left to claim it. \u201cThis place is on the list. You don\u2019t need money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about furniture? What about a worktable and storage cupboards for tonics and brews and dried herbs? What about tools? What about blankets and linens and healing supplies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen\u2019s gift . . .\u201d</p><p>Shira shook her head fiercely. \u201cNo. I can justify what I have in the room at the Residence as a court expense, but I can\u2019t expect the court to supply a place like this. And Cassidy shouldn\u2019t pay for something beyond the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like this place.\u201d He had an idea, but he needed to be sure of her first.</p><p>\u201cYes, I like this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He looked around, then checked the list again. \u201cI want to take a look at those two cottages. They\u2019re on the list too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Shira sighed. \u201cMy apologies, Gray. I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself, and I have no right to feel that way. The Shalador people have more now than we had dreamed possible a year ago, and I\u2019m the court Healer to a Queen I like and admire. No Healer could ask for a better way to serve her people than to care for such a Queen.\u201d She gave him a wobbly smile. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home, so why don\u2019t I take the horse and pony cart back to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray said again. \u201cI\u2019m standing as your escort today. If you want to go back now, we\u2019ll go back. But you\u2019re not going alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see the Residence from where I\u2019m standing,\u201d Shira said when she finally found her voice. \u201cI can see the stables\u2019 pastures from where I\u2019m standing. Hell\u2019s fire, Vae and Archerr and Cassidy are standing in the yard right now watching us.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar had said, \u201cStrong women can get bitchy about Protocol when they think you\u2019re being bossy or overprotective or whatever damn thing they think you\u2019re being. Sometimes it\u2019s smart to give in, but if you know you\u2019re right, set your heels down, boyo, and be a polite, courteous wall.\u201d</p><p>He had the feeling Lucivar was still working on the polite and courteous part, but the man sure did know how to set his heels down.</p><p>\u201cI could climb over the back wall and be home,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll assist you over the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you need help to do what should be done,\u201d Lucivar had said, \u201cask for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Vae?* Gray called. *I need you.*</p><p>Shira began sputtering at him that she didn\u2019t need help and didn\u2019t notice Vae heading toward them until the Sceltie jumped the wall.</p><p>*Shira? Shira! Why are you acting like a hissy cat?*</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d Shira sputtered, glaring at him.\u201cYou . . .\u201d</p><p>Whatever she was going to call him got lost in Khollie\u2019s joyous *Shira!* as he got over the wall and joined them.</p><p>\u201cShira wants to go home now, and I have something else I need to do, so would the two of you escort her home?\u201d</p><p>*We will take care of Shira,* Khollie said, his tail wagging as he looked up at Ranon\u2019s mate.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Shira stomped off with two furry escorts who were more implacable than any Warlord Prince would dare to be.</p> <p>At least she\u2019s not unhappy anymore,Gray thought. But he figured it would be prudent to stay out of her way until Ranon got home.</p><p>*Gray?* Archerr asked. *Is everything all right?*</p><p>*Shira is a hissy cat,* he replied.</p><p>Archerr\u2019s snorted laugh had Shira stopping midstride to turn and stare at Gray.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>His smile must have been sufficiently insolent because he couldsee her temper flare.</p> <p>He felt a bit weak-kneed as he gave her a two-finger salute, then turned his back on her and walked to the front of the house.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t smart to piss off a Black Widow. On the other hand, she probably would be too angry to wonder about the \u201csomething\u201d he needed to do.</p><p>He untied the horse and started walking down Wolf Creek Road to take a look at the two cottages that were also within the \u201cQueen\u2019s square\u201d and also available for the court\u2019s use. He hadn\u2019t reached the first cottage before the silver twins came running down the road, no doubt alerted by Vae.</p><p>*Are you going home now, Gray?* Kief asked, wagging his tail.</p><p>*We will take the horse back to the stable,* Lloyd said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, boys, but I still need the horse.\u201d</p><p>They stared at him, tails gently wagging.</p><p>Trying not to sigh, he held out the lead. \u201cHold him while I take a look at these buildings.\u201d</p> <p>*I will watch the horse,* Lloyd said.</p><p>*I will go with Gray,* Kief said.</p><p>Now he did sigh, but he didn\u2019t argue. No point in arguing. It didn\u2019t take the humans long to figure that out. The Scelties seemed to know when they had to obey without question\u2014and they knew when humans were acting like stubborn sheep and needed to be herded in the right direction.</p><p>The smart human yielded before getting nipped.</p><p>Not all of the Scelties had found their special place in the village, but some were settling in. The Warlord brothers Lloyd and Kief had taken up residence at the stables where the court kept their horses. The First Circle had dubbed them the silver twins because they were gray and white. Not really twins, but they were litter mates, and the only difference in their looks was that Lloyd had a wider blaze down his face. The men were still looking after their own mounts, but they felt easier about leaving the stable unattended now. After all, dogs who were smart enough to bring carrots out to the pasture to make friends with the horses were also smart enough to know when to fetch a human.</p><p>Prince Darkmist divided his time between Yairen and Akeelah, a witch who was a Tradition Keeper of Stories. It sure pissed off Ranon the first time he walked into his grandfather\u2019s house and was challenged by another Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince. So Ranon and Mist were working out a few territorial issues. The fact that Ranon was Khollie\u2019s human and Khollie was Mist\u2019s little brother made things more . . . interesting.</p><p>As entertaining as that was\u2014when you weren\u2019t the human involved\u2014right now, he needed to take a good look at these cottages and see if his idea would work.</p><p>When he finished inspecting the second cottage, he stood out front, shaking his head and smiling. Lloyd had brought the horse and cart.</p><p>\u201cThanks, boys,\u201d he said as he climbed into the cart. They stood aside and waited until he\u2019d given the horse the signal to walk on. Then they raced back to the stables, and he headed for a meeting with the village elders.</p><p>Kermilla slipped up to her room. She and Correne hadn\u2019t gotten around to shopping, but they\u2019d still had a delightful afternoon once they\u2019d met Garth and Brok, two Warlord brothers who weren\u2019t much older than Kermilla. They had gone to a dining house and talked and laughed for hours, while her two escorts sat at another table looking bored. Having older, experienced men serving in the court meant she didn\u2019t have to work as hard to rule her territory, but it was so much more work to hold their interest when she had to deal with them day after day. These young men hung on to every word she said\u2014and they werehers. She\u2019d felt that strange pull when she saw them\u2014the same pull she\u2019d felt when she first met Theran.</p><p>After making plans to meet up tomorrow to shop, she and Correne had returned to the mansion and the dull company waiting for her there. But she\u2019d had so much fun with her new boys, she really would pay attention this evening when Theran droned on about what Dena Nehele needed.He officially ruled the town, but he seemed to think she should be doing as much as if she were already the Queen\u2014without the compensation! Well, he did tell her she could put things on account against the tithes, but some of the merchants were getting that tight look in their eyes that meant these people didn\u2019t know how to show their loyalty to a Queen any more than the people in sheep-shit Bhak did. Which was fine for Freckledy\u2014she had never had any style\u2014but not for a Queen who wanted to be recognized in aristo social circles.</p><p>Kermilla opened her door and froze.</p><p>That dumb bitch Birdie, the \u201cQueen\u2019s maid,\u201d was holding a bottle of scent Kermilla had acquired during her last shopping trip. Holding the bottle\u2014and frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell are you doing?\u201d Kermilla demanded. She strode over to the dresser and yanked the bottle out of Birdie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCleaning the room, Lady, like I always do,\u201d Birdie stammered, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cI told you before I don\u2019t like my things smeared with someone else\u2019s psychic stink,\u201d Kermilla said, her voice cold and hard. \u201cYou use Craft to raise everything on the dresser and tables when you dust them.Craft, you useless bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I only wear the White, Lady,\u201d Birdie said. \u201cI only use Craft to help with heavy lifting and the like, so I\u2019m not drained when my work is done. Lady Cassidy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Cassidy, and as long as you work in this house, you\u2019ll do things the wayI want them done. And if you can\u2019t getthat through your head, the only way you\u2019ll earn a living is by using what you\u2019ve got between your legs! Is that clear enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>One word. Kermilla heard it as a challenge\u2014and no White-Jeweledservant could be allowed to challenge the Queen.</p><p>You\u2019re still a guest here.</p><p>Remembering that had her putting temper and not power behind the open-handed slap. The blow still knocked Birdie to the floor.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my room,\u201d Kermilla said.</p><p>Whimpering, Birdie got to her feet and stumbled from the room. Shaken, Kermilla looked at the bottle of scent. The girl probably didn\u2019t know what that small, paper-thin stone disk on the bottom of the bottle meant, but Kermilla was certain Theran would be furious if he discovered how she was stretching her income.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Theran angry with her. For a little while she\u2019d flirted with the possibility of falling in love with him, but those feelings had faded before they began. Still, shedid like the man, and she didn\u2019t want him so upset that he would tell her to leave. After all, she needed his support to become Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>The Keep. The Black Mountain. A place where a man was surrounded by stone and dark power.</p><p>But a strangely comfortable place, for all that. A place where a man could lower his guard and truly rest, knowing there was something else here that was watchful\u2014and aware.</p><p>Ranon prowled around the sitting room where the Seneschal, that strange-looking female, had put him to wait. A human shape, but she wasn\u2019t human\u2014not with that face or the sibilant way she spoke. He\u2019d bet his life on it.</p><p>The door opened, and he turned.</p><p>The woman\u2019s exotic face, framed by golden hair, was a little too thin, but still beautiful in a way that tugged at his male interest\u2014especially because she seemed unaware of the streak of dirt that accented one sharp cheekbone.</p><p>Then he looked into those sapphire eyes and felt his heart skip a beat. He was totally committed to serving Cassidy, and he loved Shira with everything that was in him. But if this woman asked it of him, he would crawl through fire or over knives\u2014and never ask why she required it of him.</p><p>He needed no introduction to know he was looking at Jaenelle Angelline, the Queen who was Witch, the living myth.</p><p>Now he understood what kind of woman could hold the hearts of men like Lucivar Yaslana and Daemon Sadi.</p><p>I belong to her in the same way I belong to Cassidy.And if Jaenelle demanded it of him, he would turn away from everything else he held dear in order to serve her.</p><p>\u201cLady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Ranon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d been nervous about meeting her, but he hadn\u2019t expected to respond to her likethis . As he continued to look into those sapphire eyes, he realized she felt that bond too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m theformer Queen of Ebon Askavi, Prince Ranon.\u201d Her voice held both amusement and warning.</p><p>Former?A word said for the Queen\u2019s pleasure\u2014and believed by no one except, perhaps, the Queen herself. But he understood that she neither wanted nor expected him to turn away from Cassidy and the loyalty he felt for Shalador\u2019s Lady.</p><p>\u201cI brought the reports and letters.\u201d He called in the message sack and set it on a nearby chair. \u201cReports are probably a bit lean. Cassidy has been working hard. But not too hard. We\u2019ve insisted she take rest days, but there\u2019s no point having a rest day if it\u2019s going to be spent writing reports, is there?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, he was babbling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo point at all,\u201d she agreed with a smile that told him plainly enough she\u2019d fought\u2014and lost\u2014that particular battle with her own court.</p><p>He only realized he was smiling back when her smile faded.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the history of your people, Ranon?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you know how your people came to be in Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the stories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople looked beyond themselves and made room for you. Remember that, Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget it,\u201d Ranon replied, puzzled. Some other message there. Or a warning? \u201cLady, is there something I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you what you need to know. The rest is up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stopped. Felt the room do one slow spin as he looked at the strange Jewel around her neck\u2014and the hourglass pendant she wore just above that Jewel.</p><p>Black Widow as well as Witch.</p> <p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cThis is why I asked to see you.\u201d</p><p>Two trunks appeared in front of him. Glancing at her for permission, he went down on one knee and lifted a lid. Picking up one of the items on top, he stood and opened the thin cover.</p><p>Old. Delicate.</p><p>His hands began to tremble when he realized what he held.</p><p>\u201cThat trunk has journals that record the daily life of the Shalador people\u2014and the decline of Dena Nehele after Lia\u2019s death. Two generations. No journals were sent after that. The other trunk\u2019s contents are more formal. When the Tradition Keepers saw the decline begin, they took it as a warning. So they wrote down the stories and the songs, wrote down the rituals of the Shalador people, and brought that writing to Ebon Askavi. They knew many of those things would be lost in the decaying years, but they also hoped the time would come when the forgotten things could be reclaimed. Based on the last couple of letters Cassidy sent to me, I thought it was time for these to come back to the Shalador people.\u201d</p> <p>Ranon put the journal back in the trunk before a tear fell and damaged the ink. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one other thing for you.\u201d Jaenelle called in another package and handed it to him. \u201cThis was left here at the Keep for Daemon, but he and I agree that it should go to you now.\u201d</p><p>He unwrapped the package. Another journal? He opened it to a random page and read for a minute. Then he looked at Jaenelle. \u201cJared? This came fromJared ?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThis is his account of the journey he made with Lia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Blaed and Thera.\u201dAnd Talon.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should go to Theran. He\u2019s the last Grayhaven,\u201d Ranon said as his grip tightened on the journal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours now to do with as you please. But I\u2019ll remind you that Jared was a Shalador Warlord, and he was proud of it.\u201d</p> <p>Ranon pressed a hand against his chest. \u201cMy heart is too full for words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have said all the words I need to say.\u201d Jaenelle smiled. \u201cI need to get back to Kaeleer. My father is here standing escort. In fact, he helped me locate the journals. But my husband gets snarly if I stay at the Keep in Terreille for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your time, Lady. And for these.\u201d He pointed at the trunks. \u201cThey are a gift to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Prince Ranon.\u201d</p><p>He bowed and waited until she left the room before sinking into a chair to regain his breath and his balance before he headed home.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at Powell, who was hurrying toward her.</p><p>\u201cTold you they\u2019d notice you were still working,\u201d Reyhana said quietly.</p><p>*Grf.* That was Vae\u2019s grumpy opinion.</p><p>\u201cOh, hush up, both of you.\u201d Cassidy tossed the handful of weeds into the basket, brushed off her hands, and smiled at Powell. \u201cI wasn\u2019t working. Really. I was just pulling a few weeds and keeping Reyhana company while she brushed Vae.\u201d Of course, if she wanted him to accept the \u201ca few weeds\u201d fib, she should have vanished at least half the weeds in the basket.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Powell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t rest as much as you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowell?\u201d Cassidy asked sharply. The man was too distracted to notice the basket? Her Steward noticed everything.</p><p>\u201cThere are some people who need to see you.\u201d</p><p>Not want,need. She sent out a psychic probe to get a feel for Spere\u2019s and Archerr\u2019s tempers, since they were the escorts on duty this afternoon, and wished Ranon or Gray were back from their respective errands\u2014or that it was closer to sundown and Talon could be with her.</p><p>Simmering anger, tightly leashed. That was all she was picking up from her men.</p><p>\u201cReyhana, stay here. Vae, you stay with her,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Reyhana began.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201dUntil she knew what this was about, she was not putting Reyhana in a potentially explosive situation.</p><p>*We will stay,* Vae said.</p><p>That much settled, Cassidy strode to the house, Powell puffing to keep up with her. When she reached the parlor that was the waiting room for anyone wishing to have an audience with the Queen . . .</p><p>\u201cDryden?\u201d Cassidy looked at the Grayhaven butler. \u201cWhat . . . ?Birdie? \u201d</p><p>Therewas the reason for the anger\u2014that dark bruise on the little maid\u2019s face.</p><p>*Shira,* Cassidy called. *I need you in the visitors\u2019 parlor.*</p><p>*Cassie, I really don\u2019t feel . . . *</p><p>*The Healer\u2019s attendance is required.*</p><p>Shira didn\u2019t reply. Cassidy didn\u2019t expect her to. Shira the woman had been holed up in her room, riding a mood since she\u2019d gone out to look at properties with Gray, but the Healer would arrive in the parlor ready to practice her Craft.</p><p>Putting an arm around the maid, Cassidy led Birdie to a sofa and sat down with her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything bad,\u201d Birdie whispered. \u201cI swear by the Jewels, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may explain, Lady?\u201d Dryden asked.</p><p>Cassidy looked past him to the other people in the room. Elle, the housekeeper; Maydra, the cook; and four of the young men who worked in the Grayhaven stable and had befriended Gray before he\u2019d begun to heal from the emotional scars that had their roots in the torture he\u2019d endured.</p><p>Shira burst into the room, took one look at Birdie, and said, \u201cHell\u2019s fire. Let me get some ice from the block in the freeze box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Spere said. He slipped out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWe did use a cold spell on a wet cloth to keep the swelling down,\u201d Elle said. Then she added bitterly, \u201cHad enough experience dealing with this sort of thing before.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy rose and stepped aside, giving Shira room to work. Moving to the other end of the parlor, flanked by Archerr and Powell, she faced Dryden, who was flanked by Elle and Maydra. \u201cExplain, Lord Dryden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven\u2019s guest hit Birdie,\u201d Dryden said.</p><p>A flash of rage, quickly chained. From Dryden.</p><p>\u201cWhat guest?\u201d Powell asked, but his tone said he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cThat . . . woman.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Hell\u2019s fire. This was bad. She\u2019d only had this experience once, when an aristo witch who had been a guest had tried to coerce a footman into doing \u201cbedroom work.\u201d Because of the social difference between an aristo and a servant, her butler had refused to say the woman\u2019s name when he\u2019d come to her and reported the abuse.</p><p>Or maybe refusing to say the witch\u2019s name had been the measure of the man\u2019s contempt for her behavior.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Lady Kermilla?\u201d Powell asked.</p><p>Dryden nodded.</p><p>Elle said, \u201cLady Bitch,\u201d under her breath, quietly enough that Cassidy pretended no one had heard the housekeeper\u2019s opinion of the other Dharo Queen.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she hit Birdie?\u201d Cassidy asked. Her stomach felt like it was full of foaming milk. Hadn\u2019t she voiced concerns about Kermilla when the other Queen had been training with her? The court had adored the pretty, dark-haired girl; the servants had disliked her.</p><p>\u201cBirdie was cleaning her room the way I told the girl she could clean\u2014and the way you allowed her to do for you. But that other one didn\u2019t want her things touched, wanted Birdie to be using Craft all the time to lift or move every little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cIt does if the Lady doesn\u2019t want anyone picking up an object and noticing something unusual about it,\u201d Powell said, looking at Dryden.</p><p>The butler nodded. \u201cBirdie picked up a bottle of scent from the dresser\u2014a bottle that still had the theft disk on it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Cassidy looked at Powell for explanation.</p><p>\u201cA spelled disk of paper-thin stone,\u201d Powell explained. \u201cIt was a common practice in the shops favored by the Queens and their aristo companions to put such a disk on small, expensive items that had a way of going missing. Since he didn\u2019t want to lose an eye or his tongue, the merchant couldn\u2019t acknowledge the theft, even if he saw the person do it. But a bottle of scent, for example, that left the boundaries of the shop with the disk still on the bottle would be spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoiled?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cImagine a dozen rotten eggs breaking on the kitchen floor,\u201d Maydra said. \u201cOf course, the way some of those spells worked, the scent smelled fine until it warmed on the skin for a little while. So the Lady was usually well into her social engagement before she, and everyone else, realized something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassidy clamped a hand over her nose in automatic response. Lowering her hand, she smiled sheepishly. Then she glanced at Birdie and found nothing to smile about. \u201cSo Birdie picked up a bottle of stolen scent and Kermilla hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dryden said. \u201cWhen I reported the abuse to Prince Grayhaven, Kermilla insisted that she caught Birdie trying to steal from her and that was why she struck the girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrayhaven believed that?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>Dryden looked sad. \u201cSometimes a man only sees what he wants to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Archerr said softly.</p> <p>\u201cBirdie was dismissed without references,\u201d Dryden said. \u201cElle, Maydra, and I talked it over, and handed in our resignations. We have worked for such witches before. We do not want to work for such a one again. As it turned out, four of the stable lads have no ties to the town, no family to hold them there, and they didn\u2019t want to stay either.\u201d He hesitated, then looked Cassidy in the eyes. \u201cWe came in the hope that you might have a place for us here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. Powell, however, didn\u2019t have that problem.</p><p>\u201cThere are servants\u2019 quarters here, including a separate parlor off the kitchen. Didn\u2019t ask to have those rooms cleaned since we weren\u2019t using them.\u201d</p><p>Maydra frowned. \u201cIf you have no servants here, who\u2019s been cooking for you and your court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019ve been doing a bit of it, along with some of the women in the village.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s voice trailed away.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing your own dusting too?\u201d Birdie piped up, sounding shocked.</p><p>The Grayhaven servants stared at her.</p><p>*I wouldn\u2019t admit to running a dust rag over the furniture,* Powell said, sounding amused. *You\u2019ve shocked them quite enough for one day.*</p><p>*As my father is fond of saying, I was born a daughter on the same day as I was born a Queen, and if I can get dirty weeding a garden, I can get dirty washing a floor.*</p><p>*Your father is a wise man, but I think it is time to relinquish some of your less-than-Queenly duties. Besides, they need the work, and we need the help. With your consent, I\u2019ll discuss duties and compensation with them.*</p><p>*All right.* She smiled at each of the servants and stable lads\u2014and especially at Birdie. \u201cWelcome to Eyota. There is plenty of work here for all of us. Prince Powell will discuss the details with you.\u201d</p> <p>She walked out of the room, heading for the back door that would take her to the gardens. Then she changed direction and went up to her room. She wanted solitude. She needed privacy.</p><p>*Cassie?* Vae called softly. *Cassie!*</p><p>*There is no danger,* Cassidy said. *You can let Reyhana come in now.*</p><p>*She wants to talk to you.*</p><p>*No. I need to be alone for a little while.*</p><p>A hesitation. *We will wait for you.*</p><p>Cassidy lay down on her bed and stared at the ceiling. Theran probably would accuse her of telling tales, and Kermilla certainly would accuse her of acting out of jealousy and spite. But it was the bruised look in Birdie\u2019s eyes more than the bruise on her face that had to be the deciding factor. Besides, no matter how hard it was, she had a duty to report Kermilla\u2019s behavior. Since he ruled the town of Grayhaven, Theran should be the one who disciplined Kermilla\u2014something he wouldn\u2019t do if he truly belonged to the other Dharo Queen.</p><p>Dharo Queen. That was the sticking point, wasn\u2019t it? Kermilla ruled a village in Dharo. Her conduct was the business of the Queen who ruled that Territory. So Cassidy had a responsibility to Sabrina, Territory Queen to Territory Queen, to inform the Queen of Dharo that the conduct of one of Dharo\u2019s District Queens needed careful review.</p> <p>If Kermilla, as a guest, had struck a servant, what was she doing to the people in Bhak\u2014people whose lives depended on their Queen\u2019s mercy?</p><p>Get it done. This isn\u2019t about you and Kermilla, no matter what anyone else might think. This is about being a Queen.</p><p>Sitting up, she called in the lap desk the High Lord had given her, selected a sheet of stationery with her initial on it, and began writing her letter to Sabrina.</p><p>\u201cRanon!\u201d</p><p>Seeing Gray trotting toward him from the court\u2019s stables, Ranon stopped at the edge of the street and waited. He\u2019d walked from the northern landing web, wanting the time to contact his grandfather, who would contact Akeelah. For now, two Tradition Keepers were enough to stand witness to what he\u2019d brought home.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Shira?\u201d Ranon asked when Gray reached him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been home for a while. I had another errand to run and just got back.\u201d Gray cocked a thumb over his shoulder toward the stables. \u201cFour of the stable lads from Grayhaven are working at the stables here. Just started an hour ago. They\u2019re taking one of the cottages across from the stables as their living quarters. And some of the other servants from Grayhaven are working at the Residence. Did Cassie say anything to you about this? Or Talon?\u201d</p><p>Ranon shook his head. \u201cI just got back myself. Let\u2019s find out\u2014\u201d He stopped when Gray gripped his arm. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go away for a couple of days. Three at the most. I need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Ranon studied the other Warlord Prince. Something different. Of course, Gray seemed to be changing daily, but this blend of excitement, fear, and determination was new.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cTo Dhemlan. In Kaeleer. To talk to Daemon Sadi.\u201d</p><p>A few months ago, Theran had been the one going in search of Daemon Sadi. Now it was Gray.</p><p>\u201cThere are things we need, for the court and for this village. I have an idea of how we can start to get them. But I need to talk to Daemon, and there are some decisions I can\u2019t make alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Shalador\u2019s Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>The words rocked him. Yes, he was the last adult Warlord Prince until youngsters like his brother Janos came of age, but Gray\u2019s phrasing gave a weight, aduty , to a truth he\u2019d lived with for the past few years.</p><p>\u201cIf Cassie gives her consent to this journey, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Gray huffed out a breath and smiled. \u201cGood. So let\u2019s find out what everyone else was up to today.\u201d</p><p>Plenty,Ranon thought when Dryden opened the door and greeted them.</p><p>It looked like they wereall going to have something to talk about that evening.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Kermilla frowned at the toast that was burnt around the edges. She tasted the eggs and made a face. As she pushed her plate away\u2014and noticed Correne doing the same\u2014Theran walked into the small breakfast room.</p><p>That was unusual. She and Correne, the \u201cLadies of the court,\u201d had breakfast alone, leaving the men to a working breakfast where they reviewed their assignments for the day and were allowed to be fools before they had to put on their manners.</p><p>It might be unusual to see him in the breakfast room, but his timing was perfect.</p><p>\u201cTheran, what in the name of Hell is wrong with the cook today?\u201d Kermilla complained. \u201cThe toast is burned, and these eggs are unacceptable. And the beef is . . . Well, I can hardly choke it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you try,\u201d Theran said in an odd voice. \u201cThe woman who was the cook\u2019s assistant has a blind eye and a weak arm, courtesy of the last Queen she served. She\u2019s doing the best she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she doing it at all?\u201d Correne asked, sounding pouty.</p><p>She was going to have to talk to the girl about when a good pout worked and when it caused nothing but trouble\u2014and judging by the look in Theran\u2019s eyes, being anything but helpful today was going to cause trouble.</p><p>Ignoring Correne, Theran watched Kermilla. \u201cThe cook, the housekeeper, and the butler resigned yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She heard a hint of accusation in his voice. \u201cBecause I had to discipline Birdie?\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s face tightened. \u201cYou call it discipline. You said it was necessary, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have struck the girl without good reason. But Dryden called it abuse, said it was the same kind of treatment the purged Queens used to inflict on servants\u2014and the kind of treatment I had promised him no one would endure in this house. So the senior servants resigned, along with four of the stable lads. It may take a while before I can replace them.\u201d He glanced at Correne. \u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Kermilla watched him walk out of the room. That little bitch Birdiehad to be disciplined. The other servants should have accepted that!</p><p>\u201cWhat did he mean by the purged Queens?\u201d Kermilla asked.</p><p>Correne pulled her plate back and began eating. \u201cThe Queens who were destroyed by that witch storm a couple of years ago.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI heard it swept through the whole Realm and consumed lots and lots of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many Queens?\u201d Kermilla whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe Territory Queen and all the Province Queens. Lots of the District Queens too. That\u2019s why Cassidy had to come and rule here. There has been talk of letting Queens establish a court when they\u2019re eighteen, which is before the age of majority and before they\u2019re ready to make the Offering to the Darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old Queens are too old to rule more than one village, sosomeone has to regain control of the Provinces.\u201d Correne leaned forward. \u201cI got a letter from a friend yesterday.She said some of the Warlord Princes are claiming whole districts as their personal territory and ruling like they wereQueens. \u201d</p><p>Having males rule on a Queen\u2019s behalf wasn\u2019t that unusual\u2014at least, not in Kaeleer\u2014but Correne sounded shocked. And with good reason. If the most aggressive and dangerous caste of male began taking control and ruling without a Queen\u2019s leash, the young Queens might end up being ruled by Warlord Princes instead of the other way around.</p><p>And the Queen who could stopthat change would have the loyalty of every other Queen in this land.</p><p>\u201cLook, look, look!\u201d Powell danced into the breakfast room, waving a handful of papers over his head.</p><p>Momentarily frozen in the act of biting into a piece of toast\u2014which Birdieand Maydra pointed out that she hadnot had to make for herself\u2014Cassidy finished chewing while she, Shira, and Reyhana watched the gleeful Steward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking at?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe dominant Warlord Princes living in the two southernmost Provinces have sent in a proposed division of those Provinces into districts that would be ruled by a Warlord Prince if a Queen wasn\u2019t available.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t more than a hundred adult Warlord Princes left in Dena Nehele,\u201d Shira said. \u201cCould so few actually rule effectively?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy wiped her hands on a napkin and reached for the papers. \u201cLet me see those.\u201d Her heart pounded and her hands trembled. No indication of which districts would be ruled by Queens. Not that she\u2019d expected them to offerthat much trust yet. She\u2019d come to realize that the Queens who had met with her had been prepared to be sacrificed if the new Territory Queen turned out to be as twisted as the one who had ruled before. This was evidence that the Warlord Princes who had been disappointed when they had first seen her were now reconsidering what her knowledge might give their people.</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . .\u201d Reyhana began. She immediately hunched her shoulders and toyed with her scrambled eggs.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe . . . ?\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReyhana, I enjoy your company and I value you as a friend, but you\u2019re also here to learn how to be a Queen. I can\u2019t offer guidance if you don\u2019t tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>The girl straightened up. \u201cAre any of the Warlord Princes taking responsibility for a whole Province?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a bit too aggressive,\u201d Powell said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to rule what the available Queens can\u2019t handle themselves; it\u2019s quite another to rule over a Queen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it is done,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cDaemon Sadi is the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan. Herules that Territory, and every Queen in Dhemlan answers to him. He is the exception, that is true, but Queens do sometimes rule within a Warlord Prince\u2019s Territory and not the other way around. Lucivar Yaslana is another example. He rules Ebon Rih, the territory that belongs to the Keep. The Queens who rule the villages there answer to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected,\u201d Powell said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to rule each Province, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d Reyhana said.</p><p>\u201cJust getting the Warlord Princes to step up to the line and agree to rule a district is a victory,\u201d Shira said. \u201cAt least half of these men lived in the rogue camps in the Tamanara Mountains after they reached puberty. Actually living in a village with the families they left behind is a new experience for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a good start, but it\u2019s just a start,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t your First Circle act as Province liaisons between the districts and the court?\u201d Reyhana asked. \u201cThe same way Prince Ranon does for the Shalador reserves?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe way Ranon does?\u201d Cassidy asked, glancing at Shira\u2014who was frowning thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Powell asked, indicating an empty chair.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cHere, it\u2019s probably best if we look at these papers more carefully in your office.\u201d</p><p>Powell vanished the papers. Moments later, Birdie came in with a pot of fresh coffee, another cup and saucer, and more toast.</p><p>Cassidy wondered who had told Maydra that Powell was joining her for breakfast. Then she noticed Vae in the doorway. The Sceltie wagged her tail once and left, no doubt to herd a few more of her humans.</p><p>\u201cPlease explain about Ranon,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he ever visited all the villages,\u201d Reyhana said, \u201cbut Janos told me Ranon would visit all three of the reserves and meet with the elders at least once each season. So he always knew if there was trouble or when things were getting too hard. Even during the uprisings, when he was off fighting, he\u2019d visit a reserve if he was close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing that for as long as I\u2019ve known him,\u201d Shira said. \u201cVisiting the elders. I thought he was showing his respect. He never said otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>No, he wouldn\u2019t have said otherwise, Cassidy thought. But that awareness of his people . . . Not so different from what the males in Jaenelle\u2019s court had done. Not so different at all.</p><p>\u201cIf a member of the First Circle visited a Province once or twice a month,\u201d Powell said thoughtfully, \u201cand made it known he would carry back any concerns to the Queen, I think other men would approach him\u2014especially if he\u2019s already known to those men. Not an official ruler, but a reminder that all others who rule in Dena Nehele do so on the Territory Queen\u2019s behalf. That is an excellent idea, Lady Reyhana.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy smiled at Reyhana and lifted her coffee cup as a salute. \u201cYes, itis an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Too bad Gray wasn\u2019t here to share this moment with her.</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Ranon stood in Daemon Sadi\u2019s study, a stunned look on his face. \u201cMother Night, Gray. The man has abutler who wears a Red Jewel.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked around the richly furnished room. There had been a jelly-knee moment when the door to SaDiablo Hall opened and that large, formidable man had stared at them. But it was clear the High Lord had sent a message ahead of them and they were expected, because Beale had led them to this room and informed them that the Prince would be with them shortly.</p><p>Noticing the stuffed toy on the floor near the long sofa, he nudged Ranon. \u201cHe may have a Red-Jeweled butler, but he also has a Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen may the Darkness have mercy on him,\u201d Ranon muttered.</p><p>The door opened. Ranon sucked in a breath. Gray turned.</p><p>Beautiful, deadly man. Had he felt that sexual punch the last time he\u2019d seen Daemon, or was there a reason why that heat and power were sharper today?</p><p>\u201cGray, it\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Is it?Gray wondered, noticing Daemon\u2019s slightly glazed eyes. \u201cPrince Sadi, may I introduce my friend Prince Ranon?\u201d</p><p>Those gold eyes studied Ranon just a little too long.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Shaladoran,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the look of your people. Why don\u2019t we sit down and you can tell me what brings you here.\u201d</p><p>Gray started to turn toward the informal side of the room. Daemon walked over to the blackwood desk and settled in the chair behind it, leaving him and Ranon no choice but to sit in the visitors\u2019 chairs.</p><p>He nodded to Ranon, who called in a package and set it carefully on the desk. \u201cLady Cassidy asked me to give this to you, along with this letter.\u201d</p><p>Daemon opened the letter and seemed to take a long time reading the single page. Then he opened the package that contained Jared\u2019s journal and brushed his fingertips gently over the cover.</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate her efforts at economy, Cassidy\u2019s request, as written, is not the most practical,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll convey the message,\u201d Ranon said. He reached for the package. It vanished before he touched it.</p><p>\u201cTherefore,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cI will take care of it as it should be done.\u201d Ranon hesitated, and Gray understood why. Jared\u2019s story was one of the most precious gifts Jaenelle Angelline had sent back to the Shalador people.</p><p>Daemon steepled his fingers and rested the forefinger nails against his chin. \u201cIs that why you asked to come to Dhemlan? I could have met you at the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a loan.\u201d Gray hadn\u2019t meant to say it that bluntly. In fact, he\u2019d spent a good part of the journey rehearsing what he would say. Too bad the words just plopped out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201dRanon yelped.</p><p>\u201cWe need a loan,\u201d Gray said again, keeping his eyes on Daemon, who had done nothing more than raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou are aware of the Queen\u2019s gift?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>Ignoring the slight chill in the words\u2014after all, he figured plenty of people would like to dip a hand into the SaDiablo wealth\u2014Gray nodded. \u201cBut that\u2019s just for Cassie, for the things she needs that her people can\u2019t provide yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>*Gray, what are you doing?* Ranon asked.</p><p>Gray ignored his friend. \u201cWe need a loan to start building a life for the people again. For some simple things, like blankets and linens, and cloth so women can sew clothes for their children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201dRanon said, his voice a clear warning to stop.</p><p>\u201cWe need money to fix up a Healer\u2019s House. The village will give us the land and buildings, but Shira needs money to fix it up so that she can take care of the court and some of the villagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know about this?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. She wants that place, and it\u2019s perfect. But I didn\u2019t want to tell her I\u2019d gotten the deed made out for her until I talked to Daemon about a loan to fix it up.\u201d</p><p>Ranon looked ready to fall out of his chair. \u201cDeed. You got an official deed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I talked to the elders yesterday. They witnessed the deed. The property that backs the Queen\u2019s Residence now belongs to Shira.\u201d Gray paused. \u201cTo you, too, I guess, since you\u2019re living with her, but I asked to have it put in Shira\u2019s name since it will be a Healer\u2019s residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d</p><p>Why was Ranon getting so pissy? It was the best thing to do for the women and the court. \u201cNo. But I haven\u2019t told Cassie yet that the Queen\u2019s Residence belongs to her now. She\u2019ll feel better about fixing it up into the home she wants once she knows she holds the deed.\u201d</p><p>Daemon started coughing. \u201cWe\u2019ll . . . ah . . . have to talk about how to ease into these conversations so you don\u2019t stun the Ladies when you get home.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked at the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan. No chill in the voice now. No, Daemon seemed to be struggling with the effort not to laugh. \u201cYou think Cassie and Shira are going to go hissy cat about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHissy cat?\u201d Those gold eyes were starting to water.</p><p>\u201cA Sceltie term for a riled human female.\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s roar of laughter filled the room.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Sadi finally regained some control. \u201cSo you want a loan to fix up the Healer\u2019s House. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gray said, pressing his hands between his knees and leaning toward the desk. \u201cBut you have businesses in other Territories besides Dhemlan, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something pained and sad flickered in Daemon\u2019s eyes. \u201cI used to have a few businesses in Dena Nehele. It helped some people defy Dorothea\u2019s bitches for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>But the land fell anyway. How many places did you help hold on a little while longer? No wonder Lucivar said you can\u2019t come to Dena Nehele the way he can. There\u2019s no place in Terreille you can go that doesn\u2019t hold bitter memories, is there?</p><p>\u201cWe could use your help again,\u201d Gray said quietly. \u201cIn return for fixing up the buildings and providing the merchandise, since that\u2019s one of the things we don\u2019t have, the elders in Eyota have agreed to give you the buildings and the land they\u2019re on for a hundred years. That may not sound like a long time to you, but it\u2019s a long time for us.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon looked away, and Gray got the impression that Sadi was trying to decide about something more important than a couple of buildings and some merchandise.</p><p>Then Daemon rose and came around the desk. \u201cLet\u2019s go down the road and spend some time in Halaway. It\u2019s a small village and some of the shops there should give us all a reference point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gray said as he and Ranon stood up and followed Daemon to the door.</p><p>A quick knock. The door opened.</p><p>Daemon froze midstep. His nostrils flared as Jaenelle walked into the room\u2014and the gold eyes that now looked at Gray and Ranon held a barely controlled savagery.</p> <p>\u201cDaemon,\u201d Jaenelle said softly.</p><p>Daemon stared at the two men and snarled.</p><p>\u201cPrince.\u201d</p><p>Those gold eyes focused on her.</p><p>She, in turn, smiled at Gray and Ranon.</p><p>*Mother Night, Gray, I can smell moon\u2019s blood,* Ranon said. *We have to get out of this room before he kills us.*</p> <p>*How?*</p><p>Ranon gave no answer, since moving toward the door meant moving toward Jaenelle, and that would be a lethal mistake.</p><p>Then two other males entered the room and stopped on either side of Jaenelle at the same time Daemon stepped closer to her.</p><p>Still smiling at Gray and Ranon, Jaenelle said, \u201cI believe you know my little brother, Ladvarian.\u201d</p><p>Gray hadn\u2019t met the Red-Jeweled Sceltie Warlord when Ladvarian and Khardeen came to Eyota, but he nodded anyway.</p><p>She hooked an arm around her other companion\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd this pretty kitty is Prince Kaelas.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cpretty kitty\u201d was a white, huge Warlord Prince who wore a Red Jewel\u2014and wasn\u2019t half as terrifying as Daemon at that moment.</p><p>\u201cYou have some business to take care of this afternoon?\u201d Jaenelle released Kaelas and turned toward Daemon.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be postponed,\u201d he said in a croon that produced a chill down Gray\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for that,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cAt this moment, Beale and Holt are in my private garden, arranging a lounge chair in the shady spot, Mrs. Beale is making a pitcher of that fruit punch I enjoy drinking in warm weather, Ladvarian and Kaelas are going to keep me company, and . . .\u201d She called in a book and held it up between them. \u201cI have Fiona\u2019s new Tracker and Shadow novel to read.\u201d</p><p>Daemon studied his wife through narrowed eyes. \u201cIn other words, you have no use for me this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo use at all.\u201d</p><p>The words could have been cutting to a man in love, but not when they were accompanied by the look in Jaenelle\u2019s gorgeous eyes as she smiled at Daemon and gave his face a brief caress.</p><p>A code, Gray thought. Like the one he and Cassie had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring our guests back for dinner,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Daemon hesitated. \u201cAs my Lady wishes.\u201d</p><p>*He doesn\u2019t want us anywhere near her, but he won\u2019t hesitate to hurt us if we decline her invitation,* Ranon said.</p><p>*Did you read the section in the Protocol book that covers this situation? * Gray asked.</p><p>*Yes. Thank the Darkness.*</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Jaenelle said before she left the room with Ladvarian and Kaelas.</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an answer, so they followed him out of the Hall.</p><p>Daemon stopped at the edge of Halaway and waited for his companions to catch up. Gray and Ranon had been trailing after him since he\u2019d walked out of the Hall and headed for the village on foot. He had needed the movement, had needed to burn off some of the temper. When Saetan had contacted him to find out if he was willing to host Gray and Ranon, he\u2019d warned his father that Jaenelle\u2019s moontime was close and he might not respond well to male visitors.</p><p>Jaenelle had decided that the visit shouldn\u2019t be postponed.</p><p>Daemon frowned. Gray and Ranon immediately stopped walking.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m steady now and won\u2019t eviscerate you for being in the same room as my wife.\u201d But in the moment before Jaenelle had said \u201cPrince\u201d in a tone he recognized as a command, he had considered it.</p><p>Ah, well. At least he could tell Saetan that two of Cassidy\u2019s court had paid attention to the additional notes about how Warlord Princes reacted to the scent of moon\u2019s blood and how to avoid provoking an attack.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told us not to come,\u201d Gray said when he reached Daemon.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady decided otherwise,\u201d Daemon replied.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. But if it makes you feel any better, Ladvarian and Kaelas didn\u2019t object to your presence today. Since those two didn\u2019t see you as a threat to the Lady, I can keep my temper leashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cat is Kaelas?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cArcerian,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s the Warlord Prince of Arceria. All eight hundred pounds of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>He liked these men, and while he wanted them to be careful during their stay at the Hall, he saw no reason to frighten them. So unless it became necessary, he wouldn\u2019t tell them what a Red-Jeweled Warlord Prince of Kaelas\u2019s size, speed, and strength could do to a human body when he got pissed off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the village,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>It was a small, healthy village, prosperous enough to take care of itself and the people within its boundaries.</p><p>Daemon noted the way that the males who were simply going about their business went on alert at the sight of strangers\u2014and relaxed when they realized the strangers were with him. He noted how the village guards came trotting past to get a look at the strangersdespite Gray and Ranon being with him.</p><p>\u201cDoes this village often see trouble?\u201d Ranon asked when Gray stopped at a bookshop window and stared at the display, damn near vibrating with excitement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cConsidering its proximity to the Hall, if trouble starts here and the Queen\u2019s court can\u2019t handle it, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all the males are ready to defend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is our nature, Ranon.\u201d</p><p>The shop door opened and Sylvia walked out. She wore a sleeveless shirt tucked into a pair of knee-length trousers and sandals. Her short black hair looked deliberately mussed enough to be called sassy, and there wasn\u2019t a single thing besides her psychic scent that would give anyone a clue that she was the Queen of Halaway.</p><p>Daemon moved to join Gray, who had turned away from the window and given Sylvia a quick, assessing look before smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Lady,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Sylvia narrowed her gold eyes. \u201cYou look familiar, but not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I introduce Prince Jared Blaed Grayhaven and Prince Ranon,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cThey\u2019re here visiting from Dena Nehele. Gentlemen, this is Lady Sylvia.\u201d</p><p>Gray frowned at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t introduce her as a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Proof enough that Gray was far more perceptive than his cousin when it came to recognizing caste.</p><p>He glanced at Sylvia, who gave him a tiny nod. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t. Lady Sylvia rules Halaway and prefers to be informal in her home village unless formality is required.\u201d</p><p>Gray beamed at Sylvia. \u201cThat\u2019s the way Cassie wants things to be in Eyota. The Shaladorans are pretty comfortable with that because they\u2019re used to their Queens living among them, so I think she\u2019s happier living where we do now than she was when we were in Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Daemon thought as he looked at Sylvia\u2019s slightly stunned expression and swallowed the urge to laugh. The earnest young Warlord Prince who had asked him for a loan had changed into a two-legged puppy.</p><p>\u201cI met someone else named Grayhaven recently,\u201d Sylvia said.</p><p>\u201cJared Blaed and Theran are cousins,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>Sylvia\u2019s smile had sharp edges. \u201cAnd how is Theran getting along with Vae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Vae lives with Cassie and me now,\u201d Gray said. \u201cSo does Khollie, but that\u2019s because Ranon and Shira live in the Queen\u2019s Residence with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that must make story time easier for all of you, since the humans can take turns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory time?\u201d</p><p>Ah, no, Sylvia,Daemon thought. But he wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know about story time?\u201d Sylvia asked, widening her eyes. When Gray shook his head, she opened the bookshop door and called to someone inside. \u201cDo you have any copies ofUnicorn to the Rescue orSceltie Saves the Day ?\u201d She turned back to Gray. \u201cHow many Scelties live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are thirteen in our village,\u201d Gray said, looking back at Daemon.</p><p>Finally figured out something is going on, haven\u2019t you, boyo?Of course, it was much too late todo anything about it, but it was always good for a man to recognize when he was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sylvia leaned into the shop, then back out. \u201cOh, good. They also have a couple of copies ofDragon and the Dangerous Deed. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think . . .\u201d Ranon began.</p><p>\u201cA gift,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cEnjoy your visit, gentlemen. Prince Sadi.\u201d</p><p>Daemon watched her hurry away and duck into a shop a couple of doors down from the bookshop. He huffed out a breath. \u201cWhile we\u2019re in the shop, there are a few other books you might find entertaining.\u201d The Tracker and Shadow books were adventures or mysteries for most readers, but anyone who dealt with a Sceltie also found them instructional. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was laughing when she went into that other shop,\u201d Gray said as Daemon led the two men into the bookshop. \u201cWhy was she laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you show those books to any Sceltie, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Daemon replied dryly.And may the Darkness have mercy on you.</p><p>He let them look around while he selected a few books that he thought Cassidy would enjoy since Jaenelle or Marian had liked them. Ranon showed polite interest, but Gray loved books and stories, and kept delaying so that he could see \u201cjust one more thing.\u201d Daemon ended up selecting a few more books for them to take back to Eyota and then hauled Gray out of the shop so they could see more of the village.</p> <p>Gray showed a boyish enthusiasm for everything he saw except, oddly, the bakery, which he glanced at and then bolted past. Ranon\u2019s emotions were more contained and more intense\u2014especially when Daemon showed the Shaladoran the music shop. The place sold sheet music and instruments that spanned the Territories in Kaeleer, as well as the music crystals that had audio spells.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell them Jaenelle owned this shop, which was the reason it had such an eclectic variety of music\u2014and why it had an attached room with a small stage for performances. Twice a month, she joined the musicians and sang there\u2014and on those nights, there was never an empty chair.</p><p>He mentioned the performances and pointed out the nearby tavern and coffee shop. Ranon appreciated the potential businesses. Gray was more dazzled by the small courtyards that were shady gathering places accented with flower beds.</p><p>By the time they settled at a table in one of those courtyards with glasses of ale and a plate of sandwiches, Daemon had a very good idea what kind of businesses would do well in Eyota.</p><p>\u201cAll right, gentlemen . . .\u201d he began.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the boy.\u201d</p><p>Daemon rose at the sound of that female voice and was pleased that Gray and Ranon responded just as quickly.</p><p>\u201cTersa,\u201d he said warmly as he kissed her cheek. Her long black hair was always as tangled as her mind, but it gave him comfort to know she could wander around this village and be safe. \u201cWould you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are trying to feed me,\u201d she accused.</p><p>Of course he was. Even having a journeymaid Black Widow living with her, Tersa still didn\u2019t remember to eat when her mind traveled its own strange paths.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little,\u201d he said, giving her a boyish smile.</p> <p>She gave his arm a light, dismissive smack as she glanced at Ranon. Then she looked at Gray, and Daemon felt the change in her\u2014and saw Gray go absolutely still.</p><p>\u201cThis is the one,\u201d Tersa said softly. She called in a glass globe supported by a carved wooden base and set it in front of Gray. Then she touched the small amethyst in the base. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>Smoke filled the globe as the spell engaged.</p><p>Changes,Daemon thought.Metamorphosis. He watched as a dagger was cocooned, then emerged as a small boy who had no limbs. That image cocooned and emerged as a dead tree, which cocooned and emerged as a living tree that bore daggers as its fruit. That image cocooned and emerged as a dragon breathing fire\u2014a powerful warrior.</p><p>All the color had drained out of Gray\u2019s face when he saw the first two images\u2014and something Daemon couldn\u2019t name filled those green eyes when Gray saw the last image.</p><p>The sequence started again. When the image of the dagger tree cocooned, the sequence stopped.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you are,\u201d Tersa said.</p><p>\u201cHow do I get to the last stage?\u201d Gray asked, his eyes fixed on the shrouded image.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the time comes, accept the fire that lives within you.\u201d</p><p>*Tersa?* Daemon asked.</p><p>*Trust your wife\u2014and trust your own heart.*</p><p>She kissed him and walked away.</p><p>Shaken, he sat down and drained the glass of ale. Gray and Ranon did the same, so he flicked a thought at the tavern owner, who hurried out a minute later with a cold pitcher of ale.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Ranon asked after the second glass of ale.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Daemon replied.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . different,\u201d Gray said, clearly not wanting to offend, but just as clearly wanting an answer.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a broken Black Widow,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cShe\u2019s been walking the roads of the Twisted Kingdom for a long time, but her mind completely shattered a few centuries ago when she made the choice to forfeit sanity in order to regain her Craft. In the past few years, she\u2019s been living closer to the border of sanity, which lets her have a life in the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she can\u2019t wear a Jewel, how does she . . . ?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Even my father doesn\u2019t know. But sane or not, Jewels or not, she has always been a formidable witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jaenelle know how Tersa regained power through madness?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably, since my Lady has walked roads even darker than the ones Tersa has traveled.\u201d But this was not something he wanted to think about right now, so he said, \u201cGentlemen. Let\u2019s talk about doing business.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Thank the Darkness neither of us have to drive this Coach,Ranon thought as he and Gray huddled in the comfortable back compartment of the SaDiablo Coach provided by Daemon. They\u2019d had a delicious dinner. At least, he assumed it was delicious. He couldn\u2019t remember a single bite of it. Afterward, Sadi had opened the Gate next to the Hall and instructed one of the drivers who worked for the SaDiablo family to take his guests back to Dena Nehele. So they were heading home directly from the Hall, riding the Opal Winds.</p><p>\u201cMother Night, Gray,\u201d Ranon said, keeping his voice low even though they couldn\u2019t be heard through the closed door separating their compartment from the driver\u2019s. \u201cFive million gold marks. Do you have any idea how much that is?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve everseen a gold mark. I got a ten silver mark once for my birthday, and I thought it was a fortune. Do you really think we could spend that many gold marks?\u201d</p><p>Ranon took a deep breath and felt his body tremble as he breathed out. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be hard to do. We\u2019ve had so little for so long, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to do. Paying it back is a different thing altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShops and supplies,\u201d Gray said. \u201cForage for the animals if the harvest falls short this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood for us if the crops fall short this year,\u201d Ranon said. Although with so many Blood dead in the past two years, having people starve was less likely. Having the crops rot in the fields because there weren\u2019t enough hands to harvest them was a possibility, even if the Blood used Craft and drained their power every day to get the harvest in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find the right kinds of buildings for the shops Daemon wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>Ranon closed his eyes. A music shop like the one he\u2019d seen in Halaway. A room where the Tradition Keepers like his grandfather could teach openly what had been forbidden for so many years. And Sadi\u2019s gift . . .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Daemon had said, \u201cbut the music of Scelt has a complex simplicity that I think is similar to Shalador\u2019s music. At least as I remember it. You might enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>The music crystals and the brass stand. Such a simple thing, really, and not so simple. Like Sadi casually pointing out some folk music from Dharo that could be played on a flute.</p><p>Sharing customs. Sharing hopes.</p><p>Kind of funny, actually. Now that the Shaladorans could honor their own traditions, it didn\u2019t sting to look beyond his own people and consider what other traditions might have to offer.</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>A quick scan of the messages that had arrived that afternoon confirmed that nothing required his immediate attention, so Daemon went up to Jaenelle\u2019s sitting room. When she marked her place in her book and set it aside, he took that as an invitation. He picked her up, then sat down in the stuffed chair with her on his lap.</p><p>\u201cOur guests are on their way home?\u201d She ran her fingers through his hair, a soothing caress.</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d He called in Jared\u2019s journal and held it up for her to see.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t want it?\u201d Disappointment filled her voice and eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey want to preserve the original and also be able to share the contents. Cassidy sent a note with the journal asking if the Queen\u2019s gift could be extended to having a couple of copies made so that people could read Jared\u2019s account of his journey with Lia.\u201d</p><p>She studied him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like an extravagant request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s also not a practical request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And what would my darling Prince consider a practical request?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA thousand copies would be a good start.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat are you going to do with a thousand copies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, sell them in the merchant\u2019s shop I\u2019m opening in Eyota. They can buy the book there, then go over to the coffee shop I\u2019m also opening and read while enjoying a cup or two of their favorite beverage.\u201d</p><p>She hooted. \u201cHow many shops did Gray and Ranon talk you into opening?\u201d</p><p>He laughed with her. \u201cFour. Plus a loan the court can use to help the people start rebuilding their lives and villages.\u201d</p><p>Then his laughter faded. He cuddled Jaenelle, needing that comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDid I do the right thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big a loan did you give them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFive million gold marks.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cThat explains why they both looked like they couldn\u2019t remember how to breathe when you brought them back from the village and couldn\u2019t string words together in a coherent sentence all through dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaenelle, did I do the right thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you ask that?</p><p>\u201cBecause Dena Nehele is going to fall.\u201d</p><p>She rested a hand over his heart. \u201cDaemon, pretend you never heard that.Act as if you\u2019d never heard that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m going to talk to Lord Burle about doing a bit of work on my new properties in Eyota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could also offer those properties as training ground if there were any youngsters in that village who wanted to learn the carpenter\u2019s trade and Lord Burle was willing to teach them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, could I?\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a kiss that was warm and sweet.

Warlord Princes?\u201d She shuddered dramatically. \u201cWhy waste a good meal on them? It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll know the difference since they\u2019re always fighting or living in the rogue camps.\u201d</p> <p>Glancing back at the unamused expressions of her men, Kermilla whispered. \u201cStop that. It\u2019s disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019strue. \u201d</p><p>Hard to argue with that. Theran plowed through food she could barely swallow, and didn\u2019t care if a dish was bland or the potatoes were lumpy. In fact, as long as it didn\u2019t have dirt on it and was cooked enough that it wasn\u2019t still running, he didn\u2019t complain. Since he would be taking care of her residence when she became Queen, she was going to have to improve his palate.Then they would have the kind of dinner parties that would impress the aristos here in Dena Nehele.</p><p>\u201cTrue or not, you don\u2019t say things like that when other men are around. If it gets back to the Warlord Princes, it will cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>Correne looked over her shoulder at Bardoc and Kenjim, then looked at Kermilla. \u201cThey belong to you, sothey won\u2019t go telling tales about you. And I heard in the stables that this carriage driver had his tongue cut out so hecouldn\u2019t tell tales.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla winced. No, her men wouldn\u2019t tell tales on her, but they didn\u2019t feel the same loyalty to Correne, which was something the girl couldn\u2019t get through her head. She acted like the men wouldn\u2019tdare say anything.</p> <p>It might be useful to find out why the Queens here felt that way.</p><p>Then they were at the meeting place. Brok and Garth clambered into the seats behind the driver, all smiles and young-man juice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a special dinner at the house tomorrow, so Correne and I need to do some shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite us to this dinner,\u201d Brok said. \u201cWe\u2019ll show you how to make it special.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to have someone besides Correne to talk to, but Theran had emphasized several times that these Warlord Princes were coming to meether, talk toher, so she couldn\u2019t have her own little party at one end of the table.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Kermilla gave them a pretty pout. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do something fun together soon. Driver, take us to the marketplace in the landen part of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Garth sounded alarmed.</p><p>\u201cWhyever not?\u201d Kermilla asked. \u201cDriver, move on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWecan\u2019t, \u201d Brok said, his voice full of bitter hatred. \u201cQueen\u2019s orders. If we cross intotheir part of town, we\u2019ll be exiled from Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla stared at them, too shocked to speak. \u201cWhy would Cassidy do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Garth muttered. \u201cWe were just having a little fun, and then she and that damn dog started raving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDog?\u201d Kermilla frowned. \u201cOh, the kindred Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have one of those smart dogs?\u201d Correne asked. \u201cWhen I set up my court, I\u2019m going to insist on having one of them. I think it would be quite amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re more trouble than they\u2019re worth,\u201d Kermilla muttered. But therewas a kind of status in having one of the kindred as a companion. Just not a bitch like that Vae. \u201cAnyway, gentlemen, you needn\u2019t be concerned with any orders given by Lady Freckledy.\u201d She waited until Garth and Brok stopped guffawing, then tapped her Summer-sky ring. \u201cI outrank her, which means I can countermand any order she gives. So I am formally requesting your presence while Correne and I do some shopping in the landen marketplace.\u201d Since her escorts were behind her and couldn\u2019t see her face, she gave her boys a significant smile. \u201cMaybe you could even point out a likely place for us to pick up a gift or two.\u201d</p><p>Brok smiled back. \u201cYes, Lady, we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppi!\u201d Ignoring the other two men who were standing with Gray and Ranon, Cassidy threw herself into her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my Kitten.\u201d Burle hugged her breathless, then took a step back to study her face. His eyes got misty. He sniffed and nodded sharply before turning to the men. \u201cPrince Gray. Prince Ranon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see you again, sir,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Burle frowned. \u201cSir? Huh.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy linked arms with her father. \u201cCome inside and tell me all the gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen do not gossip,\u201d Burle said. \u201cWe share news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Well, come in and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for that later. There\u2019s work to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got time for a little visit before you start,\u201d Cassidy protested. She wanted to have him to herself for a little while before he got involved in the whirlwind of work Prince Sadi\u2019s loan was about to create.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here a whole month,\u201d Burle said.</p><p>She recognized the gleam in her father\u2019s eyes. She didn\u2019t know what kind of arrangement Daemon Sadi had made with Burle\u2014and she was certain neither man would tell her the exact terms of that arrangement\u2014but Burle was excited by the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your decision, of course, Lord Burle,\u201d Rainier said with a smile, \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard the High Lord say more than once that a daughter takes priority over any other kind of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver any other kind ofwork , huh?\u201d Burle laughed.</p><p>Rainier indicated the man standing on his left. \u201cLady Cassidy, may I introduce Lord Marcus, Prince Sadi\u2019s man of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you with us,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cI suggest that Gray and Ranon show Marcus and me the buildings for the shops,\u201d Rainier said. \u201cYou can spend some time with your father, and then Lord Burle can look at what needs to be done in the Queen\u2019s Residence and the Healer\u2019s House. Prince Sadi did emphasize that those two places were to be done first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, Cassie and I will have a little visit before we get down to work,\u201d Burle said.</p><p>She waited until the men climbed into the open carriage with Ranon in the driver\u2019s seat. Then she turned to her father. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could come to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my girl. Of course I would help. Besides, training a few youngsters to have a trade, that\u2019s important too, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mother going to come for a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She had some things she wanted to look into first. Then she\u2019ll be along. And your brother\u2019s planning to come and help out for a few days too.\u201d Burle turned, looked at the Residence, and said wistfully, \u201cHate to waste good daylight.\u201d</p><p>Since she felt the same way about gardening as he did about building, she smiled. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s get you settled into one of the guest rooms. We\u2019ll get a quick bite to eat so that we don\u2019t have to fib when we\u2019re asked if we took time for it, and then we can visit while I help you take measurements at the Healer\u2019s House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deal, Kitten. That is a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, I think it would be wiser to do your shopping in another part of the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,la, Kenjim,\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be fussing about this.\u201d Besides, until Theran paid the bills at the few aristo shops she had found in this dung-heap town, the merchants weren\u2019t going to extend any more credit.</p><p>\u201cYour companions have a questionable kind of honor,\u201d Kenjim said.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Kenjim served her, but Garth and Brok werehers. \u201cHowdare you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare because I\u2019m First Circle. Lady, we\u2019re not in Dharo. We aren\u2019t even in our own Realm. This isn\u2019t a friendly place, and those young studs could pull you into the kind of trouble that ends in bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Lower lip trembling, she walked away from him. The fact that he stayed at the carriage instead of accompanying her to the tables of goods told her plainly enough that he wouldn\u2019t serve her one minute past his contract. And that made her angry as well as sad. Kenjim used to think she was a \u201cdelight to the senses.\u201d Now all he did was criticize.</p><p>They called this a craftsmen\u2019s courtyard? Kermilla looked at the half-empty tables and the sullen landen faces. They watched her with a look in their eyes that made her nervous. Maybe Kenjim was right. Maybe this wasn\u2019t a good part of town for her to be in. But giving in now would mean taking orders from a male who was supposed to serve her, and no Queen with any pride would do that.</p><p>She joined Correne, who had been studying a selection of leather belts.</p><p>\u201cThis one would be acceptable,\u201d Correne said. \u201cThe buckle is almost pretty.\u201d</p><p>The leather was lusciously soft and meant to accept the sweet curve of a woman\u2019s hips, and the pewter buckle was in the shape of an arbor and bench, a highly suggestive piece implying the pleasure that could be sampled in a garden\u2014if a woman wore it in the right place.</p><p>\u201cThis is a fine piece, Lady,\u201d the landen said. \u201cThe price is thirty silver marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty!\u201d Correne said. \u201cYou think I would pay alanden thirty silver marks foranything ?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rage flashed in the landen\u2019s face, quickly masked but not quickly enough.</p><p>Brok and Garth stepped up to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to give the Ladies trouble?\u201d Brok snarled.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Kermilla said firmly. \u201cThere is no reason to be uncivil because of a simple misunderstanding.\u201d She looked at the landen and used the same tone that effectively cowed the landens in sheep-shit Woolskin. \u201cI\u2019m sure this man didn\u2019t realize aQueen was interested in the belt, and it is customary that when aQueen expresses interest in an item, it is given to her as agift. \u201d She picked up the belt and handed it to Correne. \u201cTherefore, haggling over the price isn\u2019t necessary. Is it?\u201d</p><p>The landen looked at Brok and Garth. Then he shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not necessary. Please accept this belt as a gift, Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards are coming,\u201d Garth said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice had Kermilla walking back to their carriage. And something in Brok\u2019s voice when he looked at a weaver and said, \u201cTell your little bitch to keep an eye out for us,\u201d made her shiver.</p><p>Then the guards rode up and surrounded them\u2014hard men with honed tempers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Kermilla demanded.</p><p>\u201cThese two Warlords were forbidden to come into the landen part of town,\u201d a guard said. \u201cThe penalty for disobeying the Queen\u2019s command is exile. Or death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kermilla\u2019s heart pounded. How could this man be such a brute? He had no business threatening her boys. None! \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen\u2019s command\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI outrank Cassidy, andI say these men are free to come and go as they please!\u201d</p><p>The guard looked at her, and there was no indication he was going to yield.</p> <p>\u201cYour Jewels may outrank Lady Cassidy\u2019s, butshe rules Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Kermilla snapped. \u201cCome spring,I will be the law here, and I won\u2019t forget who caused trouble for me and mine.\u201d</p><p>A humming, terrible silence.</p><p>\u201cWarlord,\u201d Kenjim said politely as he stepped up to stand at her left. \u201cThe Ladies were not aware of this command when they asked these two Warlords to stand as additional escorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarth and Brok were aware of it,\u201d the guard said. \u201cThey almost blinded a young girl. That\u2019s why they were banned from this part of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Lord Bardoc and I had been aware of this, we would have opposed those Warlords coming with us,\u201d Kenjim said.</p><p>Kenjim\u2019s anger was a scalding heat against her skin. Kermilla took a half step away from him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll escort you all back to the line,\u201d the guard said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll take Garth and Brok back to their father\u2019s house. This will be reported to the Master of the Guard. If he feels that more needs to be done, he\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>If more needs to be done? Kermilla frowned. What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Kenjim said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough?\u201d Kermilla stared at Kenjim in disbelief. Then she glared at the guard. \u201cYou won\u2019t report to anyone. Grayhaven isTheran\u2019s town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, it was still part of Dena Nehele. Prince Grayhaven may rule here, but he still has to answer to the Queen and her court. And that includes Talon, the Master of the Guard.\u201d</p><p>Theran would befurious if Talon came here and started chewing on him over this.</p><p>She offered no other protests as Kenjim and Bardoc helped her and Correne into the carriage.</p><p>*I vanished the belt before the guards arrived,* Correne said once they were all seated.</p><p>As if that was the least bit important right now,Kermilla thought.</p><p>Two of the guards escorted them all the way back to the spot where she had met up with Brok and Garth. Then they rode off with her two boys, leaving her with Bardoc\u2019s discomfort and Kenjim\u2019s simmering anger.</p><p>As soon as they returned to the mansion, Correne scurried to her room and Bardoc made some excuse about needing to talk to Jhorma. Which left her alone with Kenjim, who followed her right into her room.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell are you doing, associating with bastards who would try to blind a child?\u201d Kenjim growled.</p><p>\u201cGarth and Brok are mine.\u201d Kermilla thumped a fist against her chest. \u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried to blind a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stupid landen!\u201d Kermilla shouted. \u201cWho cares about landens?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her before saying quietly, \u201cA Queen with honor.\u201d</p><p>The insult silenced her. She studied his eyes, felt the sharp heat of his temper. She tried a delicate psychic probe to find out what was under the moment\u2019s temper\u2014and found disgust, disappointment, and contempt.</p><p>\u201cIf Garth and Brok belong to you, then I don\u2019t.\u201d Kenjim\u2019s voice was dangerously quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019re playing, claiming that you\u2019re going to be Queen here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIam going to be Queen! Theran promised me!\u201d</p><p>Kenjim let out a huffing laugh that held no humor. \u201cThen he\u2019s as much of a fool as we were.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla walked over to the window and stared at nothing. Bardoc was unhappy about this misunderstanding with those stupid guards who were protecting landens, but she could talk him around. Kenjim, however, was now a danger to her. He wouldn\u2019t be able to turn Theran against her, but his anger could sour the opinion of the Warlord Princes who were coming to meet her. He might even try to ruin her chance of becoming the Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>She turned back to face him. \u201cPack your things. You\u2019re returning to Bhak immediately. I\u2019ll have Gallard assign another in the First Circle to stand escort here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the Lady wishes.\u201d Kenjim\u2019s smile held a sharp, terrible edge. \u201cBefore you, I served an honest\u2014and honorable\u2014Queen for five years. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand the value of negotiating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you try to smear my reputation by distorting what happened today or by misrepresenting this conversation, I will go to Lady Darlena and counter your report with a charge of mistreatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Kermilla paled. As a District Queen, she ruled under the hand of a Province Queen who, in turn, ruled her piece of Dharo under the hand of the Territory Queen. If Kenjim went to Darlena with a charge of mistreatment, more than the Province Queen would be taking a look at her court. And that wouldn\u2019t do at all. Not when spring was so many months away. If Darlena\u2014or even worse, Sabrina\u2014took Kenjim\u2019s side in this and released him from his contract right now, it would break her court, and she wouldn\u2019t have the income from Bhak and Woolskin to support her, as insufficient as it was.</p><p>If she asked Theran to kill Kenjim, would he do it without asking questions?</p><p>No. Not without questions. Even if Theran would do that for her, Jhorma and Bardoc would insist on some justification\u2014and would insist on her leaving Dena Nehele, which would ruin everything.</p><p>Kenjim has already considered that. He knows the knife he\u2019s holding against my throat is sharper than any I can hold against his. I can\u2019t strike against him without hurting myself more.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cWe\u2019ll just say that you\u2019ve completed your rotation as escort and are returning to Bhak to take up other duties on behalf of your Queen. Is that satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,get out. \u201d</p><p>He reached for the door but didn\u2019t open it. When he looked at her, she thought she saw regret, maybe even sorrow, in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo yourself a favor, Kermilla. Cut the acquaintance with those two young Warlords. Stop playing these games. Go back to Bhak and start taking care of what is already yours. If you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t be the only man who walks away from your court.\u201d He opened the door and walked out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t go down to dinner that night, claiming a sick headache. And that wasn\u2019t far from the truth, since she had blurred the afternoon with many generous glasses of brandy.</p><p>Tonight she would brood and sulk and get gloriously drunk. Tomorrow, when those Warlord Princes came to dinner, she needed to shine.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>*Bastard?*</p><p>Daemon opened his eyes, not sure if the call that had broken his sleep had been real or part of a dream.</p><p>*Bastard?*</p><p>Ebon-gray psychic thread. No doubt now that the call was real. *Prick?* He waited. Didn\u2019t get a response. Just a sense of pain running through that psychic thread.*Lucivar?*</p><p>*I need help.*</p><p>Daemon flung the sheet aside and rolled out of bed, startling Jaenelle. *Where are you?*</p><p>*Home.*</p><p>*Are you hurt?*</p><p>*No. Marian . . .* Pain. Grief.</p><p>Mother Night. *I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.*</p><p>He rushed into the adjoining bedroom to dress. Jaenelle rushed in right behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He pulled on trousers and a shirt that he didn\u2019t bother to button. He grabbed a jacket, shoes, and socks, then vanished them. \u201cSomething about Marian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay the Darkness have mercy.\u201d Jaenelle ran back to her bedroom, hollering as she went, \u201cGet one of the Coaches. I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, even considered arguing with her. She was still in the days of her moontime when she couldn\u2019t use more than basic Craft without causing herself excruciating pain. But she was a Healer, the best Healer in the whole damn Realm, and she was Lucivar\u2019s sister and Queen. If Marian needed more help than the Eyrien Healer could provide, Jaenelle would step in, no matter the cost.</p><p>And this time, as long as her own life wasn\u2019t at risk, he wouldn\u2019t try to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you downstairs.\u201d He was out of the room and running through the Hall to reach the outer door closest to the stables and the building that housed the carriages and Coaches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The footmen who were on night duty didn\u2019t call to him, but word must have passed as they figured out his direction because Beale was waiting at the outer door for him.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your haste and the late hour, I assumed the small Coach would be sufficient,\u201d Beale said. \u201cIt\u2019s being brought around to the landing web since that would be more convenient for the Lady.\u201d</p><p>Still panting from the run, Daemon nodded. It seemed Beale was thinking a lot more clearly than he was. \u201cGuess I should have contacted you to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have other things on your mind.\u201d</p><p>He hurried through the corridors, buttoning his shirt as he went, and reached the great hall at the same time Jaenelle came running down the stairs. They raced out the open front door to the Coach on the landing web.</p><p>Holt waited beside the Coach, dressed in nothing but a pair of short trousers. As Jaenelle entered the Coach, a basket suddenly appeared beside the footman. He grabbed it and shoved it into Daemon\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cThe best Mrs. Beale could do in the time,\u201d Holt said.</p><p>Daemon handed the basket to Jaenelle and took the driver\u2019s seat while Holt closed the door and moved away from the landing web.</p> <p>Jaenelle took the seat beside Daemon, still holding the basket. \u201cDid Lucivar say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s scared, he\u2019s grieving, and he\u2019s in pain.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask anything else.</p><p>He raised the Coach off the landing web, caught the Black Wind, and raced to Ebon Rih as fast as the Black could take them.</p><p>\u201cWait until I set this thing down,\u201d Daemon snapped as Jaenelle started to rise from her seat. \u201cIf you fall off the damn mountain, you won\u2019t help any of us.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look that normally produced a cold sweat. He ignored the look, just as he ignored the odd way his hands trembled when he remembered the way Lucivar sounded.</p> <p>Couldn\u2019t think about that. One of them needed to be the warrior who could draw the line and defend it. It didn\u2019t sound like Lucivar was in any shape to defend anything, including himself.</p><p>Especially himself.</p><p>Daemon opened the Coach door, and they both rocked back from the emotions flooding from the eyrie above them.</p><p>\u201cCan you deal with him?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal.\u201d</p><p>She left the Coach and raced up the stairs. He stayed a couple of steps behind her so he wouldn\u2019t trip her. She ran past Lucivar, who was standing in the flagstone courtyard in front of the eyrie\u2014standing so perfectly still, as if even a deep breath might shatter him.</p><p>Daemon approached his brother slowly, cautiously. \u201cLucivar.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar continued to stare straight ahead, but one tear slipped down his face.</p> <p>Daemon did a fast psychic probe of the eyrie and surrounding land. Marian and Nurian, the Eyrien Healer, were inside with Jaenelle. But the other two people he\u2019d expected to find were missing. *Father?* he called on a Black spear thread.</p><p>*Daemonar is with me at the Keep,* Saetan said. *Take care of Lucivar.*</p><p>*Done.* Knowing the boy was safe, he focused once again on his brother. \u201cLucivar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiscarriage.\u201d Lucivar\u2019s voice broke. \u201cWe lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Daemon brushed a finger over Lucivar\u2019s shoulder, an offer of contact with no expectations. A moment later, he was holding on to a sobbing man.</p><p>\u201cIs it my fault, Daemon?\u201d Lucivar asked. \u201cIs it my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Daemon stroked Lucivar\u2019s hair and added another layer to the soothing spells he was wrapping around his brother.</p><p>\u201cSh-she got pregnant during the rut. You know what we\u2019re like during that time.You know. Maybe I damaged her inside. Maybe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Daemon rocked him gently. Rocked and soothed. He had a feeling Saetan was doing much the same thing with a frightened little boy. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let Lucivar say it, wouldn\u2019t let Lucivar keep thinking that. But it was possible, and they both knew it. That was part of the pain. Until Nurian\u2014or more to the point, Jaenelle\u2014said otherwise, it was a possibility.</p><p>The tears finally eased, but Lucivar still clung to him. Since he was facing the eyrie, he saw Jaenelle first.</p><p>\u201cPrick,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lucivar straightened up, wiped his eyes, and turned toward her. Jaenelle studied Lucivar. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been out here grieving, that\u2019s fine. If you\u2019ve been out here blaming yourself, you\u2019re going to piss off your wife as well as your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat . . . ?\u201d Lucivar looked so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing you had done before\u2014or could have done now\u2014to change this,\u201d Jaenelle said gently. \u201cThe babe didn\u2019t form right. It couldn\u2019t survive, so Marian\u2019s body released it. A simple and natural thing, despite how much the heart hurts because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine in every way,\u201d Jaenelle said, still looking at Lucivar. \u201cShe needs to rest for a few days\u2014and she needs to grieve without feeling that you see her grief as a kind of blame. Marian lost a baby tonight. So did you.\u201d She turned her head toward the eyrie. \u201cNurian has everything cleaned up. Go be with your wife, Lucivar. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar hesitated. Then he gently touched Jaenelle\u2019s cheek and went into the eyrie.</p><p>Daemon slipped an arm around her waist. \u201cDid you tell him the truth?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a puzzled look. \u201cWhy would I tell him anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo spare him if he was responsible for the miscarriage.\u201d</p><p>The air around them chilled. \u201cA smart man wouldn\u2019t call a Healer a liar,\u201d she said too softly.</p><p>\u201cA smart man also knows that Healers sometimes lie.\u201d He looked in her eyes and waited.</p><p>\u201cHealers sometimes lie,\u201d Jaenelle acknowledged. \u201cBut not this time. Blaming himself for something that wasn\u2019t his fault and wasn\u2019t anything he could have changed is an indulgence his wife and son can\u2019t afford. Neither can he. If you can\u2019t help him see that, his father will.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. Especially since she sounded absolutely sure of that.</p><p>Nurian walked out of the eyrie, looking tired. \u201cI have a healing brew simmering on the stove. Needs another ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can finish it,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cI took the linens,\u201d Nurian said, lowering her voice. \u201cMarian asked if I could get them cleansed, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle shook her head. \u201cA Black Widow might be able to cleanse the psychic residue out of the cloth enough to be acceptable to Marian, but no one is going to be able to cleanse those linens enough for Lucivar to tolerate. We\u2019ll get them replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that would be the way of it.\u201d Nurian paused. \u201cShould I wake Jillian and send her to the Keep to watch Daemonar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her sleep. It would be better to have her help later in the morning when the High Lord needs to rest. You get some rest too. We\u2019ll be here to look after them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be back in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Spreading her wings, Nurian flew to the eyrie she shared with her younger sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better keep an eye on that brew.\u201d Jaenelle gave Daemon a quick kiss and walked into the eyrie.</p><p>He was still standing outside an hour later when Surreal showed up.</p><p>\u201cI heard, more or less,\u201d she said as she climbed the last stair and joined him in the courtyard. \u201cSo who needs to be babied and who needs to be bullied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething is wrong with Marian. Lucivar is distraught. Daemonar is staying with Uncle Saetan.\u201d Surreal hooked her hair behind one ear. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in trouble, by the way. Mostly forgiven because it was clear you had left your brains somewhere between the bedroom and the landing web and couldn\u2019t be relied on right now.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently there are rules when there is a family crisis. You broke the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of any,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Uncle Saetan is, and after you arrived here, he contacted Beale, and Beale then informed Mrs. Beale of where you were and why. Rainier is on his way, but he has to wait for the first round of food Mrs. Beale has prepared. Chaosti is also on his way, but he\u2019ll stop at the Hall for whatever wasn\u2019t ready when Rainier headed out.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Was any of that supposed to make sense? \u201cSurreal.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t snarl at me. You\u2019re the one who pissed off your cook by not telling her there was a family emergency and asking her to prepare food so none of us needed to think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian lost the baby. No one gives a damn about food right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She looked out over the mountain. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like being jabbed about it, but there were going to be a lot of people coming and going over the next few days to give whatever help they could, and they would need to be fed.</p><p>Surreal drew in a breath and huffed it out. \u201cAll right, then. You and Uncle Saetan can baby Marian until she starts snarling at you, and Jaenelle and I will bully Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Lucivar deserves a little pampering too?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look. \u201cSugar, to an Eyrien male, being bulliedis a kind of pampering. Don\u2019t ask me why, but sometimes nothing says \u2018I love you\u2019 to a male better than getting a whack upside the head.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the eyrie, leaving him out there to ponder the perversity of his own gender and the mystery of hers.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>After renting a horse at Grayhaven\u2019s Coaching station, Ranon headed for the parts of the town where he\u2019d spent some time. He didn\u2019t want to be here, didn\u2019t want to be wasting a day pursuing something Shira couldn\u2019t explain. But she\u2019d gone all hissy cat on him last night and insisted that he come to Grayhaventoday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That wasn\u2019t fair,Ranon scolded himself as he rode through the streets and felt a grim uneasiness settling over him. Saying she had been a \u201chissy cat\u201d diminished the power of the feelings Shira had last night. And remembering the tightness in her face, the worry in her eyes . . . Something was pushing her to push at him, but this time her tangled web only gave her a sense ofwhen something was coming and notwhat was coming.</p><p>Now that he was here, he wished he\u2019d asked Archerr or Shaddo to come with him.</p><p>This town didn\u2019t feel right anymore. Or more to the point, it was starting to feel the way the towns and villages had felt for the past several generations: discouraged, resigned, wary. Angry. He rode through the shopping district and had the odd sense that shopkeepers were letting their windows stay dirty and weren\u2019t bothering to sweep the walks as a deliberate way to discourage the interest of some customers.</p> <p>Like aristos. Or Queens.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to go up to the mansion, Shira had said.Just go to the places in town where we\u2019d shopped or visited. Then listen to your heart.</p><p>He could have used something less cryptic. Then again, maybe the messages were here. The women who sold them plants when Gray was working on the gardens at the mansion asked him if the Rose Queen was coming back to Grayhaven. Some of the shopkeepers came out of their stores to ask if the court was returning. He heard the hope in their voices when they asked, and he saw the dull acceptance in their eyes when he told them Cassidy and her court were remaining in Eyota.</p><p>He stopped at a tavern for a short glass of ale. It was late morning, too early for a drink as far as he was concerned, but he\u2019d gone in because you could usually get a feel for what the men were thinking\u2014and there were too many men there for the time of day. That in itself was not a good sign.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Theran seeing any of this? The man was supposed to be ruling this town. Why wasn\u2019t he heeding warnings that were so clear? Grayhaven was the capital of Dena Nehele. When Cassidy left a few weeks ago, there were signs of people shaking off the years of war and the decades of abuse at the hands of twisted Queens. Now shops that had been open were closed, empty. Now people hurried along the walks with the same hunched wariness that had been typical of the people everywhere in Dena Nehele.</p> <p>What was Theran doing that people were reacting this way? Ranon didn\u2019t like him, but that was a clash of personalities. It didn\u2019t mean Theran wasn\u2019t a good man or a good Warlord Prince. So why wasn\u2019t hedoing something to fix whatever this was?</p><p>Ranon continued riding through the streets, becoming more and more edgy. Enemy camp. Enemy ground. His instincts shouldn\u2019t be telling him those things, but he could feel himself preparing for a fight.</p><p>When he reached the guardhouse that marked the line that separated the landen part of town from the Blood, he hesitated for a long moment before he urged his horse forward and continued down the street.</p><p>There was an ugly feeling here. As he rode toward the craftsmen\u2019s courtyard, he created a skintight Opal shield around himself. Where were the craftsmen? Where was the merchandise?</p><p>He looked over at the area that had been occupied by the weaver family and saw James Weaver step toward him, looking grim, angry, and battle-hard.</p><p>\u201cPrince,\u201d James said, \u201cI would speak to you.\u201d He caught himself, as if just realizing he\u2019d issued a kind of challenge. Then he added, \u201cIf you will permit it.\u201d</p> <p>Ranon stared at the man, assessing the temper he saw in those eyes. He and Shira had come here often while Shira was healing JuliDee\u2019s face and checking the eye that had almost been lost because of two Warlord pricks. Those sessions, and his and Shira\u2019s presence among these people, had become cordial enough that Shira would have a cup of tea with the wife and daughter while James shared a glass of ale with him.</p><p>So what would putthat look in a man\u2019s eyes? Why would there be so much tension just because one of the Blood rode by?</p><p>The answer came to him. He was off his horse and grabbing James\u2019s arms so fast the other man didn\u2019t have time to react.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with your family? Is that why they aren\u2019t with you? Your wife? Has something happened to your daughter, your son?\u201d</p><p>James relaxed. \u201cThey\u2019re all well, Prince. I thank you for asking.\u201d Then he looked uneasy, so when he stepped back, Ranon let him go. \u201cThe Rose Queen stood up for us landens, and your Lady healed my little girl. You helped me and mine, so I thought . . . fair warning, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair warning about what?\u201d Ranon felt a chill settle in his gut.</p><p>\u201cWhen Prince Grayhaven\u2019s bitch takes control of Dena Nehele, there\u2019s going to be another uprising. And this time it won\u2019t end until all of us are dead\u2014or all of you.\u201d</p><p>Ranon stared at James, shocked speechless. Then he shook his head. \u201cCassidy\u2019s court stands. She rules everything but this town, which is under Prince Grayhaven\u2019s control. Kermilla isn\u2019t going to rule Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe says she is.\u201d</p><p>No.It wasn\u2019t just that he wanted Cassie to rule; the thought of Kermilla ruling filled him with dread.</p><p>\u201cThing is,\u201d James said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of destroying, tired of fighting and killing. But if it has to be done again, I\u2019d rather fightfor something than against something.\u201d</p><p>A plea in those eyes. Messages under the spoken words.</p><p>And suddenly Ranon remembered what Jaenelle had said to him:People looked beyond themselves and made room for you. Remember that, Prince.</p><p>Before he could work out what he wanted to ask James, a handful of guards rode up.</p><p>Ranon turned and put up an Opal shield behind him, protecting the landen since the hostility in the guards\u2019 psychic scents was sufficient warning that he\u2019d walked into some kind of trouble.</p><p>The senior guard, Lord Rogir, stared at him for a moment\u2014and the Warlord\u2019s aggression faded with recognition. \u201cPrince Ranon?\u201d</p><p>Ranon nodded, noting the way the other guards had fanned out. Two were keeping an eye on the landens; the others were watching him.</p><p>\u201cPrince, if I could have a few minutes of your time?\u201d Rogir asked.</p><p>Taking a careful measure of the tempers around him, Ranon dropped the Opal shield behind him and turned to James. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d Then he strode far enough away to be out of earshot.</p><p>Lord Rogir dismounted and followed him.</p><p>\u201cIs the Rose Queen coming back to Grayhaven?\u201d Rogir asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cShe\u2019s settled in Eyota. So is the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Lady Cassidy leaving in the spring? Is it true the other Dharo Queen is going to rule Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all seem to know something more than Cassidy\u2019s court knows,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cLady Kermilla can fart words all she wants. Doesn\u2019t change who is ruling Dena Nehele now\u2014or who is going to continue to rule. The court stands. If the Queen is challenged, we\u2019ll fight.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really his place to make such a statement without more of the First Circle present, but he was sure of the truth of it.</p><p>Rogir glanced at James Weaver. \u201cCan you do anything for them? This town isn\u2019t safe for that family anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether she rules officially or not, Theran Grayhaven has given this town over to the other Queen. She says she outranks the Rose Queen and can countermand any orders we\u2019ve been given.\u201d Fury swept over Rogir\u2019s face. \u201cShe brought those two Warlords, Garth and Brok, into this part of town a few days ago\u2014and she made the kind of warning threats we\u2019ve all heard before about what will happen to anyone who opposes her now. Since then, my men and I have kept a close watch on this courtyard. Those Warlords came back this morning, and they were looking for Weaver\u2019s little girl. They blame her for the punishment they damn well deserved. If they get their hands on her this time, they\u2019ll do a lot worse than throw horse shit and stones.\u201d</p><p>Ranon felt sick, cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a wife and a daughter about the same age as his.\u201d Rogir tipped his head toward James. \u201cI\u2019ve kept an eye on these folks because of that. Gotten to know them. Blood and landen . . . We may be from the same race, but we\u2019re not the same. We\u2019ll never be the same, so we don\u2019t fit together easy. But a father is a father, and I think about the fear that would be eating my gut if two Warlords hadthat look in their eyes when they asked aboutmy little girl.\u201d</p><p>Easy enough to guess where this conversation was heading, but the words had to be said. So Ranon waited.</p><p>Rogir cleared his throat. \u201cThose landens need to get out of Grayhaven. And I want my family out of here. The guards who have been riding with me to protect the landens and have followed the Queen\u2019s command? They want to get out too. Especially the one who is newly married and hoped for a better life than he or his wife had known before.\u201d</p><p>People looked beyond themselves and made room for you. Remember that, Prince.\u201cI can\u2019t make any promises before discussing this with the Queen,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Listen to your heart.\u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here after dark, and one way or another, we\u2019ll figure out how to get your family out of this town. The other guards as well.\u201d He glanced at James Weaver. \u201cAnd them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a sister . . .\u201d Rogir trailed off.</p><p>\u201cHave a list ready for me.\u201d Ranon hesitated, but it had to be said because it could make a difference between someone choosing to go or stay. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably end up living in the same village as the court. That means living in a Shalador reserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the others know, but if the court is there and your people are willing to have us, I don\u2019t think anyone who wants to leave is going to care about those kinds of boundaries.\u201d</p><p>Ranon nodded and returned to James. \u201cHow many of you want to get out?\u201d</p><p>James looked at him as if not quite daring to believe the question. A glance at the other craftsmen, who nodded. \u201cSeveral families. All have skilled craftsmen who aren\u2019t afraid to work hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That would please Burle,Ranon thought. Cassie\u2019s father wasn\u2019t afraid of working hard either and required the same commitment from anyone who was going to work for him.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has sheep.\u201d James sounded cautiously hopeful. \u201cThey give a fine wool that my wife spins for our weaving. And Tanner\u2019s cousin has cattle for meat and leather. I know a dairyman too. Maybe . . . maybe a dozen families in all.\u201d He looked sad. \u201cToo many here think the past will be our future. They\u2019ve given up hope. They\u2019ll stay here to fight or die. Some of us would like more for our families.\u201d</p><p>Ranon signaled for Rogir to join them. Looking at Rogir, he tipped his head toward James. \u201cCan your family shelter his tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can,\u201d Rogir replied without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you will end up, and I don\u2019t know what I can offer beyond the promise that I\u2019ll help you get out of this town,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the men I know want to get out,\u201d Rogir said. \u201cTell them to pack up what they don\u2019t want to leave behind.\u201d</p><p>James made a gesture that took in himself and the other craftsmen who were watching them so intently. \u201cWe were relocated here after the uprisings. We were allowed only what could fit in one wagon. Everything we have can still fit in that wagon.\u201d</p><p>Ranon looked at the two men. They had stood on opposite sides during the uprisings. Now they stood together as fathers and husbands\u2014and men who, if they had to fight again, wanted to fightfor something instead of against something.</p> <p>\u201cStart packing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet back here during the aristo dinner hour.\u201d Less chance of running into Theran or Kermilla at that time. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the Queen\u2019s decision then.\u201d</p><p>Mounting his horse, he rode back through town and found himself passing one of the shops that held the kind of merchandise only an aristo could afford. He stopped, dismounted, and went in, not sure what he was doing there.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Heknew what he was doing there: looking for something to sweeten the half-promises he\u2019d made on his Queen\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cMay I assist you?\u201d the merchant asked.</p><p>Sweets. Cassie had dipped into the loan Sadi had given the court and given her First Circle half what was due them from the coming tithe, so he had a few marks he could spend.</p><p>\u201cChocolates,\u201d he said. \u201cA small treat for the Ladies.\u201d He emphasized small because the stuff was wickedly expensive.</p> <p>The merchant studied him. \u201cYou serve Lady Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Ranon felt his body tighten, but he wasn\u2019t sure why since the man had made no hostile move. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard she is now living in a village in the eastern Shalador reserve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she intending to stay there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>A hesitation. \u201cWould there be room in that village for another shop?\u201d Ranon blinked.Another one looking to run? He looked around the shop. \u201cThe Shalador people couldn\u2019t afford your fine merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can adapt and sell what people need.\u201d</p> <p>There weren\u2019t any shops like this one in Eyota, but there were going to be the shops owned by Sadi. \u201cThe Warlord Prince of Dhemlan now owns a few shops in the village. His man of business is talking to anyone interested in managing those shops. Lord Marcus will be in Eyota for a couple more days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the information.\u201d</p><p>As the merchant went behind the counter, Ranon spotted the small boxes of chocolates. He winced at the price, but he chose the box that held a dozen pieces\u2014three each for Cassidy, her mother Devra, Shira, and Reyhana.</p><p>He set the box on the counter. The merchant looked at the box, then reached under the counter, set a box twice that size beside the one Ranon chose, and vanished the smaller box.</p><p>\u201cThe one you chose is stale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you this one for the same price.\u201d</p><p>Ranon frowned. \u201cWhy would you leave out stale sweets?\u201d</p><p>The merchant smiled wearily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sting as much when they are stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you reported this theft?\u201d Ranon asked. \u201cWho has been stealing from you?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s silence was the answer.</p><p>Ranon paid for the chocolates, then vanished the box and headed for the door. He wanted to get away from here. He wanted to behome.</p><p>But he hesitated at the door and turned to look at the merchant. \u201cIf you come to Eyota, tell Lord Marcus I suggested he talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Prince.\u201d</p><p>As he rode back to the Coaching station to return the horse, he kept his eyes on the street, aware of how many people noticed him and half raised a hand to catch his attention. He\u2019d had enough for one day\u2014too much for one day\u2014so he pretended he didn\u2019t see them.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t ignore the four Warlord Princes who walked out of the Coaching station just as he rode up.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t ridden with any of them during the uprisings, and didn\u2019t know any of them as friends. But when there were only a hundred of your caste left to defend your land, you knew the names and faces\u2014and reputations\u2014of those men.</p><p>\u201cRanon,\u201d Ferall said, sounding cordial\u2014and surprised. Since Ferall\u2019s Opal Jewel outranked the other three, he stood as their leader while they were together.</p><p>\u201cFerall,\u201d Ranon said. Then he nodded to the other men. \u201cGentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were up to the mansion?\u201d Ferall asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHad some personal business in the town. I offered to pick up a couple of things for the Ladies that weren\u2019t available in Eyota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some personal business here ourselves,\u201d Ferall said.</p><p>Like a meeting with Theran?But it wasn\u2019t a question to ask, because silence was being offered. They wouldn\u2019t mention his presence in the town to Theran and he wouldn\u2019t mention them to the court by name.</p><p>He nodded and led the horse to the stables. Then he caught the Opal Wind and headed back to Eyota.</p><p>He\u2019s dancing on the knife\u2019s edge,Cassidy thought as she listened to Ranon\u2019s too carefully thought-out report. He was skilled enough at offering this kind of information that she couldn\u2019t tell what he was withholding, only that he wasn\u2019t telling her everything.</p><p>She glanced at her Master of the Guard. Whatever reason Ranon had for tempering his words now, he was going to tell Talon everything.</p><p>Easy enough to guess though. He\u2019d been in Grayhaven. If he\u2019d had a meeting with Theran\u2014or Kermilla\u2014he wouldn\u2019t want her to know. Then again, Shira had said thatshe had sent Ranon to Grayhaven because of a vision.</p><p>Did the reason really matter? Cassidy wondered. Did whatever Ranon was hiding matter? There were people who wanted to leave Grayhaven and begin a new life, and had asked a member of her First Circle for help. She had the uneasy feeling that some of those people might not haveany life if she didn\u2019t support the tentative offers Ranon had made on behalf of Queen and court.</p><p>And in truth, he had acted as a Warlord Prince in Kaeleer would have acted. He had acted because he believed in her and the Old Ways her presence was bringing back to the Blood in Dena Nehele.</p><p>When Ranon finished his report, a heavy silence filled the room as all the First Circle who had returned from their duties in time for this meeting waited for her response.</p><p>She stood up and walked over to Ranon, who tensed but showed no other sign of nerves.</p><p>\u201cSince the day I met you, you have championed the Shalador people, argued so their concerns wouldn\u2019t be ignored. Today you are standing for a people who are not your own but needed someone to speak for them. By doing so, you honor the justice I want for all the people of Dena Nehele. I\u2019m so proud of you and\u2014\u201d Her throat suddenly closed. Tears filled her eyes and spilled over. She swallowed hard, put a hand on her chest, and said, \u201cMy heart is too full for words.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she was in his arms, being hugged breathless. Then he released her and stepped back.</p><p>Wiping tears off her cheeks, Cassidy looked at Gray and Powell. \u201cWe need to consider land and buildings. Any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the merchant is willing to be a manager rather than own a shop, I think he\u2019ll be a good choice for one of Prince Sadi\u2019s shops,\u201d Powell said. \u201cHowever, I suggest that a condition of his managing a shop in this village is that he hire one or two Shaladorans who want to learn the merchant trade and teach them the skills needed to run their own shops one day.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s smile widened until her muscles ached. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards who have families may want to look at the available cottages within the Queen\u2019s square,\u201d Archerr said. \u201cFrom a tactical point of view, having more trained fighters within that ground is better for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cSo we should pick a couple of cottages?\u201d Powell asked.</p><p>\u201cYou will not,\u201d Cassidy and Shira said.</p><p>Powell blinked.</p><p>\u201cThe women will choose their own homes,\u201d Cassidy said firmly.</p><p>Powell blinked again, apparently not sure if there was any safe ground at the moment. \u201cVery well. We will charge rent?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy started to deny it, but Ranon said, \u201cThat\u2019s fair. The village is giving the land and buildings to the court to do with as you please. That doesn\u2019t mean letting anyone beyond the First Circle live here free. Cassie, if you don\u2019t want to keep the rent as income for yourself or the court, it could go back into the village treasury. Or you can offer the cottages as part of the wages the guards receive from the village treasury or the tithes.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy chewed on her lower lip. Too much to think about.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we work out those kinds of details later?\u201d Powell suggested.</p><p>Gray looked up from a rough sketch of the village and the available buildings. \u201cRanon, what\u2019s this place beyond the village?\u201d</p><p>Ranon braced his hands on the table and leaned to see the sketch better. \u201cUsed to be a kind of tradesman\u2019s school. I think. My grandfather might remember when it was last inhabited.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould it work for craftsmen?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cIt looks like a walled community that has a considerable bit of open land attached to it. And it\u2019s a couple of miles beyond the rest of the village.\u201d</p><p>Ranon nodded. \u201cIt was far enough out to be vulnerable to attack. I think that\u2019s why it was abandoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about attacks now,\u201d Gray said. \u201cHow about offering this place to the landens?\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy saw something flicker in Ranon\u2019s eyes when Gray said they didn\u2019t have to worry about attacks. \u201cYou think the landens would be at risk if they lived so close to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon said quickly. \u201cIn fact, this might be a fair compromise. They\u2019ll have a place that is their own, but it\u2019s close enough for them to come into the village for market day and other supplies. There\u2019s enough land attached to the place for them to graze their livestock as well as grow some crops beyond kitchen gardens. Only one big barn, but it was built to hold all the animals in the community, so it might do for them for this year at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re agreed on what we can offer?\u201d Cassidy asked, looking at her First Circle and waiting for their nods of agreement. \u201cIn that case, Ranon, go back and talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll draft letters of passage,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat way if the landens are stopped along the way, the Blood will know they\u2019re traveling at the Queen\u2019s command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Talon said. \u201cRanon, see if the guards who don\u2019t have families to settle would be willing to ride escort for the landens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cGray, get a couple of horses saddled,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI want to take a look at these places, and I want you to come with me since you\u2019ve been looking at these buildings more than the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Gray vanished the sketch, gave Cassidy a smile, and left the room.</p><p>\u201cI think that will be all, gentlemen,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIf you would come to my office, we\u2019ll discuss tomorrow\u2019s duties.\u201d</p><p>Powell had a knack for being a Steward, Cassidy thought as the men except Ranon and Talon left the room.</p><p>\u201cCassidy, Reyhana, and I have drum practice tonight, so I think Maydra prepared a stew for dinner,\u201d Shira said, looking at Ranon. \u201cI\u2019ll see if it\u2019s ready so you can have a quick meal before you head back out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore you go,\u201d Ranon said. He called in a box, set it on the table, and nudged it toward Cassidy. \u201cI picked up some chocolates for you Ladies.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy stared at the box, then let out a whoop of laughter. \u201cYou reallywere nervous about this report, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Looking completely baffled, Ranon said, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw a box of chocolates this size was when my father had done something to piss off my mother and was trying to work his way back to the sweeter side of her temper.\u201d Cassidy looked at Ranon more closely. Hell\u2019s fire. The man wasblushing.</p><p>*You hit the target dead center that time,* Shira said on a distaff thread. She hurried out of the room.</p><p>Ranon was strong, brave, as arrogant as any other Warlord Prince, and wouldn\u2019t back down from a fight. But he had shy spots when it came to living with women, and he wasn\u2019t always sure of how he should behave.</p><p>Then again, maybe he did understand how some things balanced other things.</p><p>She picked up the box, thanked him, and left the room.</p> <p>Shira was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is in proportion?\u201d Cassidy asked, lifting the box.</p><p>Shira frowned at the box. \u201cIn proportion to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo whatever Ranon thought would hurt so much that I would need this much consolation.\u201d</p><p>Talon used Craft to close the door. Then he put an aural shield around the room and a Sapphire lock on the door. The last wasn\u2019t to keep Ranon in as much as to keep everyone else out.</p><p>He studied the Shaladoran\u2019s back. Stiff. Tense. Waiting for the Master of the Guard to make the first move.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you wouldn\u2019t tell her,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Ranon turned around.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. How had the man managed to hidethat much anger?</p><p>\u201cTheran has given his . . .Lady . . . free run of the town. The Warlord brothers who hurt the landen girl?She brought them with her to the landen part of town\u2014and then threatened the guards when they stood by our Queen\u2019s command. I gather she\u2019s been stealing from some of the merchants. And she has the expectation that, come spring, Cassidy is going to be gone andshe is going to be the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d Ranon\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cAnd sincethat expectation was the reason Cassie ran in the first place, I wasnot going to tell her about the rumors.\u201d</p><p>Talon frowned. Landens, guards, and merchants were all looking to leave the town? To him that added up to more than rumors. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met four Warlord Princes who were just coming into town as I was leaving. I think all four of them come from the Heartsblood River Province.\u201d</p><p>Recruiting, Talon thought bitterly. Trying to woo enough Warlord Princes to support Kermilla and form a court in the spring that would be strong enough to challenge Cassidy\u2019s\u2014and break Cassidy\u2019s court in the process.</p><p>But he\u2019d known when they left Grayhaven that Theran wanted Kermilla to rule and Cassidy\u2019s court would break when Cassidy\u2019s First Escort, the man who had brought her to this land in the first place, walked away. And the reason he said nothing then was the same reason he would say nothing now: Gray.</p><p>The man Gray was becoming might be able to serve in a court, or at least fill an empty space and keepthis court intact. He wanted to give the boy as much time to season as possible before that decision had to be faced.</p><p>\u201cYou hear anything else, I want to know,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the Steward is aware that we may be looking at a fight come spring. But it doesn\u2019t go further than the three of us. You understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I do,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cGet some food and head out,\u201d Talon said. \u201cTake Burne and Haele with you. And take the biggest Coach you can handle from the Coaching station here.\u201d</p><p>Ranon paled. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a fast retreat. Take the most vulnerable and run. Leave the stronger to pack up what can be saved before the enemy takes notice. You can\u2019t believe Theran would attack women and children, landen or otherwise. Youcan\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe it possible of the boy he\u2019d raised, but he wasn\u2019t so sure of the man anymore. With Kermilla holding the leash, he wasn\u2019t sure what Theran would do.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you seen someone poised to run who didn\u2019t survive long enough to find safe ground?\u201d Talon asked. Ranon paled even more, which told him the man had seen firsthand what had happened to some of those people. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you stuff them into a Coach and move them on the Winds or have them on the road in wagons, but you get those people out of Grayhaven tonight.\u201d</p><p>Talon released the Sapphire lock and dropped the aural shield.</p><p>Looking dazed, Ranon walked out of the room.</p><p>Talon sank in a chair and rubbed his maimed left hand over his face.</p><p>So Theran was recruiting. And either Kermilla was making an ambitious assumption because she was living in Theran\u2019s house\u2014and sharing his bed?\u2014or he had told her he was going to try to make her the Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>Damn young fool. With Cassidy, they had a real chance to bring Dena Nehele back to what it had been. If Theran let a pretty face dazzle him stupid, he could ruin this for all of them.</p><p>Before that happened, he, Talon, who had been Jared and Lia\u2019s friend, would spill whatever blood needed to be spilled. Even if he had to tear his own heart out in the process.</p><p>I still think he\u2019s a good man, but he\u2019s not a good leader. He\u2019s proving that every time he doesn\u2019t stand against Kermilla and defend his people. So I promise you this, Lia. I won\u2019t let your bloodline destroy your people, no matter the price.</p><p>Having made that promise, he rose and went out to the stables to join Gray.</p><p>Theran leaned back to let the servant he\u2019d hired for a thief\u2019s wage remove his plate.</p><p>The dinner wasn\u2019t going well. That wasn\u2019t Kermilla\u2019s fault. She was doing her best to entertain these men, but he should have realized Warlord Princes who had spent most of their lives being both predator and prey in the ongoing fight to protect what they could of Dena Nehele wouldn\u2019t have much interest in the conversation of a twenty-one-year-old woman they couldn\u2019t bed.</p><p>They were polite. He couldn\u2019t fault them for their manners. They even extended the courtesy of showing interest they clearly didn\u2019t feel. At least, it was clear to him.</p><p>They were also getting pissed off at Correne\u2019s catty remarks. The girl wasn\u2019t liked in her own village. In fact, she was one of the young Queens the Warlord Princes were vehemently opposed to seeing rule even the smallest village. That she seemed to be trying to compete with Kermilla for the men\u2019s attention\u2014and the fact that Kermilla was taking the bait and blatantly flirting\u2014wasn\u2019t lost on these men.</p><p>\u201cKermilla has been helping the Queens in the northern Provinces re-learn the aspect of their power that nourishes the land and benefits the harvest,\u201d Theran said, laying his hand lightly on Kermilla\u2019s wrist.</p><p>She gave him an arch look, and for a moment he thought she might say something imprudent. Then she slipped her wrist out from under his hand and smiled at Ferall.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI was shocked to learn that my Sisters had forgotten such a basic part of what makes a Queen a Queen.\u201d</p><p>The skin around Ferall\u2019s eyes tightened.</p><p>Kermilla added hastily, \u201cSo I was, naturally, pleased to be of some small service to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t set up a court yet?\u201d Ferall asked.</p><p>\u201cSilly man, of course I have a court.\u201d Kermilla gave Ferall a dazzling smile. \u201cI rule a Blood village and a landen village in Dharo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo who has been taking care of the Queen\u2019s duties there while you\u2019ve been visiting Theran here?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed through Theran. Had Kermilla heard the criticism in that question?</p><p>Kermilla put aside the flirtatious playfulness as easily as she might put aside a shawl. She gave Ferall a look at the Queen beneath the young-woman banter. \u201cDharo is an old Territory with a strong web of Queens. The village I rule can be run very well by my Steward and Master of the Guard for the time being. I am kept apprised of what is happening there and would return home in an instant if I was urgently needed.\u201d She placed her hand on Theran\u2019s arm. \u201cI am not negligent in my duties, Prince Ferall, which is what you are implying. But a village that is well established requires little supervision from its Queen, so I offered to stay and give Theran whatever assistance I can in repairing the damage that has been done to his people.\u201d</p> <p>Her speech warmed Theran\u2019s heart, but Ferall seemed less impressed. He gave Theran a hard look and said, \u201cI thought that\u2019s why Lady Cassidy came here. I thought that\u2019s why we all agreed to have her as the Queen. And she didn\u2019t leave the people she\u2019d promised to rule in order to \u2018give assistance.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Where was that anger coming from? Theran wondered. Nothing Kermilla said should have offended Ferall that much. Unless he wanted to be offended for some reason?</p><p>Kermilla, however, felt the punch in Ferall\u2019s words. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t leave her people,\u201d she snapped. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any. She wasn\u2019t Queen enough to hold on to her court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla,\u201d Theran said in soft warning, touching her wrist again.</p><p>Kermilla pulled away from him. \u201cAnd where is Cassidy now? Here in the capital city? No. She\u2019s in some cow-dung village that belongs to a people the rest of you would rather pretend don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold your tongue, girl,\u201d Ferall snarled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know us. Any of us. Especially the Shaladorans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Cassidy is a country girl from a trademan\u2019s family who can\u2019t talk about anything except livestock and crops and wouldn\u2019t know how to sit at a table with a true aristo if all your lives depended on it.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s heart jumped in his throat. Thank the Darkness these men didn\u2019t know about Cassidy\u2019s connection to Sadi and his wife. Those two were as aristo as you could get.</p><p>\u201cHer manners are as rough as her face, and neither is fit for polite company,\u201d Kermilla finished, her chest rising and falling impressively as she sucked in air.</p><p>Correne snickered. \u201cBack in her old village, they called Freckledy the \u2018spotted draft horse of Queens.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A tense silence shrouded the table for a long, long moment.</p> <p>Then Ferall looked Theran in the eyes and pushed back his chair. \u201cWe\u2019re done here. There\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d</p><p>Ferall walked out of the room, followed by the other three Warlord Princes.</p><p>Stunned, Theran didn\u2019t move for several heartbeats. Then he ran after them and caught them at the front door.</p><p>\u201cFerall, wait.\u201d He grabbed the other man\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d Ferall pulled out of Theran\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s young and high-spirited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo young,\u201d Ferall said. \u201cShe should have slapped that little bitch down for insulting the Queen like that. And if people in her old villagedid say that about Cassidy, who told Correne about it so that it could be slung around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably one of Kermilla\u2019s escorts,\u201d Theran snapped. \u201cThey\u2019re here too, and they come from Dharo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA court takes its temper from its Queen,\u201d Ferall said. \u201cAnd what was at that table tonight is not something I want ruling my village. Good night, Theran.\u201d</p><p>He let them walk away. There was nothing else he could do.</p><p>No, he thought as he closed the door, therewas something he could do. But he would wait until Kermilla retired for the evening. Maybe he\u2019d even wait until tomorrow when things settled down a little more.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Ranon thought when he led the horse out of the Coaching station stables and ran into Ferall and the other three Warlord Princes. Could his timing be any worse today?</p><p>\u201cFerall,\u201d he said, then nodded to the other men.</p><p>\u201cMore personal business?\u201d Ferall asked.</p><p>Ranon shook his head. \u201cQueen\u2019s business in the town.\u201d Meaning, it wasn\u2019t the business of anyone who lived in the mansion.</p><p>Ferall hesitated. Actually looked uncomfortable. \u201cDoes the Queen have any objections to visitors in her home village?\u201d</p><p>What an odd question. \u201cNo objections at all,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if the four of us came by a week from today to take a look around?\u201d</p><p>Something was going on. Too bad he didn\u2019t know what it was\u2014and couldn\u2019t afford to care. Not tonight. \u201cI can\u2019t promise Lady Cassidy will be available, but I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m there. Why don\u2019t you come by in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that. Good evening to you, Ranon.\u201d</p><p>The other Warlord Princes followed Ferall into the Coaching station. Wasn\u2019t any reason for them to hire a Coach to ride the Winds back to their homes\u2014unless they wanted that time to talk among themselves before going their separate ways.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a worry for another day,\u201d Ranon muttered as he mounted the horse. Good thing they hadn\u2019t seen him leaving the Coach he\u2019d brought. There would have been questions about that\u2014and about Burne and Haele being with him if they\u2019d been spotted by the other men.</p><p>He kept the horse at a walk, waiting for his Brothers in the court to catch up. When they did, the first thing Haele said was, \u201cWhat was Ferall doing in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot our business,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cYou know better,\u201d Burne said. \u201cFerall is a savage fighter, even beyond what you\u2019d expect from the Opal. And it\u2019s said he\u2019s the eyes and ears of a half dozen Queens in the Province where he lives.\u201d</p><p>Like me,Ranon thought. The Shalador Queens hadn\u2019t left the reserves for a few generations. That had kept at least some of them safe from the twisted Queens. But that didn\u2019t mean they hadn\u2019t been aware of what was happening in the rest of Dena Nehele, because there had always been men who reported back to them.</p><p>And some of those men had paid for being a Queen\u2019s eyes and ears by losing their eyes and ears\u2014and tongue.</p><p>Ranon said, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a better idea of what Ferall was doing here today when he comes to visit us in a week.\u201d</p><p>Haele swore softly. They respected Ferall as a man, but hewas a savage fighter. The thought of Ferall being in their village for any reason that wasn\u2019t peaceful was a reason to sweat.</p><p>Don\u2019t borrow trouble,Ranon thought.We\u2019ve already got plenty.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak again until they reached the craftsmen\u2019s courtyard and found it empty.</p><p>\u201cAre we ahead of time?\u201d Burne asked as he scanned the surrounding buildings and the street.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cAnd if we were late, someone would have waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they decided not to come,\u201d Haele said.</p><p>Not likely.</p><p>Lord Rogir rode up a minute later.</p><p>\u201cThose Warlord pricks found out where Weaver\u2019s family lived. They tried to force their way in. My wife and daughter were there. I figured if we worked in teams and used some Craft we could get the households packed up faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everyone all right?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Rogir nodded. \u201cMy wife threw shields around the room where the females were and held on long enough for me and two other guards to arrive. We forced Garth and Brok to leave, but they\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t matter,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeaver\u2019s wife and daughter are with mine at our house. Weaver and his son took off with their wagon, heading on the south road. They\u2019ll reach his brother\u2019s place by morning. I sent one of my men with them. Tanner almost has his family and tools packed up. His wife is also with mine. He and his sons are taking the wagon and heading out to his cousin\u2019s place. Potter and two other families are still packing up. They\u2019ve agreed to go to the Dairyman\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>The guard nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t think the other landens around here believed any good would come of it, so they\u2019re not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Ranon called in the letters of passage. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get one of these to Weaver and make sure the other two parties have one, as well as a guard riding as escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need you to come with us to represent your men.\u201d</p><p>Some nerves now, but Rogir nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Coach at the station. We\u2019ll take the women and children and as much of the household goods as we can pack into the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate it. We\u2019ve all used Craft to vanish things and store them, but that takes power, and we\u2019re all holding more than is comfortable.\u201d</p><p>And compromising their ability to fight by draining the reserves in the Jewels that way.</p><p>\u201cThe men at the Coaching station said they have a Coach and driver we can use if we\u2019re relocating folks,\u201d Haele said. \u201cI did tell them some of those people would be landens, and he said as a courtesy to the Queen, he\u2019d charge the same price for each passenger.\u201d</p><p>Another message, Ranon thought. Landens weren\u2019t forbidden from buying passage on the Coaches that could ride the Winds, but they were usually charged double\u2014sometimes triple\u2014what any of the Blood would pay, so most couldn\u2019t afford the luxury of speed.</p><p>A feeling crawled just under his skin, scratching at him. He used to feel like this when he was trying to finish an assignment and get out before a Queen\u2019s guards arrived.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this and get out of here,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t the only one who had that feeling because they all settled into their tasks with grim efficiency, and by the quiet hours of deep night, they were all out of Grayhaven and traveling, by one means or another, to Eyota. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Two days after that disastrous dinner party, Theran went into the Steward\u2019s office, sat behind the desk, and pressed his hands against his forehead. The damn headache had teeth, and it wasn\u2019t going to let him have the hour of peace he needed before he had to face the rest of a miserable day.</p> <p>Then he noticed the neat stack of papers placed in the center of the desk and swore as he read the first merchant\u2019s bill. The swearing, and the headache, increased in intensity as he looked through the rest of the stack and realized what they were.</p><p>\u201cHow in the name of Hell could she spend this much?\u201d he muttered. Yes, he\u2019d offered to pay for the expenses Kermilla would have because she was staying here, but obviously he hadn\u2019t been explicit enough about how much she could spend.</p><p>Feeling sick, he added up the bills three times, hoping he\u2019d find some mistake that would reduce the total.</p><p>No mistake. He vanished all the bills and pushed away from the desk. He had to talk to the merchantsnow. And he\u2019d have to pay the price of Kermilla\u2019s misunderstanding.</p><p>And that would make this day a whole lot worse.</p> <p>Kermilla lifted her chin to indicate the tavern two doors down from where she had arranged to meet Garth and Brok. She hadn\u2019t heard from her boys since they\u2019d been taken away by those nasty guards the other day, so it was a good thing they\u2019d set up this meeting before they separated. \u201cTrae, go inside and see if they\u2019re still in there.\u201d</p><p>Trae hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m the only escort you brought today. I can\u2019t leave you unattended, Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can if I say you can.\u201d She tapped her foot to indicate she was annoyed. He used to smile and give in when she did that. Now he looked uneasy. \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk down with you and stand outside. It isn\u2019t suitable for me to go into a tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went into the tavern back home,\u201d Trae said.</p><p>Kermilla stiffened. \u201cI never did. That was an aristo establishment for fine wines and conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the Lady pleases,\u201d Trae replied.</p> <p>As good as calling her a liar without saying anything that could justify discipline.</p><p>They walked to the tavern, and Trae stepped inside the doorway. Moments later he stepped out with a young Warlord. \u201cThis is a friend of Garth\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell Lords Garth and Brok that I\u2019m waiting.\u201d Kermilla put a little chill in her voice.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d the Warlord replied. \u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cGone? Gone where?\u201d</p><p>The Warlord shifted his weight from one foot to the other and looked at Trae instead of her. \u201cThey weren\u2019t supposed to go into the landen part of town. Queen\u2019s command.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla rolled her eyes. \u201cOh,la. I countermanded that order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should have told that to the Master of the Guard,\u201d the Warlord said hotly. \u201cTalon came for them last night, and nowthey\u2019re gone. \u201d</p> <p>She forgot how to breathe. That fierce, maimed old Warlord Prince had come for her boys? \u201cHe exiled them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. The courtesy fingers weren\u2019t on their father\u2019s doorstep this morning, so maybe they were just sent away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtesy fingers?\u201d Trae asked.</p><p>The Warlord shook his head and backed away. \u201cI\u2019ve said enough. You want to know anything more, you ask Prince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Kermilla huffed as the Warlord hurried away. \u201cI certainly will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Trae said quietly. \u201cI think it would be better if Jhorma and I asked about the fingers. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the mansion,\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only answer I want from Prince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>The biggest one being where he had gone so early this morning. And why Correne had gone with him.</p><p>When he got back from his discussions with all the merchants, Theran found another package on his desk: a small, plain wooden box.</p><p>He knew what that box meant. Anyone who lived in Dena Nehele knew what it meant.</p><p>Using a psychic thread, he summoned Julien, his new butler. He picked up the folded and wax-sealed paper that had been on top of the box, but he didn\u2019t break the seal or open the paper.</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven?\u201d Julien took one step into the room and came no farther until he looked around and confirmed there were no females present. Then he approached the desk.</p><p>Julien was a Warlord who had a handsome face and a cold temper. Like Gray, his body had been tortured\u2014and scarred. When he applied for the butler\u2019s position, he\u2019d told Theran straight out that he would gut any woman who tried to ride him, but as long as Theran kept theLadies away from him, he\u2019d be pleased to have the job.</p><p>After seeing Julien sharpen the cook\u2019s knives one afternoon, Theran made sure the man was never alone with Kermilla or Correne.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this arrive?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cI found it early this morning on the table where visitors\u2019 calling cards are left,\u201d Julien replied. \u201cYou were already gone, so I put it in the butler\u2019s pantry to avoid upsetting the other servants. I meant to give it to you when you returned this morning, but you left so soon after . . .\u201d</p><p>So Talon had been here last night. Had he still been home, or had he been riding the Winds to return one problem to her home village?</p><p>If he\u2019d been home, if Talon had slipped in and out of here without even trying to talk to him . . . that was as much a warning as the box.</p><p>\u201cIs Lady Kermilla in?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room. She seemed distressed when she returned from the village. She wants to speak with you, but Lords Trae and Jhorma have requested an audience before you talk to the Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend them in.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Julien was out of the room before breaking the seal and opening the paper. Simple words with nothing wasted\u2014and an unflinching and unforgiving judgment.</p><p>Garth and Brok disobeyed the Queen and went into the landen part of town. For that alone, they would have been exiled, as the Queen commanded. But they went to the weaver\u2019s home intending to rape the wife and little girl. This I know as fact.</p><p>They are forfeit.</p><p>No signature. There never was a signature on a note like this, but he recognized Talon\u2019s writing.</p><p>A quick knock on the door. Then Jhorma and Trae walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla had a disturbing experience today,\u201d Jhorma said. \u201cA Warlord mentioned something about \u2018courtesy fingers,\u2019 but wouldn\u2019t explain further.\u201d</p><p>Theran pointed at the box. \u201cYou can open it.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the box on the desk, Trae raised the lid. Then he stumbled back, swearing.</p><p>\u201cWhen a man was hunted down and executed by a Warlord Prince, his ring finger and his ring, drained of power, were sent back to his family.\u201d Usually the hunt was done because the bastard\u2019s offense had been \u201cforgiven\u201d by a twisted Queen. But one way or another, the people of Dena Nehele got justice\u2014and the fingers were an assurance that no one needed to worry about the bastard coming back to hurt them again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to share that part with the men who served Kermilla. That would tell them too clearly what Talon thought of her, and they might try to convince her to go back to Dharo and her safe little village.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Jhorma said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet them. I gathered from Bardoc that those two were little pricks, but surely escorting a Queen traveling in a questionable part of town shouldn\u2019t warrant execution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t. This did.\u201d Theran handed the paper to Jhorma\u2014and watched the man pale.</p><p>\u201cCan you verify they tried to do this?\u201d Jhorma asked.</p><p>\u201cTalon wouldn\u2019t have executed them if he wasn\u2019t sure of their intentions.\u201d And he would have been sure after he ripped open Garth and Brok\u2019s inner barriers and got the truth from their own minds.</p><p>No, Talon would have been certain even before he took that action. The confirmation from their own minds before the execution was only a formality.</p><p>\u201cThey were hers.\u201d Trae looked sick and confused. \u201cShe\u2019d gone to meet them and found out Talon had taken them away. On the ride back here, she kept saying he had no right to touch a male who belonged to her.\u201d</p><p>They couldn\u2019t belong to her.Theran\u2019s stomach rolled.Not the same way I do. She couldn\u2019t mean that. How could I belong to a Queen who would claim men capable of raping a child? Trae\u2019s mistaken. Or he\u2019s lying. He has to be.</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about Prince Talon, Lady Cassidy\u2019s Master of the Guard?\u201d Jhorma sounded wary.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Theran\u2019s stomach rolled again. He knew exactly why Talon had left the fingers here instead of on their father\u2019s doorstep\u2014because he, as the ruler of this town, should have exiled Garth and Brok for breaking the Queen\u2019s command.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anyone who could deliver this to the Warlords\u2019 family?\u201d Trae asked.</p><p>Theran shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked at Trae with grudging respect. He\u2019d thought of Kermilla\u2019s escorts as useless appendages, unwanted chaperons who restricted what he could say to his lover\u2014and to the woman who should rule his people. But these men were First Circle. If they\u2019d been home, they would be taking care of the business of the court, just like Cassidy\u2019s First Circle did.</p><p>Offering to take the box to the Warlords\u2019 father was a kindness he hadn\u2019t expected from Kermilla\u2019s present court.</p><p>\u201cTake Laska with you,\u201d Jhorma said. \u201cThere has been enough death over a foolish decision, and I don\u2019t imagine anyone reacts well when they receive one of those boxes\u2014unless they\u2019re truly relieved to receive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Theran nodded at the paper Jhorma still held. \u201cYou can give him that too. He should know why his sons were forfeit.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Jhorma and Trae left, Theran called in a bottle of brandy. He had downed his first large glass before Kermilla stomped daintily into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid Trae tell you about the dreadful thing that happened in town today?\u201d Kermilla put her hands on her hips and looked stern. \u201cYou should tell Talon he has no business interfering with this town.You rule here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarth and Brok are forfeit, Kermilla. There is nothing anyone can do about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to do something! They\u2019re mine, Theran. They\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDead.\u201dHell\u2019s fire. He hadn\u2019t meant to be that blunt.</p><p>She paled. Pouring more brandy in the glass, he guided her to a chair. \u201cDrink this.\u201d He waited until she chugged the brandy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kermilla, but Garth and Brok are dead. They were executed.\u201d</p><p>She gasped for air, then wailed, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He pulled up a footstool and sat in front of her. \u201cThey went to a landen\u2019s house with the intention of raping the wife and daughter. That\u2019s unforgivable, even here where we\u2019ve forgotten so much of the Old Ways of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Kermilla protested.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t believe them capable of that obscenity. She hadn\u2019t realized what kind of men they were when she\u2019d claimed them. Thank the Darkness for that. \u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>Calling in a small, lace-edged handkerchief, she looked at him with big blue eyes and sniffled, turning an ordinary body sound into something feminine and delicate.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Correne?\u201d Kermilla asked. \u201cI know she went off with you this morning, which is very naughty of you, Theran. She hasn\u2019t had her Virgin Night yet. She shouldn\u2019t go anywhere with a man without a chaperon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her home,\u201d Theran said quietly. \u201cShe\u2019s back in her home village now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?She was my only friend here. My only female friend,\u201d she added hastily when he stiffened.</p><p>He took the glass from her and set it on the table next to the chair. Then he took her hands. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a friend to you, although she hid her intentions well.\u201d</p> <p>She jerked her hands out of his. \u201cWhatever are you talking about? Of course she\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>The headache was still there, gnawing inside his skull. So he spoke without softening the blow. \u201cBecause of her, you made enemies at dinner the other night.\u201d He pulled back. He should have asked this question before. Hehad asked this question before. But not so bluntly that he would have to have an answer. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve presumed too much from your staying here after Cassidy moved her court to Eyota. If I have, I apologize. I thought you were willing to become the Queen here next spring. I thought you had stayed to learn what the people here need from their Queen. I\u2019ve been bringing influential people here to meet you so that they would support your intention to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat influential people?\u201d Kermilla snapped. \u201cThere are only a handful of aristo families in this town and I\u2019m not allowed to go anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfluential doesn\u2019t always mean aristo,\u201d Theran said, tightening the leash on his temper. \u201cFerall is an example. He\u2019s a savage fighter, and he\u2019s respected by other Warlord Princes and the surviving Queens because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t very nice at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla stuck out her lower lip. The pout usually made him think of carnal things he\u2019d like to do with her. Today, with his head pounding unmercifully, it just made her mouth look puffy and unattractive.</p><p>\u201cYou should have slapped Correne down when she made that remark about Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shewas called Lady Freckledy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t the Queen of a Territory then. Ferall didn\u2019t join Cassidy\u2019s court and he may not serve her directly, but hewas insulted on her behalf. When you did nothing, you lost his support\u2014and the support of the other three Warlord Princes who came with him. That means you lost the support of any of the Queens who pay attention to how Ferall reacts to people who might have great influence in our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should he be insulted? You just said he wasn\u2019t hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live under a bad Queen. I believe you would be a better Queen for Dena Nehele, but Cassidy has been making an effort to help the people, and the Queens and Warlord Princes are paying attention. They aren\u2019t interested in parties and concerts, Kermilla. They\u2019re interested in a harvest that will feed everyone through the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to have any fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun is a luxury we can\u2019t afford yet.\u201d He took her hands again. \u201cAnd there are some other things the people can\u2019t afford yet. I got the bills from the merchants today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Theran. You\u2019re not going to grumble about that too.\u201d</p><p>He released her hands and moved away from her, needing some distance. \u201cI told the merchants I would pay what was on these bills and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, clearly hurt and insulted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kermilla, but the shops you\u2019ve been patronizing have fulfilled their tithes until next spring.All the tithes. Not just what would have come to me as income, but also what should have gone into the town\u2019s treasury to pay the guards and maintain the basic necessities of the town itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you pay it?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Thank the Darkness she didn\u2019t know about the treasure Cassidy had found in the attics here. \u201cI have enough money from my family to pay for the servants and start doing some repairs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you livein a mansion. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThis spring was the first time I set foot in this house. My family hasn\u2019t lived here for generations. Couldn\u2019t live here because the Territory Queen had claimed it for herself.\u201d</p><p>She looked around the room, as if casting about for something she could understand.</p><p>For a moment, he thought she was going to ask him to sell off some of the furnishings in order to pay for another damn dress. But she looked at him with a tiny frown. \u201cCan\u2019t you raise the tithes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd give more people a reason to leave?\u201d He raked his hand through his hair. \u201cHave you paid any attention when we went driving around the town? Have you noticed all the empty houses and empty shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her frowned deepened. \u201cGrayhaven is theimportant town. Why aren\u2019t there more people living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. Her lower lip quivered.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment to regain control.</p><p>She\u2019s young, inexperienced. She\u2019s lived in a safe little village her whole life. Sweet Darkness, please let her understand this time.</p><p>\u201cHalf the Blood in Dena Nehele were destroyed by that witch storm that ripped through the Realms a couple of years ago. Then the landens rose up against us, and half of the survivors died. Do you understand, Kermilla? For every four Blood who were alive three years ago,only one of us is left. \u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her face wiped clean of all expression.</p><p>Returning to the footstool, he sat and faced her again. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what I don\u2019t have. I think you can be a good Queen, but you\u2019ve let a few questionable companions persuade you into making bad decisions. You\u2019ve lost the respect of some powerful men because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran, I\u2019m truly sorry. I didn\u2019t know how bad it\u2019s been for all of you.\u201d</p><p>Why not?he wondered.I\u2019ve been telling you since the first time we took a drive around the town.</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t understand that things would be so different here. That ruling would be so different here.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s heart pounded. She sounded regretful, almost apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d Kermilla said in a subdued voice. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of her hand, then said with all the conviction he could put in his voice, \u201cWe can have a good life, Kermilla. It\u2019s just going to take time and work.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she pulled away from him gently and left the room. She didn\u2019t join them for dinner that night, which he didn\u2019t think odd, but he did regret that her door remained locked to him when he tapped on it later that night.</p><p>And he tried not to think about the sounds he\u2019d heard a moment before he knocked. Sounds an aural shield could have politely hidden if she hadn\u2019t wanted anyone to hear.</p><p>Sounds that indicated she\u2019d found consolation with someone else that night.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Standing in the doorway of the dining room, Dryden announced, \u201cPrinces Ferall, Rikoma, Elendill, and Hikaeda have arrived. I have put them in the visitors\u2019 parlor.\u201d</p><p>Ranon almost spit a mouthful of coffee across the table. \u201cThey\u2019re herealready ?\u201d When he\u2019d suggested they come in the morning, he hadn\u2019t expected the four men to arrivethis early.</p><p>Wiping his mouth with a napkin, he pushed away from the table. \u201cThank you, Dryden. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine, Ranon,\u201d Powell said. He was the only other person left at the table.</p><p>\u201cWill it?\u201d Not knowing if Ferall now served Kermilla and was here as her eyes and ears made Ranon edgy. That uncertainty had gnawed at him ever since he\u2019d agreed to this visit.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll see what they want to see. Show them the village. Show them the people. That\u2019s all you can do. I\u2019ll inform Maydra that we will have four guests for the midday meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Cassie?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe she went upstairs to change clothes.\u201d</p><p>Ranon hurried to the visitors\u2019 parlor. The four men hadn\u2019t taken a seat. When he walked in they were doing a slow prowl around the room, looking a little baffled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ferall nodded, as did Rikoma and Elendill. Hikaeda smiled and said, \u201cHave we come to the right place, Ranon? When we arrived at the landing web and asked for the Queen\u2019s residence, we were directed here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUsed to be a boardinghouse, so it has a big dining room and kitchen, several parlors, and sufficient bedrooms and bathrooms for the Queen and some of her court, as well as rooms for special guests. Also has enough land for a big kitchen garden, herb garden, and flower gardens, plus some ground Gray says will suit the honey pears.\u201d Ranon shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not a typical building for a Queen\u2019s residence, but it pleases Lady Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>As they took another look around the room, Ranon felt his shoulders tighten, even though feeling defensive was foolish. The furniture was old but clean and polished. The room had the scent of a place that was cared for. And the fact that the Queen wasn\u2019t buying new furniture to impress visitors while the people were still struggling to have enough clothes and a decent pair of shoes was something her court would not apologize for. To anyone.</p><p>Footsteps. Female voices.</p> <p>Cassidy suddenly appeared in the doorway wearing shortened trousers and a shirt that looked like she\u2019d rescued it from the rag bag. Probably the same rag bag where she got the cloths that were stuffed into the bucket she was holding.</p><p>\u201cRanon, Dryden said . . .\u201d She looked at the other four men in the room and her hazel eyes widened. \u201cOh, Hell\u2019s fire. Is thattoday ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears we have come at an inconvenient time,\u201d Ferall said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d Cassidy said, stepping farther into the room. \u201cNo. My apologies, gentlemen. We\u2019ve had several families come to the village, and we\u2019ve been working to get them settled into their new homes. Between that and the work in the shops and trying to get the Healing House and Shira\u2019s residence set up, I lost track of the days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, if we\u2019re going to get the last rooms in the Healing House cleaned out properly so Shira can start working there, we\u2019re going to need\u2014Oh.\u201d</p> <p>Another tall, big-boned woman with a long, plain face, freckles, and red hair stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, this is my mother, Devra.\u201d</p><p>Four Warlord Princes tipped their heads in a respectful bow.</p><p>\u201cWe are honored by the introduction,\u201d Ferall said.</p><p>\u201cCassie, give me the bucket.\u201d Devra wrapped her hand around the handle. \u201cYou\u2019re needed here. Besides, you\u2019ve been working too hard lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not.\u201d Cassidy tightened her own grip on the bucket.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you have. Even your father thinks so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t been working any harder than the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>Devra narrowed her eyes. \u201cDaughter, you fell asleep in the middle of drum practice last night. That should tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe promised to work only half a day today,\u201d Cassidy protested.</p><p>Devra gave him a stern look. \u201cRanon.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hands in surrender. \u201cNo. With all respect, Devra, I amnot getting in the middle of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we made this appointment with Ranon, he did tell us that the Queen may not be available,\u201d Hikaeda said.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Cassidy said, trying to tug the bucket out of Devra\u2019s hand. A futile effort.</p> <p>Ranon sent out a psychic call for help. He\u2019d already learned that when Cassidy and Devra squared off to argue about something, there was only one person in the house who was willing to step in and deal with two stubborn women.</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie!*</p><p>Vae appeared in the doorway and looked up at Cassidy\u2019s back. Or more likely, at Cassidy\u2019s ass since that was Vae\u2019s preferred spot to nip.</p><p>*Ranon will talk to the other males and show them male things.*</p><p>Cassidy pressed her lips together, and her face turned bright red. Devra just looked interested. All five Warlord Princes squirmed.</p><p>*You will work with Shira and Devra. Then you will eat. Then you will not work. It is time to work now. Shira is waiting for you.*</p><p>Vae trotted off, no doubt to wait at the back door.</p><p>\u201cIf you will excuse us,\u201d Devra said tightly, \u201cit is time to work now. The Sceltie said so.\u201d She walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure to see you, gentlemen,\u201d Cassidy said. She hurried to catch up to Devra.</p><p>No one said anything for several moments.</p><p>\u201cYou called the Sceltie to deal with the Queen?\u201d Elendill asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cSome days I think if we\u2019d had Vae planning tactics, we could have defended our people even better than we did.\u201d</p><p>Ferall laughed softly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get on with these male things we\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to see?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>All the humor in their faces faded away. Ferall said, \u201cWhatever you choose to show us.\u201d</p><p>A careful phrasing, but Ranon knew that what wasn\u2019t shown would be as important as whatwas shown. In Ferall\u2019s place, he would have paid attention to both. \u201cAre you all comfortable with doing some walking?\u201d</p><p>Ferall nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen let me show you what the Queen\u2019s presence has done for Eyota.\u201d</p><p>He began with the Queen\u2019s square, introducing them to Shaddo\u2019s wife, who was standing outside the family\u2019s cottage with a look of grim amusement on her face.</p><p>\u201cShaddo already left to do a circuit around the village,\u201d Soli said. \u201cDo you need him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon replied. Since she looked like she was edging toward a hissy cat mood, he added, \u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Since he knew whatthat meant, he led a retreat that didn\u2019t look hasty for all its speed.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Ferall sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cNot for us,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d Rikoma asked.</p><p>The answer came trotting up the street.</p><p>\u201cFor Eryk and Eliot, Shaddo\u2019s sons,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>The boys were moving smartly, with Darcy trotting right behind them.</p><p>\u201cRanon!\u201d Eryk rushed up to the men. \u201cTell Darcy we weren\u2019t doing anything wrong! We were just playing at the pond in the park!\u201d</p><p>Darcy growled and lunged at Eliot\u2019s heels, giving the boy good reason to scramble past his older brother. *Soli wants you home.Now. *</p><p>\u201cDid your father give you permission to go to the pond\u2014or the park?\u201d Ranon asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t,\u201d Eryk said.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wants you home,\u201d Ranon said. He owed it to Shaddo to keep his expression stern and his voice firm, but damn, he wanted to laugh.</p><p>*Home!* Darcy said.</p><p>Eryk glared at Darcy. \u201cJust wait until I have my Birthright Ceremony. You won\u2019t be so bossy then!\u201d</p><p>*I will still have sharper teeth.*</p><p>Hard to argue with that,Ranon thought. But he would have to mention that comment to Shaddo tonight. He wasn\u2019t sure Eryk\u2019s Birthright Jewel would end up outranking Darcy\u2019s, but the boy couldn\u2019t be allowed to use power to hurt someone in his family\u2014even if that family member had four legs and fur . . . and sharper teeth.</p><p>He and the other men continued down Autumn Road, passing the house where Lord Rogir and his family were settling in. Several girls were in the front yard, jumping rope. Or more precisely, two of the girls were swinging the rope and Keely was jumping over it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop. The girls were still uneasy around strangers, and Keely, despite looking like a live furry toy at the moment, had appointed herself the Protector of Young Females living in the Queen\u2019s square and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to attack if proper introductions weren\u2019t made. And he really didn\u2019t want to take time for the kind of proper introductions\u2014with thorough sniffing\u2014that Scelties deemed necessary before letting an unknown get close to their humans.</p><p>\u201cThat was another Sceltie?\u201d Hikaeda asked. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like hundreds some days, but there are twelve of them, plus Vae,\u201d Ranon replied. And in a village that only held a few hundred people, the odds werenot in the humans\u2019 favor.</p><p>He took the men down a few other streets. The occupied houses were carefully tended. Not many people visible, but there was still a sense of energy and purpose, of work being done with good heart.</p><p>His people had always had heart. Now there was also joy.</p><p>\u201cYou lost people,\u201d Ferall said quietly, tipping his head to indicate the empty houses.</p><p>\u201cHere in Eyota, most of the families who are gone were lost before the purge and the uprisings,\u201d Ranon replied. Meaning most had been slaughtered by the twisted Queens who had been encouraged to eliminate the Shalador people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ferall said.</p><p>\u201cWe survived, and now we have hope.\u201d</p><p>Ferall gave him an odd look, but they turned onto the main street, and his guests stopped. Just stopped.</p><p>Anyone who farmed was with his animals or in his fields, getting ready for the harvest that would begin in a few more weeks. And many craftsmen of all kinds were in their own shops working. But the first impression for someone who hadn\u2019t been watching this carefully planned frenzy grow on a daily basis was that every male who was old enough and strong enough to lift and carry, and every person who had some skill with tools\u2014or wanted to learn to have skills, regardless of gender\u2014was on the main street, scurrying in and out of buildings.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Elendill said.</p><p>Calling in the watch his grandfather had given him for his twentieth birthday, Ranon opened the cover and checked the time. Then he vanished the watch. \u201cThis will quiet down right about . . . now.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Burle stepped out of one of the buildings. In a Craft-enhanced voice, he hollered, \u201cBreak!\u201d</p><p>All the pounding, sawing, clattering noises stopped. People came out of various buildings and headed up the street.</p><p>\u201cElders\u2019 Park is being used as a rest station,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cThere is food and water there, and one or two of the elders are there each day to listen to the people or answer questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Ranon,\u201d Hikaeda said. \u201cHow are your people able to do this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ranon took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He heard the envy in Hikaeda\u2019s voice\u2014and worried about Ferall\u2019s silence. But they needed to know why this prosperity was starting here.</p><p>\u201cThis is the Queen\u2019s home village, and it is because of her that we have been able to make certain business connections that will be able to benefit all of Dena Nehele in time.\u201d He paused. \u201cGray has become friends with Daemon Sadi and made a deal with him: in exchange for Prince Sadi owning a few businesses here in Eyota, the court was given a loan for supplies the people in Dena Nehele will need, especially this coming winter.\u201d</p><p>A shocked gasp from all four men\u2014and a hint of fear. Just hearing Sadi\u2019s name had that effect on most men.</p> <p>\u201cGrayhas become friends withSadi ?\u201d Elendill asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Not a surprising question considering the shape Gray had been in for the past ten years. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to purchase things like blankets, clothes, and shoes\u2014things that are in short supply here,\u201d Ranon continued. \u201cA weavers guild in the southern Province was burned out during the uprisings. By borrowing from the loan, they will be able to purchase looms and wool, fix up a couple of empty houses as a new workplace, and begin to make a living again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does a village ask for such help?\u201d Rikoma asked with extreme courtesy.</p><p>\u201cWhoever rules the village submits a request to Lady Cassidy, telling her what is needed\u2014and the cost.\u201d Ranon sighed. \u201cOur land was destroyed over generations. It will take more than one season to fix all the wrongs. But we have the means now of buying feed for livestock and food for our people if the harvest falls short this year. We have connections we wouldn\u2019t have dreamed possible a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about envy, don\u2019t be,\u201d Ferall said. \u201cIt\u2019s right and fitting that the Queen\u2019s home village receive the first benefit of her efforts. And like her court, it should be an example of what is possible.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could think of what to say, a voice called his name.</p><p>Rainier pulled up next to them.</p><p>What had Ferall said about no envy? Hell\u2019s fire!He felt envy. That pony cart Rainier was driving practically screamedaristo. Not because it was fancy, but because of the quality and craftsmanship that had gone into the making of it. And the bay gelding pulling the cart was a gorgeous piece of horseflesh.</p><p>\u201cGlad I found you since no one seems to know where Gray is working today,\u201d Rainier said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be at the Queen\u2019s Residence for the midday meal,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stay. I swung by to see if Marcus needed anything, and then put this lad through his paces to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be any problems. Now I\u2019m heading back to Kaeleer. Prince Yaslana\u2019s wife is indisposed, so I\u2019m going to stay in Ebon Rih for a while and help out with administrative tasks. Lucivar is too short-tempered right now to deal with paperwork\u2014or the people who bring it.\u201d</p> <p>Rainier smiled when he said it, but Ranon saw the concern in the other man\u2019s eyes. \u201cIs there anything we can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019ll appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>Rainier continued to smile as he looked at the other men, but Ranon had the feeling the Kaeleer Warlord Prince had just completed a very quick\u2014and thorough\u2014assessment of his guests.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rainier said, \u201cI\u2019ll get this boy to the stables and be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStables?\u201d</p><p>Rainier made a gesture that included the horse and cart. \u201cLadies Morghann and Jaenelle sent this to Ladies Shira and Cassidy. Queens and Healers in Scelt like this cart\u2019s design because there are storage compartments under the benches in the back, and it\u2019s small enough to be comfortable for a Lady to drive. Lord Khardeen raised the horse up from a foal and trained him personally, so the lad is solid and dependable. He\u2019s not kindred\u2014Khardeen figured you had enough adjustments to make without that particular bit of fun\u2014but the horse is used to being around Scelties, so he\u2019ll settle in just fine with Kief and Lloyd to look after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainier, it\u2019s very generous, but we can\u2019t afford this,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Rainier gave him an odd look, and his smile sharpened. \u201cRanon, darling, I\u2019ll bet when you took a piss this morning you noticed you have a cock and balls. That means you have no say in this. Cassidy\u2019s friends want her to have the horse and cart. They figured she\u2019ll share it with Shira since Shira is the court\u2019s Healer. If you want to argue about this with the Queen of Scelt and . . . Prince Sadi\u2019s wife, you go right ahead. I\u2019m not about to.\u201d He gathered the reins and clicked to the horse, turning back the way he\u2019d come.</p> <p>Ranon had heard the hesitation and conscious choice of how to identify Jaenelle\u2014and knew that Rainier might work for Daemon Sadi, but the man still served the Queen of Ebon Askavi.</p><p>He watched the pony cart turn a corner.</p><p>*What in the name of Hell just happened here?* Ranon asked Rainier on an Opal thread.</p><p>Rainier\u2019s laughter came through the thread. *I didn\u2019t tell your friendsall of Cassidy\u2019s connections. And whether you tell them why Cassidy knows so many Territory Queens in Kaeleer or why they\u2019re all paying so much attention to what happens in Dena Nehele is up to you.*</p><p>*Are they paying attention?* Ranon\u2019s heart started to pound hard.</p><p>*Ranon,* Rainier said gently, *the rulers of Scelt, Glacia, Dharo, Nharkhava, Dhemlan, and Ebon Rih all have a connection to your Queen or her court. Not to mention the High Lord of Hell. Of course they\u2019re paying attention. And it doesn\u2019t hurt if the Queens and Warlord Princes in Dena Nehele know a little more about your Lady\u2019s credentials.*</p><p>Being so busy day after day, focusing on repairs and crops and the things the people would need to get through the winter, it was easy to forget how much power could arrow down on their land.</p><p>But being so busy day after day never quite smothered the knowledge that Theran\u2019s actions might be setting up Dena Nehele for another violent storm.</p><p>He turned to the other men. \u201cShall we continue?\u201d</p><p>Rikoma, Elendill, and Hikaeda looked at Ferall.</p><p>\u201cIs there any place we could get a drink and sit for a bit?\u201d Ferall asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is. It\u2019s down this way.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d had enough. Whatever they had come here to see, whatever questions they had wanted answered, they had gotten more than they\u2019d expected.</p><p>So he took them to Elders\u2019 Park and got them coffee and food, and gave them silence as they watched the workers return to their assignments. And knew with absolute certainty that something had changed.</p><p>They arrived back at the Queen\u2019s Residence earlier than anticipated, so Ranon took the other men around to the back of the house. He didn\u2019t think any of them knew any more about gardens than he did, but they looked around politely as he pointed out the Healing House and the cottage Gray wanted to convert into a loaning library.</p><p>\u201cGray is working with Lord Marcus, Prince Sadi\u2019s man of business, to figure out costs and what will be needed,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cSince many people can\u2019t afford books right now, he wants to have this library and obtain a wide variety of books to educate and entertain. The villagers would pay a couple of coppers to take a book for a month, then return it. We want to keep the fee small enough that people can afford it, but it also has to pay for the books themselves, the librarian\u2019s wages, and the repairs and upkeep of the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray thought of this?\u201d Hikaeda asked.</p><p>\u201cGray is a bundle of ideas,\u201d Ranon said dryly.</p><p>Powell had given Gray his own little space in the Steward\u2019s office to stash all his notes about possibilities for Eyota in particular and Dena Nehele in general. Only the knowledge that every available person was going to be helping with the harvest this year, and the need to get the shops finished up and stocked with merchandise, kept Gray from trying to add one more thing to the list of projects to be accomplished before winter set in.</p><p>They moved away from the wall and ended up standing near the table and chairs under the big tree.</p><p>*Ranon!*</p><p>The joyful shout was the only warning he had before he turned and ended up with his arms full of Sceltie. Coughing from the dust that rose up as Khollie smacked into his chest, he said, \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>*The females were cleaning Shira\u2019s den. I helped.*</p><p>The tail banging against him with enthusiasm raised more dust.</p><p>\u201cYou used your tail as a dust rag, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>*Yes! Shira says you need to wash my tail before I\u2019m allowed in the house.* Khollie squirmed as he tried to lick Ranon\u2019s ear.</p><p>The tail wasn\u2019t the only thing that needed to get washed.</p><p>Ranon\u2019s face heated as the other men watched with amused interest. He hated himself for feeling the tiniest bit of shame, but that didn\u2019t change the truth. Khollie was different. There was a sweetness to him that wasn\u2019t about his being younger than the other Scelties, or just a trait of personality. He\u2019d seen children who had a similar kind of sweetness. They weren\u2019t the same as other children. Weren\u2019t quite right.</p><p>Not that Khollie wasn\u2019t a bright boy. He was. He needed things explained carefully, but only one time. And he did wear a Tiger Eye Jewel.</p><p>But if Ranon had to be a Sceltie\u2019s human, why couldn\u2019t it have been someone like Keely or Darcy or, Hell\u2019s fire, even Darkmist? Catching sight of the Opal-Jeweled Sceltie Warlord Prince had made Ferall stop and stare.</p><p>Darkmist made hardened warriors sit up and take notice. Khollie, the homely little patchwork dog, just amused them.</p><p>Elendill shifted to the left, giving Ranon a clear view of his brother Janos\u2014who was bent over double with his arms wrapped around himself. Laughing.</p><p>But the boy straightened up quickly enough and headed over to them.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Khollie,\u201d Janos said. \u201cRanon has to stay with the other humans, so I\u2019ll help you wash up.\u201d</p><p>*I owe you,* Ranon said as Khollie jumped out of his arms and whapped him in the face with a dusty tail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*You do,* Janos agreed.</p><p>Not a youth anymore, despite being eighteen,Ranon thought as he watched Janos and Khollie walk to the house.And much changed even from last summer.</p><p>One of the reasons for those changes walked out of the house. Reyhana wore a long, simple summer dress and sandals.</p> <p>Ranon heard Janos\u2019s sharp command that stopped Khollie from a joyful leap. He watched the way his brother went down on one knee to be closer to the cowering dog\u2019s height and pointed to Reyhana, who nodded as if agreeing with Janos\u2019s words. He watched Khollie straighten up, no longer afraid once he understood that Janos\u2019s sharpness had been intended to protect him from doing something wrong\u2014like jumping into Reyhana\u2019s freshly bathed arms.</p><p>And he saw the way Janos looked at Reyhana, saw the brush of fingers against her hand when Janos rose to take Khollie to the laundry room for a bath.</p><p>A hard choice for a young man who burned for more than a few kisses and petting. Reyhana was the Shalador Queen with the most potential in her generation, and it would be a couple of years or more before she would have her Virgin Night. It would cost Janos his life if an imprudent coupling damaged the girl in any way.</p><p>But he knew what it was like to be young and have a woman hold your heart. After all, Shira had been sixteen when he\u2019d fallen in love with her.</p><p>Reyhana walked toward them, and Ranon watched for the moment when the other men picked up her psychic scent and realized she was a Queen. And he wondered why the men tensed, especially Hikaeda and Ferall.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Reyhana said, tipping her head in a small bow.</p><p>Ranon made the introductions.</p><p>\u201cLady Reyhana,\u201d Ferall replied as the men gave her a matching vow.</p><p>\u201cWe have about half an hour before the meal,\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cWould you like to sit out here and have a glass of ale while you wait? It\u2019s a lovely spot when there\u2019s a breeze like there is today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be welcome,\u201d Ferall said.</p><p>Reyhana turned her head, her eyes having the distant look the Blood sometimes had when they communicated on a psychic thread.</p> <p>\u201cAre you staying here?\u201d Rikoma asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes. I have the privilege of working as part of Lady Cassidy\u2019s court to learn Protocol and the Old Ways of the Blood, as well as the rights and duties of a Queen and court. It\u2019s very exciting to be a part of this new beginning for all our people.\u201d</p><p>Elendill looked past her shoulder. \u201cYou have many servants here?\u201d</p><p>Reyhana laughed softly. \u201cThe Queen\u2019s court acts as a training ground. We have a butler, a housekeeper and her assistant, and a cook. The footmen and maids are all young people from the village who want training in domestic service. They get training; we get extra help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many aristo houses anymore that need servants,\u201d Hikaeda said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but there are boardinghouses and inns,\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cAnd there are people like Prince Spere and Prince Haele who share a cottage in the Queen\u2019s square rather than having the whole court living here. Being members of the First Circle, their residence is cared for by the servants here, but there are others who would be willing to pay to have some cooking and cleaning done. Aristo houses are not the only places that need such skills.\u201d</p><p>Reyhana\u2019s face, like her voice, shone with enthusiasm. Hearing a sound, she looked behind her, then looked at the men. Her green eyes twinkled with good humor. \u201cPlease step aside to leave a clear path to the table. The girls are still getting used to being around Warlord Princes, and they get nervous. But they\u2019re getting better and drop fewer things. We\u2019ve only had one broken glass this week.\u201d</p><p>Birdie, who was now assistant housekeeper and assistant trainer of maids, carried the pitcher of ale. Copper, a village girl in training, carried the tray of glasses.</p> <p>Watching Copper\u2019s hands shake as she glanced at the men and crept after Birdie, Ranon held his breath. Then pitcher and tray were on the table and both girls were retreating back to the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll notice there is a shield around the edge of the tray,\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cIt won\u2019t help anything if the tray is dropped, but it does prevent a wobble from tipping a glass off the tray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think of that?\u201d Rikoma asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Vae did.\u201d</p><p>The men laughed, and Ranon guessed that had been Reyhana\u2019s intention. Warlord Princes were lethal predators, and they were used to being feared. Being given an opportunity to laugh with a woman was a moment both appreciated and prized.</p><p>Reyhana went back into the house. Hikaeda poured the ale and passed the glasses. For a few minutes, the men looked at the gardens and spoke little.</p><p>Then Cassidy walked out of the house. Like Reyhana, she wore a long, light summer dress, but her hair had been put up in a simple knot at the back of her head.</p><p>She had just reached Ranon when . . .</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie!*</p><p>Cassidy crossed her eyes and made a face as Gray and Vae caught up with her.</p><p>*Hat, Cassie!*</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIf I put a hat on now, the hair will fall down, and it\u2019s too hot today to have it down.\u201d</p><p>*Gray, tell her!*</p><p>Coming up on Cassidy\u2019s left side, Gray nodded to the men. He wore a plain white shirt and black trousers\u2014and his Purple Dusk pendant and ring.</p><p>There was nothing challenging about a man wearing his Jewels, and there was nothing special about the clothes, but Ranon felt a curious tension in the other men.</p><p>Gray gave the men a conspiratorial smile as he looked each of them in the eyes. That smile included a mischievous wink when his eyes moved to Hikaeda. Then he called in a parasol, opened it, and held it over Cassidy.</p><p>When she did nothing but look up at it, Gray said politely, \u201cAre you going to take the parasol, or should I hold it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending too much time with somebody,\u201d Cassidy muttered as she took the parasol. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hit me?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy and Gray smiled at each other\u2014and those smiles had enough heat to take everyone by surprise. Including Ranon.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Gray said, \u201cif you would join us, the meal is ready.\u201d</p><p>He raised his right hand, an escort\u2019s gesture. Cassidy placed her left hand over his in automatic response\u2014like a Queen would respond to her First Escort or Consort . . . or her husband.</p><p>Cassidy and Gray walked back to the house. Ranon started to follow, then realized the others weren\u2019t coming with him.</p><p>Hikaeda stared at nothing. \u201cWe were friends,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBefore he was taken and hurt so badly, we were friends. I never thought . . . It\u2019s good to see him again. It\u2019s good to see Jared Blaed.\u201d</p><p>Hikaeda headed for the house, followed by Rikoma and Elendill. But Ferall still lingered.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Ferall shook his head. \u201cI want this for my own village, for my own Province.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come inside,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cThere are people around the table who can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ferall said softly, \u201cI think maybe there are.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Ranon gave his horse its head and caught up to Burle before the man reached the landen community.</p><p>Something had surprised Lord Rogir when he stopped at the community to see how the cleanup and repairs were coming along, and anything that would surprise a senior guard was something Ranon wanted to check out for himself\u2014especially when Cassidy\u2019s father was about to ride into that community.</p><p>Ranon rode through the arched gateway ahead of Burle, then reined in, understanding Rogir\u2019s surprise.</p><p>Lilly Weaver and JuliDee had been staying with Rogir\u2019s family since the flight from Grayhaven. Lilly and Rogir\u2019s wife had worked together to clean up the senior guard\u2019s household. Other women in the village had also pitched in to give two other cottages a good scrubbing. One cottage went to Lord Brandon and his wife, and the other was to be a general residence for the unmarried guards. After that, the women had been driving out to the community to start cleaning up the attached row houses.</p><p>Now there were several wagons parked close to the houses and many unfamiliar faces\u2014and there was James Weaver, hugging his wife.</p><p>Rogir stood off to one side with a couple of his men, watching the reunion. Deciding that was the best choice for an explanation, Ranon guided his horse over to the men and dismounted. James, spotting him, gave Lilly one more hug and joined them.</p><p>\u201cYou made good time,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think all the houses are ready to be occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilly says they have three that are clean and in good order,\u201d James said. \u201cMostly good order. Lilly wanted to know about\u2014\u201d</p><p>*Puppies!*</p><p>Ranon stiffened. So did Rogir. Burle just climbed off the wagon and headed over to them as Wynne, a Sceltie with a pure white head, and black-f aced Duffy jumped out of the wagon.</p><p>Burle looked at Ranon and shrugged. \u201cThey wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>*Puppies!* Wynne wagged her tail at the smaller landen children.</p><p>Then Duffy froze for a moment before shooting straight up into the air to hover well above the buildings. His tail began wagging so hard the motion knocked him sideways as he shouted, *Sheep!*</p><p>Oh, shit,Ranon thought.</p><p>\u201cYou outrank the rest of us,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t have to sound so damned cheerful\u2014and relieved\u2014about it. Of course, Keely had taken up residence with Rogir\u2019s family. Having enough experience now trying to deal with just one, the man could be somewhat forgiven for not wanting to deal with a pair of Scelties.</p><p>\u201cDuffy, come down now,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>*They havesheep !*</p><p>And may the Darkness have mercy on them. \u201cDuffy,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Duffy dropped out of the air so fast, Ranon was sure the dog would hit the ground. But he came to a stop an arm\u2019s length from the ground and gently floated down the rest of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did your lady want to know?\u201d Burle asked.</p><p>Looking a little apprehensive, James pulled his attention away from the Scelties. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an ice chest that she could find in the kitchen area.\u201d He sounded apologetic. \u201cIt would help our food last longer if we could purchase some ice.\u201d</p><p>Burle frowned. \u201cThere are cold boxes, and each of them have a small freezer inside the main box. I checked them out, and they\u2019re all in good working order. Need a good scrubbing, of course, but if that\u2019s been done, they\u2019re ready for a cold spell.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing James\u2019s discomfort, Ranon said, \u201cI think that\u2019s the problem, Burle. The cold boxes don\u2019t work without Craft, and landens can\u2019t do Craft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any youths in your village who are interested in earning some pocket money?\u201d Burle asked. Then he huffed. \u201cLook. I know things have been hard here. You just need to look around to see it. And I know there have been bad troubles here between the Blood and landens. But the fighting is over, and from what I understand there wasn\u2019t any of that kind of fighting in Eyota. These people are here because you all decided you were willing to work together to build a new life. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Burle looked at James. \u201cCold box is more dependable than ice. The spell needs to be renewed on a weekly basis.\u201d Now he looked at Ranon and Rogir. \u201cAround Weavers Field, where I come from, a couple of enterprising young Warlords go to the neighboring landen village where some of the people have bought cold boxes. They charge a fee for maintaining the spell on each cold box. Now I know things are tight here and no one has much coin to spare, but these houses also have a tank for hot water that needs Craft too. So it seems to me that charging three coppers a week for both spells would be fair. At least for this first little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask around the village and see if anyone is interested,\u201d Ranon said.</p> <p>*We could do those spells,* Wynne said.</p><p>*We know our Craft,* Duffy said.</p><p>The men looked at one another. No one had noticed the Scelties joining them.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Burle finally said. \u201cYou come with me. I\u2019ll show you the spells, and you can give them a try. Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>*What happens if they do it wrong?* Ranon asked Burle.</p><p>*Then I guess I\u2019ll be buying that landen family another cold box or ice chest,* Burle replied as he and the Scelties went into one of the houses.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you for a few more days,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>\u201cThat was my decision, sir,\u201d Jaego said.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d Ristoff said. \u201cMoore is about a day behind us with the rest of the landen families and livestock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have driven the animals awfully hard,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. We had help.\u201d James shook his head and sounded like he still didn\u2019t quite believe what had happened.</p><p>Jaego nodded, then looked at the other guard. \u201cRistoff and I took the liberty to make some decisions on the Queen\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>Ranon stiffened, then forced himself to relax. Hadn\u2019t he also taken the liberty to make some promises in Cassidy\u2019s name? If these men were going to serve as guards in her court, he had to show some confidence in their decisions\u2014at least until those decisions proved unworthy of that trust. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are still feeling plenty uneasy, and we were concerned about the landen families traveling so far,\u201d Jaego said. \u201cEspecially since some of the raiding parties had traveled the same way during the uprisings. Some animals, and a couple of women with a lot more men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo days out, we stopped at a Coaching station on the outskirts of a village,\u201d Ristoff said. \u201cShowed the Coachmen the letters of passage from the Queen\u2019s Steward, and told them that she wanted these craftsmen and the other families settled near her home village as part of her plans to restore Dena Nehele. They had heard of some of the things Lady Cassidy has done already to help restore our land, so they offered their livestock Coach and a passenger Coach. Since it required several trips, and we had to load the wagons into the livestock Coach after the animals, we agreed on a spot south of the Heartsblood River as a place to disembark.\u201d</p><p>Jaego called in some papers and handed them to Ranon. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough marks to cover the usual fares, but the Coachmen didn\u2019t name a price. Those papers indicate the number of trips they made, the number of wagons and livestock taken. They said they\u2019ll accept whatever fee the Queen deems fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did ask that we mention their names,\u201d Ristoff said. \u201cThey wanted Lady Cassidy to know there are others beyond her court who are willing to serve in their own way.\u201d</p><p>The ripples from one heart can change so much,Ranon thought.Cassidy has changed so much.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d he said, his voice warm with approval. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>Then he noticed Burle coming out of the house. The man kept scratching the back of his neck, but Ranon didn\u2019t think the itch was on Burle\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Burle replied. \u201cNot exactly. Those two youngsters are right. They do know their Craft. They learned both those spells after being shown once, and they can do them better than a good many young humans I\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Why did he ask the question when he didn\u2019t really want to be given the answer?</p><p>Burle wasn\u2019t looking any of them in the eye, and that made Ranon nervous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d Burle finally said. \u201cWynne and Duffy want to try out this payment-for-work idea humans seem so fond of.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll maintain the spells on the cold boxes and water tanks for three coppers a week for each household.\u201d Burle looked at James Weaver.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fair,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cThey also want three coppers a day to guard and herd livestock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they liked herding sheep,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>\u201cA man who likes his work still wants to be paid for it,\u201d Burle said.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Burle nodded. \u201cSince they\u2019ll be helping guard the community, they\u2019ll live in the guardhouse with whoever is stationed here. They want their own big chair so the humans can\u2019t snarl about them being on the furniture.\u201d</p><p>Ranon found himself nodding in time with Rogir.</p><p>\u201cOne of them is free each week to go to story time in the village,\u201d Burle continued. He glanced at James. \u201cDo you have a teacher for your children?\u201d</p><p>James nodded. \u201cPotter\u2019s wife has been teaching some of our children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Wynne and Duffy want a little time with the teacher each day to continue learning to read and do their sums.\u201d</p><p>Ranon\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cThey read?They can read? Then why doI have to readSceltie Saves the Day every damn night?\u201d</p><p>Rogir and James looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have children yet, do you?\u201d James asked.</p><p>The Rock of Foreboding sank in the pond of Ranon\u2019s belly.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.He had read that damn book too many times.</p><p>\u201cThink of this as practice,\u201d Rogir said.</p><p>\u201cNext thing you know they\u2019ll be writing their own stories,\u201d Ranon muttered.</p><p>Burle shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Writing requires special Craft for a Sceltie, and it\u2019s hard to learn. Someone named Ladvarian can write a whole letter, but he got special training from the living myth. Of the Scelties here, only Vae can write a little.\u201d</p><p>Vae could write? Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked. Damn it! He was a Warlord Prince. Running away wasnot an option.</p><p>Running away sounded like a very good idea, though.</p><p>\u201cThat was all of it,\u201d Burle said. \u201cIf James here is willing to represent his people and we have a bargain, I\u2019ll tell the youngsters and we\u2019ll finish the deal.\u201d</p><p>James looked back at the other landens. The men nodded, so it was obvious they had chosen him to be their spokesman and interact with the Blood. \u201cWe have a deal.\u201d</p><p>Burle waved a hand.</p><p>Wynne and Duffy trotted up to them.</p><p>\u201cYou have a bargain,\u201d Burle told them. \u201cA handshake before witnesses is considered a fair agreement.\u201d</p><p>The Scelties popped up to hover on air about waist high. They sat and offered their right front paws to James, who seemed to have a sudden understanding of just what he was getting himself and his people into. But he shook with Wynne and Duffy, sealing the bargain.</p><p>The Scelties, along with the guards, went off to the guardhouse to see what would be needed. Burle waved at the landens and headed for his wagon. Ranon mounted his horse and rode out too.</p><p>As he rode back to Eyota, he wondered if Jaenelle Angelline and Morghann, the Queen of Scelt, had known exactly what they were doing when they let these particular Scelties loose on an unsuspecting people.</p><p>And he knew he would take perverse pleasure in watching the faces of the rest of the court when he told them about this day\u2019s adventure.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Kermilla crumpled the letter from Correne, tossed it into the fireplace, and blasted it with witchfire, turning it to ash in seconds.</p><p>She paced her bedroom, feeling more misused with every circuit she made. She\u2019d wasted the whole summer, when she should have been enjoying picnics and parties instead of being criticized for not working in the damn garden. And despite her pointed hints, Theran remained oblivious to what she\u2019d given up to stay here and wait until he could make her the Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>There was nothing to do in this dung-heap town.Nothing! She could visit a couple of aristo girls she\u2019d become acquainted with, but they had nointeresting conversation, so there wasn\u2019t much point. Besides, about the only things they could do during these visits were walk around the village or drive around the village. And if they did that, the girls wanted to browse in the shops, and what was the point of going into shops if you couldn\u2019t buy anything? She\u2019d writtenthree letters to her Steward, Lord Gallard, telling him to double the forthcoming autumn tithes because she needed the income, and alsocommanding him to send her some marks from the village treasury to hold her over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His single answer had been vague about the autumn tithes and totally lacking in the required marks.</p><p>She could summon her Consort, but there had been a change over the summer in Jhorma\u2019s attitude that made her feel like she was alone in bed even when he was pumping inside her.</p><p>She couldwork.

The bitch was just trying to secure her position. Sheknew she couldn\u2019t retain the title of Territory Queen after the year\u2019s contract was done unless she didsomething to catch the Blood\u2019s interest.</p><p>Theran had explained about the contract that gave Cassidy and the people of Dena Nehele one year to decide if Cassidy would become the fully acknowledged Queen of Dena Nehele.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have access to Cassidy\u2019s court here, so she couldn\u2019t use her skills to coax the men into believing she was the better choice. That meant she didn\u2019t have an already formed court to claim, and that meant she was going to have to entice twelve males here to serve in her First Circle, andthat meant she couldn\u2019t be seen as lacking in any way.</p><p>Which meant getting a Sceltie.</p><p>*Laska, please attend.*</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t been with her when she first arrived in Grayhaven. Cassidy\u2019s First Circle wouldn\u2019t recognize him, so Cassidy would be the only person he\u2019d have to avoid. He\u2019d be able to slip in and out of that stupid Shalador village, fetching her a special little friend in exchange for being allowed to go home, which was theonly thing her First Circle seemed to want to do anymore.</p><p>And once she had a Sceltie to help her entertain the men Theran brought here to meet her,no one would remember old Freckledy\u2019s name.</p><p>Wrapping himself in a sight shield, Laska dropped from the Summer-sky Wind to the northern landing web in Eyota. A handful of men were outside the small Coach station near the web, talking and playing cards. Probably a couple of Coach drivers along with the men who took care of the horses for hire and drove the carriages that served as conveyances for visitors.</p><p>One of the men looked toward the landing web as Laska arrived. After a moment\u2019s study of the area, the man returned his attention to the card game, and Laska snuck away, feeling more confident that he would remain undetected long enough to complete his assignment and return to Grayhaven.</p><p>As he slipped along the village streets, looking for the required prize, he wondered why he couldn\u2019t approach one of Cassidy\u2019s First Circle and just ask for a dog. Why had Kermilla emphasized the need for stealth? Had she already asked Cassidy and the request had been refused? Or was Kermilla using this as a pissing contest to prove her court was better than the court Cassidy now ruled? That a member ofher court, a Summer-sky Warlord, could slip in and out of a village that several Warlord Princes regarded as their personal territory?</p><p>He didn\u2019t care anymore what Kermilla wanted. Her appeal had soured at a devastating speed once she had control of a court, and despite having months left in his contract, he was already counting the days until he wasn\u2019t hers to command.</p><p>A dog barked. Laska hurried toward the sound. Then he turned a corner, stopped, and swore under his breath.</p><p>There were Scelties here all right, the first ones he\u2019d seen. But he was on the main street of the damn village, and there were an awful lot of people out and about.</p> <p>Maybe that would work to his advantage. With so many people milling about, who would notice him in a crowd? And he wouldn\u2019t have to go all the way back to the landing web. Courtesy and formality dictated that landing webs be used when arriving or leaving a village, but people could catch or drop from the Winds anywhere along the way. He didn\u2019t even need to catch the Summer-sky Wind. Any of the lighter Webs would do. There wasn\u2019t a thread of any Wind he could access running over the main street, but he\u2019d be able to findsomething between here and the landing web.</p><p>He could grab a Sceltie and be gone from this village before anyone realized the dog was missing. And once Kermilla had a special little friend, he would be allowed to go home.</p><p>With that in mind, Laska retreated and circled round to approach the main street from the other direction.</p><p>Breathing in that first scent of autumn, Ranon stopped at Elders\u2019 Park and looked at the main street of Eyota, his heart aching with pride.</p><p>They had done so much. The businesses owned by Daemon Sadi were in operation. The Lady\u2019s Pleasure\u2014named, he\u2019d been told, for Lady Angelline\u2019s enjoyment of the beverage\u2014served coffee imported from Kaeleer, which was much smoother than the rough drink he\u2019d always known as coffee. They also served small cups of thick hot chocolate\u2014frightfully expensive, but a drink a young man bought a lady he wanted to impress. Small sandwiches and pastries were also served.</p><p>The coffee shop provided a playroom and a fenced outdoor play area for young children so that mothers could have a quiet moment to visit with friends. The shop had hired two young witches to watch the children, as well as Kharr and Bryant, two Warlord Scelties with a no-nonsense attitude when it came to herdinganything.</p><p>The shop had been open a week, and it already was an important gathering place, as was Whistler\u2019s Tavern. The tavern also served food\u2014mostly sandwiches in the warm weather, but it would serve soups, stews, and meat pies once the season turned colder.</p><p>Merchants, the variety shop managed by Lord Careth, had received its first shipment of practical goods from Kaeleer, along with a crate of books that would have made Gray whimper in lust if four crates of books for the loaning library hadn\u2019t arrived at the same time. Gray had spent an evening helping the newly hired librarian sort the books just so he could look at them.</p><p>And then there was Heartbeat, the music shop, where Ranon was meeting his grandfather to look over the instruments. Yairen wanted to hear the Scelt whistle, an instrument similar enough to the Shalador flute. Being made of metal instead of wood, the Scelt whistles were less expensive, and Yairen wanted to consider if they could be used as a beginning instrument for youngsters here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up the street to see Yairen,\u201d Ranon told Khollie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here for story time?\u201d</p><p>*Yes.* Khollie wagged his tail. *Wynne is here, and Vae and Darcy are here, and Mist is coming soon.*</p><p>\u201cAll right. If I\u2019m not at the music shop when story time is done, I\u2019ll be nearby.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in amusement, Ranon continued up the street. Next month, when the weather turned colder, the weekly afternoon story time would move to the room in Heartbeat where performances and lessons would be held. Indoors or outdoors, hearing Shalador stories told in public was a strange experience for the whole village.</p><p>Having Scelties in the audience who wouldn\u2019t tolerate children misbehaving and interrupting the storyteller was also a strange experience. Not that there was much misbehavior but, somehow, it was more shaming to be nipped by a Sceltie than cuffed by an adult.</p><p>Hurt more, too.</p><p>He entered the shop and nodded to the Shaladoran couple who had been hired to run the shop and teach music. Laithan taught Shalador flute and the fiddle. He had been one of Yairen\u2019s students\u2014one of the last to learn from the Tradition Keeper before the old man\u2019s hands were broken for good. Jade had a lovely voice and ran two classes to teach the traditional Shalador songs. Mostly, though, Jade ran the business end of the shop.</p><p>And Lizzie, the Sceltie who had claimed the music shop asher place, ran everyone.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, grandson,\u201d Yairen said. \u201cLaithan has given me some of his time to hear the drum that came from the Isle of Scelt. Now it is your turn so I can hear the metal flute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think our traditional songs sound right on the Scelt whistle,\u201d Laithan said, \u201cbut Dena Nehele folk songs suit the instrument\u2019s range. Jade has sorted out most of the music that arrived. I\u2019ll see if there is anything that was written specifically for these whistles.\u201d</p><p>Ranon picked up a whistle. It was shorter and half the circumference of a Shalador flute, but the finger holes were the same. Setting his fingers, he blew a note.</p><p>A different sound than the wooden flute. A sharper sound. But pleasing all the same. He tried a piece of a traditional Shalador song and then a folk song from Dena Nehele. Laithan was right; the folk songs sounded better than the music of Shalador.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Laithan said, returning with several sheets of music. \u201cTry one of these.\u201d</p><p>Ranon looked over the music. Folk songs, he guessed. One had a lively pace; the other was slower. He chose the slower piece\u2014and he understood why the Shalador people might find common ground with the music of Scelt.</p><p>Bright and yet bittersweet. A sound that slipped past the mind and spoke to the heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he said a few minutes later, setting the whistle on the counter.</p><p>\u201cA gift,\u201d Laithan said, \u201calong with this music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaithan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for you coming to play here once or twice a month.\u201d Laithan laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t make such a face, Ranon. You won\u2019t have to perform alone. I\u2019ve kept one of these whistles for myself because I want to become acquainted with this music too. One night of Shalador music and one night of Scelt to teach and entertain our people through the winter months.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cDeal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ranon shook hands. \u201cDeal.\u201d Then he vanished whistle and music and looked at his grandfather. \u201cWould you like to\u2014\u201d</p><p>*Ranon!*</p><p>The dog sounded panicked. *Khollie? What\u2019s wrong?* By the time Ranon turned away from the counter and took the first step, Lizzie had passed through the door and charged down the street.</p> <p>*Ranon!*</p><p>More than panic now. All he heard was terror.</p><p>Ranon burst out of Heartbeat and headed down the street, not quite running as he shaped a tight, double layer of Opal shields around himself\u2014the kind of shielding a Warlord Prince used on a killing field.</p><p>Not quite running toward the commotion near Elders\u2019 Park, but aware of everything around him. Aware of confused feelings edging toward anger that created a psychic buzz so thick and harsh it was almost a sound. Aware of Wynne and Kharr herding the children who had come for story time into a tight flock that could be defended. Aware of Vae, Darcy, and Lizzie snapping and snarling as they circled around something that kept trying to move away from Elders\u2019 Park and all the people.</p><p>*Ranon?* Archerr called. *What in the name of Hell is going on?*</p> <p>*I don\u2019t know.* Ranon slowed down as he scanned the street. *The Scelties are all acting strange. Maybe a piglet or chicken got loose and they\u2019re making a game of herding it.* But he\u2019d see or hear an animal if it was caught between the three dogs. And that didn\u2019t explain Wynne and Kharr\u2019s behavior\u2014or why he couldn\u2019t spot Khollie.</p><p>Then Vae charged the empty space within the Sceltie triangle and hitsomething with a blast of Purple Dusk power.</p><p>A sight shield broke, revealing an unknown Warlord.</p><p>Ranon froze for just a moment as he remembered the day the Scelties arrived in Eyota and how one of them had located Archerr by scent, despite the Warlord Prince being sight shielded.</p><p>They had known he was there. He\u2019d slipped past us, but they had . . .</p><p>That was when he saw the rest, and a cold rage burned through him as he strode down the street.</p> <p>The bastard had a hand around Khollie\u2019s neck, holding the dog off the ground that way. Not by the scruff,by the neck.</p><p>The Scelties looked at him and hesitated a moment, then resumed their attack, hitting the defensive shields the stranger threw around himself.</p><p>At first Ranon wondered why Vae and the others were throwing themselves against the stranger\u2019s shields. That tactic was draining the Scelties\u2019 power as well as the Warlord\u2019s, and Ranon thought it a waste of their strength until he realized the brilliance of their fight. The dumb, two-legged sheep was caught in a snapping triangle, unable to run away\u2014and too harried to notice the enraged Warlord Princes closing in on him.</p><p>As he moved toward the fight, Ranon\u2019s eyes flicked from one side of the street to the other. Kharr and Wynne had the children and elders well shielded. Shaddo and Archerr were coming up the street to flank the bastard. Vae, Darcy, and Lizzie continued their relentless attack, wearing down the Warlord\u2019s power and shields.</p><p>And Khollie . . .</p><p>Khollie hung limp and unmoving in the bastard\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Ranon called in his fighting knife and used Craft to create a flash of light on the blade, deliberately forcing the Warlord\u2019s attention on himself now.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Ranon snarled.</p> <p>The Warlord shifted his arm to use Khollie\u2019s hanging body as a shield. \u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of them.\u201d He sounding desperate. \u201cWe only want one. We\u2019ll take this one. He\u2019s already damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d Ranon\u2019s voice sounded barely human. \u201cLet my little brother go!\u201d</p><p>No way for the man to catch the Winds from this part of the street. No way for the Warlord to get away, not with the three Scelties keeping him pinned. No chance of the bastard winning a fight, not with three Warlord Princes standing on this killing field ready to rip him apart.</p><p>Then Darkmist charged up the street, heading straight for the Warlord.</p><p>Perfect. If Darkmist hit the Warlord in the back, that would be the distraction Ranon needed to strike without endangering Khollie.</p><p>*Vae,* Ranon said. *As soon as I break that bastard\u2019s shields, you grab Khollie and run.*</p><p>*We will catch Khollie,* she replied, continuing to keep the Warlord in position for the best strike.</p><p>He kept his eyes on the stranger, but he couldfeel Darkmist and knew the moment he needed to unleash a punch of Opal power and break the man\u2019s shields so the dog could strike.</p><p>A second after the shields broke, Darkmist leaped . . . andmissed. The man\u2019s open coat flapped as the dog sailed past.</p><p>An odd look flashed over the Warlord\u2019s face as he staggered a step and dropped Khollie. At the same time, Vae leaped, grabbed one of Khollie\u2019s front legs, and kept going, running on air and pulling Khollie with her as Darcy and Lizzie scattered.</p><p>Then Ranon noticed the blood on Darkmist\u2019s muzzle. Saw the thing in Darkmist\u2019s jaws beat once, twice. And once more before those jaws closed on a still-beating heart.</p><p>Darkmist whirled to face the Warlord. Ranon felt the punch of furious Opal power\u2014and saw the man\u2019s head puff for a moment before he fell to the ground.</p><p>The dog hadn\u2019t missed. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. The dog hadn\u2019t missed. He\u2019dpassed through the man\u2019s body and snatched the heart right out of the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>The thought of the skill and training it took to do something like that knocked Ranon back from the killing edge.</p><p>Vanishing the knife, he rushed over to the spot where Vae guarded Khollie. He dropped to his knees and reached for the little dog\u2014and snatched his hand back in time to keep from losing a finger as Mist, still riding the killing edge, dropped the heart and snapped at him.</p><p>\u201cLet me help him, Mist,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother, but he\u2019s my friend. Step back now.Step back. \u201d</p><p>There were sounds all around him now, people all around now, but the only thing that mattered was the other Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>Mist took a step back. His eyes were still glazed and he still growled. Probably wasn\u2019t even aware of it.</p><p>Watching Mist, Ranon placed a hand on Khollie. \u201cKhollie?\u201d He felt the dog\u2019s heart beat, felt the lungs rise and fall with each breath. \u201cKhollie?\u201d He began a careful exploration, hesitating when he got to the neck. Was it damaged?</p><p>The dark eyes, usually filled with joy, were closed.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Ranon,\u201d Shaddo said, approaching carefully since there were two Opal Warlord Princes whose tempers were unpredictable right now. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ranon stripped off his shirt and wrapped Khollie in it before he stood up and looked around. \u201cI need to get him to Shira, but I . . . we . . . walked over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Ranon, here.\u201d Guard Jaego hurried up with his horse.</p><p>Ranon took a step, then looked at Shaddo and Archerr.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a place to store the carrion until Talon rises and can get a look at the bastard,\u201d Archerr said.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of things here.\u201d</p><p>Freed of any duties beyond the dog in his arms, Ranon mounted Jaego\u2019s horse and galloped back to the Queen\u2019s Residence with Darkmist racing after him.</p><p>One of the Scelties must have alerted the silver twins because Lloyd was waiting for him when he reached the Residence. He dismounted and tossed a rein to the Sceltie, who led the horse to the stables.</p><p>\u201cShira!\u201d Ranon roared as he entered the house. Sweet Darkness, let her be here. He took Khollie into the parlor the court used and laid the dog on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Ranon,\u201d Shira said, rushing into the room. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Seeing Khollie, she shoved him aside so hard she knocked him on his ass.</p><p>He snarled at her, still too furious and too close to the killing edge to tolerate the shove, even from her.</p><p>\u201cPrince Ranon, attend.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s voice. Strong. Demanding. A leash that held his fury.</p><p>Breathing hard, he rose and walked out of the parlor.</p><p>\u201cReport,\u201d Cassidy said, then held up a hand and led him to the meeting room.</p><p>Powell came into the room, followed by Spere, Burne, and Cayle. A moment later, Gray, dirt-streaked and panting, rushed into the room.</p><p>\u201cReport, Ranon,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>He told them everything from the moment he had left Khollie at Elders\u2019 Park for story time to the moment he had wrapped the Sceltie in his shirt and ridden back to the Residence to get help.</p><p>Almost everything. Watching Cassidy\u2019s increasingly pale face, he couldn\u2019t tell her how Darkmist had killed the bastard, couldn\u2019t tell her about seeing the still-beating heart in the dog\u2019s jaws.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Spere said when Ranon stopped talking. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wonder why the fool thought he could get away with it, but why did he do it in the first place?\u201d</p><p>*He belongs to the other Queen.* Vae stood in the doorway. Ranon couldn\u2019t tell if she quivered with anger or fear. *I remember her smells. She is on his clothes.*</p><p>Cassidy swayed. Gray wrapped an arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cKermilla did this?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>*Her smells are on him.* Vae left the room.</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize him, Ranon?\u201d Burne asked.</p><p>Ranon shook his head.</p><p>Cassidy swallowed hard. \u201cIf he belongs to her First Circle, I could identify\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon said. After Darkmist unleashed that punch of Opal power, the man\u2019s head had lookedwrong. Until he figured out why it looked wrong, he wasn\u2019t letting Cassidy near the body. Wasn\u2019t letting Shira near it either.</p><p>\u201cArcherr and Shaddo are going to find a place to store the body until Talon rises,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cAs Master of the Guard, this falls to him now, Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon is correct,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd as Talon\u2019s second-in-command, the decisions of what to do with the enemy are Ranon\u2019s to make, Lady, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she would have argued, but just then Shira appeared in the doorway, hugging herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shira said, coming into the room. \u201cHe\u2019s alive. His heart is beating and he\u2019s breathing. His neck may be bruised, but I have no sense of anything broken. But he\u2019s not there. I can\u2019t wake him up, not with healing Craft or the Hourglass\u2019s Craft. Vae says . . .\u201d Her voice broke, and Ranon watched her pull on all the strength inside her to continue. \u201cVae says sometimes humans try to force kindred to live with them. It\u2019s almost impossible to control the cats once they start growing up because they\u2019re wild and so big. The wolves, like the cats, are too wild, and the horses, unicorns, and dragons are big. But Scelties are small, so sometimes humans try to take them. And s-sometimes a Sceltie goes away to a place deep inside himself, where humans can\u2019t find him. Where humans can\u2019t follow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Tears filled Shira\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe either comes back . . . or he dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Ranon\u2019s voice was rough. \u201cShira, what can we do?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cWe wait. Vae and Darkmist said to leave him wrapped in your shirt because it has your smells. They think that\u2019s a good thing for him right now.\u201d</p><p>She walked out of the room.</p><p>*Ranon?* Archerr called softly.</p><p>*Yeah?*</p><p>*We didn\u2019t know where else to put it, so we brought the body to the Healing House.* Archerr hesitated. *Keep Shira away from here.

Cassidy too.*</p> <p>*Can you put a shield around the Healing House to keep everyone out?*</p><p>*I can. I have, in fact. I\u2019d rather not be inside with . . .that . . . more than I have to.*</p><p>\u201cWhy would Kermilla do that?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cassie,\u201d Gray said gently. \u201cCome away now.\u201d</p><p>Ranon watched Gray lead Cassie out of the room.</p><p>*Ranon?* Janos called.</p> <p>Mother Night. *Where are you? Are you okay?*</p><p>*We\u2019re fine. Reyhana and I got back from a ride and . . . Could you tell Kief to let us go? He\u2019s got us trapped in a stall, and he says we can\u2019t leave until you say it\u2019s safe.*</p><p>On another day, that would have been funny. *We\u2019ve had some trouble, Prince Janos.

I hear you.*</p><p>Andhe heard the Warlord Prince in his brother\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my office if you need me.\u201d Powell touched his arm\u2014a gesture full of understanding\u2014before following Cassidy and Gray out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cBurne and I will head over to Main Street and see what needs to be done,\u201d Spere said.</p><p>Ranon nodded. \u201cJaego was on the street and probably already alerted Rogir, but pull in everyone you can to ride circuits. Make sure the landen community is put on alert, too. I don\u2019t know what kind of game that bitch was trying to play, but we\u2019re not giving her a second chance at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Cayle said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Ranon?\u201d Spere asked.</p><p>\u201cShaddo, Archerr, and I will hold the Queen\u2019s square. Once Talon rises . . .\u201d</p><p>Hours yet. It would be hours yet. And all any of them could do was wait.</p><p>Talon pressed two fingers against the deceased Warlord\u2019s head, then took a step back, shuddering.</p><p>Felt like pebbles in a bag of mush. It would have been less disturbing if the head had exploded from the blast of power. They\u2019d all done that on a killing field at one time or other. But having the ability to explode bone and brains and still leave the skin intact indicated a frightening level of skill in the use of Craft and power.</p><p>More than frightening since that level of skill belonged to a dog who wore Birthright Opal and was still growing into his full strength.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anything like this, Talon?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>The First Circle\u2014and Gray\u2014had gathered at the Healing House to look at this corpse. Talon scanned their faces. Wasn\u2019t one of them who wasn\u2019t sickly pale. Not that he blamed them for that. He was demon-dead, and even he was finding it hard to be in this room.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cPassing flesh through flesh is dangerous to the point of stupidity. Healers do it, sinking their hands into a person to heal injuries inside the body, but that\u2019s a controlled, steady movement, and they spend years training to do it so they don\u2019t lose parts of themselves within the other flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was fast,\u201d Ranon said, his voice oddly hushed. \u201cSo damn fast. I thought he missed. Until I saw the blood on Darkmist\u2019s muzzle and the heart, I thought he missed the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaddo and I were behind this one,\u201d Archerr said, tipping his head to indicate the corpse. \u201cDamned queer feeling, seeing the dog disappear like that. We weren\u2019t even sure what we\u2019d seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hesitation,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cThe Scelties. Before we had time to figure out something was wrong, they\u2019d decided who among them was fighting and who was defending. Fast. Hell\u2019s fire, they were fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t just the Scelties on the street either,\u201d Spere said. \u201cDuffy knew. He told Moore there was an attack in the village, then left Moore to defend the people working in the landen community while he went out for the shepherds and livestock. And Keely herded every child in the Queen\u2019s square who was playing outside into the nearest house.\u201d</p><p>Talon listened to them all. Strong men. Good men. And every one of them, himself included, hadn\u2019t really understood what lived inside those small furry bodies. Despite being around Vae, they really hadn\u2019t understood that these dogs were Blood who had been given exceptional training in Craft\u2014and in fighting.</p><p>Once things calmed down, he was going to find out exactly what the Scelties could do.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t waiting for me,\u201d Ranon said quietly. \u201cVae could have taken that bastard. She wears Purple Dusk. He wore Summer-sky. She and Lizzie and Darcy were holding him in place, keeping him pinned, but she could have broken his defensive shields and attacked. I thought she was waiting for me to reach the fight.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey were waiting for Darkmist.\u201d</p><p>That bruises you, doesn\u2019t it?Talon thought.It hurts your heart some to realize they weren\u2019t sure they could count on you to defend one of them. Now you all know the answer.</p><p>Powell cleared his throat. \u201cHow did this man manage to get his hands on Khollie in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnatched him,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cAccording to Darcy, the three of them heard a man\u2019s voice calling to them. Vae didn\u2019t like something about the voice and stayed put, but it sounded friendly, and Khollie had no reason to think anyone in the village would hurt him, so he moved toward it. So did Darcy, but from another direction. That\u2019s why he picked up the scent and realized the voice was coming from someone who was sight shielded. That made him wary, and he stopped. But Khollie was already close enough to grab. The moment he disappeared, Darcy and Vae warned the other Scelties and launched their attack. You know the rest.\u201d</p><p>Talon didn\u2019t know nearly enough, but he knew what had to be done next. \u201cArcherr, Spere, and Haele are coming with me. Ranon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>Talon shook his head. Ranon\u2019s eyes were too bright, and he couldn\u2019t tell if the Shaladoran\u2019s temper was leaning toward hot or cold. Which meant Ranon was too unpredictable for this assignment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold my tongue and my temper,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cYou have my word on it. But if you\u2019re taking this back to the mansion, I want to stand as witness. For Khollie\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d He\u2019d give in for Ranon, but not for Gray. \u201cYou\u2019re needed here, Gray. Cassie\u2019s parents are home in Dharo. Even if we sent a message now, they couldn\u2019t get back to Eyota until tomorrow. That means Cassie needs you to be here with her. Your duty is to your Queen, Prince.\u201d</p><p>He watched Gray absorb the words\u2014and felt relieved when Gray nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of you split up. I want the landing webs, north and east, guarded at all times. Anyone can drop from the Winds anywhere along the thread, but from now on, we consider anyone a potential enemy who doesn\u2019t arrive in the village at the landing webs or refuses to tell the guard on duty his business in our village.\u201d Talon flipped the blanket over the corpse, glad to hide that head. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>And may the Darkness have mercy on me if Theran knew about this.</p><p>Gray found Cassidy in the garden, leaning against one of the big trees.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He drew her against him, back to chest, and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to tell Jaenelle?\u201d Cassidy asked, her voice breaking. \u201cShe trusted me to look after the kindred. She wouldn\u2019t have allowed them to come here otherwise. What am I supposed to tell her?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips against her temple. \u201cNothing. Tonight, there is nothing to say. We\u2019ll know more in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms and held on to him while she wept.</p><p>He held on too and hoped with everything in him that Khollie would wake up because, better than Cassie ever could, he understood the seductive lure of going away from fear and pain and never coming back. Even if that meant dying.</p><p>Julien opened the parlor door and said, \u201cPrince Grayhaven, Prince Talon needs to speak with you. It is urgent.\u201d</p><p>Theran glanced at Kermilla as he set aside his book and rose. She\u2019d become more and more agitated throughout the afternoon, although she\u2019d refused to tell him why. Even Jhorma couldn\u2019t get an answer from her. Now, hearing Talon\u2019s name, she looked frightened.</p><p>\u201cBardoc, stay with the Lady,\u201d Jhorma said as he pushed away from the card table and approached Theran.</p><p>Jhorma had no business assuming he could be part of this meeting, but Theran wasn\u2019t going to argue. Jhorma was a rival for Kermilla\u2019s affections\u2014and her bed\u2014but lately he\u2019d shown himself to be a sensible man who had a fair amount of court polish. And right now, Theran wasn\u2019t going to turn away anyone\u2019s help. \u201cJulien, tell Prince Talon\u2014\u201d</p><p>Talon walked into the room, brushing Julien aside. Ranon, Archerr, Spere, and Haele followed him, carrying a stretcher that held a blanket-wrapped bundle.</p><p>\u201cTheran,\u201d Talon said. \u201cLord Jhorma.\u201d He looked at Kermilla, who was still sitting at the card table, and said nothing\u2014a deliberate social cut.</p><p>\u201cI think this belongs to your Lady,\u201d Talon said, turning his attention back to Theran. Using Craft he pulled aside the blanket far enough to reveal the head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Jhorma whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s Laska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaska?\u201d Kermilla squeaked.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Theran asked.</p> <p>The look in Talon\u2019s eyes. Hard. Unforgiving.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon, this man came to the village of Eyota and tried to abduct a young Warlord,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThe youngster\u2019s brother, a Warlord Prince, eliminated the enemy. Afterwards, a member of the court identified the man as one ofhers. So we have returned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took a lot of rage to do that,\u201d Jhorma said, staring at Laska.</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason for the rage,\u201d Talon replied, his eyes never leaving Theran.</p><p>Theran\u2019s heart banged against his chest. \u201cIs the youngster all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Healer has done all she can. We don\u2019t know if it will be enough,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Hard eyes. Unforgiving eyes. Accusing eyes.</p><p>*Hell\u2019s fire, Talon, how bad is it?* Theran asked. *Why would Laska do it?*</p><p>*As for why, ask your Lady,* Talon replied. *As for how bad . . . We won\u2019t know that until we know if the youngster will live.*</p><p>Theran looked at Ranon. Cold, black fury inthose eyes. And pain.</p><p>Mother Night.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate you returning the body to us,\u201d Jhorma said. \u201cI recognize the courtesy you have extended to us in doing so. I will take the body back to Dharo. Shame will shroud his family\u2019s grief because there was no honor in how Laska died, but his family will still grieve.\u201d</p><p>*Talon, I am so sorry,* Theran said.</p><p>*Laska\u2019s family isn\u2019t the only one who has a reason to feel shame because of this.* Talon walked out of the room.</p><p>After lowering the stretcher to the floor, Ranon and the other men followed Talon. Julien hurried out after them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave as soon as I\u2019m packed.\u201d Jhorma vanished the body and stretcher.</p><p>\u201cLet Bardoc give you a hand with the packing.\u201d</p><p>Jhorma gave Theran a long look, then signaled Bardoc, who joined them with too much haste.</p><p>\u201cI think Bardoc should accompany me to Dharo,\u201d Jhorma said. \u201cHe and Laska came from the same village. He knows the family.\u201d</p> <p>Theran nodded. He didn\u2019t care what Jhorma did, not when all his hopes for Dena Nehele were breaking around him.</p><p>He closed the door behind Jhorma and Bardoc\u2014and put a Green lock on it. Then he turned to face Kermilla, who had left the card table and was now standing in the middle of the room, looking pale and scared.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Laska doing in Eyota?\u201d He moved toward her while his temper strained the leash. \u201cHe had no reason to be there. He hadno business being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kermilla said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d He stopped, not willing to tempt his control by getting too close to her. \u201cHe\u2019s a member of your court. You have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Some anger in her voice and eyes now that he was challenging her.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Kermilla. Do you know what this has done to your reputation? One of your First Circle tried to abduct a young Warlord. I can tell you two reasons the Warlord Princes are going to think of when they hear about this: torture and rape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaska wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d Kermilla snapped. \u201cLaska wouldn\u2019tdo that. I wouldnever have anyone in my court who would do that!\u201d</p><p>You would have brought Garth and Brok into your court. If you could overlook one kind of rapist, why not another?</p><p>He pushed that thought away and buried it deep.</p><p>\u201cThen what was he doing in that village, and what was he doing with that boy that would piss off a brother enough to kill Laskathat way?\u201d Theran shouted.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t getting a boy!\u201d she screamed. \u201cHe went there to get me a Sceltie!\u201d</p><p>Theran took a step back, staggered by the foolishness that cost a man his life\u2014and probably cost the rest of them in other ways.</p><p>\u201cA Sceltie.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, woman, have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord Princes are all so impressed that Cassidy has some, and they\u2019re not going to take me seriously until I have one too.\u201d Tears filled her eyes and her lower lip trembled. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have missed one in that stupid village. Besides, you sent Correne away, and that awful Talon killed Garth and Brok, and I wanted company.You\u2019re always too busy to pay attention to me even though yousay you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this ismy fault because I\u2019m working in every way I can to get this town through the coming winter?\u201d He paced, circled, wanted to tear up the room and smash the furniture. But he couldn\u2019t afford to replace whatever he destroyed, so he held his temper and circled. And paced.</p><p>\u201cEven if Laska had managed to snatch one without being detected, how would you have held on to it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019rekindred, Kermilla.Blood. Didn\u2019t you notice anything while Vae was here? She\u2019s awitch. She wears a Purple Dusk Jewel. Mother Night, woman,she outranks you. \u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s fact, Kermilla. Vae\u2019s Jewels outrank yours. So what were you going to do with this Warlord if he didn\u2019t want to stay here? Chain him? Cage him? Beat him and torture him until he was too broken down in body and spirit to run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be of any use if he was like that.\u201d She stamped her foot. \u201cBut hewould have wanted to stay with me. Once he got here, he would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d Theran sank into the nearest chair, leaned back and closed his eyes.</p><p>Kermilla wasn\u2019t like the Queen who had tortured Gray. Shewasn\u2019t. But she\u2019d made an error in judgment that would not be fixed easily. If he could fix it at all.</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d Kermilla climbed into his lap and pressed against him. \u201cTheran, I\u2019m sorry about this little trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your men died. That\u2019s not a little trouble,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cTalon, the most respected man in this land, is against you. That\u2019s not a little trouble. The fact that Talon isn\u2019t making a distinction between kindred and human Blood in this instance . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cIn a couple of days, every Warlord Prince is going to know that you sent a man to Eyota to abduct a young Warlord, and no one is going to care if you intended to take a boy or a dog.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled down and put her head on his shoulder. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He put his arms around her, unable to deny her whatever comfort he could give. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Ranon stood in the parlor doorway, unable to take that last step into the room. Vae looked up from her spot on the sofa and gave him one tail-tip wag. Darkmist, who was on the floor in front of the sofa, gave him no greeting but also didn\u2019t challenge his presence.</p><p>A hesitant touch of a hand on his back. He turned and followed Shira to the healing room in the Residence. As soon as she closed the door, he pulled her into his arms and held on.</p><p>\u201cI was ashamed that the least of them had chosen me,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cI felt embarrassed when Ferall and the others saw him that day. And now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Ranon, hush,\u201d she said as she stroked his back.</p><p>\u201cIs he coming back to us, Shira?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d</p><p>He eased back enough to rest his forehead against hers. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray took Cassie upstairs. She\u2019s distraught. Powell has been in his office since you left. The rest of the First Circle and the guards have been patrolling the village in shifts. I sent Reyhana and Janos to your grandfather for the night. They spent hours in the parlor this evening, taking turns readingSceltie Saves the Day, and they both needed to be away for a while. Vae and Darkmist have been here all the time. The other Scelties come for an hour, then go out with one of the men to patrol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShira . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hiding under your shirt.\u201d She said the words quickly, as if she needed to silence any questions she couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cVae thinks that\u2019s a good sign because he\u2019s been making tiny movements to get himself completely covered. You can\u2019t see anything but the tip of his nose now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired, love. I was in a fight once that lasted a whole day. It was a relentless battle on a killing field, so we were all committed to winning or dying. Barely had time for a sip of water or a mouthful of food in the rare spaces between one enemy and the next. When I finally walked off that field, I didn\u2019t feel this tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to bed,\u201d Shira said, caressing his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Khollie up with us. Maybe we\u2019ll both get a little rest that way.\u201d</p><p>He followed her back into the parlor and very carefully lifted the bundle hidden in his shirt. They went up to their room, and he tucked Khollie on the bed between them.</p><p>The last thing he remembered after stretching out on the bed was linking fingers with Shira.</p><p>*Ranon?*</p><p>A scared little whisper of a voice, but enough to have his eyes opening to stare at the bedroom ceiling.</p><p>*Ranon?*</p><p>Ranon turned his head to look at the bundle on the bed. *Khollie?*</p><p>Pinching a little of the shirt, he eased it back until he could see the dog\u2019s head\u2014and the dark eyes staring at him.</p><p>*Hey, little brother. We were worried about you.*</p><p>Khollie peered at his surroundings. *I am on the bed. I am not supposed to be on the bed. It is a Shira rule.*</p><p>*I know. But she said you were allowed this one time.*</p><p>*Ranon? I need a tree.*</p><p>*You want some food too?*</p><p>*Yes.*</p><p>*Come on, then. We\u2019ll see what we can find.*</p><p>He helped Khollie untangle himself from the shirt, then eased out of bed.</p><p>Shira immediately woke up. \u201cRanon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cKhollie and I are going to get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over to look at Khollie, who gave her a quick lick on the chin before jumping off the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>As Ranon let them out of the room, he heard her muffled sob.</p><p>He closed the door as quietly as he could, but he\u2019d barely taken a step before Cassie\u2019s door opened and Gray stood there.</p> <p>He knew about Yaslana\u2019s rules concerning Gray and Cassie\u2019s physical relationship. Hell\u2019s fire,everyone knew about Lucivar\u2019s rules.

I have to go too. We will go together. Ranon will guard us.*</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d He put an Opal shield around the backyard. Nothing would get in\u2014or out\u2014without him knowing about it.</p><p>He stood in the doorway, watching, and didn\u2019t turn when Gray came up behind him.</p><p>\u201cI told Cassie that Khollie woke up,\u201d Gray said. \u201cShe wants to cry by herself for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShira is crying too.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t fair to ask, but there was no one else he could ask. \u201cWill Khollie be all right, Gray?\u201d</p> <p>Those green eyes held too much knowledge. Then Gray said, \u201cWe\u2019ll help him be all right.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Saetan sat on the wide arm of a stuffed chair and watched a storm gather in one of the Keep\u2019s sitting rooms.</p><p>The first warning of trouble had been the two Warlords who arrived at the Keep a couple days ago. They wanted passage through the Gate in order to return to Dharo\u2014and they brought the body of another man.</p><p>The second warning had come in a note from Daemon yesterday, requesting his presence at a meeting. Official, careful wording. Not a message from son to father but from Consort to Steward.</p><p>When Jaenelle was pissed off about something, she didn\u2019t seem to remember that she no longer had an official court.</p><p>And no one was ballsy enough to remind her. Including him.</p> <p>The third warning was Daemon\u2019s note to Draca, asking the Keep\u2019s Seneschal to accommodate several overnight guests.</p><p>Saetan wanted to believe the meeting was being held at the Keep to accommodate Lucivar, who still felt uneasy about leaving Marian on her own for too long. But when the others began to arrive, he knew why Jaenelle had chosen the Keep: It was the Sanctuary\u2014and lair\u2014of Witch.</p><p>Jaenelle and Daemon arrived first. She wore a cobwebby, spidersilk dress known as Widow\u2019s weeds, and her Jewel was mostly Gray with streaks of Red and Sapphire\u2014and a single thread of Black. Daemon wore a face that revealed nothing of his thoughts or feelings. He wasn\u2019t there as Jaenelle\u2019s husband or Consort or as the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan. He was in that room as the Queen\u2019s weapon.</p><p>Lucivar walked in. \u201cCat, what\u2019s this\u2014\u201d He looked at Daemon\u2019s face and didn\u2019t finish the question.</p><p>Sabrina came in next, tense and nervous, followed by Aaron, Morghann, and Khardeen.</p><p>Four of Jaenelle\u2019s childhood friends,Saetan thought as he watched Sabrina greet the others.Four people who had served in Witch\u2019s First Circle. Will they still be friends when this discussion is over?</p><p>Jaenelle sat on a half sofa across from several chairs. Daemon sat beside her, his right arm stretched out over the sofa\u2019s back, looking calm and lazy.</p><p>Saetan watched the way Lucivar prowled the room without ever turning his back to Daemon and felt a shiver of fear.</p><p>The women sat. Aaron and Khardeen remained on their feet, tense and alert.</p><p>Then Karla walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cKiss kiss. Sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d She made her way to the chair closest to Saetan\u2019s. \u201cI was trying to undo an . . . incident . . . that turned a large white cat into a bright pink and blue cat.\u201d</p><p>A flash of warm humor from Jaenelle flowed through the room. \u201cDid you fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I left, KaeAskavi was an evenly tinted mauve cat\u2014and he wasnot happy.\u201d</p><p>That produced a few chuckles, but the humor quickly faded as all their attention focused on Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cI received a letter from Cassidy yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt you should all know what happened and that we should come to an agreement about what will\u2014and will not\u2014be done.\u201d</p><p>She called in the letter and handed it to Daemon. Lucivar immediately came around to the back of the sofa to read over his brother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Daemon read the letter and handed it to Khardeen. That beautiful face revealed nothing, and there was nothing Saetan could detect on a psychic thread, even at the level of the Black. Daemon had his emotions tightly leashed.</p><p>But the room grew cold.</p><p>Lucivar, on the other hand, began swearing softly, viciously in Eyrien as he resumed his prowling.</p><p>Hot anger. Cold fury. The room filled with temper as, one by one, the friends who had been First Circle in the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi read Cassidy\u2019s letter. Finally Karla read it and passed it to him as he called in his half-moon glasses.</p><p>How many times did Cassidy write that letter before she achieved sentences that were so carefully honest? She didn\u2019t accuse anyone of anything. She didn\u2019t offer opinions or feelings. She didn\u2019t report anything that hadn\u2019t been witnessed. She didn\u2019tsay Kermilla had given the order, but there wasn\u2019t a single person in the room who couldn\u2019t read between the lines. The only break from that control was Cassidy\u2019s excessive assurances that Khollie was still a little frightened because of the incident but they were confident that he would recover completely.</p><p>Which meant there had been some doubt that Khollie would recover at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell is going on there?\u201d Khary said.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t Cassie\u2019s fault,\u201d Aaron snapped, instantly ready to defend his cousin.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was,\u201d Khary snapped back. \u201cBut something should be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will be done,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly. \u201cAt least, not by us.\u201d</p><p>Daemon stiffened. Nothing anyone else would notice, but Saetan had been keeping a wary eye on him and saw the change.</p><p>He knows something. Or suspects something. But his tongue, like his temper, is held by the Queen\u2019s will, and he\u2019ll tell us nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Kermilla still doing in Dena Nehele anyway?\u201d Sabrina snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou were aware she had gone to visit Cassidy?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd aware of her mistreatment of a servant while she was a guest there. Believe me, that will weigh heavily in my decision about whether she\u2019s going to continue rulinganything in my Territory.\u201d Sabrina paced back and forth behind the chairs. \u201cBut that happened in early summer. We\u2019re into the autumn harvest now. What\u2019s she still doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCausing more trouble?\u201d Khary suggested.</p><p>\u201cKhary,\u201d Morghann said in quiet warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hush him, Morghann, he\u2019s right,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cKermilla has no business being there, and it\u2019s past time to go to Dena Nehele and haul the bitch\u2019s ass home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take action outside of your own Territory, Sabrina. That line was drawn thousands of years ago, and it does not\u2014cannot\u2014change.\u201dBecause that was the line Dorothea and Hekatah crossed in their efforts to take control of the whole Realm of Terreille. As much as I love all of you, for the good of the Realms and the Blood, I will kill any one of you who tries to cross that line.</p><p>He glanced at Jaenelle and saw the way Witch looked at him. Looked through him.</p><p>And if it came to that, she would expect me to do nothing less.\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued. \u201cKermilla is, and has been, Theran Grayhaven\u2019s guest these past few weeks, not Cassidy\u2019s. If the Queen of Dena Nehele wants Kermilla out of her Territory, it\u2019s up to her to take care of it\u2014and her First Circle has the strength to do it without help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy\u2019s too polite,\u201d Sabrina snapped at him, then turned to Jaenelle. \u201cThey have a history. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s sapphire eyes held Sabrina. A moment passed. Two.</p><p>Saetan wished fiercely that he was privy to that psychic thread and knew what passed between the two women. Becausesomething had surprised Sabrina enough to drain the Dharo Queen\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to be blind to what\u2019s happening?\u201d Sabrina asked.</p><p>\u201cOutside of your own borders, yes,\u201d Jaenelle replied. Then her lips curved in a sharp, chilly smile. \u201cWould I ask you to be blind to what\u2019s happening within your own borders? Never.\u201d She considered. \u201cAlmost never.\u201d</p><p>Four Queens who began ruling at a young age\u2014as soon as they had made the Offering to the Darkness, in fact. Each one was capable of great compassion\u2014and of being totally ruthless. Saetan watched them, certain that in these few seconds of silence they had reached an agreement of how they would work together to achieve a desired resultwithout crossing that unforgivable line.</p><p>As curious as he was about what had passed between Sabrina and Jaenelle, he was equally certain that hedidn\u2019t want to know what the four Queens had decided to do. And maybe, if he was lucky, he wouldn\u2019t have to know. After all, he was supposed to be retired from the living Realms.</p><p>And the sun might shine in Hell tomorrow.</p><p>*Coward,* Daemon said softly on a Black spear thread.</p><p>A hint of humor, of relaxation. The Queen\u2019s weapon would not be needed tonight.</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord who acted on Kermilla\u2019s orders came from Dharo?\u201d Sabrina asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the assumption, since he didn\u2019t come from Dena Nehele,\u201d Jaenelle replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd the body was brought back to Kaeleer,\u201d Saetan said. When they all stared at him, he lifted an eyebrow. \u201cDraca opened the Gate for them. If you think anyone is more qualified to decide who may use the Gate here at the Keep, then you can take it up with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaenelle was the only person who might be able to challenge Draca\u2019s decision and overrule the Seneschal about who could or couldn\u2019t use the Gate. Since she seemed to have no objection, the rest of them backed away from any criticism they might have had.</p><p>\u201cHow many men are in Kermilla\u2019s First Circle?\u201d Karla asked.</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d Sabrina stared at Karla. \u201cShe had the same twelve men who had been Cassidy\u2019s First Circle.\u201d</p> <p>Karla\u2019s lips curved in a wicked smile. \u201cThen Kermilla\u2019s court is broken, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cBut no court that\u2019s sound breaks because of a death, even when there aren\u2019t more than twelve males in the First Circle. The court continues for a few days, sometimes even weeks, while the Queen considers the men in the Second Circle and decides who will be invited to fill the opening in the First Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she has a Second Circle, Uncle Saetan,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cThe First and Second Circles are paid with the Queen\u2019s tithes. Cassidy didn\u2019t need more than her First Circle to work exclusively on the court\u2019s behalf, so she didn\u2019t have anyone in her Second Circle except youngsters who were with her for training and court polish. I know she paid them because Darlena, the Province Queen who rules that part of Dharo, had been impressed by Cassidy\u2019s generosity as well as by the number of requests she received from youngsters of all castes who were willing to serve in a small village court because of that generosity. Darlena also noticed how many of those youngsters retracted their requests when they learned that Kermilla now ruled Bhak instead of Cassidy. So I don\u2019t think the current Queen of Bhak has anyone who can fill the vacant place in her court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means the court is broken,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly, looking at Sabrina.</p> <p>Sabrina tipped her head. \u201cIf her court doesn\u2019t tell me, I can pretend not to know.\u201d</p><p>Aaron swore but did nothing else because he, like the rest of them, knew there was a reason Jaenelle wanted some things to be ignored.</p><p>Even if she chose not to tell any of them the reason.</p><p>\u201cThere was an interesting miscalculation when the summer tithes for Bhak and Woolskin were sent to Darlena\u2019s Steward,\u201d Sabrina continued. \u201cIt was swiftly corrected, but Gallard had never made that kind of miscalculation when he served Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTried to short the Province Queen of her rightful share of the tithes?\u201d Khary asked.</p><p>Sabrina\u2019s smile was sufficient answer. \u201cI think my Steward and Darlena\u2019s should personally collect the autumn tithes from a few of the District Queens and review their court accounts.\u201d She looked at Jaenelle. \u201cDon\u2019t you think? That would be a fair warning to a Queen who had been granted a provisional year to prove herself\u2014especially if she truly wanted to retain those villages as her territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho gives a piss about being fair?\u201d Lucivar growled.</p><p>Saetan felt his temper rise, but before he could respond, Daemon said mildly, \u201cWe all give a piss about being fair when it buys needed time.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stopped prowling and stared at Daemon. \u201cOh.That kind of being fair. All right, fine. But someone should still go to Dena Nehele and explain to that bitch that a young Warlord can\u2019t be snatched off the street just because he has four legs and fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s been taken care of,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d Lucivar demanded.</p><p>\u201cBy someone who can explain things even better than you.\u201d Jaenelle smiled at Lucivar.</p><p>Lucivar took a step back and resumed his prowling.</p><p>After a few moments of uneasy silence, Khary said, \u201cThere might not be much we can do about Kermilla right now, but I can go to Eyota tomorrow and bring Khollie home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can take Khollie anywhere without a fight,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Khary gave Jaenelle, then Morghann, a hard stare. \u201cHe\u2019s delicate. You bothknow that. And Ranon didn\u2019t want him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was true then isn\u2019t true now. Ranon needed some time to gain clarity in his feelings.\u201d</p><p>Khary made a rude noise. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly.</p><p>Silence as the men took a long moment to assess the implications of that statement.</p><p>One of us,Saetan thought. Those three words told him a great deal about Ranon\u2014and explained even more why Jaenelle had avoided telling him any details about her meeting with the Shalador Warlord Prince. Damned hard to insist that you were a \u201cformer\u201d ruler when a newly met Warlord Prince recognized a bond with you that could hold him.</p><p>When Gray had recognized her asthe Queen, Jaenelle had slid around facing the truth that she wasn\u2019t a former anything by arguing that Gray was confused by his developing sense of being a Warlord Prince. But there was nothing wrong with Ranon that she could use as an excuse.</p><p>Which made this particular meeting even more interesting.</p><p>\u201cWhat Circle?\u201d Khary finally asked.</p><p>\u201cSecond,\u201d Jaenelle replied.</p><p>Meaning, if the Dark Court still officially existed, Ranon would have been accepted into the Second Circle. Not as intimate a companion as someone in the First Circle, but those who served in the Second were still close enough\u2014and trusted enough\u2014for confidential assignments and direct service to the Queen.</p><p>\u201cAnd Gray?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cSecond Circle,\u201d she said.</p><p>Anger still smeared the room, but it no longer had heat or teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it then,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cNot quite. I received this letter from Cassidy a couple of days ago, before the attempted abduction,\u201d Jaenelle said. She called in another letter and handed it to Khary.</p><p>By the time Khary got halfway through the first page, his mouth was hanging open. \u201cPayment for work?They\u2019re getting paid to herd sheep? \u201d</p><p>\u201cThree coppers a day,\u201d Jaenelle said cheerfully. \u201cWynne and Duffy are also maintaining the spells on the cold boxes and hot water tanks for the landen community and get three coppers a week for each household.\u201d</p><p>Since Khary seemed frozen, Aaron snagged the second page. \u201cOh, Mother Night. Two of them are working in a children\u2019s play area.\u201d</p><p>Sabrina snorted, then had to call in a handkerchief to blow her nose.</p><p>Morghann twisted in her chair so she could read the other side of the page. \u201cThey call Lloyd and Kief the silver twins. And the boys are working in the stables. That\u2019s good. They like horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I understand the Scelties wanting to learn about being paid for work, but what are they going to do with the money?\u201d Daemon said. \u201cSave up their coppers to buy their own little steading and a small flock of sheep?\u201d</p><p>Morghann and Jaenelle looked at Daemon. Just looked at him. And then they smiled.</p><p>Lucivar caught Khary before he landed on the floor, and Saetan watched Daemon\u2014his brilliant, lethal son\u2014turn pale. Probably at the thought of someday having to negotiate a business deal with a Sceltie.</p><p>*Coward,* Saetan said on a Black spear thread.</p><p>Daemon gave him a sideways look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bizarre,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cLadvarian and I own the little cottage and acreage where he trains other Scelties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Khary yelped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daemon whispered.</p><p>Jaenelle looked at Khary. \u201cI thought you knew that. Morghann, didn\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes,\u201d Morghann replied. \u201cBut it seemed best not to mention that bit of paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle patted Daemon\u2019s thigh. \u201cLadvarian and I have owned that property since before you and I got married, so I never thought to mention it. Besides, having that place is so much better than having a dozen Scelties living with us whenever we\u2019re in Maghre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s so much better.\u201d Daemon looked a little woozy.</p><p>\u201cThe relationship between Scelties and humans is too well established in Scelt,\u201d Morghann said. \u201cAnd not all Scelties want to change the relationship they already have with humans. But in a new land, there would be opportunities the Scelties couldn\u2019t explore as easily here.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked around the room without quite looking at one another.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d Karla asked Jaenelle. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re done, I\u2019d like some help in figuring out how to turn a mauve cat back into a white cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraca is serving a late supper in about an hour,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cThat should be enough time,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>For what?Saetan wondered. But it wasn\u2019t a question he would ask because his darling girls might tell him.</p><p>The Ladies left the room, leaving the men to collapse into chairs, not sure if they should be scared or pissed off, or should laugh like fools.</p><p>The room held nothing but a blissful, and exhausted, silence for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cCan you stay for supper?\u201d Daemon asked Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cNo choice,\u201d Lucivar growled. \u201cMarian said if I want to stay married, I\u2019m going to stay out for the whole evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been a bit too possessive lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. She says she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the Healer say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurian also says Marian is fine, so she\u2019s fine. Everyone is supposed to be fine. Well, I\u2019mnot fine. She scared the shit out of me with that miscarriage.\u201d Lucivar snarled. \u201cNext thing she\u2019ll be wanting sex again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do that,\u201d Aaron said sympathetically while Khary nodded. \u201cThey do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then . . .\u201d Saetan began.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>They all straightened up and looked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cSounded like something blew up,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cWhat kind of spell were the girls trying to fix?\u201d</p><p>They all looked at him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Saetan said firmly. \u201cIf you want to find out, you go ahead. I am not leaving this room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other four men looked at one another.</p><p>Daemon held out his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some time before supper. Let me see that letter again.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p> <p>Having exhausted his patience for card playing, Theran left Kermilla sulking over a hand of solitaire and noticed the Sceltie standing perfectly still near the parlor door.</p><p>He moved toward the dog. \u201cVae?\u201d</p><p>No, not Vae. Same coloring but different markings, and a sense of maturity\u2014and power.</p><p>He saw the Red Jewel at the same time Kermilla spotted the dog and hurried toward him, clapping her hands in delight.</p><p>\u201cOh,Theran. You got me a Sceltie.\u201d</p> <p>She took another step. The dog bared his teeth and snarled.</p><p>Kermilla shook her finger. \u201cBad dog!\u201d</p><p>Something more than the Sceltie snarled, and the sound filled the room.</p><p>*I am Lord Ladvarian,* the Sceltie said, staring at Kermilla. *This is Prince Jaal.*</p><p>A large brown cat with black stripes suddenly appeared on Ladvarian\u2019s right, dwarfing the Sceltie. If the cat had the strength that body implied, it could pull down a full-grown horse or cow without any trouble.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about what it could do to a man.</p> <p>Then he noticed the Green Jewel around the cat\u2019s neck and acknowledged the title his mind wanted to deny.Prince Jaal. A Warlord Prince who wore a Jewel equal to his own and had a body he couldn\u2019t match for strength or speed.</p><p>*And this is Prince Kaelas,* Ladvarian said.</p><p>Theran\u2019s bowels turned to water. The white cat now standing on Ladvarian\u2019s left washuge. Even the striped cat looked small in comparison.</p><p>Worse, Kaelas wore a Red Jewel.</p><p>The Sceltie was focused on Kermilla. The cats were focused onhim, and he knew, with absolute certainty, that if anything went wrong now, he had no chance of surviving.</p><p>*You hurt Khollie,* Ladvarian told Kermilla.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>*When you hunt one kindred, you hunt all kindred. Remember that, because the next time you send a male to hunt down one of us, we will come hunting for you.* Ladvarian paused. *This is what Kaelas does to enemies of kindred.*</p> <p>Theran felt a surge of power and realized a moment too late that Ladvarian had forced at least one of Kermilla\u2019s inner barriers open, no doubt to show her exactly what that huge white cat could do.</p><p>She whimpered and her eyes widened. Then she bent over and vomited.</p><p>The dog, damn its heart, put up a shield to keep the kindred from getting splashed as Kermilla heaved, then heaved again.</p><p>Ladvarian looked at him. *You are not a friend.*</p><p>Beads of sweat popped out on his forehead. He\u2019d stood on killing fields. He\u2019d seen slaughter. But he was certain he had never seen anything that could equal what that white cat would do to a man.</p><p>And he was grateful he\u2019d been spared seeing whatever memory had been forced upon Kermilla.</p><p>Ladvarian turned and trotted through the closed parlor door. Jaal followed him. When they were gone, that walking white death stared at him a moment longer\u2014and disappeared.</p><p>Theran froze. Was Kaelas gone? Or was the cat standing there, sight shielded, waiting for him to move, to become prey?</p><p>No sound. Not even breathing. Nothing he could detect.Nothing.</p><p>Then the door began to open. Julien peeked into the room. \u201cPrince Grayhaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get it out?\u201d Kermilla whimpered. \u201cHow am I going to stopseeing that?\u201d</p><p>Theran didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Julien pushed the door open and stepped into the room, a distasteful look on his face when he spotted the mess on the carpet. \u201cPrince, I saw\u2014\u201d He gasped and leaped away from the door. \u201cSomething just brushed past me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s gone.Theran closed his eyes.Thank the Darkness, it\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe our guests will be back,\u201d he said, and almost laughed at how calm he sounded. \u201cI\u2019ll escort the Lady to her room. Can you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Julien looked at the carpet and nodded. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get it cleaned sufficiently, I\u2019ll burn the damn thing.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around Kermilla and led her out of the room.</p><p>On another day, he would have voiced an opinion about a butler deciding whether or not to destroy a carpet he couldn\u2019t afford to replace. Tonight he didn\u2019t have enough balls left to argue with anyone.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten the only warning he would ever get. If those three ever had a reason to come looking for him again, the only sounds he would hear were his own screams.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Daemon lay on his side, facing away from the rest of the bed. When he felt Jaenelle slip under the covers, he pressed his face into the pillow and began chanting silently,Don\u2019t laugh, don\u2019t laugh, don\u2019t laugh.</p><p>If he started laughing again, she would kick his ass out of bed.</p><p>But, damn, it was hard not to laugh when his darling wife looked like a brightly colored, demented sheep. Not that he would saythat. He knew better. Lucivar didn\u2019t, but he knew better.</p><p>Lucivar was sent home with a note from his father explaining to Marian why Lucivarhad to go home before his sister, and Karla, killed him flatter than dead. Whatever that meant.</p><p>Jaenelle poked his back with a finger. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh, don\u2019t laugh, don\u2019t laugh.\u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow Karla and I will figure out what went wrong, and we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He tried to resist and couldn\u2019t. Damn his curiosity, it was going to get him into trouble. But he rolled onto his back so he could look at her\u2014and had to clench his teeth until he gainedsome control. \u201cI was wondering . . .\u201d</p><p>Her sapphire eyes narrowed.</p><p>He made a twirling motion with one finger. \u201cHow did your hair . . . ?\u201d It wasn\u2019t the splotches of bright pink, blue, and mauve in her golden hair that broke his control. It wasn\u2019t even the streaks of green, which made no sense since they weren\u2019t part of the original spell Karla was trying to fix. It was the fact that the colored hair had also corkscrewed and . . .sproinged . . . out from her head.</p><p>Hence Lucivar\u2019s comment about demented sheep.</p><p>Laughter bubbled up. Threatened to spill out.</p><p>Jaenelle huffed and said something in the Old Tongue that was, no doubt,very rude. \u201cGo to sleep. You\u2019re not going to be good for anything else.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Blinked again. The laughter vanished. He looked at the silly little sheep sitting so foolishly close to him and another kind of amusement swelled inside him. And swelled a particular part of him.</p><p>\u201cWas that a challenge?\u201d he purred.</p><p>Her eyes widened. She shifted her hips away from him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sat up. \u201cI think it was. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pounced. Her squeak of surprise as he pinned her to the bed did all kinds of delightful things to the predatory side of his nature. Even better was the way her breath caught after he vanished her nightgown and used his teeth and tongue to give her breasts some lavish attention.</p><p>He closed his teeth over his favorite spot on her neck, followed by soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that laughter can be an aphrodisiac?\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She shook her head. Brightly colored, corkscrew curls bounced against his nose.</p><p>Smiling he raised his head and looked at her. Nerves in those beautiful eyes. Nerves . . . and hot desire.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cThen let me expand your education a little,\u201d he purred.</p><p>She said nothing, so he sheathed himself inside her.</p><p>He expanded her education a whole lot more than a little, but by the time he was done, they were both too exhausted\u2014and too satisfied\u2014to care.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Gray brushed one fingertip over the globe Tersa had given him.</p><p>This is where you are, she\u2019d said.</p><p>Not whole. Not fully formed. Not who he could have been.</p><p>The fire dance celebrated the Shalador males\u2019 sexual and emotional maturity\u2014and acknowledged their willingness to accept adult responsibilities as well as adult pleasures. Would this dance really make a difference in the way Cassie saw him?</p><p>Would it make a difference in the way he saw himself?</p><p>When the time comes, accept the fire that lives within you.</p><p>Brushing a finger over the globe again, he thought,It\u2019s time. Win or lose, it\u2019s time.</p><p>He\u2019d been twenty-two when he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness. Something inside him had swelled and pushed at him, demanding release, demanding that he open himself to his mature potential. But he\u2019d been too emotionally damaged to endure that grueling test of Self, and instead of embracing the dark glory that could have been his, he\u2019d fled from it\u2014and had ended up with a Purple Dusk Jewel that was a little darker than his Birthright Purple Dusk.</p><p>The Offering could be made only once, and what he might have been had been severed by his own fear and refusal to accept it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t reclaim the power that was lost forever, but maybe, with the fire dance, he could finally meet and embrace the man he should be.</p><p>Gray opened the door to his room and found Ranon leaning against the hallway wall, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>He looked at the other Warlord Prince, a man who had become a closer, stronger friend than any he\u2019d ever had. Tonight there was heat in Ranon\u2019s dark eyes. Heat and a glitter that wasn\u2019t temper but wasn\u2019t far removed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d May the Darkness have mercy on him if he wasn\u2019t ready. If he failed this time, too many of his dreams would fail with him.</p><p>They walked out of the Queen\u2019s Residence together, then stopped when they reached the street. Currents of feminine power drifted through the village, along the streets, stropping against Gray\u2019s inner barriers.</p><p>Ranon closed his eyes and breathed deep. Gray had the sense that his friend was breathing in more than air.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d Ranon whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear anything, but he felt it in his blood.</p><p>The drums were calling the men to the dance.</p><p>Ranon took in another breath, then let it out in a sigh as he opened his eyes. \u201cCome on, Gray. It\u2019s time to dance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie was there tonight among the drummers, was there among the women who had come to watch the fire contained in a vessel of male flesh.</p><p>Cassie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray said as he began walking toward the sound of the drums. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy looked around as she set up her drum and stool between Shira\u2019s and Reyhana\u2019s. This park, named The Dance, had been a tangle of weeds and overgrown bushes with a pile of stones in the center of the almost impenetrable mess. Gray had been frustrated that the elders wouldn\u2019t let him clean up this park when they let him work on the others in Eyota. He\u2019d grumbled and fussed about it so much the elders finally told him politely but firmly to keep his hands off the place.</p><p>Now there was a large circle of fine sand that had been carefully raked. The tumble of stones in the center was a large fire pit piled with wood that was ready for a flame\u2019s kiss. Freshly mown grass filled the rest of the space, and bushes defined the boundaries and provided some privacy. Eight archways created entranceways to The Dance.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t cleaned up in the past couple of days,\u201d Cassidy said quietly. Or as quietly as she could over the sound of the two women who had begun drumming.</p><p>Shira smiled and looked a little embarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be careful for so long . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIllusion spells. Lots of them, woven in and around one another. The Dance is always tended, even though most years it wasn\u2019t safe to use such a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t do these special dances?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe did. But not like this.\u201d Shira smiled fiercely, but her eyes were tear bright. \u201cIt was too risky to do the whole celebration together, so it would be spread out over the weeks between the Autumn Moon and the next full moon. This is the first time in a very long time my people will come together on one night for these dances.\u201d</p><p>It hurt that they hadn\u2019t trusted her enough to release the illusion spells and reveal The Dance for what it was, but it also told her how deep the fear ran in the Shalador people. She didn\u2019t ask Shira what the penalty had been for those who had been caught doing these dances. She didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>And yet, despite that fear, they had invited her to participate in this celebration, to be \u201cpart of its heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrummers and the other musicians will be going in and out as the dances change, so if you lose the rhythm, just drop out until you can pick it up again,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cJanos is dancing tonight,\u201d Reyhana said.</p><p>Cassidy looked at Shira, who looked at Reyhana and smiled, but then said, \u201cRemember, you go nowhere tonight without a chaperon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Reyhana looked away. Shira sighed and said, \u201cHeated blood can eliminate good sense, and sometimes young people do things they regret the next day\u2014or make mistakes they can\u2019t live with.\u201d</p><p>Reyhana\u2019s face blazed with color, but she held her head up. \u201cI know my duty to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to yourself,\u201d Cassidy added softly.</p><p>Reyhana met her eyes and nodded. \u201cAnd to myself. That\u2019s why Janos asked Darkmist to act as our chaperon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Shira pressed a hand against her mouth to stifle a laugh. \u201cIn that case, I apologize for treading where I had no reason to tread.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs the court\u2019s Healer, you had a right to express concern,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>*In that case,* Shira said, *I\u2019ll ask if you\u2019ve been drinking the contraceptive brew since your last moontime.*</p><p>Cassidy felt the heat rising in her face. *Yes, I have.*</p><p>*Good.* Shira sat on her stool and placed her smaller drum between her knees. \u201cAh, the Priestess is giving the signal. The rest of us will join the drumming in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy took her place and got her own drum in position. They had practiced for these dances over the past few weeks. Yairen had declared her ready to join the drumming for all but the Fire Dance.</p><p>The Shalador women were gathering. Many stopped at a small stone altar and opened a vein over a large silver chalice\u2014the blood the Priestess would use to cast the circle for the dance.</p><p>Two more drums joined the first two drummers. Then two more, and two more. A simple rhythm that would split into something more demanding. Cassidy had been assigned the simpler beat, and Shira and Reyhana had chosen to stay with her instead of doing the more complex beat. She appreciated that when her turn came to join the drummers. There was plenty to think about, and when the drums were suddenly enhanced with Craft and the sound flowed out of The Dance, she felt the seduction and the power of this tradition.</p><p>As the last drummer took up the beat, the Priestess\u2019s voice rose in wordless song, calling the men to the dance. Another voice joined hers. Then another. And another.</p><p>The first men arrived. Some were fathers with sons who were old enough for the Boys\u2019 Dance. Most were older men, including Ranon\u2019s grandfather Yairen, who would begin the celebration with the Wisdom Dance.</p><p>The Priestess cast the circle with blood and Craft as the women\u2019s voices quieted until it was only her voice and the drums calling, calling, calling.</p><p>Cassidy drummed, grateful for the simple beat she could maintain and still observe the people.</p><p>The Priestess extended her hand and brought Yairen across the circle. Then they both extended their hands to bring two more men into the dance. As she took the hand of the last elder who was participating in the dance, she stepped out of the circle.</p><p>All the drummers except the lead drummer stopped and shook out their hands as the lead drummer made the transition to the new beat. Then the rest of the drummers joined in again, along with the musicians playing fiddles and flutes.</p><p>A blur of images and sounds. Cassidy focused on the drumming, catching glimpses of the men as they danced the same formal steps their ancestors had performed centuries ago.</p><p>She lost her rhythm through part of the Boys\u2019 Dance because the younger ones\u2014those who had recently gone through their Birthright Ceremony\u2014turned into brainless puppies, forgetting most of what they had learned so they ended up bouncing along with the older boys. And more than a few of them stopped dancing altogether to wave at their mothers, which caused tangles as the boys still dancing tried to move around unplanned obstacles.</p><p>Despite Shira\u2019s earlier assurance that drummers dropped out of the music, Cassidy felt embarrassed that she\u2019d lost the rhythm after so many weeks of practice. Then the Boys\u2019 Dance gave way to the Youths\u2019 Dance, and Reyhana lost all ability to drum because she was laughing so hard at Janos\u2019s antics. Hearing other bursts of laughter followed by a stumble in the beat, Cassidy suddenly understood that perfection wasn\u2019t expected during this joyous celebration. So she watched Janos and laughed with Reyhana.</p><p>He performed the steps exactly as he should, but Cassidy learned a great deal about attitude. Most of the young men who were within a year or two of making the Offering and being considered adults were fiercely serious as they performed the dance. Janos gave the steps a lightheartedness, making fun of himself and the others who were on the cusp of manhood.</p><p>Cassidy felt more than heard Shira\u2019s sigh of relief and understood the feeling even while she laughed. Janos knew there were lines he couldn\u2019t cross, and he\u2019d done what he could to keep himself\u2014and Reyhana\u2014from temptation.</p><p>The Youths stepped out of the circle as they brought over the last group of dancers. The adult men walked in a quiet circle as all but the lead drummer once again went silent.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Janos,\u201d Cassidy said. Then she noticed Reyhana vanishing her drum and stool. \u201cAren\u2019t you staying to see the last dance?\u201d</p><p>The two youngsters gave her startled looks.</p><p>\u201cNo, Lady,\u201d Janos finally said. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting some friends at The Lady\u2019s Pleasure. Then we\u2019ll go back to my grandfather\u2019s house for the night.\u201d</p><p>*Don\u2019t ask,* Shira said as she vanished her smaller drum and called in the large drum, settling it between her thighs.</p><p>One by one the drummers joined the lead drummer, and The Dance once more filled with sound.</p><p>Noticing how many people were leaving, Cassidy leaned toward Shira. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fire Dance isn\u2019t for children.\u201d Shira began drumming.</p><p>Gray circled with the rest of the men, letting their bodies shield him from Cassie\u2019s view.</p><p>His life, his dreams . . . everything came down to this dance.</p><p>Ranon was on his left, but on his right, the side closest to the fire . . . a shadow. Primal. Lethal. Seductive.</p><p>You ran from me once,something whispered.I can\u2019t give you now what was lost then. But I can give you the rest if you\u2019re ready to accept it. Will you run from me again? Or will you embrace the fire?</p><p>Who are you?</p><p>You know.</p><p>A brush of heat against his right arm. A shivery awareness of what he still could claim for himself.</p><p>The man. The Warlord Prince.</p><p>Yes, I know who you are,Gray thought.You are Jared Blaed.</p><p>Will you run from me again?</p><p>Gray caught a glimpse of Cassie\u2019s fiery hair and felt a hunger for more than sex\u2014and knew how to get everything he wanted.</p><p>No, I won\u2019t run from you again. This time, I\u2019ll take everything you can give me.</p><p>Cassidy didn\u2019t catch the signal, but moments after the last child left the park, the dance began.</p><p>Clothes vanished with the first thumped step, and looking at a circle of men who wore nothing but their Jewels and their pride, she understood why the Fire Dance wasn\u2019t witnessed by children.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful!</p><p>Shadows and fire. Hard bodies glistening with sweat as they performed that hot, grinding dance.</p><p>She caught sight of Ranon and almost slid off her stool. Then she glanced at Shira and saw the same fierce glitter inthose dark eyes. The Black Widow no longer played the drum as music. The beat, thesound, became a challenge, female to male, and every move and thrust of the dance was Ranon\u2019s answer to that challenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she looked at the man dancing next to Ranon, looked into a familiar face that held the glittering green eyes of a stranger.</p><p>A dangerous stranger.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>As he performed each turn and thrust of the dance, the shadow clung like a second skin\u2014primal, lethal, seductive. Then it became his skin, filling him with a wild heat.</p><p>And then, as he looked into Cassie\u2019s eyes, it became him.</p><p>Ranon and Gray moved on with the other dancers, stomping, thrusting, whirling. The scars on Gray\u2019s back silvered in the firelight, and Cassidy had the feeling those scars would no longer be a source of shame; they would be a testimony of courage.</p><p>Round and round. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him, following his progression around the circle even when the fire hid him from sight.</p><p>Round and round until the drums were a thrumming in her blood.</p> <p>The drums stopped without warning, and the silence was a painful scraping over her senses, over her skin.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d A voice roughened by lust, by need, by something more than both.</p><p>Her legs trembled, but she forced herself to stand and look Gray in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d His hands cupped her face. The slight tremble in his fingers helped settle her own nerves.</p><p>Until he kissed her.</p><p>Heat. Drums. A hot, grinding dance. A firestorm of feelings as his tongue swept into her mouth, asking and demanding.</p> <p>\u201cGray.\u201d Ranon\u2019s voice sounded just as rough. \u201cPut some pants on and let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>How am I supposed to keep my hands off him long enough to get home?Cassidy wondered as she watched Gray call in a pair of trousers and put them on.</p><p>The air was cool at this time of year, but Gray didn\u2019t bother with a shirt or shoes. He just grabbed her hand and headed for one of the archways, followed by Ranon and Shira.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know who, if any of them, had contacted the silver twins to bring the horse and pony cart, but Lloyd and Kief were waiting for them. They piled in, Ranon and Shira on the driver\u2019s seat while she and Gray shared the back bench seats with the Scelties.</p><p>They piled out again in front of the Queen\u2019s Residence. The silver twins headed back to the stables with the horse. Ranon and Shira headed around the back of the house while Gray grabbed Cassidy\u2019s hand again and headed into the house.</p><p>Ranon and Shira hadn\u2019t moved into their own place yet, but it seemed they were going to spend the night there. Probably just as well, considering the way Gray hustled her up the stairs and into her room.</p><p>He took her in his arms and pressed a soft kiss on her temple\u2014a kiss that trembled with tenderness as well as the violence inherent in a Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet me love you. Let me be your partner in this dance.\u201d</p> <p>She shifted enough to look at his face, to look into his eyes. The Fire Dance had burned out what was left of the scarred boy he had been. A man stood before her, waiting for her answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lucivar\u2019s rules?\u201d Not that she gave a damn about Lucivar\u2019s rules right now, but she had to ask while she could still think.</p><p>\u201cA useful leash that kept us both safe. But a man doesn\u2019t need someone else to hold the leash. This has nothing to do with Lucivar. Not anymore. Just you and me, Cassie. Now it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take you as my partner, as my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d That was all he said. All he needed to say.</p><p>Soft. Sweet. Hot. Hard. They touched and tasted, learning each other\u2019s bodies as sweat-slicked skin slid across skin. He surrounded her\u2014and she surrounded him\u2014a claiming that went beyond the body. When he brought her up and over the crest a final time and poured himself into her, she knew everything had changed.</p><p>Gray woke instantly, his arm tightening over Cassie as he listened for whatever had snapped him out of a sound sleep.</p><p>Nothing. And yet,something kept scratching at his senses, demanding acknowledgment.</p><p>He slipped out of bed and pulled on a robe. Whatever he was sensing wasn\u2019t in this room.</p><p>He reached for the door that opened onto the hallway. The scratchy, demanding feeling faded. When he stepped back from the door, the feeling returned.</p><p>He probed the room again\u2014and felt his temper sharpen, felt himself rising to the killing edge as a natural response to a potential threat to his Queen.</p><p>Thatsomething wasn\u2019t in Cassie\u2019s room and it wasn\u2019t beyond her room either. That left . . .</p><p>He slipped into the adjoining bedroom. His room.</p><p>A glint of light near the dresser caught his attention. Despite the scratchy feeling, he sensed nothing dangerous, so he walked over to the dresser, then used Craft to form a small ball of witchlight.</p><p>He stared for a long time as his temper eased back from the killing edge. Then he extinguished the witchlight and went back to Cassie\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Cassie murmured when he slipped back into bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her and kissed the sweet spot on her neck. \u201cGo back to sleep, love. It\u2019s early yet.\u201d</p><p>She dropped back into sleep instantly, but he didn\u2019t. He waited until there was enough daylight; then he went back to his room and stared at the globe Tersa had given him.</p><p>The dragon, the symbol of himself as a whole man, stared back at him.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Julien stood in the breakfast room doorway. \u201cThere is a man digging in the garden. He says he\u2019s your cousin.\u201d</p><p>Theran set his coffee cup down, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and pushed away from the table. \u201cGray\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Gray. Digging in the garden. Not coming near the house.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>He glanced at Kermilla and suppressed a sigh. This morning she wasn\u2019t pleased with anyone who had a cock. Jhorma hadn\u2019t returned. Neither had Bardoc. And the escorts who should have arrived for their rotation of service were still in Dharo.</p><p>She\u2019d accused him of not sending her letters to her court, claiming he was jealous of her men. That was true, up to a point. He craved her in a way he\u2019d never craved anything else. She was a fever in his blood, and even when she did things that made him uneasy or they argued about money, heknew the problems were simply because she was a young, inexperienced Queen\u2014and because she came from a family who had wealth he couldn\u2019t imagine\u2014and he still wanted to shape things to meet her wishes and will as much as he could.</p><p>So, yes, he was jealous. But he was practical enough to recognize that having a couple of her First Circle here to help entertain her would have worked to his advantage.</p><p>All in all, this wasn\u2019t a good day to ask her to talk to Gray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go out and see him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour cousin is the gardener, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Kermilla spread jam over her toast in a fussy manner and didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good he\u2019s come back. The flower beds have been looking very weedy and unkempt lately. It gives visitors a bad impression.\u201d</p><p>Theran saw Julien\u2019s face tighten. The butler worked in the garden as a way to relax and was doing what he could to keep things tidy. But the grounds weren\u2019t part of Julien\u2019s duties, and Kermilla preferred to enjoy the results of someone else\u2019s labor\u2014and complained when the results didn\u2019t meet her expectations.</p><p>\u201cJulien, bring another pot of coffee,\u201d Kermilla said, not looking at either man as she continued to spread the jam on the toast. \u201cAnd tell the cook to pay attention to what she\u2019s doing this time. This last pot tasted like wash water.\u201d</p><p>Julien turned and walked away. Theran followed him.</p><p>\u201cJulien?\u201d Kermilla yelled. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Julien stopped and turned to Theran. There was a queer look in the butler\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going back in that room. I have other duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this morning?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>Julien\u2019s mouth curved in an unnerving smile. \u201cI\u2019m sharpening the cook\u2019s knives.\u201d</p><p>Theran hurried out to the garden. He hadn\u2019t heard from Gray since Cassidy ran away to Eyota. Talon had written to him a couple of times early on, Master of the Guard to First Escort, and news filtered through from some of the Warlord Princes he knew, but he hadn\u2019t heard from Gray.</p><p>A large woven basket sat at the edge of the Queen\u2019s flower bed. The bottom of it was filled with bulbs.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>Gray looked over and smiled at him. \u201cMorning.\u201d He brushed the dirt off two more bulbs and put them in the basket. Then he pushed the spade\u2019s head into the soil to keep the handle upright. \u201cThis bed could use some water. So could the rest of them. I guess you haven\u2019t had rain up here for the past few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201d Theran\u2019s heart lightened. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have you back\u2014and not just for the gardens.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave him a puzzled look and shook his head, still smiling. \u201cI\u2019m not staying. I just came by to pick up some of the bulbs I got for Cassie. Figured I\u2019d divide them. That will leave this bed looking a little sparse next spring, but it will fill in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came back to Grayhaven forbulbs ?\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cI planted them for Cassie, and I paid a hefty sum for a few of them. Besides . . .\u201d He looked around the garden. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the point?\u201d Gray looked past Theran\u2019s shoulder, and a dark, feral look came into his green eyes.</p><p>Before Theran could ask what was wrong, Gray pulled the spade out of the soil. Except it was no longer a spade. It was a pitchfork, and Gray held it more like a weapon than a tool.</p><p>For a moment, Theran just stared. It took a lot of skill in using Craft to vanish one object and call in another so smoothly a person couldn\u2019t see the transition. Where had Gray learned to do that?</p><p>Then he remembered thatsomething had sparked his cousin\u2019s temper and looked behind him.</p><p>Kermilla pranced over the lawn toward them, her expression one of sharp delight. That expression usually meant she was going to delight in using the sharp side of her tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gray, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cThe gardener? Have you finally remembered your duties and come back to be useful?\u201d</p><p>What Theran saw in Gray\u2019s eyes made the queer look in Julien\u2019s seem warm and comforting in comparison.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t work for you, bitch,\u201d Gray snarled. \u201cI never will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGray,\u201d Theran said, shocked.</p><p>Kermilla\u2019s face went white with anger. \u201cYou should be careful about saying \u2018never,\u2019 gardener. Things change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things change,\u201d Gray agreed. \u201cSome things don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla took a step closer. Gray raised the pitchfork, and there was no doubt of how he would use it if she came any closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Queen,\u201d Kermilla hissed.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t outrank me, and I don\u2019t serve you, so that means nothing,\u201d Gray snarled. \u201cAnd nothing like you is ever going to lay a hand on me again.\u201d</p><p>A moment of choice.</p><p>Theran put himself between Kermilla and Gray. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Gray. Kermilla, please go back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla.\u201d He\u2019d pay for giving her an order in front of someone, but Gray would try to hurt her, maybe even try to kill her, if she didn\u2019t get out of sight.</p><p>He waited until Kermilla was safely inside the house; then he focused his anger on his cousin.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at him. \u201cDo you actually serve that bitch? Sleep with that bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling her that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not knowher , but I knew one just like her. I have the scars to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not like that! She\u2019snothing like that! And you better mind your tongue, boy. When Kermilla becomes the Queen of Dena Nehele, she isnot going to forget your insults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fortunate she\u2019s not going to become the Queen.\u201d Gray drove the pitchfork deep into the soil. \u201cCassie is the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly until spring. When her contract runs out, Kermilla will rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray said. \u201cCassieis the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-year contract, Gray. Then she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s settled in. She\u2019s chosen to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not serving a minute beyond my contract, and when I leave, Cassidy\u2019s court will break and re-form around Kermilla as the new Queen.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cYou really think men like Archerr and Shaddo are going to serve Kermilla? You thinkRanon is going to serve someone like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll serve if I say they\u2019ll serve. Or have you immersed yourself so much in that shitty little Shalador slum that you\u2019ve forgotten who I am?\u201d</p><p>He regretted saying the words the moment he gave them voice\u2014and regretted them even more when Gray\u2019s eyes filled with something frigid and bitter.</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget who you are?\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou\u2019re Grayhaven. You\u2019re the last of the line, the one who needed to be protected and defended at any cost. For what, Theran? So you can play the pony now forher ? If that\u2019s what you wanted, you should have come down from the mountains years ago and given yourself to the Queens who were here. They were no different than her, and they would have used you just fine. If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll take off my shirt and show you my back. I guess you\u2019ve forgotten what it looks like.\u201d He paused. \u201cI paid a high price to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Today, I do. Today, I wish I\u2019d told you to get your own damn box of sweets if you wanted them that much. But you wanted the box of sweets from the bakery and the sweets between that girl\u2019s thighs\u2014and you got them both. What did I get? Two years of pain and fear and nightmares about things you will never know, and ten years beyond that of being frozen in a shroud of boyhood. And for what, Theran? For what?\u201d</p><p>Theran took a step back.</p><p>\u201cBecause of you, I\u2019m less than what I could have been, and I have to live with that. Every day, I have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>The air between them crackled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking this through, Gray. You\u2019re not seeing this clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I am, Prince Grayhaven. I am seeing things quite clearly. You\u2019re the one who wants to ignore what you\u2019ve done and pretend someone else is to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drew the line, and now you don\u2019t want to admit that we\u2019re standing on opposite sides. If you make Kermilla the Queen, I will fight her with everything I am\u2014because I would rather die than live one day under her hand.\u201d Gray flung out his right hand, aiming for the flower bed. All the plants and bulbs exploded out of the ground and hung in the air for a moment. The bulbs vanished; the plants fell back into the flower bed.</p><p>A moment later, the basket vanished too.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019m taking all the bulbs I planted for Cassie. If your bitch wants a spring garden, she can plant one herself.\u201d He walked away, heading around the house to reach the landing web beyond the gates.</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d Theran yelled.</p><p>Gray stopped and turned. \u201cMy name is Jared Blaed.\u201d</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Saetan opened the Gate and stepped through to the Keep in Terreille.</p><p>He was going to have to talk to Gray about the timing of these unscheduled visits. The boy had a knack for catching him at the end of his waking hours.</p><p>He opened the door of the sitting room, then stayed in the doorway, assessing the changes in the man who furiously paced the length of the room.</p><p>\u201cPrince,\u201d he said as he stepped into the room and closed the door.</p><p>Gray rushed toward him, those green eyes filled with a fury that must have been building every minute of the journey here.</p><p>\u201cYou have to teach me how to be a Consort,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cBoyo, I don\u2019t have to teach you anything,\u201d Saetan replied mildly.</p><p>\u201cTheran\u2019s going to break the court,\u201d Gray snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s planning to push Cassie out come spring and put that bitch Kermilla in her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair! After all the work Cassie has done, all the good she\u2019s done, and he thinks he can snap his fingers and everyone will drop to their knees and lick Kermilla\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not licking anyone\u2019s ass, not again, and he isnot going to break Cassie\u2019s court. So you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d</p><p>Gray drew in one deep breath after another, as if he\u2019d been running hard. His hands were clenched, and there was a wild look in his eyes. \u201cMy name is Jared Blaed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my name is Saetan. I suggest you remember that.\u201d</p><p>A month ago, he would have been more lenient with the boy. But Jaenelle\u2019s remark that Gray could have been Second Circle changed things. A Warlord Prince who had the personality and strength to stand in the Second Circle of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi was a dangerous man. Not just because of the Jewels he wore but because of thekind of man he was inside. So Gray was going to be held to some very strict standards from now on.</p><p>\u201cIf I become Cassie\u2019s Consort when Theran leaves, then her court won\u2019t break,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Two Queens. Two courts in a fight for the same Territory.</p><p>If the fight remained between the courts, a few good men would die\u2014and possibly the vanquished Queen as well. If the fight escalated beyond the courts . . . it would be war.</p><p>\u201cThis is what is going to happen today,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou\u2019re coming back with me to the Keep in Kaeleer. I\u2019ll ask Daemon and Lucivar to join us. Then we\u2019ll discuss your concerns and your request for training.\u201d</p><p>Gray opened his mouth, and if he said what the look in his eyes indicated, Saetan wouldn\u2019t hesitate to toss him out of the Keep with the firm understanding that he wouldn\u2019t be allowed back in until he\u2019d learned some manners.</p><p>Apparently Gray had already learned some manners because he reined in his temper and said, \u201cThank you, sir. That would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Since I was about to retire and get some rest, I\u2019m going to do that until Daemon and Lucivar arrive. And what will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>A long pause while Gray eyed him warily. \u201cI\u2019m going to be making mulch?\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s smile had a razor\u2019s edge. \u201cI\u2019m delighted we understand one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m delighted too.\u201d</p><p>Hardly,Saetan thought as he led Gray to the Gate and opened it to the Keep in Kaeleer.</p><p>After leaving Gray in a courtyard with an empty barrel and enough wood to keep the boy occupied for the rest of the day if need be, he sent a thought on a Black psychic spear thread. *Daemon.*</p><p>*Father?* Instant concern.</p><p>*Gray is here. I need you and Lucivar at the Keep as soon as you can get here.*</p><p>*Is Gray all right?*</p><p>Saetan snorted softly. *Prince Jared Blaed is pissed off and doing just fine.*</p><p>A thoughtful assessment he could feel through the psychic thread.</p><p>*Are you going to get some rest before we arrive?* Daemon asked.</p><p>*Yes.*</p><p>Amusement filled the thread. *So what do you have him doing with his time? Chopping wood or making mulch?*</p><p>*Since Lucivar has been working through a lot of temper lately by chopping wood, there\u2019s already enough stacked to supply his eyrie, the Keep, and The Tavern for the next year or so.*</p><p>*Ah. So Gray is making mulch.*</p><p>*Or sawdust.*</p><p>Saetan broke the link and went up to his suite. If the discussion turned out to be as lively as he expected, he was going to need all the rest he could get.</p><p>Tired, sore, and dressed in clean clothes after taking a long, hot shower, Gray mopped up the stew in the bottom of the bowl with the last bite of bread. Full, he sat back and noticed the books that filled one shelf in the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d just made his selection when Daemon walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to stir things up today, did you?\u201d Daemon said, smiling.</p><p>Gray put the book back on the shelf. \u201cDid Uncle Saetan tell you why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he just said Lucivar and I were needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think he told you. You wouldn\u2019t be smiling if he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, puppy,\u201d Daemon said softly. \u201cI consider you a friend, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be careful.\u201d</p><p>Daemon walked out of the room. Gray followed to the sitting room where Saetan and Lucivar waited. Daemon took a seat. Gray didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Saetan said, \u201csay what you need to say, and we\u2019ll listen. And thenyou will listen.\u201d</p> <p>The anger, and the feeling of betrayal, that had been building since his fight with Theran that morning overflowed, and he told them everything. He told them about all the things Cassie had done for the Shalador people and for Dena Nehele. He told them about the village and how it felt to be part of that community. He told them about the landen community and the people who lived there. And then he told them about going to Grayhaven early that morning to retrieve some of the special bulbs he\u2019d planted for Cassie and learning that Theran intended to replace Cassie with Kermilla, just tossing Cassie aside after all the work she\u2019d done for their people.</p><p>And he felt jagged ice fill his gut when he realized the three of them didn\u2019t seem the least bit surprised to hear about Theran\u2019s plans for Kermilla.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to train to be a Consort,\u201d he finished. \u201cSo I can take Theran\u2019s place and keep the court intact.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then Daemon said, \u201cFirst Escort, not Consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie and I are lovers. I should be her Consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d Lucivar asked. \u201cI don\u2019t recall discussing it\u2014or giving my permission.\u201d</p> <p>The mildly curious tone made Gray nervous. Then he remembered the fire dance and the primal power that he\u2019d finally welcomed without reservation. He was no longer just Gray, the man. Now he was also Jared Blaed, the Warlord Prince. \u201cWith all respect, Prince Yaslana, the rules you set in the spring protected me as well as Cassie because I wasn\u2019t emotionally ready to be a lover. Now I am, and we don\u2019t need those rules anymore\u2014and frankly, what she and I do together is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar smiled. \u201cYou can look me in the eyes and say that, so you\u2019re right. It\u2019s none of my business anymore.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness for that.</p><p>\u201cFirst Escort, Gray, not Consort,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cYou were Jaenelle\u2019s Consort,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cAnd make no mistake, I still am. But the Queen\u2019s Triangle is about the court, and while the Consort provides a very intimate kind of service, his position and his status are still about the court. In terms of the court, a First Escort performs the same function except for the sex. Your relationship with Cassie is personal. You want to keep it that way. She was hurt by the last man who served as her Consort. You don\u2019t ever want her to wonder if you\u2019re in her bed because you want to wear the Consort\u2019s ring and have the status and reputation that goes with it.\u201d</p><p>Gray sat down. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re into the last of the harvest now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Saetan asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir. Except for the autumn squashes that we\u2019ll harvest next month, the rest has been brought in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou\u2019ll come here once a week, late afternoon. Plan to stay over until the following morning. You\u2019ll be studying Protocol with an eye to how it applies to a First Escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I tell Cassie?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to know about this. Not until she has to. It will break her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ve decided you require more training, and I\u2019m going to personally provide that training. If she has any problem with you spending time at the Keep, she may discuss it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she will discuss it with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll also work with Daemon and Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let him practice with Jaenelle,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cWhen he can keep up with her\u2014and keep track of her\u2014for half a day, he\u2019ll be able to make the run with any other Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s settled then,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when Theran breaks Cassidy\u2019s court?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cIf Theran has the same misunderstanding about courts that you do, he\u2019s in for a rude awakening,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cExcept when a court is first formed, not everyone joins at the same time. People come in, people move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes timing can be a delightful knife rammed up someone\u2019s ass,\u201d Daemon purred. \u201cThe moment Theran announces his intentions to make Kermilla the Queen, Cassidy can demote him to a regular escort in her First Circle and you can sign a contract to serve as First Escort. That gives her thirteen males in the First Circle. If Cassie chooses not to dismiss him, Theran has to fulfill his contract to the last minute. Next spring, she already has a court that stands, and he\u2019s left trying to build one around a Queen of questionable morals.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked at Daemon. \u201cDid you know he would do this when you let Cassie come to Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>Daemon stared at him for a long time. \u201cIf I\u2019d known, I would have buried him in a grave that could never be found. But that\u2019s done now, and we have to let this play out as it will.\u201d</p><p>Why?</p><p>He looked at the three men who watched him with such predatory patience and knew the answer.</p><p>Jaenelle.</p><p>If Jaenelle thought Cassie could win against Kermilla without direct help from these men, then she could win. Would win.</p><p>In the next few months, he was going to learn everything he could from these men to make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we start?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re all here, now would be a good time,\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy glanced out the window again. Gray had left very early that morning, and no one had seen him since\u2014or knew exactly where he\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cHe had to have told someone where he\u2019d gone,\u201d she said to Talon. \u201cCould he have told one of the Scelties? Someone we didn\u2019t think to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon received a message from Gray around midday saying that he had an appointment and would be back late this evening,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cCassidy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t saywhere he would be! That\u2019s not like him, Talon. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send word through the rogue camps. Maybe he\u2019s up in the mountains somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Why?</p><p>After a couple of nights in her bed, was he already looking for a way to leave?</p><p>\u201cCassidy . . .\u201d</p><p>She finally heard it. She\u2019d been so preoccupied about Gray, she\u2019d ignored the obvious. Talon had something to tell her, and he wasn\u2019t comfortable saying it.</p><p>\u201cI made a promise a long time ago,\u201d Talon said, \u201cand twice a year I keep that promise. It means I\u2019ll be gone for a day. Maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Saying more would break a long-standing trust.\u201d</p><p>If she ordered him to, he would tell her\u2014and that would break the trust building between them.</p><p>\u201cCan you promise me that what you do will not harm Dena Nehele or any of its people?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He relaxed. He even smiled. \u201cThat I can promise with everything in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll look forward to your return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady.\u201d</p><p>After Talon left the room, Cassidy curled up in a window seat.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to compare Gray and Jhorma, to compare a man who said he loved her with one who had wanted to list being her Consort on his credentials. It wasn\u2019t fair, but Gray\u2019s unexplained absence made her wonder if he would continue to want her now that he was emotionally healed. Being his first lover didn\u2019t mean he wanted her to be his last.</p><p>If that was the case, she would find the strength to let him go with grace. But after he was gone, would she be able to hide the heartache well enough to escape the pity of her own court?</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Dena Nehele Queens rode the trails through the Tamanara Mountains in secret and in silence. Some had made this journey many times over many years. For others, it was the first time they had dared to give anyone this much trust.</p><p>Each of them had the list of trails to follow. Their escorts knew the exact time they had to pass the checkpoints on the trails. Miss the time, and you had a choice: turn back or die. There was no leniency or mercy in the spells that protected the mountain trails\u2014and in this time and place, there was no mercy in the Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince who created those spells year after year, generation after generation. He was the assurance that the Queens who had gathered twice a year to talk with each other were safe from the ones who had ruled.</p><p>When they reached the meeting place, they left horses and escorts behind and entered the clearing alone. Many embraced, relieved to see familiar faces again. But no one asked for a name. They never asked for a name. Even if they lived in neighboring villages and knew each other, they did not acknowledge such things, or ask about children, lovers, or parents.</p><p>Too many had been tortured to death over the years for them to leave all caution behind.</p><p>When the last Queen who chose to make the journey entered the clearing, the Sapphire shields went up around them\u2014protective shields, sight shields, aural shields.</p><p>Witchlight and warming spells made them comfortable. They called in stools, benches, or chairs. Then, safe within the Sapphire shields that would hide them until dawn, they shared their knowledge of their land and their people.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good harvest. The best we have had in many years. There will be enough food this year for everyone. The Craft the Rose Queen called the Queen\u2019s Gift made the difference.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHarvests were not so good in the north. The Other Queen was not as generous with her time. She wears a stronger Jewel than the Rose, but I do not think she is as skilled in her Craft\u2014or as caring of the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was trouble in Grayhaven. Some people moved away because of the Other Queen\u2019s presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the Rose Queen allowed a community of landens to settle close to her home village. They are courteous and hardworking. They come to the Blood village for supplies and for social events. They show great respect for the Rose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWarlord Princes who have gone to the Rose\u2019s village have been impressed by the work being done, and by the feel of the village. Fear no longer creeps through the streets. Even Ferall was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared Blaed has healed.\u201d</p><p>A stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cI have heard that too. And that he is the Rose Queen\u2019s lover\u2014by choice. He is becoming a strong leader, and it is said that he knows some very powerful men in Kaeleer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a rumor in the north that the Rose Queen will leave when the spring flowers bloom and the Other Queen will take her place and rule Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat one wants much and offers little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe south has not heard these rumors. There is no sign that the Rose intends to leave. Her court is strong and gathers strength around itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard the rumor too. Theran Grayhaven wants the Other to rule and will give her our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some . . . strangeness . . . about the way the Rose departed from Grayhaven and ended up with the Shaladorans. It is speculated that it had something to do with the Other Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rose has brought a young Shaladoran Queen into her court for training. The girl is learning the Old Ways and Protocol. She is respectful and performs her duties well. And there is real affection between the girl and the Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Other also had a young Queen as a companion for a while. Many of the Warlord Princes had strong reservations about the girl\u2019s behavior and her ability to be a good Queen. After seeing her with the Other in Grayhaven, they are of one voice\u2014they will not tolerate her setting up a court in Dena Nehele, not even in the smallest village. They say the girl embraces too much of what was hated in the Queens who were purged by the witch storm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Other chose such an undesirable Queen for a companion and yet Theran Grayhaven wants her to rule the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Rose, Ranon has found a Queen for his people. If the Other tries to take Dena Nehele, he will fight such a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Jared Blaed?\u201d</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>Throughout the night they talked\u2014and sometimes they cried. At the first whisper of dawn, the Sapphire spells began to fade, so they vanished their stools, benches, and chairs. They drew the power that had fueled the witchlight and the warming spells back into themselves and prepared for the journey out of the mountains.</p><p>As they made their way back home, they thought about the things that had been said, and they all knew one thing: the Black Widows had been right. Come spring, Dena Nehele would either embrace a hopeful beginning\u2014or face a terrible end.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>KAELEER</p> <p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>A warm hand rubbed his leg just above the knee.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d Gray opened his eyes. They must have been closed because now he could see Daemon crouching in front of the chair he\u2019d collapsed into when he walked into Daemon\u2019s study.</p><p>\u201cDrink this,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warm tonic. It will help put some bone back in your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did the old bone go?\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Gray tried to focus on the blurry mug floating in front of him. Too much effort. He let his head fall back against the chair and stared at the ceiling. It wasn\u2019t doing anything. He liked that. A lot.</p><p>He was so damn tired. He had never ever, in the whole of his life, been this tired.</p><p>How did these mendo this every day?</p><p>\u201cGray, did you remember any part of the Protocol that dealt with the First Escort arranging rest periods for the Queen and her escorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d</p><p>The dry humor in Daemon\u2019s voice told Gray he\u2019d missed something.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Lucivar\u2019s voice. He sounded amused too. \u201cLooking at him, I guess it\u2019s good Jaenelle doesn\u2019t have as much energy as she used to.\u201d</p><p>Gray had spent one whole morning and afternoon acting as First Escort to Jaenelle Angelline. He whimpered at the thought of her having more energy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Daemon gave him a soothing pat.</p><p>\u201cDinner is almost ready,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cApparently Mrs. Beale figured a few people would want to turn in early tonight, so dinner is being served early too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good decision on her part,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cCome on, Gray. Maybe some food will help.\u201d</p><p>Help what? He\u2019d have to chew it, wouldn\u2019t he? What help was that?</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust give me another minute.\u201d</p><p>Gray pushed himself to a sitting position, catching the blanket as it slid off his legs. He still felt tired, but he was much better for taking that minute to rest before dinner.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d Daemon closed the book he was reading and set it on the table next to his chair.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m still a little groggy.\u201d Gray tried to tidy his hair by running his fingers through it. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there. Is it time for dinner?\u201d He looked to one side, then the other. \u201cWasn\u2019t I sitting in a chair before? How did I end up on the sofa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyo, it\u2019s closing in on midnight, and the rest of us had dinner hours ago. You\u2019re on the sofa because Lucivar and I couldn\u2019t keep you awake long enough to get you any farther. We figured you\u2019d sleep just as well there as anyplace else we could carry you.\u201d</p><p>Gray braced his head in his hands. Weeks of studying, working, traveling to the Keep and to SaDiablo Hall for training. \u201cI failed, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t remember the part about the First Escort being able to insist on rest breaks, but I figure you\u2019ll learn that Protocol fast enough for self-preservation if for nothing else. As for the rest, Lucivar and I agree that the only thing you\u2019re lacking is the finesse that comes from experience. And that you will learn by working beside your Queen.\u201d</p><p>Gray raised his head. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled. \u201cReally. In fact, I have this for you.\u201d He called in a sheet of paper and used Craft to float it over to Gray. \u201cThe High Lord wrote it out, so you can be sure the Protocol is exact for retiring a man from a dominant position in a court and giving that title\u2014and the duties that go with it\u2014to someone else.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the words but didn\u2019t try to read them. \u201cWhen do you think Theran will tell Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first day of Winsol is a week from now. Unless he\u2019s a complete bastard, he\u2019ll wait until the celebration is over and people are settling into the routine of winter days. He can\u2019t wait much longer than that to start gathering the men who will form a First Circle, but the moment he does more than try to feel out who might be interested in serving Kermilla, every Queen and Warlord Prince is going to know about it\u2014and Cassie will hear about it. That\u2019s whenshe should make her declaration of whether she\u2019s going to stay or leave. After that, a lot depends on which Queen the other Queens and Warlord Princes are willing to have rule over their lives.\u201d Daemon stood up. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll warm up the food Mrs. Beale set aside for you. Then you can get a bit more sleep and be on your way in the morning.\u201d He paused. \u201cMy advice is to forget about all of this and enjoy the days of Winsol.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s stomach rumbled. He got to his feet, feeling awake enough to be enthusiastic about food.</p><p>\u201cThere is one other piece of advice I could use,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daemon raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you buy a Sceltie for Winsol?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran fanned out the gold marks. Twenty ten-marks. He\u2019d rarely seen gold marks. The silver marks were easier to come by when the rogues sold game to folks who couldn\u2019t afford to buy meat from the butcher\u2019s shop. Easier to come by and not as noticeable when spent. Usually only aristos\u2014or the twisted Queens and their First Circles\u2014had enough income to use gold marks.</p><p>Talon had given him twenty ten-marks for his twentieth birthday\u2014the first and only time he\u2019d held that much spending money. It still felt like a fortune.</p><p>After deducting the expenses for the town treasury and the Grayhaven estate, he figured he would have four hundred gold marks as an annual personal income from the town\u2019s tithes. He\u2019d need a few new clothes in the coming months and there would be the expense for the occasional evening\u2019s entertainment, but he knew how to live lean. Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d been doing it his whole life. That\u2019s why he had decided to give his Lady half of that income as a special surprise.</p><p>Kermilla walked into the sitting room. \u201cThe bastard butler said you wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bastard, Kermilla,\u201d Theran said. \u201cYou know it\u2019s unkind to insult a man by saying he has no father.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThen let\u2019s say it describes his temper and attitude if you don\u2019t want to besmirch whatever bloodlines he can claim.\u201d Then she saw the gold marks and her breath caught.</p><p>He almost reconsidered what he was going to do, but maybe her recent bitchiness was a sign of frustration. There was little society in the town and less public entertainment that she felt was worthy of her notice. And she seemed to find his efforts at lovemaking less and less enjoyable\u2014so much so, he\u2019d stopped asking for sex and decided to wait for her invitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, eyeing the gold marks.</p><p>He held them out. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took the fanned marks and counted them twice. \u201cTwo hundred gold marks? Theran, where did you get this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled, warmly pleased by the light in her eyes. \u201cI know there hasn\u2019t been much money and the income hasn\u2019t arrived from your village\u2019s tithes. Winsol starts in three days, and I thought you\u2019d enjoy doing a bit of shopping.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been hinting hard enough that the failure of her Steward to send the income owed to her was making it impossible for her to buy any gifts for her family or to select the expected gifts for her Steward, Master of the Guard, and Consort\u2014or to buy anything for him.</p> <p>The gift itself wasn\u2019t important. It was the fact that Kermilla wanted to give him one. He hadn\u2019t had a gift from a woman since he\u2019d left his mother when he was seven years old.</p><p>\u201cOh, Theran!\u201d</p><p>Kermilla threw her arms around him and kissed him with enough heat to fire his blood. Before he could get another good taste of her, she backed away, wagging a finger at him while she smiled playfully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for later,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I have to see what\u2019s left in the shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spend it all in one place,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice light but hoping she heard the warning to spend carefully.</p> <p>\u201cSilly man,\u201d she said as she danced out of the parlor.</p><p>A few minutes later, he looked out a window and saw her heading down the drive in the pony cart with one of the stable lads as her driver. He also saw a man in a messenger\u2019s livery walking up the drive. Not a messenger from the town. One of them would have come on horseback. This man must have ridden the Winds and arrived at the landing web just beyond Grayhaven\u2019s gates.</p><p>He started to go to his study, then turned and headed for the front door. Any message coming here was most likely for him anyway. No point having Julien track him down when he could be on hand.</p><p>He timed it so it looked like he was passing through the entranceway on his way to the stairs when Julien opened the door and took the message.</p><p>The messenger\u2019s tone sounded courteous, but there was clearly something on the man\u2019s mind. Theran saw hot anger in the eyes that stared at him before Julien shut the door and handed him the wax-sealed heavy paper.</p><p>Theran broke the seal and opened the message\u2014and wished he\u2019d waited until he\u2019d reached the privacy of his study.</p> <p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Julien asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what that phrase means\u2014a bitch got buried. Will anyone weep?\u201d</p><p>The coldness of Julien\u2019s words stung him.</p><p>He went into his study and locked the door. Just a physical lock, just an indication he wanted no company and no one disturbing him.</p><p>He read the words again and again. As he sat there through the morning, staring at letters and reports and seeing nothing, he was glad he\u2019d given Kermilla the gold marks\u2014glad she would find some sweetness in what would be a bitter day.</p><p>Kermilla rode back through the Grayhaven gates, her color high with the pleasure of a long morning in the shops. She glanced at the basket of packages in the back of the pony cart and felt a prick of guilt, which was easily dismissed. It wasn\u2019t her fault. She hadn\u2019t had anything new in weeks, months,forever. So she\u2019d gotten a bit extravagant buying things for herself\u2014like that gorgeous red dress that cost ninety gold marks.</p><p>Of the two hundred gold marks Theran had given her that morning, she had ten left. She\u2019d meant to be careful, she really had, but it felt sogood to have money again that she couldn\u2019t stop herself from buying all the things she\u2019d been denied.</p> <p>She\u2019d regained some control at the end when she realized she had to come back with some packages that were gifts for other people\u2014things she could let Theran see. He didn\u2019t have to know that she\u2019d grabbed a few things off the shelves of a shop an aristo wouldn\u2019t normally enter and had put those gifts into the boxes of the things she\u2019d bought for herself in the only aristo merchant shop left in the whole dung-heap town. If he noticed that the quality of the goods didn\u2019t match the implied quality of the box, he would blame the merchant.</p><p>She\u2019d known he was being stingy and had been holding back on giving her any money. But she\u2019d worn him down until he finally acknowledged that she deserved a Queen\u2019s due\u2014and a Queen\u2019s income.</p><p>Theran was like her father in that way.He\u2019d grumped and grumbled about her spending, had asked her\u2014almost begged her sometimes\u2014to be less extravagant, but he always ended up giving her the marks she needed to pay for the clothes or the entertainments that were vital to bringing herself to the notice of the men who had enough reputation and potential to form a court around her and provide her with a place to rule that would, in turn, provide her with the income she deserved.</p><p>Theran wouldn\u2019t be happy that she\u2019d spent all the marks he\u2019d given her, but she\u2019d wiggle more out of him.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Julien.\u201d She kept her tone frigidly polite.</p><p>\u201cI trust you had a pleasant outing,\u201d he replied.</p><p>No matter how cold she made her voice, the damn butler would match it\u2014and then add just a little more ice.</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran is in his study,\u201d Julian said. \u201cHe asked that you join him there when you returned.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the basket of packages. \u201cTake these up to my room, if that won\u2019t interfere too much with your other duties.\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head in a bow that was less than he should have given her.</p><p>She knocked on the door and felt a quiver of uneasiness when she heard theclick of the lock turning before the door opened.</p><p>Theran stood halfway between his desk and the door, as if he couldn\u2019t decide where he was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed yourself?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She rushed up to him and gave him an enthusiastic hug. \u201cI did. And I was pleased to see so many people doing a little something to make the town look festive for Winsol.\u201d She played with a button on his shirt, looked up at him through her lashes, and gave him the smile that always made men sigh indulgently before doing what she wanted. \u201cBut I was alittle bit careless because everything looked so wonderful.\u201d She caught her lower lip between her teeth. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to need more money in order to finish my shopping for Winsol.\u201d</p><p>She saw it in his eyes, felt it in the way he seemed to step away from her without actually moving. A bad miscalculation on her part. She should have remembered that he wasn\u2019t used to aristo measurements of spending. A trifling expense to her was an almost unthinkable extravagance to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kermilla.\u201d Now he did step back. \u201cI gave you everything that could be spared from the tithes and the estate. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Theran.\u201d She grasped his hands. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I see this grand house, and I forget that . . .\u201d No, that wasn\u2019t the right way to regain the ground she\u2019d just lost.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Why not?That he gave up without anger or arguing troubled her.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about something else.\u201d He led her over to the stuffed chair and footstool that were tucked on one side of the room. Once she was settled in the chair, he sat on the footstool.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Something bad. She could tell that much.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your friend Correne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran, I haven\u2019t even written to her lately, so if she\u2019s making remarks about Cassidy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, Kermilla. She enraged a Warlord Prince who was visiting friends for Winsol and he killed her, right on the main street in full view of half the village.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Theran took her hands. The warmth of his hands showed her how cold she\u2019d become, chilled to the bone by his words.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t liked or trusted by the Warlord Princes who lived near her village,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWhatever leash had kept some of her behavior under control disappeared after her visit here. She\u2019d been shopping and stole some items. Didn\u2019t even try to be subtle about it. A boy who was in the shop with his older brothers saw her and told the merchant, who then reported her to the village guards. She claimed that the merchant should give her those things as \u2018gifts\u2019 because she was a Queen.\u201d He snorted softly. \u201cWhich just proved she\u2019d been tainted by the bitches who had ruled here before.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been whimpering until he made soothing noises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kermilla, but it\u2019s important that you know what this girl was like. You have to understand that befriending her and being influenced by her the way you were is going to make it harder for the Warlord Princes and Queens to trust you. They aren\u2019t going to tolerate having that kind of Queen rule in Dena Nehele. Not again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak. Couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cShe had to reveal everything she had taken. Because of her age, the humiliation was deemed sufficient punishment. But the next day, she attacked the boy when he was out with friends . . .\u201d Theran closed his eyes. When he opened them, they were filled with grief. \u201cThe village council didn\u2019t give me the details. I can find out if you need to know. But they called in Healers from neighboring villages to help the village Healer. Even with that much skill, not all of what she did to the boy can be healed. He acted with honor\u2014and he\u2019ll never be the same because of what she did.\u201d</p><p>What kind of people are they to kill a Queen over some stupid boy?</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord Prince who was in the village hunted Correne down and executed her on the main street.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed against the sickness clogging her throat. \u201cWhat did they do to him? What did they do to the bastard who killed a Queen?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a queer look. \u201cNothing. He did the same thing he\u2019d been doing his whole life\u2014eliminating an enemy who had no honor.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hands out of his. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well. I\u2019m going up to my room to rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stood up and held out a hand.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to touch him.

Maybe she hadn\u2019t wanted to see that Theran wasn\u2019t any different from the rest of them.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and saw grief for the boy, who was still alive, and no regret\u2014none at all\u2014for Correne\u2019s death. Did she really want to live among these people? Could she survive among these people?</p><p>She stood up, avoiding his hand. Somehow, that didn\u2019t surprise him.</p><p>He opened the door for her. She walked out of the study.</p><p>Theran\u2019s dismissal of Correne\u2019s death troubled her, even scared her\u2014but it didn\u2019t scare her half as much as seeing the dark pleasure in Julien\u2019s eyes and knowing that pleasure was there because he\u2019d heard the news.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p> <p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy hurried into the meeting room. Gray was finally home, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she was relieved or angry. A hasty message saying he\u2019d been delayed but would be home before Winsol hadn\u2019t soothed her, not when he\u2019d been so vague about these required meetings with the High Lord\u2014and not when Jaenelle\u2019s response to her inquiries was a gently worded message that still translated to \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray, are you all right\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her, twirled her, hugged her breathless\u2014then kissed her in a way that made her dizzy and more than a little self-conscious since her whole First Circle was watching them.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019ve been gone so long.\u201d Gray\u2019s green eyes blazed with happy excitement, and he didn\u2019t look sorry at all. \u201cI asked Daemon for a favor, and then he wanted me to wait and bring along a special delivery for you. I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray, stop bouncing,\u201d Ranon said.</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Gray grinned. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to be home. The SaDiablos are wonderful people, but they\u2019re exhausting to be around for any length of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry spending four months with them,\u201d Cassidy muttered.</p><p>Gray hooted.</p><p>\u201cWhen my boys get like this, I take them to the park and make them run around until they\u2019re almost too tired to walk home,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cThink that would work with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gray looked around the room\u2014and then looked under the table. \u201cWhere are Vae and Khollie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>He shrugged out of his coat. \u201cGood. Ranon, would you put an Opal shield around the room and a lock on the door?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy felt tension ripple through the room. \u201cIs there a reason for this, Gray?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Vae and Khollie joining us right now,\u201d he replied.</p><p>At least he was starting to settle down, Cassidy thought as everyone gathered around the table.</p><p>\u201cI did some shopping while I was in Kaeleer,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Cassidy frowned. \u201cI thought we agreed that we would buy our gifts from local shops, and anything we bought that came from Kaeleer we would purchase at Merchants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did agree, but there were some things we wouldn\u2019t be able to make in time. Not this year, anyway.\u201d Gray ran a hand down her arm, silently asking her to understand. \u201cI asked Daemon to take me to Scelt. We spent a day in Maghre. I met Lady Fiona and Shadow, the Sceltie Warlord who is her inspiration for the Tracker and Shadow books. I know he\u2019s the inspiration because he told me. Several times. We also spent some of the afternoon with Lord Khardeen. And I bought some things.\u201d</p><p>An odd assortment of toys and other things appeared on the table.</p><p>\u201cI got these brushes for Lizzie, Wynne, and Keely. See? Their names are etched into the wood. And these,\u201d Gray brushed a finger over the top of several small containers, \u201chave nail paint that can be used safely on Sceltie nails as well as girl nails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would dogs want painted nails?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d Gray replied. \u201cBut apparently Scelties who live with young girls end up with painted nails, and this is the only nail paint that should be used.\u201d</p><p>Shira muffled a snort and said on a distaff thread, *I guess that means Wynne and Keely will have pretty toenails.*</p><p>Cassidy pressed her lips together and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThese braided ropes are good for playing tug or toss or chase\u2014with or without humans,\u201d Gray continued. \u201cAnd these rawhide strips are for chewing. We\u2019ll be able to figure out how to make these here, but for now I bought plenty for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Archerr tapped one of the bright-colored balls on the table. \u201cThese things are as big as the dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut lightweight,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThese are the kinds of toys folks in Scelt buy for the Scelties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d Shaddo picked up a stuffed baby bunny.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to give that to Darcy for Winsol,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat way he\u2019ll have a pet Soli will let him keep.\u201d</p><p>Shaddo laughed. \u201cYeah, they had this \u2018discussion\u2019 two or three times a week over the summer. He\u2019d bring home a bunny or some other small thing, wanting to keep it as a cuddly, and she couldn\u2019t find a way to explain that the bunny he wanted to keep as a pet would grow up into the rabbit he\u2019d catch for dinner. This just might satisfy both of them. Thanks, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I bought a variety of things,\u201d Gray said. \u201cEveryone living with a Sceltie will have a gift that\u2019s appropriate so they won\u2019t feel left out of the celebrations. We choose what we want, and the rest goes to Merchants as stock for future gifts or treats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, Gray,\u201d Powell said, looking bemused.</p><p>Gray called in a stuffed toy and held it out to Ranon. \u201cI thought Khollie would like this.\u201d</p><p>A lamb about half the size of the Sceltie. Big enough to cuddle with but small enough that Khollie could carry it around with him.</p><p>Khollie, who was still afraid to be alone. Who had been so terrified to go outside one day that he ended up peeing on the floor and then hid in a corner and whined all day until Ranon came home.</p><p>Gray shifted, still holding the toy that Ranon hadn\u2019t taken. \u201cLambie is stuffed with rags, so he can have a bath whenever he needs one. Might need some Craft to help the insides dry, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Cassidy saw Ranon\u2019s throat work, saw his dark eyes fill with tears. A moment later, he was holding on to Gray, his eyes squeezed tight.</p><p>She glanced at Shira. A mistake. They both looked away, trying not to blubber. Didn\u2019t help to see Powell knuckling away a tear.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ranon said hoarsely, finally stepping back. Gently holding the toy, he turned and offered it to Shira, who took it and vanished it.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you vanish those toys and things, Gray,\u201d Talon said. \u201cYou and Shaddo should talk to the other folks so they can pick out what they\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Gray vanished the Sceltie gifts, then rubbed his hands. \u201cThat was my shopping. I do have some crates to deliver to Merchants. But these are to be opened by Cassie, and she is to do with the contents as she pleases.\u201d</p><p>He called in several crates and set them near the wall. He pointed to the crate on the right. \u201cThat one first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a hand with that, Cassie,\u201d Archerr said. He opened the crate and set the lid aside.</p><p>Cassidy lifted the first item. They were individually wrapped in heavy brown paper but not sealed. She set it on the table and opened the brown paper.</p><p>A book with a fine leather cover. The kind of expensive book that was meant for a family library. The kind that was meant to be handled and read by generations.</p><p>She opened it to the title page and gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s Jared\u2019s account of the journey he made with Lia. I asked Prince Sadi to have a couple of copies made so the story could be shared without risking the original. I never expected him to dothis. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautifully made,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>Gray poked around in the crate. \u201cCassie, there must be a dozen of these leather-bound volumes in here. Maybe more.\u201d</p><p>Enough for the Grayhaven family and her First Circle. And one for her. She was certain of it.</p><p>Ignoring their stunned protests, which lasted only until each man held a book, she passed out the leather-bound volumes. She put two in front of Talon. *Would you see that one of these is delivered to Prince Grayhaven?*</p><p>Talon studied her for a moment. *I will.*</p><p>After giving Ranon his copy, there were two left\u2014one for her and one for Gray.</p><p>Wondering if there were more surprises, she watched Gray and Archerr open the next crate.</p><p>More copies of Jared\u2019s account, but these had an ordinary binding.</p><p>Gray opened the wax-sealed note resting on the books in the last crate. \u201cDaemon says these books are a gift to be distributed to whomever Cassie wishes or to be used in the loaning libraries. More copies of Jared\u2019s account were printed, but those will be sold through Merchants, along with other copies of these books.\u201d He frowned as he vanished the note and picked up two of the books. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Cassidy asked, peering over Gray\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMore books, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Powell yelped and grabbed a book. Then grabbed another. \u201cHow did he find these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d several men asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of these authors, but their work was destroyed when the tainted Queens first took control of Dena Nehele,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThere might be a few copies of their books hidden in family libraries, but no one has read their stories in a couple of centuries at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone sent copies of those books to the Keep so they wouldn\u2019t be completely destroyed or forgotten,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>A dozen copies of a dozen books\u2014including two novels by Shalador authors Ranon had never heard of. Gray insisted that she have a full set of the books for the Residence\u2019s library and that the loaning library in Eyota be given a full set. Everyone agreed that Gray and Powell could decide what to do with the rest of the copies later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Cassidy?* Reyhana\u2019s call was followed by tapping on the door a moment later. *Maydra says dinner is almost ready, and Dryden said to remind you that we have drumming tonight.*</p><p>*We\u2019ll be out in a few minutes,* Cassidy replied. She wanted a few minutes alone to regain her balance. Her parents and brother were joining her for Winsol here in Eyota. She still had some shopping to do, as well as some social events to attend as the Queen before she could be a daughter for a few days.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything more?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing that needs your attention,\u201d Gray replied.</p><p>She considered the phrasing and was fairly certain she\u2019d just been asked to leave.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Shira,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have drumming tonight, so Maydra is going to serve dinner in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2014\u201d Shaddo jerked, then gave Gray a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d Gray said, smiling at Cassidy.</p> <p>Ranon released the Opal lock on the door, and Cassidy and Shira left the room.</p><p>\u201cThat man has been spending too much time with Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle,\u201d Cassidy muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to sound like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d Shira asked as they walked up to their rooms.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t budge those men with a sledgehammer once they\u2019d set their minds to something.\u201d</p><p>Shira laughed. Foolish woman.</p><p>Going into her room, Cassidy sat on the bed and brushed a finger over the leather cover of the book. Jared and Lia when they were young. Before their world had turned dark and terrible and bloody. She had never found any journals at Grayhaven from Lia\u2019s younger years. Maybe the woman hadn\u2019t started keeping a journal until she was a little older.</p> <p>And maybe this would give her a glimpse of the young Queen who, in the last months of her life, had left behind the clues that led to the treasure Cassidy had found.</p><p>She opened the book, then closed it and put it on the bedside table. There was always a quiet afternoon or two during Winsol. That was family tradition. She would save the book for one of those days.</p><p>Gray waited until Ranon restored the Opal lock on the room. Then he faced the men who formed the First Circle. \u201cA few months ago, Theran told me straight out he intended to break the court and set up Kermilla as the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun shines in Hell,\u201d Archerr snarled. \u201cI\u2019ve already had my fill ofthat bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been going up to the Keep once a week to study with the High Lord, and sometimes Daemon and Lucivar as well. They gave me the training needed to stand as a Queen\u2019s First Escort. This was the last time. By their standards, I\u2019m qualified to serve in a court.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then Talon snorted. \u201cIf you meet their standards, no one here is going to dispute your credentials.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the men nodded.</p><p>\u201cI was also given this.\u201d He called in the paper and set in on the table in front of Powell and Talon.</p> <p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Powell said after reading it through twice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone could write something so devastatingly courteous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did write this?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cThe High Lord. Daemon said Saetan was very exact about the Protocol used to demote a member of the court for failure to fulfill his duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis holds Theran to his contract with the court, but it also strips him of the title of First Escort and ends his status as part of the Queen\u2019s Triangle.\u201d Powell looked at Gray. \u201cThe moment you sign a contract with Cassie, the court stands, with or without Theran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout Theran,\u201d Gray said quietly. \u201cNo matter what else happens, the court will stand without Theran.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had plenty of time to think about that on the way home. He still loved his cousin, still cared about the man. But he wouldn\u2019t want a Warlord Prince who couldn\u2019t be loyal anywhere near his Queen.</p><p>\u201cIt pains me to say it, but I agree,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cI was told we should put this aside and enjoy Winsol,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of you who want to visit family, we\u2019ll work out a way to give you a few days\u2019 leave,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Yes, they would put it aside and enjoy Winsol, Gray thought as he went upstairs to wash up for dinner. Men like Shaddo would savor the days with their children. Others would spend a few days with brothers or sisters or parents\u2014the people they had seen only during hurried, secret visits for so many years.</p><p>They would visit them now, openly\u2014perhaps for the last time.</p><p>That was the truth behind Talon\u2019s words\u2014the acknowledgment that, come spring, not all of them would walk away from the killing fields.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran waited in the front hall for Kermilla. It would have looked, and felt, less clumsy if he\u2019d waited in his study, but he wasn\u2019t sure she would seek him out, and he didn\u2019t want to miss this chance to see her one last time.</p><p>He\u2019d known this was coming, had seen it in her eyes after he\u2019d told her about Correne\u2019s death. The males in Dena Nehele weren\u2019t sufficiently civilized for a vivacious young woman like Kermilla, and Correne\u2019s savage execution made her realize she wasn\u2019t as safe here as she\u2019d thought. Being a Queen had never saved any witch from a Warlord Prince\u2019s knife if her actions snapped the leash that held back a formidable temper. Without the security of a court or the presence of more than one man she could trust with her life, leaving was the prudent thing for her to do.</p><p>But, Hell\u2019s fire, it hurt that she was leaving the day before Winsol began. Thirteen days of celebration that honored the Darkness; honored Witch, the living myth; celebrated the longest night of the year; and marked the last days of the old year.</p><p>Every aristo family still living in the town had invited him and Kermilla to parties or dinners or outings of one kind or another. Nothing overly sophisticated about any of those activities, he supposed, but he\u2019d been looking forward to all of it\u2014and would still have to attend out of duty, if not for pleasure.</p><p>Kermilla came down the stairs, hesitating on the last step when she saw him. He walked up to her, almost eye to eye with her since the step gave her a few added inches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready to go?\u201d he asked, taking her hands in his.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tried, but she couldn\u2019t manage her usual flirtatious smile. \u201cI should have told you sooner that I was needed back in Dharo. I thought . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>I guess being with me isn\u2019t enticement enough for you to stay.The thought saddened him. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d It was tempting to add \u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d but he was afraid she would agree with him, despite how much he\u2019d paid for the gift.</p><p>He called in the box and gave it to her.</p><p>The excited light in her eyes when she took the box faded when she opened it.</p><p>He\u2019d been right. Kermilla didn\u2019t think much of his gift. There was only one good jeweler left in Grayhaven. He\u2019d been honest with the man about how many gold marks he could spend, and he\u2019d thought the delicate silver bracelet was as fine a piece as any he\u2019d seen in Lia\u2019s jewelry box\u2014the old box Cassidy had found that had contained the gifts Lia had received from her husband and children.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Kermilla closed the box and vanished it.</p><p>Not even good enough to put on so he could see her wearing it before she left. Not even good enough for that.</p><p>The front door opened. Julien stood in the doorway, letting fresh cold air fill the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThe carriage is out front, if Lady Kermilla is ready to go to the Coach station,\u201d Julien said. When Theran didn\u2019t move, he came in and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely visit,\u201d Kermilla said. She couldn\u2019t quite make the words sound sincere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were here,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>He waited, still blocking the steps.</p><p>She gave him a look that was polite but a trifle annoyed. \u201cI have to get to the station. It\u2019s a long journey, and there will be a lot to do when I get home.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment longer, then stepped aside. He escorted her out to the carriage and watched until she passed through the gates of the estate.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee brought to your study?\u201d Julien asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d He could occupy himself with paperwork. There was always plenty of paperwork.</p><p>Once he was inside the room, he looked around carefully.</p><p>Nothing out of place. Nothing added.</p><p>He had hoped, but it appeared that had been foolish.</p><p>Despite what she\u2019d hinted, despite what she\u2019d told him, apparently none of the gold marks she\u2019d spent had been on a gift for him.</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Kermilla huddled in the back of the horse-drawn cab. Damn driver hadn\u2019t even offered her a lap rug to ease the chill inside the cab, let alone the spell-warmed lap rug heshould have offered the Queen who ruled his village. He hadn\u2019t put a warming spell on the inside of the cab, either, which he also should have done. She could create the warming spell herself, but that wasn\u2019t the point. A Queen shouldn\u2019t have to do menial spells when there were others around to tend to her needs.</p><p>And that was a lesson this particular driver was going to learn very soon.</p><p>Having made that decision, she stared out the cab\u2019s window.</p><p>Snow. Big, fluffy flakes of snow. Wasn\u2019t that festive? Wasn\u2019t that a lovely way to return to sheep-shit Bhak?</p><p>Thank the Darkness she had a few dresses that would be suitable for the Winsol celebrations, including the red dress she\u2019d bought yesterday. It wasn\u2019t the quality she was accustomed to, but people would be impressed that she\u2019d lowered her standards in order to be a gracious guest and buy some dresses in Dena Nehele.</p><p>Her court would have to spread the word of her return quickly so invitations that might have been discarded in her absence could be sent again. And if all the invitations didn\u2019t make it out, some families would be honored by her presence and the others not only would feel the social sting of their error, they also would feel a sting in their income when she, as their Queen, made a few adjustments to the tithes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why had she wasted so much time in Dena Nehele? Why had she wasted herself onthose people? They wouldn\u2019t have anything resembling polite society in years, if ever. And the men! Even a standard five-year contract would have been too long to survive among them.</p><p>Could she have survived five years among them? Or would one of those Warlord Princes have honed his knife on her bones over something that should have been overlooked in the first place?</p><p>She would miss Theran. He\u2019d made her feel special in a way no one else ever had. She would miss him for that.</p> <p>She called in the jeweler\u2019s box and studied the silver bracelet. Then she vanished it again and sighed. A trinket gift that no one would notice\u2014unless they noticed its lack of quality. How could a man live in a place like the Grayhaven mansion and not understand the difference between a gift of quality and a trinket gift?</p><p>The driver pulled up at the Queen\u2019s house. The private side,her side, was completely dark, including the globes that should have lit the front door. On the side reserved for the business of the court, light shone from the window of the Steward\u2019s office, and globes of witchlight lit the public door.</p><p>The driver handed her down and drove off without a courteous word or a backward glance. At least the bastard had known better than to ask her to pay a fare.</p><p>Despite the lack of welcome, she tried the private door first. Her key wouldn\u2019t open the lock, and the shields permeating the door and walls kept her from using Craft to pass through the wood.</p><p>Having no choice, Kermilla stomped to the public door of her house and pounded on it. Hell\u2019s fire! There were lights in the windows, sosomeone should be around to answer the door. It wasn\u2019t that late.</p> <p>The door finally opened. A stranger stared at her. \u201cMay I help you, Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the other one?\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><p>\u201cHe resigned.\u201d</p><p>She took a step forward. He didn\u2019t step back. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Lady. You have not yet presented a card.\u201d</p><p>Stung, she blinked snowflakes out of her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Kermilla. The Queen of Bhak. This is my house.\u201d</p><p>He studied her much too long before stepping back. \u201cIn that case, if you would like to step inside, I\u2019ll inform the Steward that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d she said, storming past him. \u201cI\u2019ll speak with him later. Right now I want to go up to my suite and clean up. Have the cook come to me so I can tell her what I want for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>She stopped short when a shield came up in front of her, effectively blocking all access to any of the rooms. She whirled to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cButler will do.\u201d</p> <p>Not an answer. Before she could give him a blast of temper, she took a good look at him.</p><p>A Purple Dusk Prince. His caste didn\u2019t outrank hers, but his Jewels did.</p><p>Footsteps along another hallway. Then Gallard turned the corner and stopped.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla! We didn\u2019t expect you,\u201d Gallard said.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell is going on?\u201d Kermilla shouted. \u201cWhy is thismale refusing to let me into my own house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Gallard looked uncomfortable. \u201cCome into my office. There\u2019s a lovely fire in there. So comforting on a cold evening such as this. Butler? Could you arrange for another setting?\u201d</p><p>Butler tipped his head. \u201cI\u2019ll also inform Housekeeper that a guest room will be needed this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest room?\u201d Kermilla shrieked. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla,please. \u201d</p><p>She saw it in Gallard\u2019s eyes. Nerves. Maybe even fear. Which was why she didn\u2019t say anything when the shield dropped and Gallard took her arm and led her into his office.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s beef stew tonight,\u201d Gallard said. When they reached the small dining table that was against one wall of his office, he released her arm. \u201cCook added a different spice, I think. Gives the stew a bit of heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that man?\u201d Kermilla shrugged out of her coat and tossed it toward a chair.</p><p>Gallard picked up the coat where it had fallen on the floor and carefully laid it over the chair\u2019s back. \u201cHe\u2019s the butler. Considering who he reports to, it is in our best interest to maintain as amiable a relationship with him as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does he report to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sabrina\u2019s Steward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A tapping on the door. Butler walked in with a tray. He set another bowl of stew on the table, another cup and saucer, and a small plate of fruit and cheese.</p><p>Kermilla sniffed. At least Therantried to set a better table. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I want that for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what there is,\u201d Butler replied. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, do without.\u201d</p><p>Too shocked to respond, she watched him leave the room.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Kermilla,\u201d Gallard said. \u201cThe food isn\u2019t fancy, but it is good.\u201d</p><p>She sat\u2014and tried to ignore his gusty sigh of relief as he settled the napkin on his lap and continued his meal.</p><p>Gallard ate as if he feared an interruption would take him away from the food. She ate because she was hungry. She didn\u2019tsay anything, but she made sure he knew she considered the meal an insult.</p><p>\u201cThat man is intolerable,\u201d Kermilla said when Gallard poured coffee for both of them. \u201cHe has to be dismissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you afford to replace him?\u201d Gallard asked. \u201cHe serves the Territory Queen, and his wages, along with the housekeeper, the cook, the maid, and the footman, come from her. If you dismiss any of these people, you will not get a replacement unless you can pay that person\u2019s wages. And I can tell you right now, anyone who agrees to work here will want their wages in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then we\u2019ll pay for respectful servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tithes, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no tithes.\u201d</p><p>She bobbled her cup and almost spilled the coffee.</p><p>Gallard\u2019s sadness spread over her like a smothering blanket.</p><p>\u201cThe court is beggared, Kermilla. I apologize for the criticism, but you spent so extravagantly when you first took over rule of Bhak and Woolskin that we haven\u2019t been able to pay all the debts.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla swayed in her seat. \u201cThen raise the tithes. Squeeze a little more out of the damn landens.\u201d</p><p>Gallard dabbed his mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhen you demanded that I raise the summer tithes in order to provide you with money you needed during your visit, I obeyed and used some of the extra income to pay down your debts. However, when I went to pay the guards their quarterly income, I discovered the village treasury had been drained. The men were given half their wages, and they all began to fall into debt because they couldn\u2019t pay their bills. You demanded more money. I raised the tithes again. When told what they would be required to pay for the autumn tithes, the landens refused to harvest their crops. They let them rot in the fields. They said that since their children were going to starve anyway on the little that was left, they saw no reason to work and sweat in order to feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare they!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe tried to keep things contained, but you didn\u2019t answer my letters, and you ignored my pleas for your return. Then Lady Darlena and Lady Sabrina\u2019s Stewards showed up to review the accounts and to personally receive the Queens\u2019 shares of the autumn tithes. They were almost buried under the complaints, pleas, and accusations from both villages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s done,\u201d Kermilla said crossly. \u201cI\u2019m back now, and I\u2019ll fix things with the mighty Queens. What can you give me for income now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s something. Household funds.Something. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head too quickly. Resentment bubbled up inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see Sabrina tomorrow and fix this,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is the first day of Winsol,\u201d Gallard said. \u201cExcept for emergencies, the Queen doesn\u2019t grant audiences during Winsol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThisis an emergency!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, it is not. But it is a smear on our reputations that we must all work to overcome. Everything has a price. We acted imprudently, and now we must pay the consequences.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a smear onher reputation. Just because her First Circle hadn\u2019t had balls enough to keep things under control didn\u2019t meanshe should bear the blame.</p><p>\u201cHow soon can the servants open up my side of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have to discuss that with Lady Sabrina or her Steward. He closed that side of the house since it wasn\u2019t in use.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with him. He wasn\u2019t saying the things he should be saying. \u201cWhere is Jhorma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJhorma is celebrating Winsol elsewhere this year,\u201d Gallard said. \u201cSince none of us are from Bhak, everyone else is spending Winsol in their home villages. I elected to stay and catch up on paperwork\u2014and to maintain the court\u2019s presence in the village. After darkest night, the Master of the Guard will return, and I\u2019ll go home for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do? My house is closed up, my court is scattered, and no one seems to care that I came back to celebrate the most important holiday with my people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know you were returning. Frankly, Kermilla, we had no reason to believe you would return to Bhak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I return? I rule here.\u201d</p><p>For now.</p><p>She heard the unspoken warning. \u201cI\u2019ve been traveling most of the day, and I\u2019m tired. I\u2019d like to go to my room now. Please arrange to have a carriage for me first thing tomorrow morning to take me to the landing web. I want to talk to Sabrina before she becomes so immersed in frivolity that she forgets her duties as a Queen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gallard sucked in a breath, but in the end he escorted her to the guest room and said nothing.</p><p>She would talk to Sabrina and get this mess straightened out so that she could enjoy some of Winsol. And she would go home for a few days. She needed to be around people who thought she was wonderful, and she could count on her father to give her enough marks to tide her over.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p> <p>KAELEER</p><p>Kermilla stood at the parlor window in her parents\u2019 house and watched the snow fall. It was a roomy house, the kind typically owned by a couple who came from secondary branches of aristo families and wanted to maintain the social connections that would be an asset to their children.</p><p>Social connections were of no use to her right now. At least, not until she managed to get her father alone and talked him into giving her some help.</p><p>She should have left early on the first day of Winsol as she\u2019d intended to do. But she\u2019d wrangled with that thrice-damned butler in order to get access to her clothes\u2014which was insulting beyond words\u2014andthen discovered most of the new jewelry and half the new clothes she\u2019d bought before going to Dena Nehele weregone. Not stolen by the servants, as she\u2019d first suspected. No, something even worse. The jewelry that hadn\u2019t been paid for yet had been returned to the jewelers. The dresses and formal gowns that hadn\u2019t been worn had been sent to shops in other Provinces to be sold in order to pay for the clothes shehad worn.</p><p>Thank the Darkness she\u2019d had two trunks of autumn and winter clothes sent to her in Dena Nehele. The damn nosy Stewards hadn\u2019t foundthose clothes and they never would.</p> <p>By the time she\u2019d gotten that sorted out and taken a Coach to Sabrina\u2019s residence, the Queen of Dharo was gone and her thrice-damned Steward refused to reveal her location, even when Kermilla emphasized several times that this was an emergency.</p><p>The Steward, of course, offered to hear her out.</p><p>The man had no balls, no sex, and no heart. He listened calmly, with no sign of interest or concern. He didn\u2019t respond to flirting or to pouts or any other tool that usually proved useful when dealing with men.</p><p>He listened. Then he told her what financial arrangements Lady Sabrina had authorized for Kermilla and her court.</p><p>The private side of the Queen\u2019s house in Bhak would be reopened for Kermilla\u2019s use. Sabrina would pay for the general maintenance of that house and its stables until spring. That included the wages for the butler, housekeeper, cook, maid, footman, coachman, and stable lad. No additional staff, not even restoring Kermilla\u2019s personal maid. Food for the Queen and the First Circle who were in residence, as well as for the servants, would also be paid for by the Territory Queen. Kermilla would be responsible for the expense of any entertainment held at the house.</p><p>Income? Had Lady Kermilla discussed the situation in Bhak and Woolskin with her own Steward? Yes? Then the Lady was aware that there was no income available for her use since the winter tithes had gone into paying down the remaining debts.</p> <p>Insulting, insufferable man, treating her like a child who had overspent her allowance! Yes, just like that but neverever acknowledging that the allowance hadn\u2019t been adequate to begin with!</p><p>She\u2019d gotten no satisfaction from Sabrina\u2019s Steward beyond him giving her an appointment to meet with Dharo\u2019s Queen the day after Winsol ended.</p><p>It had been too humiliating to go back to the house in Bhak. If she summoned her court to return, what would she do with them? She couldn\u2019t throw any parties or dinners, couldn\u2019t afford tickets to a play or a concert or any other kind of entertainment. And it occurred to her that Sabrina didn\u2019t know yet that her First Circle was short a man, and having the other men scattered would make that fact less obvious.</p><p>So she returned to Bhak long enough to pack up all her clothes, then came here to her parents\u2019 house to \u201cenjoy the holiday as a daughter instead of a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Her father was delighted to see her. Her mother was pleased too, but Kermilla sensed a reservation there. And her brother and sister hadn\u2019t made any accommodation to spend time with her, as they should have since she was a Queen.</p><p>The parlor door opened and her father walked in. Then he saw her, realized they were alone, and started to back out.</p><p>\u201cFather, wait.\u201d Kermilla rushed over to him, grabbed his hand, and pulled him into the room. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should wait for your mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d She tugged him over to a chair, then sat on the footstool in front of him. \u201cI wanted to talk toyou. \u201d</p><p>He sighed, as if he knew what she wanted to talk about. But there was sadness in his eyes and more than a little worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, sweets?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI need some help. Just a little,\u201d she added quickly when he shook his head. \u201cThere was a misunderstanding about the court expenses and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help, Kermilla. I\u2019m sorry, sweets, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that much,\u201d she coaxed, sure she could wear him down. He had never failed her before. Ever.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said with a thread of temper that sounded a little like fear. \u201cWhen your mother found out about all the debts I\u2019d managed to hide from her, all the debts weighing on the family now for the clothes and things you needed while you were in training . . .\u201d He clasped his hands together tight enough to turn the knuckles white. \u201cShe told me that if I gave you so much as a silver mark without her consent she\u2019ll divorce me, and the only things I\u2019ll take from the marriage are my personal belongings and all of your debts.\u201d Now he clasped her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to think of your brother and sister now, sweets. They did without plenty of things these past few years because you needed so much to get established. But you are established now, ruling a village and having a Queen\u2019s income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Queen\u2019s expenses,\u201d she pouted.</p><p>He released her hands. \u201cThen you need to talk to your Steward about court expenses, or talk to a man of business about investing some of your income to give you some profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good once the spring tithes come in, but I need something now!\u201d Kermilla said.</p><p>\u201cBut the winter tithes were paid not more than a few days ago,\u201d he protested. \u201cWhat happened to that income?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA misunderstanding between my Steward and Sabrina\u2019s. It will be straightened out as soon as I talk to her after Winsol, but for now I need two or three hundred gold marks to tide me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shock in his eyes. Panic as the front door opened. He bolted out of the chair and almost knocked her over in his haste to get out of the room.</p><p>She heard her mother\u2019s voice\u2014and her father\u2019s. Too low to hear the words, but she recognized the tone.</p><p>A minute later, her mother walked into the room and stood near the chair. Kermilla stood up, lifting her chin in a subtle challenge. After all, her mother might wear Summer-sky too, but she was just a witch, not a Queen.</p><p>Her mother studied her for a long moment. Too long. \u201cWe\u2019ve given you all the financial help we can. It\u2019s time for you to take responsibility for yourself, especially when you\u2019ve taken responsibility for so many other people\u2019s lives now. I love you, Kermilla, and I love your father. But I will divorce him if that\u2019s what I have to do to protect your brother and sister\u2019s future. I will do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t help me at all?\u201d Kermilla asked.</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cFinancially? No. There\u2019s nothing left to give, and there won\u2019t be for several more years.\u201d She paused. \u201cAre you going to stay with us through the days of Winsol?\u201d</p><p>Kermilla nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt would have hurt your father terribly if you only came to see him in order to get money.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy came downstairs and paused, listening. Hearing nothing in the rooms usually occupied by the court, she went along to the kitchen, where the servants were most likely to gather at this hour for a cup of tea and a light snack.</p><p>It stung that Gray had been right to insist that she take a nap. During the first four days of Winsol, she\u2019d visited a dozen villages in the Shalador reserves and the two southernmost Provinces; she\u2019d listened to children in each of those villages sing the same three traditional Winsol songs; she\u2019d toured those villages with the residing Queen or Warlord Prince to see the new loaning libraries and other improvements; and she\u2019d felt overwhelmed by the number of people who had lined those villages\u2019 main streets in order to see the Queen known as Shalador\u2019s Lady.</p><p>A couple of sneezes this morning and Gray had started fretting that she was coming down with a chill from overwork. He\u2019d held his tongue while she attended the performances this morning, since it was the last official function she would make beyond her home village until after Winsol, but when they returned home for the midday meal he insisted she go to bed and rest for the afternoon\u2014and Shira had agreed with him.</p><p>Her breathinghad felt a little raspy and her chest had burned when she coughed, so she didn\u2019t argue with them too much. Now, feeling better after drinking the healing brew Shira had made for her and getting some sleep, she wandered into the kitchen to find her court and family.</p><p>Devra looked over, then pulled two baking sheets out of the oven and set them on trivets to cool. \u201cThere you are, Daughter. You look better for the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Cassidy was so focused on the baking sheets, she barely heard her mother. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d They looked like circles of dough, baked golden brown and full of . . . Was that chocolate?</p><p>\u201cChocolate chunk cookies,\u201d Maydra replied as she continued to blend and stir ingredients in a big bowl on the counter. \u201cA special Winsol treat that\u2019s made in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought the ingredients to make a couple of our family treats, so Maydra and I have been baking this afternoon,\u201d Devra said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassidy\u2019s mouth watered.</p><p>Devra transferred the cookies from the baking sheets onto cooling racks. She glanced at Cassidy, then shook her head and chuckled. \u201cThe last time you had that look in your eyes, you were seven years old and ate yourself into a stupor.\u201d She picked up a cookie and handed it to Cassidy. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy ignored Maydra\u2019s amused snort and bit into the still-warm cookie. \u201cOh. Mmmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Devra suggested that the women connected to the court each make one or two treats for Winsol,\u201d Maydra said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll divide them up between those households. That way everyone gets variety without extra expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make enough of these to share?\u201d Cassidy asked, eyeing the cookies.</p><p>Her mother gave her a look that made her feel like she was seven years old again, so she decided it was time to sound like a grown-up. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is with his apprentice carpenters. They\u2019ve all made gifts for people and wanted his help with the finishing touches. As for everyone else . . .\u201d Devra tipped her head. \u201cThey\u2019re outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Frannie rushed into the kitchen with Cassidy\u2019s heavy winter coat. \u201cLady! You can\u2019t be going out there without a coat. Not with you trying to shake off a chill!\u201d</p><p>Cassidy eyed the young Shalador witch who wanted to work as a personal maid\u2014and was using Cassidy and Reyhana as her training ground. The girl had potential and took real pleasure in her work\u2014and everyone pretended not to know that Frannie had become so skilled at weaving hair into intricate braids by practicing on her father\u2019s draft horses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to step outside for a minute,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cHuh!\u201d Frannie held up the coat. \u201cThe stoop is swept clean, so you won\u2019t be needing boots.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy glanced at her mother, decided the gleam in Devra\u2019s eyes meant that mother sided with the maid, and let herself get bundled into the coat and nudged out the back door.</p><p>Shira and Reyhana stood next to the stoop, watching men, boys, and Scelties run around the backyard.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking better,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>Cassidy nodded. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying cows and sheep,\u201d Reyhana replied. \u201cEryk and Eliot are the sheep. Shaddo, Janos, Ranon, and Gray are the cows. The silver twins, Darcy, Khollie, and Darkmist are the herders. The white globes of witchlight at that end of the yard is the corral. The green globes are brambles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those little hourglasses floating near the witchlights?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Shira said. \u201cLittle two-minute timers. If a cow or sheep gets into the brambles, he can stay for two minutes as a resting period. If he gets herded into the corral, he has to stay for two minutes before trying to escape. The object of the game is to get all the cows and sheep into the corral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s winning?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Shira shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Reyhana said. \u201cThat looks like a stampede.\u201d</p> <p>The men were smart, skilled at working as a team, and had long legs. The dogs had speed, were using Craft to run on top of the snow, and were born with the ability to herd reluctant critters. The boys had an abundance of energy.</p><p>Based on what she was seeing, Cassidy figured the winners would be determined by which side had the most stamina.</p><p>*Would you bet on the men to win?* Cassidy asked Shira.</p><p>*Of course I would! Anything else would be disloyal.*</p><p>*Would you expect to win the bet?*</p><p>*Nope. So I wouldn\u2019t bet much.*</p><p>Cassidy suppressed a laugh and watched the game.</p><p>One moment everyone was running, shouting, barking, laughing. The next, men and dogs stood frozen, staring at the house. The dogs growled softly. The men, Warlord Princes all, stared with eyes that began to glaze as they rose to the killing edge. Only the boys took a few more steps before realizing something was wrong.</p><p>Then everyone was in motion again. Darcy got in front of the boys. Khollie dashed for her and Shira. Shaddo and the silver twins headed around the house in one direction while Janos and Darkmist headed around the other side. Ranon and Gray moved together, heading for the kitchen door.</p><p>Then the Scelties hesitated, and Cassidy had the impression that information was being passed between all the warriors.</p><p>*What just happened?* Shira asked.</p><p>*An alert, I think,* Cassidy replied. But what had caused it? And would she ever get used to the way Warlord Princes could change in a heartbeat from laughing, easy men to warriors rising to the killing edge?</p><p>The back door opened and Dryden said, \u201cLady Cassidy, Prince Ferall and Prince Hikaeda are here and have asked if you could spare them a few minutes of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dryden,\u201d Cassidy said. As she turned to enter the house, she realized Gray and Ranon intended to come in with her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to interrupt your game. I can talk to them by myself.\u201d</p><p>They looked at her. Just looked at her.</p><p>Overprotective and bossy\u2014and they managed the bossy part without saying a word.</p><p>And would fight with her and for her to their last breath in order to protect her from real or potential harm, whether she wanted them to or not.</p><p>Sighing, she went inside, shrugged out of her coat and handed it to Frannie\u2014and pretended she wasn\u2019t worried about how to control Ranon\u2019s and Gray\u2019s response to men they knew.</p><p>She walked into the visitors\u2019 parlor with Ranon and Gray moving to flank her\u2014Gray on her left and Ranon on her right.</p><p>Vae wagged her tail in greeting, then trotted out of the room.</p><p>Well, that explained why the Scelties had relaxed a bit. Vae had been watching the guests and hadn\u2019t given a call to battle.</p><p>What was she supposed to say to these men about being regarded with such suspicion just because they had asked to see her? Her former court hadn\u2019t behaved this way, so she had no precedent.</p><p>Yes, she did. Jaenelle\u2019s court.Her First Circle would have looked more casual, but they would have been just as prepared to fight.</p><p>Ferall gave her a quick glance before focusing on her men.</p><p>\u201cRanon,\u201d Ferall said quietly. Then he studied Gray. \u201cJared Blaed.\u201d Finally he looked at her. \u201cHikaeda and I are here on behalf of the Warlord Princes in our Province to wish you a Happy Winsol\u2014and to thank you for the books. It means a lot to all of us to receive such a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, gentlemen,\u201d Cassidy said, smiling. \u201cCould I offer you some refreshments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the offer, but with your consent, we\u2019d like to visit the main street and the shops there,\u201d Ferall said. \u201cHave a couple of special gifts to buy this year.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded simple enough, but Cassidy heard uneasiness in his voice. Almost fear. As if he\u2019d just revealed something terribly important and terribly fragile, and he was waiting to see how she would respond.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThen I won\u2019t delay you any longer. I\u2019ve gone shopping with my father when he wanted a special gift, so I know how long it can take a man to choose the right one.\u201d</p><p>Smiles and chuckles all around.</p><p>\u201cJared Blaed and I could use some exercise, so we\u2019ll walk over with you,\u201d Ranon said casually.</p><p>You need some what?Cassidy almost blurted out. Then she realized it wasn\u2019t casual at all, and felt insulted on behalf of the men who had come here in good faith.</p><p>She rounded on Ranon. \u201cI\u2019m sure Prince Ferall and Prince Hikaeda don\u2019t need your escort for a little shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn point of fact, Lady, we do,\u201d Hikaeda said.</p><p>She turned back to her guests, surprised to hear Hikaeda defend Ranon.</p><p>\u201cWhen a Warlord Prince comes into a village, it makes people nervous,\u201d Ferall said. \u201cAnd they have good reason to be nervous. We are what we are, Lady Cassidy. Predators. Killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s customary to give a Warlord Prince a local escort,\u201d Hikaeda said. \u201cIt tells the people he isn\u2019t there to hunt. Makes it easier for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Was that true in Kaeleer as well? She didn\u2019t remember her First Circle offering escort to a Warlord Prince when one of them came to Bhak. Maybe she could ask her cousin Aaron if this was typical of all courts or just a Territory Queen\u2019s. \u201cIn that case, I apologize for snapping at you, Ranon.\u201d</p><p>They all looked surprised that she would apologize at all, let alone in public.</p><p>Suddenly she wanted them all gone so she could get a cup of spiced tea and think about all the undercurrents and unspoken messages that had filled this room in the past few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to stop at Whistler\u2019s Tavern at some point,\u201d Cassidy told Gray. \u201cI think they\u2019re serving steak pie along with some traditional Winsol dishes.\u201d</p><p>Gray glanced at the other men. \u201cI think we\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d She tipped her head, a small courtesy bow to indicate respect. \u201cHappy Winsol.\u201d</p><p>She walked back to the kitchen and found Shira and Reyhana sitting at the table with Devra and Maydra. All of them had cups of coffee, and there were two cookies left on a plate.</p><p>\u201cWe saved these two for you,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>Cassidy took one and chewed slowly. \u201cMaydra, could you make another batch of these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made enough for all the households to share, Daughter,\u201d Devra said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to send them to someone as a special gift,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Maydra nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough ingredients for one more batch. I can do that after dinner tonight. Didn\u2019t make anything fancy for the evening meal, after all the baking this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray and Ranon are dining out with Ferall and Hikaeda,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cAnd Powell is out this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is going to eat with his apprentices so they can keep working for a few hours longer,\u201d Devra said. \u201cSince it\u2019s just the women tonight, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t cook as we please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassidy took the last cookie. \u201cThat\u2019s settled then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA word with you, Cassie?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Cassidy turned away from the dining room. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>They went into the parlor. Now that they had privacy, he didn\u2019t seem eager to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your family here for Winsol,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy brother Clayton is coming tomorrow to be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have half the court here, so you\u2019ll be looked after.\u201d</p><p>He was tiptoeing around something. \u201cTalon, it\u2019s Winsol. The next few days are social and fun. I don\u2019t need looking after.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are some who do,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI wanted your consent to be gone for a few days. Thing is, the mountain passes still need to be guarded, so there are still men in the rogue camps. Some of them are there because they see that as their duty to Queen and land. Some of them are there because they\u2019d seen too much when the twisted Queens ruled here, and they haven\u2019t found the courage yet to come down to the villages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Talon.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t be doing that, Cassie. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s not as bad as you\u2019re thinking. And it\u2019s better this year than it\u2019s been in a long time. Thing is, I trained a lot of those boys, so I\u2019ve always made it a point to spend a little time in each of those camps around Winsol Eve and Winsol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should do that.\u201d Cassidy blinked away the tears. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner? We could have done something for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been done. First Circle took care of it. Guess we should have told you, but you were already doing plenty.\u201d Talon smiled. \u201cGray made up a bundle of books for each camp. Good entertainment on winter nights. Got new blankets and other supplies to pass out. Got baked goods and casseroles, fruits and coffee. Got a bit of a feast for each camp. They\u2019ll already be making some of their own; this will add to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Do you know how many men are still up there?\u201d</p> <p>Talon shook his head. \u201cSome went down to their home villages for a while, then went back into the mountains. I\u2019ll have a better idea once I\u2019ve seen the camps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowell is out this evening, so I\u2019ll talk to him tomorrow morning and see what can be spared from the tithes for quarterly wages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWages? For what?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy lifted her chin. \u201cYou said they\u2019re guarding the passes for Queen and land. To me that sounds like they work for the court. And if they work for the court, they get paid by the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, that\u2019s not why I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Talon. It doesn\u2019t make it any less true. If this is the work they do, they will be paid. We may not be able to give them what they deserve\u2014not yet, anyway\u2014but those men will be acknowledged.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her for a long moment. Then he kissed her cheek and walked out of the room.</p><p>She gave herself another minute to settle before joining the other women for dinner.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon walked into the parlor where Jaenelle was tucking the last few presents under the tree before she created an illusion spell of the brightly wrapped boxes. Most, if not all, of those gifts would be going with her to the Keep this evening, so the illusion spell would maintain this room\u2019s festive appearance.</p><p>He would tuck his special gift for her among the rest once he joined her at the Keep tomorrow for the family\u2019s celebration of Winsol.</p><p>He held out a brown delivery box. \u201cThis came for you. Special delivery from Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Cassie?\u201d Jaenelle put the last box in place, frowned a little, rearranged a couple more, then nodded, finally satisfied with the arrangement.</p><p>Of course, if this package was supposed to go with the others, his darling wife could well pull them all out and start again.</p><p>He might find that annoying if he didn\u2019t suspect she was trying to figure out what the gifts were without using Craft to probe the packages.</p><p>That was considered cheating.</p><p>Besides, if challenged, he would deny having done anything similar when he\u2019d handled packages while putting his gifts under the tree.</p><p>Jaenelle opened the delivery box and uncovered a note and a large bakery tin.</p><p>\u201cChocolate chunk cookies,\u201d she read. \u201cTaste best when slightly warm.\u201d She vanished the note, opened the bakery tin, and took a cookie.</p><p>Daemon narrowed his gold eyes as he watched her slowly chew and swallow. Until now, the only time he\u2019d seenthat look on her face was when he was doing something especially pleasing with his hands or mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see those.\u201d He reached for a cookie.</p><p>She hugged the tin, took a step back, and snarled, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he purred, \u201cyou\u2019re sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you like having sex with me.\u201d</p><p>She watched him out of those sapphire eyes. \u201cYou think you can give me sex that\u2019s as good as these cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can manage that.\u201d</p><p>She put the last bite of cookie in her mouth. She chewed. Swallowed. Licked melted chocolate off her fingers.</p><p>And gave him a smile that made his knees weak and his blood sizzle.</p><p>\u201cDid you have any plans for this afternoon?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Her smile turned a bit feral and a whole lot hotter.</p><p>She handed him the bakery tin, walked to the door, and said over her shoulder, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell Beale we\u2019re going to miss the midday meal?\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk out of the room and wondered when she\u2019d learned to dothat with her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I do that?\u201d Since he needed a minute before he left the room, he ate a cookie. \u201cDamn, theyare good.\u201d He studied the cookies\u2014and smiled.</p><p>They tasted best when warm? Well, he\u2019d have to see how warm he could make it when he walked into the bedroom holding a bakery tin full of these cookies\u2014and wearing nothing but black leather pants that fit like a second skin.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Winsol. For the Blood it was the most important day of the year.</p><p>For Theran, it was a bittersweet evening.</p><p>He sat in a chair near the fire Julien had lit in the parlor, his socked feet resting on a stool. Watching the flames, he idly swirled brandy in a snifter.</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed these past few days more than he\u2019d expected. The first time he\u2019d shown up at a social engagement without Kermilla, there had been an awkward silence, but word must have spread after that because none of his other hosts mentioned her absence. And because her absence meant he was free to travel to other towns, he\u2019d spent some time with other Warlord Princes who had been friends in the rogue camps.</p><p>The days leading up to Winsol had been full. He still missed Kermilla with an ache that made him feel hollowed out at times\u2014even when he acknowledged to himself that she wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed the parties half as much as he did, being used to things that were so much grander.</p><p>If she\u2019d asked him to spend Winsol with her in Dharo, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. Would his clothes and manners have been that much of an embarrassment to her?</p><p>Probably.</p><p>She certainly would have been offended by the thought of sitting down with the servants for the Winsol feast. Since he couldn\u2019t see the cook making a separate meal just for him, he\u2019d asked Julien, Hanna, and the others to join him in the dining room and to set the table with whatever bits of fancy the butler and housekeeper could find. Despite the surroundings and a much better quality of food, sitting with them tonight had felt more like a Winsol dinner in the rogue camps\u2014camaraderie and easy teasing between the adults and youngsters, and laughter. A great deal of laughter and the hopeful relief that the bad times were behind them.</p><p>He enjoyed the meal and the chance to know them as people instead of just servants.</p><p>But he still missed Kermilla. And Gray. Hell\u2019s fire, he missed Gray. Not Gray as he\u2019d been for the past ten years, but the youth he had been before he was captured and tortured. As he sipped his brandy and stared at the fire, Theran kept remembering that last Winsol when Gray was whole and happy\u2014when one of them wasn\u2019t weighed down by nightmares and the other by guilt.</p><p>A tap on the parlor door before Julien stepped in. \u201cPrince Talon is here and asked if you\u2019re available to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Theran set the brandy aside and pushed out of the chair. \u201cSend him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any of that special wine,\u201d Julien said. \u201cIs there something else we can offer as refreshment?\u201d</p><p>Would Julien actually open a vein and mix his own blood with red wine to make yarbarah?</p><p>Studying his butler\u2019s face, Theran realized that was a distinct possibility. \u201cLet me find out if he wants anything.\u201d He paused, wondering if he was reading something in Julien\u2019s voice that wasn\u2019t really there. \u201cI appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>Julien nodded and stepped out of the room.</p><p>A minute later, Talon walked in.</p><p>\u201cHappy Winsol,\u201d Talon said, giving Theran a hard hug and a smile.</p><p>\u201cHappy Winsol.\u201d Theran grinned, delighted by this visit. \u201cCome sit by the fire. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have more snow until morning, but the old men who have weather aches say no one will move far from their own doorstep tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably right,\u201d Talon replied, taking a seat by the fire. \u201cPlenty of snow up in the mountains this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in the Tamanara Mountains?\u201d Theran couldn\u2019t keep the surprise out of his voice. Did Cassidy know her Master of the Guard was visiting the rogue camps?</p><p>\u201cI always visit the camps during the Winsol nights.\u201d Talon gave him a sharp look. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. The past few years, he\u2019d made those visits with the older man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have time for that this year,\u201d Theran said. He didn\u2019t add that, until tonight, he hadn\u2019t thought about the men who had remained in the mountain camps.</p><p>\u201cI had time.\u201d</p><p>Made time is what Talon meant.Since he should have done the same, he changed the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s Gray?\u201d</p> <p>Talon smiled. \u201cBoy\u2019s got as much energy as a Sceltie, and he\u2019s almost as good at herding.\u201d</p><p>Is she working him hard?Not a question he could ask out loud since Cassidy was a sore subject between them.</p><p>Still smiling, Talon shook his head. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t working in the Queen\u2019s gardens, he was overseeing the restoration of the small public gardens and parks in the village. Since Cassie, Shira, and Vae all insisted that he balance that with quiet work, Powell put him in charge of helping villages establish loaning libraries. I\u2019ve never seen him happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he miss having you with him for Winsol?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. Cassie\u2019s parents and her brother are staying for Winsol. Along with the First Circle, he\u2019s got plenty of people around him.\u201d Talon gave him a long look, then asked quietly, \u201cWhat about you? Why are you alone tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve attended more parties, winter picnics, musical evenings, card parties, riding parties, you-name-it parties in the past six days than I\u2019ve ever seen. I had a choice of attending four Winsol parties or having a quiet evening at home. I chose to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kermilla?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the ache caused by the sound of her name. \u201cShe had Winsol commitments to fill in Dharo.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s court didn\u2019t know that Kermilla was gone for good, and he wasn\u2019t about to say anything that would lead Talon to think that. Besides, he didn\u2019t know for certain she was gone for good. Correne\u2019s death and the reason the little bitch had died had shaken Kermilla. It would have shaken any woman with a sensitive heart. Once she had some time away, she might realize that her influence as Dena Nehele\u2019s Queen would curb the younger Queens and could prevent another tragedy like the one that had left a boy so horribly maimed.</p><p>As pleased as he was to see Talon, it was unfortunate that Cassidy\u2019s Master of the Guard had learned that Kermilla wasn\u2019t currently in Dena Nehele. Without Kermilla\u2019s presence, Cassidy would solidify her claim as Territory Queen next spring without a challenge. He still didn\u2019t think she was the best Queen for Dena Nehele, so he saw no reason to surrender the field to her until he had no other choice.</p><p>Talon stared at the fire, saying nothing. Then he shook himself out of whatever thoughts had pulled him away. \u201cDidn\u2019t intend to disturb your quiet evening. I just wanted to stop by and give you these.\u201d He called in two wrapped packages, one large and one small.</p> <p>Theran\u2019s face burned. With the way they\u2019d parted, he hadn\u2019t expected to see Talon or Gray, hadn\u2019t expected to be remembered. So, feeling the pinch in his purse, he hadn\u2019t bought anything for them. \u201cTalon . . .\u201d</p><p>Talon waved a hand dismissively. \u201cFreely given. Freely taken.\u201d</p><p>The words Cassidy used the first time she had offered Talon blood from her vein. Apparently the phrase was being used for other kinds of gifts as well.</p><p>Setting aside the smaller gift, Theran opened the larger package, then exclaimed in delight as he lifted the winter coat out of the tailor\u2019s box. He slipped it on.</p><p>Talon nodded. \u201cYou and Gray are the same size, so we thought it would fit you. There are gloves in the box as well.\u201d</p><p>Theran found them and tried them on. Fine leather. Excellent workmanship.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say except thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. The coat and gloves are from Gray and me. The other is from Cassidy.\u201d</p> <p>Something burned in his throat as he removed the coat and gloves and carefully set them aside. He swallowed that burning and opened the other gift.</p><p>\u201cA book?\u201d He opened it to the title page and stared.</p><p>\u201cShe had the account of Jared and Lia\u2019s journey made into books so that the people in Dena Nehele would know their story. She thought you should have one.\u201d</p><p>Theran closed the book. His fingers stroked the leather cover. \u201cI\u2019ll send a proper thank-you after the holidays, but please convey my thanks. This is . . . special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Talon pushed out of the chair. \u201cI guess . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you stay?\u201d Theran set the book aside and looked at the man who had raised him.</p><p>\u201cWere you lying about those parties or the invitations for tonight?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t lying. I really didn\u2019t want to attend another party tonight. But I\u2019d like to spend some time with you. Maybe play some cards or a game of chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to serve the blooded rum at midnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Talon smiled. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s see if you\u2019ve learned anything about chess.\u201d</p><p>Talon said that every time they had played, even though Theran won almost half the time.</p><p>Theran smiled as he called in the chess set that had been a Winsol gift from a few years back.</p><p>They played until midnight, then shared a traditional cup of blooded rum to celebrate Winsol. An hour later, Talon caught the Winds and headed back to Eyota.</p><p>For an hour after that, Theran sat by the fire, swirling brandy in a snifter and staring at the flames\u2014and feeling oddly content.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla.\u201d Sabrina gestured to the visitor\u2019s chair before taking her seat behind the desk. \u201cI don\u2019t usually grant audiences the day after the Winsol holidays, but I didn\u2019t think this discussion should wait any longer\u2014which is why my Steward yielded to your request and made this appointment.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla sat in the chair. \u201cThere has been a serious misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Sabrina opened the file on her desk. \u201cThat error is as much my fault as yours. I had thought that a First Circle that was experienced working together could balance the inexperience of a Queen ruling her first territory. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and too much damage was done before the problems were discovered to rectify the matter in any way except starting over.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Sabrina sighed and sat back in her chair. \u201cLike other Blood whose innate abilities are linked to their caste, Queens have an instinctive desire to rule and maintain the Blood\u2019s connection to the land. A Queen is born a Queen, but she also needs training in order to be agood Queen. In the usual way of things, you would have gone from your training with a District Queen to serving in the Second or Third Circle of a Province Queen to continue your education. Instead, you stepped into another Queen\u2019s place, acquiring her court and the villages she ruled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat courtwanted to serve me!\u201d Kermilla felt the sting of Sabrina\u2019s words because it sounded like Cassidy had handed over things the freckle-faced bitch no longer wanted instead of herwinning over those men.</p><p>\u201cYes, they did,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cAnd the decision to let you rule Bhak and Woolskin was based on their experience, not yours, and the assumption that they would have the collective balls to stand firm if your inexperience was leading the court or the people you ruled into trouble. That wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla lifted her chin. \u201cA friend needed my help and my counsel. Since theywere experienced, I thought my court would be able to handle Bhak and Woolskin during my visit. I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisit?\u201d Sabrina tapped her fingertips together. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been in residence in Bhak since early summer. Being absent from the village you\u2019re supposed to be ruling for almost half a year isn\u2019t visiting a friend; it\u2019s blatant neglect of your duties\u2014especially when you had a one-year provisional contract to prove yourself capable of ruling. If you truly needed that much time away to help a friend, you should have discussed it with Lady Darlena or me. We could have suspended your contract and reassigned your court until you returned. Or we might have allowed your court to manage the villages in your absence and had your Steward and Master of the Guard report directly to Lady Darlena.\u201d</p><p>Having Darlena or Sabrina poking their noses into her finances was exactly what she\u2019d been trying to avoid. And their Stewardswould have poked into everything, just like they did when they came to collect the autumn tithes and started all this trouble.</p><p>Kermilla lifted her chin a little higher. \u201cFrankly, Lady Sabrina, I don\u2019t think Bhak is a sufficient challenge for someone of my abilities, and that was part of the reason for my absence. But I\u2019m back now, and I\u2019ll get things straightened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are already straightened out,\u201d Sabrina said. \u201cAnd to be just as frank, Lady Kermilla, looking at the desperate situation in two villages that were happy and prosperous a year ago, my conclusion is that ruling a small village like Bhak ismore than your current abilities can handle.\u201d She slapped the file closed and let out an angry sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say this. I\u2019ve given you an opportunity to voice your opinion, so let\u2019s end this dance. You failed to prove your ability to rule. At their request, the villages under your hand will be given to another Queen when your contract ends this spring. Since the villages are in her Province, Lady Darlena will rule Bhak and Woolskin unofficially until that time. You may reside in the Queen\u2019s house until spring if you choose, but you\u2019ll be living in Bhak as a resident of the village,not as the ruling Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t fair considering the misery you\u2019ve caused other people, but providing you with food and lodging and servants whose wages don\u2019t come out of your pocket is my concession, since I should have kept a closer watch on you in the first place!\u201d</p><p>Kermilla sat back, stunned.</p><p>\u201cI am aware that you no longer have the twelve men required to form an official court,\u201d Sabrina continued. \u201cAnd I am aware ofwhy you no longer have twelve men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can explain that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t, and I strongly suggest you don\u2019t try. As for the remaining members of your First Circle, officially they\u2019re still yours to command until spring since they signed a contract of service with you. However, you should be aware that Lord Jhorma feels he is no longer able to fulfill his duties as a consort and has asked to be reassigned to escort duties for the remainder of his contract. That request was granted. The rest of your men have requested that their service to you be confined to duties in Bhak and Woolskin, whether you\u2019re residing there or not. That request was also granted. And any orders that go beyond ordinary court assignments must be approved by Darlena\u2019s Steward or Master, regardless of who gives those orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have a court in name only?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Feeling weak and dizzy, Kermilla stared at the Queen of Dharo. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that you needed an older\u2014and firmer\u2014hand than Cassidy\u2019s to guide you and help you understand your responsibilities as a Queen. It\u2019s also clear that your training failed. That gives you two choices, Kermilla. You can apply to serve in another Queen\u2019s court now, with no chance of ever ruling on your own, or you can go through the training again. All of it\u2014repeating the lessons you should have learned in Cassidy\u2019s court as well as serving in another Queen\u2019s court for two years. At the end of that time, if the Province Queens and I are convinced that you\u2019re ready, you will be permitted to form another court and you\u2019ll be given the opportunity to rule another village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I form another court without this training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t form another court in my Territory without that training,\u201d Sabrina said, her voice filled with cold steel.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I do?\u201d Kermilla persisted.</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord Princes under my hand will meet your court on a killing field\u2014and destroy it.\u201d Sabrina stood up. \u201cIs there anything else, Lady Kermilla?\u201d</p><p>Her legs were shaking so hard, she wasn\u2019t sure she could stand, but Sabrina\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t give her a choice. So she stood up and made her way to the door without taking formal leave of the Queen.</p><p>As Kermilla opened the door, Sabrina said, \u201cIt looks like you also need to brush off your manners, so a review of Protocol will be required along with the rest of your training.\u201d</p><p>Sabrina sank into the chair behind her desk and rubbed her temples to ease the headache. She didn\u2019t have to wait long for her next visitor. It wouldn\u2019t occur to him to keep her waiting.</p><p>Her Steward showed him into the room at the precise time she had requested. He stopped beside the visitor\u2019s chair.</p> <p>\u201cPrince Butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sabrina.\u201d His bow was precise, Prince to Queen, when both wore Green Jewels. Although, with his ability to mask his rank, most people assumed his full strength was the Purple Dusk that was his Birthright.</p><p>He worked for her but wouldn\u2019t serve in her court. Not officially. A roamer who would take assignments for weeks or months to be her eyes and ears\u2014and sometimes her knife. His credentials were as substantial as water written on wind. At least, the ones he offered contained more than a touch of fiction, and nothing was actually known about him beyond his caste and rank.</p><p>Almost nothing. Those insubstantial credentials carried the seal of the Queen of Ebon Askavi. Whoever he was, whatever he was, he was known to Jaenelle Angelline, and that was sufficient recommendation for every Territory Queen in Kaeleer.</p><p>\u201cPlease be seated.\u201d Sabrina waved a hand at the chair recently vacated by Kermilla.</p><p>Butler looked at the chair, wrinkled his nose, and fetched another chair from the other side of the room.</p><p>Sabrina worked to keep her mouth from falling open. \u201cIs there a problem with that chair?\u201d she asked when he\u2019d finally, and fussily, taken a seat. \u201cDid she pee on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be wet,\u201d he replied pleasantly, \u201cbut as a whole, I find Lady Kermilla\u2019s scent unpleasant.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t like her.That wasn\u2019t surprising, but it was worrying.</p><p>\u201cI understand my orders, and I won\u2019t step outside them,\u201d Butler said, his voice still pleasant. \u201cI am curious, though, about why I shouldn\u2019t step outside them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour report first.\u201d Which would give her time to decide if she would answer the question inside his last statement.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla arrived on the first day of Winsol and met with your Steward. He made her aware of what was available for her use and what was not. She returned to Bhak and stayed long enough to pack her personal belongings\u2014and express her outrage again over so many of her purchases being returned or sold. She spent the days of Winsol at her parents\u2019 house. Her family, by the way, is deeply in debt because of the little Queen\u2019s extravagance, so it appears her greed is a character trait rather than an error in judgment. She didn\u2019t return to Bhak, so she must have come to this meeting from her home village.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t she been dealt with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne man\u2019s bitch is another man\u2019s Lady,\u201d Sabrina said.</p><p>Butler smiled. \u201cThe wording is usually reversed. That is, if you were intending to quote the High Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, despite the misery she\u2019s caused, she hasn\u2019t done anythingin Dharo that a Queen isn\u2019t entitled to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeggar her people? Send one of her men to his death? Is that what a Queen is entitled to do, Lady Sabrina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen\u2019s will is the law. Where she rules, she can do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless someone stops her. Why aren\u2019t we stopping her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did stop her. She no longer rules Bhak and Woolskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want them, so she\u2019ll feel no loss. You know what she wants and where she is going and what she\u2019ll try to do now. Why aren\u2019t we stopping her?\u201d</p><p>For the same reason no one asks about your credentials.\u201cBy Blood law, I cannot interfere in another Queen\u2019s Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could fix this before she left your Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She studied him as he studied her. \u201cDo you trust Jaenelle Angelline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everything I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. And that is your answer, Butler. That\u2019s why.\u201d Sabrina sat back. \u201cWhen I met with Jaenelle and some of the others at the Keep a few weeks ago, I was ready to haul Kermilla back to Dharo. It would have been an insult to Cassidy, would have implied that she wasn\u2019t able to defend her Territory from even a small threat, but I was ready to do it. I was overruled.\u201d</p><p>Butler thought it over and nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Because he did understand, she added, \u201cSomething Jaenelle said to me in private has shaped my decisions about Kermilla and is the reason I\u2019ll stand back and let this play out as it will.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, but his eyes asked her to share. And in all fairness, if he had to spend the next couple of months in Bhak, he deserved to know.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle said some people need a hard lesson in order to learn and grow\u2014and some peopleare the hard lesson.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening, Daemon returned to his seat at the table where he and Jaenelle were playing an idle game of chess. He handed a note to his Lady. \u201cThis came from Sabrina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have had her chat with Kermilla,\u201d Jaenelle said as she opened the note.</p><p>Daemon stared at the chessboard. It would be so easy to fix this little problem. He had fixed a lot of these little problems when he\u2019d lived in Terreille, despite Dorothea SaDiablo\u2019s efforts to control him. But unless Kermilla set foot in Dhemlan, he had to leave the fixing ofthis problem to Dharo\u2019s Queen.</p><p>Jaenelle read the note and gave it back to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had more experience with women like Kermilla than I have. What do you think she\u2019s going to do?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the rules of play, he picked up his Queen and set her down behind a castle guarded by a Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Cassidy will do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Also ignoring the rules of play, Jaenelle set her Queen squarely on the edge of the battlefield, flanked by two Warlord Princes.</p><p>They looked at each other, knowing nothing more needed to be said.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran looked up when his study door opened, then sprang out of the chair to meet Kermilla as she rushed into the room. She flung herself into his arms, her hair smelling of cold air and fresh snow. Her psychic scent filled his senses like the most intoxicating perfume.</p><p>\u201cKermilla,\u201d he whispered as his arms tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to fulfill my duties as a Queen, but I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d She covered one side of his face with kisses. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me. There are so many Queens in Dharo, those villages don\u2019t need me.\u201d She pulled back enough to look at him, her eyes shining with sincerity and purpose. \u201cBut you need me. Your people need me. And I need you, Theran. I missed you so much! I want to stay with you. I want to be the Queen you need for your people. I can do it, Theran. I know I can.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her, his heart so full it ached. She\u2019d come back to him. He hadn\u2019t expected to see her again, but she\u2019d come back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll build a good life for ourselves and our people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take work and time, but we\u2019ll build a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we will.\u201d</p><p>When she raised her left hand to touch his face, he saw the silver bracelet he\u2019d given her for Winsol. Her wearing it now symbolized a choice, both for the woman and the Queen.</p><p>Moved beyond words, he pressed a kiss into her palm.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to do before spring,\u201d he said, not sure enough of what she wanted from him to ask for the intimacy he craved. \u201cI guess we should get started.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she kissed him softly\u2014then kissed him again with more heat. \u201cTomorrow is soon enough. Today I don\u2019t want to think of anything but you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy entered the kitchen, rubbing her hands. A brisk walk on a crisp morning had woken her up and made her look forward to a few hours in a warm room, even if she wasn\u2019t looking forward to working her way through the correspondence, requests, and other paperwork that had arrived like a steady snowfall since the Winsol celebrations ended two weeks ago. Just as well that the new year began in the winter season. If she was diligent, she figured she could get through all the paperwork before spring planting.</p> <p>Birdie gave her a look. Before Cassidy could say anything, the assistant housekeeper made a shooing motion. \u201cI got a pot of spiced tea almost ready for you, and I\u2019ll warm up a couple of those fruit tarts Maydra baked yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we devoured them all at dinner last night,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Birdie smiled. \u201cWe put a couple aside to go with your morning pot of tea.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Cassidy went to her office. A fire was burning nicely. A heavy shawl and blanket were laid out on the stuffed chair near the hearth, in case she began to feel chilled while working at her desk. And Powell had sorted through the new sack of mail, separating correspondence from family and friends from invitations, requests for audiences, and correspondence from Dena Nehele\u2019s Queens. There were also pens and a stack of the inexpensive paper she preferred using for notes and instructions within the court.</p><p>Sitting at the desk, she closed her eyes.</p> <p>It was lovely to feel cared for, to have someone do little things like save a fruit tart or make sure pens and paper were easily at hand. It was lovely to hear Birdie and Frannie singing while they tidied up the Residence, to hear Elle and Maydra laughing, to hear the ease in Dryden\u2019s voice when he asked her to wait a moment while he instructed the young footman in the proper way to do something that involved her.</p><p>And it was a relief that her First Circle was finally learning to relax a bit. She\u2019d notice a difference in all of them during the second half of Winsol. Oh, there was still the sharp, assessing glance whenever anyone who wasn\u2019t First Circle approached her, and her men werealways going to rise to the killing edge when someone outside the court or the home village came near her\u2014Jaenelle\u2019s last note confirmedthat . But some underlying tension had disappeared. Shira also had noticed the difference but couldn\u2019t explain it either, so they\u2019d concluded that it was something men considered private and wouldn\u2019t divulge unless given a direct order from their Queen.</p><p>And their Queen didn\u2019t see any reason to push them about something that had made them happier.</p><p>Opening her eyes, Cassidy picked up the letter opener and started on the stack of correspondence from the Queens.</p><p>It was lovely to receive these notes, to read the caution and hope beneath the stiff phrases of the Queens in the northern Provinces and to read the growing confidence and warmth of the Queens in the Shalador reserves and the southern Provinces.</p><p>Many of them were interested in sending members of their courts to learn from the two Protocol instructors she had hired to work with courts and teachers so that the people of Dena Nehele would learn Protocol and the Old Ways from people who lived by the Old Ways. Two of the cottages in the Queen\u2019s square were being repaired and cleaned for the Warlord and witch. They still hadn\u2019t decided where the \u201cschool\u201d would be located. She\u2019d suggested another empty cottage in the square. Her First Circle had vehemently opposed having that many strangers coming and going within the boundaries of land that was supposed to be secure ground.</p> <p>She\u2019d resigned herself to the time it would take to negotiate with her men. Hell\u2019s fire, it had taken days to get them to agree to let the instructors live in the square, and they only gave in aboutthat after Gray, Ranon, and Talon met the two people at the Keep\u2014and received confirmation that Prince Sadi and the High Lord approved of these instructors and thought they would fit in easily with Eyota\u2019s residents. What sealed the deal was learning that the Warlord came from Scelt and was used to living around Scelties and the Lady from Nharkhava, being an enthusiastic reader of the Tracker and Shadow stories, was willing to learn to live with Scelties.</p><p>Cassidy glanced at Vae, who was snoozing in front of the hearth.</p><p>Let the Lady from Nharkhava learn on her own like the rest of us did,Cassidy thought as she opened the last letter in that stack\u2014a letter that bore the Grayhaven seal.</p><p>Then she forgot about Scelties and Protocol instructors, forgot about the spiced tea and fruit tarts, forgot about all the hope and promise in the letters she had already read.</p><p>She\u2019d been so happy and so busy building a life and working to fulfill her promise to these people that she\u2019d forgotten it was temporary\u2014until this note from Kermilla reminded her.</p><p>\u201c. . .I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t do anything to make the transition difficult . . . valuable asset to the Territory . . . treat the reserves like a Province and appoint you their Queen. \u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what, Kermilla?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cEncourage these people to break their backs and their hearts so that you can buy another fancy dress?\u201d</p><p>Vae raised her head. *Cassie?*</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that to them. Iwon\u2019t do that to them.\u201d</p><p>*Cassie!*</p><p>She wasn\u2019t aware of Vae leaving the room, but the Sceltie returned with Powell.</p><p>\u201cVae says something upset you,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the note.</p><p>His expression turned grim. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Theran was really that much of a fool.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cThe First Circle is out and about on the court\u2019s business, so there\u2019s nothing to do about this bit of information until evening when everyone has returned and Talon can join us. We can discuss it then.\u201d</p><p>What was there to discuss? In another two months, she wouldn\u2019t have a court. Just like the last time.</p><p>Her stomach rolled. Her skin turned clammy.</p><p>Was that why the men had relaxed? Had they been promised a place in Kermilla\u2019s court and had the assurance that their own status wouldn\u2019t change? Come to think of it, her former court also had been more relaxed and considerate in the weeks before they\u2019d all walked away from her.</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d Powell reached for her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>How could he not know what was wrong?</p><p>She pulled away from him before he could touch her. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, and she saw nothing in his eyes except concern. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working steadily all morning,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest for a while?\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from the desk. She had to get away from him before she got sick. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. I\u2019ll go up to my room and rest for a while. Please ask Reyhana to open the invitations and review the calendar. It will be good practice for her.\u201d She hesitated, then added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I have Birdie or Frannie bring up a tray? Or ask Lady Shira to make up a healing brew?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry, and there\u2019s no need to bother Shira about this.\u201d What ailed her was something the Black Widow Healer couldn\u2019t fix.</p><p>She left her office, aware that Powell followed her to the door and watched her.</p><p>Vae followed her all the way up to her room.</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone, Vae.\u201d</p><p>*No. You are upset, and your smells are strange.*</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>*No.* Vae jumped up on Cassidy\u2019s bed and growled a warning.</p><p>Cassidy studied the Sceltie\u2019s Purple Dusk Jewel. Outranked and out-toothed.</p><p>*Why are you upset?*</p><p>It bubbled out, hot and bitter. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose this court. I\u2019ve given the best that I have, but in two months, I\u2019ll be replaced by another Queen.\u201d Again.</p><p>*You are being foolish.*</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Kermilla took my court before. She\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>Vae\u2019s shock hit her as hard as a blow.</p><p>*You will not defend your males? You will not defend the other humans who belong to you?*</p><p>\u201cVae . . .\u201d</p><p>Vae snarled. *When a Sceltie is given a flock to protect, she protects it. When a bad dog tries to take her flock, a Sceltie doesn\u2019t tuck her tail between her legs and run away whining. A Sceltiefights. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a Sceltie!\u201d</p><p>*No, you are only human, but you are a Queen. You have shown your teeth before. Why won\u2019t you show them now and drive the bad Queen away? Your males would fight for you. Why won\u2019t you fight for them?*</p><p>\u201cIwould fight for them, with my last breath and beyond,\u201d Cassidy shouted. \u201cBut they don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>She stopped. Closed her eyes. Thought about Powell\u2019s reaction to Kermilla\u2019s letter.</p><p>Almost dismissive. A potential problem the men had been aware of, so it hadn\u2019t come as a surprise, but it was nothing important enough to summon the court immediately.</p><p>Kermilla\u2019s words felt like a knife twisting in her gut, but Vae\u2019s words hurt more.Was she giving up on this court because her former court had walked away?Was she giving up without even asking what her First Circle wanted?Was she running away, whining, instead of fighting for what belonged to her?</p><p>Would a Sceltie give up her flock to another dog when she knew the dog would hurt what she\u2019d promised to protect?</p><p>\u201cDo Scelties ever get scared?\u201d</p><p>*We get scared. But we still fight.*</p><p>Which are you going to be, Cassidy? A coward or a Queen?</p><p>Sighing, she kicked off her shoes and approached the bed. \u201cMove over, Vae. I really don\u2019t feel well right now. I need to rest for a bit.\u201d</p><p>When Vae shifted, Cassidy lay down on top of the covers and closed her eyes.</p><p>*Cassie? What will you tell your males?*</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>Vae settled beside her, warming her back. *That is foolish. This is not confusing. They are yours, and you will fight for them so they will not be forced to serve the bad Queen.* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassidy closed her eyes.

Why wasn\u2019t the man at the Residence instead of standing in Ranon\u2019s kitchen?</p><p>When Ranon asked him to stop by the house to talk, there had been some urgency in the psychic communication, but the Shalador Warlord Prince hadn\u2019t indicated it was a court meeting rather than a personal conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>Ranon put the pot of coffee, the bottle of whiskey, and five mugs on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s Powell\u2019s meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis came with the rest of the day\u2019s correspondence.\u201d Powell called in a piece of expensive paper and handed it to Gray.</p><p>Ranon came around the table. Leaning over Gray\u2019s shoulder, he read the letter and began swearing viciously as he paced around the kitchen. Gray read it and handed it to Shaddo, whose eyes glazed with killing fury as he gave the paper to Archerr.</p><p>\u201cThat bitch was gone,\u201d Shaddo snarled. \u201cTalon told us she had gone back to Dharo for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what Theran told him,\u201d Archerr said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Theran only said Kermilla had gone back to Dharo to celebrate Winsol with her people,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cTalon had the impression Theran didn\u2019t expect her to return, but Grayhaven didn\u2019tsay that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what was or wasn\u2019t said. She was gone, and now she\u2019s back,\u201d Shaddo snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is Cassie?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>Ranon whirled to face Powell. \u201cIs she giving up and running again? Hell\u2019s fire! What more do we need to do before she believes in us?\u201d</p><p>Hearing grief and desperation under Ranon\u2019s anger, Gray raised a hand\u2014and immediately felt the other Warlord Princes in the room yank on the leash to regain control of their tempers.</p><p>\u201cCassie isn\u2019t going to run anywhere,\u201d he said quietly. He didn\u2019t think she would run. Not anymore. But if she did because of Kermilla, he\u2019d find her and bring her back. \u201cPowell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter reading Kermilla\u2019s letter, she said she wasn\u2019t feeling well and went up to her room. Vae went with her.\u201d Dry amusement filled Powell\u2019s shadowed eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ranon. Lady Cassidy isn\u2019t going anywhere without our being informed.\u201d</p><p>The tension in the room eased a little.</p><p>Powell\u2019s amusement faded. \u201cPerhaps I was too dismissive and didn\u2019t take into account Cassidy\u2019s feelings about the other Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla is a scar on Cassie\u2019s heart, and that scar bleeds every time Kermilla brushes against Cassie\u2019s life,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBut she\u2019ll get past today\u2019s hurt and go on.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie would learn to live with her scars just like he was learning to live with his.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to let that bitch keep threatening everything we\u2019ve all worked for?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>\u201cCassie isn\u2019t letting that bitch do anything,\u201d Shaddo growled. \u201cThis mess is Theran\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an easy way to fix it,\u201d Archerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d</p><p>They looked at him, and Gray saw the same question in all their eyes. \u201cNo, that isn\u2019t the way to fix it. Not this time. When Cassie knows we\u2019ve prepared for this, when she knows we\u2019re going to stand with her, she\u2019ll stand with us. She won\u2019t turn her back on her people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s make sure she knows we\u2019re going to stand with her,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already contacted those I could reach in the First Circle who were working beyond the village today,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThey\u2019ll contact the others, so we\u2019ll all be here around sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThen let\u2019s have some of that coffee before we all get back to work.\u201d</p><p>Cassie opened her eyes. Full dark outside. She must have slept for a few hours\u2014and someone must have thrown a blanket over her and added a warming spell to it. Otherwise she would have gotten cold and woken up.</p><p>She tried to shift. The blanket grunted and yawned. A moment later, a small ball of witchlight floated near the bedroom door, lighting the room enough for her to see that she was pinned down by Scelties. Vae, Khollie, and Darkmist. Darcy, Keelie, and . . .</p><p>Catching the scent of leather and horses, she twisted to look behind her.</p><p>. . . Lloyd.</p><p>\u201cLet me up.\u201d</p><p>They were awake and watching her. Not one of them moved.</p><p>\u201cI have to pee.Now. Let me up.\u201d</p><p>They jumped off the bed. One of them used Craft to open her door. Darcy and Lloyd took up a position in the hallway, blocking access to anything except the bathroom and other bedrooms on this side of the staircase. Vae and Keelie trotted in front of her. Darkmist and Khollie followed so close behind she was afraid of kicking them if she raised her foot for a normal step. So she shuffled to the bathroom.</p><p>Khollie followed her inside.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI can do this by myself.\u201d</p><p>Khollie wagged his tail and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move until Vaegrff ed at him.</p><p>She closed the door in their furry faces, but as she prepared to use the toilet, she could sense them\u2014Vae, Darkmist, and Khollie\u2014standing right in front of the door andknew those keen ears would be pricked to catch every sound.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d she growled.</p><p>She\u2019d bet they didn\u2019t take more than one step back. And she\u2019d bet a season\u2019s income that those ears stayed pricked.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to win this argument, so she pretended she had privacy and took care of business.</p><p>*Your males want to talk to you,* Vae said when Cassidy opened the door.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to talk tothem. Not that she had a choice. Darcy and Lloyd took point. Keelie and Khollie blocked her on either side. Vae and Darkmist were behind her in prime herding position.</p><p>Cows and sheep must be terrified to see even one of them coming,Cassidy thought as they escorted her to the big meeting room. They escorted her all the way in, then turned and trotted out, closing the door behind them.</p><p>Her whole First Circle was there, along with Gray and Shira, but Reyhana was not.</p><p>Reyhana had the kind of strength that would attract strong males, the kind of strength that would cause Kermilla to see the girl as a serious rival in a couple of years. Would Kermilla take steps to eliminate a potential rival? It was a possibility.</p><p>And another reason to show my teeth,Cassidy thought.</p><p>A place at the table had been left for her\u2014on the far side, away from the door, and smack in the middle. A not-so-subtle way of telling her that she wasn\u2019t getting out of the room without going through her men.</p><p>She found that comforting, and she realized Vae was right. This wasn\u2019t confusing at all.</p><p>Gray came up to her and brushed a hand over her hair. \u201cYou feeling better after getting some rest?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>He studied her as if he\u2019d been prepared for one kind of mood and was faced with another. Then he smiled in return. \u201cCome over here. We have some things to show you.\u201d</p><p>He led her to her place at the table, but she felt too restless to sit down. And she wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret the men\u2019s hard eyes and grim faces since Powell had seemed so dismissive earlier.</p><p>\u201cPowell told you about the letter,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe saw that piece of shit,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cIt pissed off the rest of us, but if it knocked your legs out from under you for even a little while, I guess it was a good ploy for Kermilla to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPloy?\u201d Cassidy stared at her Master of the Guard.</p><p>\u201cYou bluff well enough when we play cards. I\u2019m surprised you couldn\u2019t see this for what it is.\u201d Talon leaned across the table toward her. \u201cDirect question, Cassie. You give us a direct answer. Are you walking away from us? Yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not walking away from you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018But\u2019 wasn\u2019t one of the choices,\u201d Talon growled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014my contract ends in two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you choose to end it,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe provisional contract was a way for us to save face if you chose not to stay with us.\u201d</p><p>That hadn\u2019t beenher impression of what that contract meant. \u201cKermilla says she\u2019s going to be the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a fight,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Fight with words. With Protocol. By taking this challenge before a tribunal of Queens, assuming she and Kermilla both had an official court. That\u2019s what Ranon meant. Didn\u2019t he?</p><p>She looked at the men again. Warlords and Warlord Princes. Warriors who had already survived years of battles, a lifetime of fighting in one way or another.</p><p>They weren\u2019t going to fight with words or with Protocol or by arguing before a tribunal to decide who would rule their Territory. They would meet their challengers on a killing field as they had done before.</p><p>\u201cIf this turns into a fight, some of you could die,\u201d she said, chilled by the possibility.</p><p>\u201cSome of us might die either way,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to submit to a Queen who cares nothing about our people or our land. We\u2019ve seen what that kind of Queen can do to a Territory. And over these past few months, we\u2019ve seen what a good Queen can do. We\u2019d rather fight for you than just fight against Kermilla, but one way or another we\u2019re going to fight\u2014and some of us will die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. For a moment, she felt grateful when Gray slipped an arm around her waist. Then she looked at him. Really looked at Prince Jared Blaed.</p><p>No longer a boy in a man\u2019s body who would be tucked away with the other young boys. This time he would stand on a killing field with the rest of the men.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Ranon said, \u201cjust before we helped James Weaver and the other landens relocate here, he told me flat out that if Kermilla became Queen, there would be another landen uprising. So there\u2019s going to be a war one way or the other.\u201d</p> <p>No.\u201cIf it has to be physical confrontation, it would be Kermilla\u2019s court fighting against mine to settle who ruled. It wouldn\u2019t be a war.\u201d</p><p>Talon made a rude noise. \u201cWitchling, it\u2019s not going to stay between the courts. There\u2019s too much at stake. More at stake than we\u2019ve had for a lot of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give in just because some bitch tells you to go?\u201d Shaddo growled at her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not giving in, but you\u2019re talking aboutwar .\u201d</p><p>The thought of empty chairs around the table kept her arguing. \u201cWhen Theran leaves it will break the court. We\u2019ll have an unofficial court going up against an official one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Talon said. \u201cHe needs to convince eleven other men to serve Kermilla, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be an easy task.\u201d He nodded at Gray. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already got his replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the lessons I was taking at the Keep?\u201d Gray asked her. \u201cI was training to be a First Escort. To be your First Escort. I\u2019m qualified, Cassie. The High Lord, Daemon, and Lucivar all agree I can serve you and the court in this way. And the High Lord gave me this.\u201d He called in a sheet of paper and handed it to her.</p><p>She read it and landed in the chair. Hard. \u201cMother Night, he\u2019s not hiding his teeth, is he?\u201d</p><p>Not a dismissal that would allow Theran to honorably accept another contract, but a kind of demotion that would have made Queens in Kaeleer take a wary look at the man if he came looking for a position of power in one oftheir courts.</p><p>\u201cThat letter is a well-phrased kick in the balls,\u201d Talon said. \u201cIt will be even more impressive once Powell copies it over and it bears your signature and seal. And the day after Theran gets that letter, you can count on every Warlord Prince within Dena Nehele\u2019s borders and in the Tamanara Mountains knowing that Jared Blaed is now the First Escort to the Queen of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Gray sat beside her. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown us what\u2019s possible. We\u2019re going to fight to keep what you\u2019ve given us.\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy pushed away from the table, needing a little space, needing to move, to think.</p><p>She\u2019d thought her men would step aside for Theran\u2019s choice because he was the last Grayhaven. But they were going to fight. Not just for her. She never would accept a war and the loss of life just to keep her in power. But this wasn\u2019t about her anymore. Not really. This was about holding on to the very things the Blood had said they wanted when she first came to Dena Nehele\u2014a land that lived by the Old Ways, that held itself to the Blood\u2019s code of honor.</p><p>Weren\u2019t those the same things Lia and Jared had fought to keep in Dena Nehele for as long as possible?</p><p>A Sceltie fights for the ones who belong to her. So does a Queen.</p><p>She turned and looked at them. All of them.</p><p>Everything has a price. But, sweet Darkness, don\u2019t let this price be too high.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fight.\u201d</p><p>Fierce pride filled their eyes, and she hoped with everything in her that she would remain worthy of that pride.</p> <p>Her legs suddenly felt shaky, so she returned to the table and sat down. Clasping her hands and pressing them against the table, she gave Talon a pleading look. \u201cIsn\u2019t there some other way?\u201d Would they even consider bringing this to a tribunal of Queens if she could arrange to get one?</p><p>\u201cNone of us are afraid of fighting,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cThere may be an alternative to war,\u201d Powell said quietly. \u201cEspecially since Kermilla has conveniently given us justification to act.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at the men, who all seemed to be weighing Powell\u2019s words on some internal scale. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Talon rubbed his chin and said thoughtfully, \u201cI doubt Theran knows Kermilla sent you that letter. Poor tactics. We\u2019ve known since he met her that he wanted her to be the Queen, but I figured he wouldn\u2019t make it an official challenge until he had the men who would form her First Circle. And he wouldn\u2019t want that court made public until close to the time when the contract he signed with you was finished because that would give you less time to respond and find someone to take his place.\u201d He gave her a fierce smile. \u201cKermilla made the first move without having sufficient backing. Now we can hit hard and fast.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, looking like a predator at ease, Talon said, \u201cPowell, what\u2019s your alternative to war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecession,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Cassidy looked around the table and saw shock on everyone\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador reserves don\u2019t have enough land,\u201d Ranon protested. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to support the people without getting some of what we need from the other Provinces. Not for a good many years yet. And three reserves mean three battlegrounds. We don\u2019t have enough trained warriors left to lead anyone else willing to fight. Not against the rest of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to just the Shalador reserves, Ranon,\u201d Powell said. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking into account the influence Lady Cassidy has had on the southern Provinces. I think given the choice of living in a Territory called Dena Nehele that is ruled by Lady Kermilla or living in a newly formed Territory ruled by Cassidy, they will be more interested in who rules the land than what the land is called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a map of Dena Nehele in your office?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Nodding, Powell called in the map and spread it out on the table.</p><p>\u201cI had some time this afternoon to consider a few things the rest of you may not have thought about yet in terms of incentive,\u201d Powell said as Talon studied the map. \u201cThe loan Gray acquired from Prince Sadi is a loan specifically to Lady Cassidy\u2019s court,not the Queen of Dena Nehele\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy jerked in her seat. So did several of the men.</p><p>Powell smiled a tight smile. \u201cExactly. Prince Sadi was very precise in the wording of that loan. It doesn\u2019t transfer to another Queen. If Cassidy\u2019s court dissolves, the loan ends, and the Prince is within his rights to demand immediate repayment of whatever funds were used. However, the loan was not specific to Dena Nehele in terms of a name or boundaries. So if Dena Nehele is split between the Queens, any Provinces still under Cassidy\u2019s rule could continue to request help for their people and businesses. Provinces under Kermilla\u2019s rule could not make use of the loan and benefit from Prince Sadi\u2019s generosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but . . .\u201d Cassidy began.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d several male voices replied.</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price, Cassie,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe Blood who want Kermilla to rule can\u2019t have you taking care of them.\u201d</p><p>He was right. She knew he was right, but she thought of the letters she\u2019d read that morning from the northern Queens and wondered what dreams might be crushed under the weight of Kermilla\u2019s wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cThe Heartsblood River is the natural border between two Provinces,\u201d Talon said, running a finger along the map. \u201cIt begins in the Tamanara Mountains and runs all the way to Reyna\u2019s Lake on the western border. That would give us five Provinces, plus the Shalador reserves. Plenty of fresh water. Some small lakes and lots of streams and creeks for fishing. Farmland and pastureland. Some woodlands that can be nurtured and allowed to grow back. That will help rebuild the deer herds and other meat animals.\u201d</p><p>Feeling dizzy, Cassidy leaned against Gray. \u201cEverything south of the Heartsblood River? That\u2019s almost a third of Dena Nehele!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems fair to me,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThat\u2019s enough land to stand on its own as a Territory, but not so much it would feel like a grab without the honesty of a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be important to emphasize that we\u2019re doing this to avoid a civil war,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our families or the people we have promised to rule and protect to live under Kermilla\u2019s hand. Instead of embroiling the Blood in a devastating fight, Lady Cassidy is relinquishing her claim to Dena Nehele and establishing this new Territory for the Blood who want to live by the Old Ways and want her guidance in order to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Shaddo said, breaking the silence that followed Powell\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019d be ashamed to fight against men who wanted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you remember what you just said,\u201d Talon told Powell. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to need something in writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll draft something,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWith the Lady\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a bit battered\u2014and wondering why they were bothering to ask her permission when they were barreling forward with a speed that left her breathless\u2014Cassidy nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf Jared Blaed and Ranon are agreeable, I\u2019d like them to show my draft to the High Lord and get his opinion,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIn confidence. He has a way with words, and we\u2019re trying to avoid a war, not start one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d Gray said, glancing at Ranon. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve declared ourselves independent of Dena Nehele, I\u2019d like Lucivar to come here for a day or two to give his opinion about what kind of defenses we need and where. No offense to you or your ability, Talon, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken,\u201d Talon said. \u201cLucivar Yaslana has been feared for centuries for what he does on a killing field. We\u2019d be fools not to take advantage of his experience and listen to any suggestions or advice he wants to give.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think Jared Blaed and Ranon should meet with the Warlord Princes in the five southern Provinces,\u201d Shaddo said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst Escort and the Master of the Guard\u2019s second-in-command? Your words are going to hold a lot of weight with the other Warlord Princes. You, Ranon, have always stood for the Shalador people. Jared\u2019s people. And Jared Blaed is descended from Thera and Blaed. Balanced against Theran using the Grayhaven name and being Lia\u2019s last descendant, I\u2019d say that evens the field.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we move fast,\u201d Powell said. \u201cCassie sends the letter to Theran, stripping him of the title of First Escort, citing his failure to honorably perform his duties as the reason for the demotion. As the High Lord suggested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll start recruiting openly in response,\u201d Archerr said.</p><p>\u201cIn the northern Provinces,\u201d Talon said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know Kermilla showed her hand, so he\u2019ll start talking to the Warlord Princes farthest away from Eyota. Also, I suspect he\u2019s been giving those men the impression that Cassie is going back to Dharo in the spring, leaving Kermilla a clear field, and that there won\u2019t be an established Queen and court to challenge the upstart. Unless a man is truly drawn to Kermilla, he\u2019ll think twice about signing on to serve in her court when he realizes it means going up against the ruling Queen and her court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think those of us who have been acting as court liaisons for the southern Provinces should head out tomorrow and set up the meetings,\u201d Haele said. \u201cMake it an official request to meet with the new First Escort and the Master\u2019s second-in-command. It would also be good if we told them the Queens would be welcome to have an audience with Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always welcome,\u201d Cassidy said, looking at her men. This might not end up being a war, but they were still preparing for a kind of battle.</p> <p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWhat are we going to call this new Territory?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at Ranon, who kept his eyes fixed on the table. \u201cRanon?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Obeying the sound of her voice, he looked at her.</p><p>Hope. The fulfillment of a dream. But for the first time since she\u2019d met him, he was holding back, acting with fierce restraint.</p><p>\u201cYou and your people have dreamed for a long time that you would have a place of your own again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you would live in a land called Shalador.\u201d</p><p>Ranon looked around the table. Cassidy\u2019s heart ached with pride as every man nodded, giving his blessing to the name.</p> <p>Ranon\u2019s dark eyes filled with tears. He blinked them away. Then he said, \u201cWe have dreamed of this, but the Shalador people won\u2019t build this new land alone, and the name should reflect all the people who call this land their home.\u201d He took a deep breath and blew it out slowly. \u201cShalador Nehele. I would like to call our new land Shalador Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy swallowed hard to push down the lump in her throat. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d Talon said, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>She\u2019d barely said the words when someone tapped on the door. Dryden and the footman entered, carrying a tray of glasses and bottles of sparkling wine.</p><p>Seeing the number of bottles, Talon and Powell glanced at each other, then shrugged. Clearly, they had both sent an order to Dryden in anticipation of reaching an agreement.</p><p>Bottles were opened and glasses were filled.</p><p>The men and Shira raised their glasses.</p> <p>\u201cTo Lady Cassidy and the Territory of Shalador Nehele,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Their voices rang all around her. \u201cTo Lady Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>The next morning, the First Circle moved quietly, and they moved fast.</p><p>By the time Cassidy, Shira, and Reyhana had finished breakfast, Ranon and Gray were sitting down with Eyota\u2019s elders and Tradition Keepers to explain the court\u2019s decision to create a new Territory. By the time Cassidy and Reyhana had settled at the desk in the Queen\u2019s office to sort and review all the requests and invitations again, the liaisons for the five southern Provinces were meeting with the Warlord Princes in those Provinces to arrange a formal visit with Ranon and Jared Blaed.</p><p>By the time the messenger arrived at the Grayhaven estate and delivered the letter from Lady Cassidy to Prince Theran Grayhaven, every Warlord Prince who lived south of the Heartsblood River knew something was about to happen\u2014and they began sharpening their knives.</p><p>Worn out by a morning of useless meetings and a midday meal that still churned sour in his belly, Theran returned to the Grayhaven mansion and found Julien waiting for him. The look in the butler\u2019s eyes chilled him because it signified another clash between butler and future Queen.</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulien?\u201d</p><p>Julien called in a letter and held it out to him. \u201cAfter you left, Lady Kermilla went into your study and opened the mail.All the mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the name of Hell would she do that?\u201d The words were out before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d The tone said the butler knew quite well why a Queen would go through mail that wasn\u2019t addressed to her\u2014and what happened to a man if she found something she didn\u2019t like. \u201cWhen this letter arrived, I felt it was best to deliver it to you personally since it has Lady Cassidy\u2019s seal.\u201d</p><p>Shucking off his heavy coat, Theran handed it to Julien and took the letter. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla wanted to be informed the moment you returned home.\u201d</p><p>Should I take my time delivering the message?That was the underlying question.</p><p>\u201cInform the Lady that I\u2019ve returned,\u201d Theran said as he walked away.</p><p>Kermilla wanted Julien dismissed. Actually, she wanted the man banned from the town because, on his best days, Julien was barely courteous to her. On the days when memories rode him hard, he couldn\u2019t stand being around her. Since she was still a guest, she had to tolerate the butler. Once she became Queen . . .</p><p>Problem was, Julien was damn good at his job, took on more than a butler\u2019s typical duties, and by standing between Kermilla and the rest of the staff, was the only reason the other servants hadn\u2019t resigned.</p><p>Why was everyone so resistant and so resentful? Yes, she was sometimes difficult or inconsiderate, but maturity and work that made full use of her abilities would soften those edges. Sure she had a temper, but that just meant she had spine and spirit. And that spine and spirit were the reasons Kermilla was the right Queen for Dena Nehele\u2014the one who could represent their land and people with grace and skill.</p><p>The servants grumbled on a daily basis, which he didn\u2019t understand since he hadn\u2019t seen Kermilla doing anything that justified the grumbles. He could ignore the servants for the most part, and did\u2014as long as Julien managed to keep them from leaving. Couldn\u2019t anyone understand that it was an anxious time for all of them and the next few weeks would be so critical? Nerves were a bit frayed and tempers were sharper than they would be normally. But once Kermilla had the assurance of her place in Dena Nehele, everything would settle down.</p><p>Could he give her any assurance?</p><p>The Warlord Princes he\u2019d met with today had listened\u2014and had offered nothing. Not one indication that they would be willing to accept Kermilla, let alone serve her. And not one spark of interest in meeting her. There was wariness over being seen in her company because Talon had declared her an enemy of the current Queen of Dena Nehele, but there wasn\u2019t any sign of the suppressed interest he\u2019d expected once he\u2019d hinted that Talon\u2019s declaration would no longer apply come spring.</p><p>What was he supposed to do about that? Having the backing of at least some of the Warlord Princes and minor Queens was crucial.</p><p>He riffled through the opened mail. Invitations? Well, he didn\u2019t mind her opening those. Not really. After all, she\u2019d be attending those events with him, so she should have a say in which ones they accepted. But the rest . . .</p><p>Uneasiness rippled through him, a warning that something wasn\u2019t good, wasn\u2019t right. Then Kermilla walked into the study, and the uneasiness was buried under his craving to be with her and use everything he was for her pleasure\u2014whatever that pleasure might be. The uneasiness was buried, but not the anger.</p><p>\u201cOh,la, Theran,\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t get back in time. There\u2019s a delightful little party later this afternoon that Imust attend and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you open my private correspondence?\u201d He hadn\u2019t realizedhow much anger he was keeping leashed until he heard the roughness in his voice.</p><p>She stopped moving toward the desk. She lowered her head and looked at him through her lashes while her mouth shifted into its sexy pout. \u201cI was just trying to help. And I wanted to learn. You\u2019re always telling me that I need to learn more about Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn by talking . . .\u201dListening. \u201c. . .or asking.Not by violating someone\u2019s privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolating?\u201d She widened her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a harsh word. I just looked at a few silly old letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a harsh word.\u201d He fanned the stack of letters and the uneasiness returned. *Julien? How many letters did you put on the desk this morning?*</p><p>*Five invitations and seven letters.*</p><p>Theran counted them again, then moved them to make sure nothing was hidden.</p><p>Five invitations\u2014and five letters.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the other two letters, Kermilla?\u201d he asked. Before she could lie to him, he added, \u201cThere were seven letters delivered. There are five here now. Where are the other two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were very rude.\u201d She enhanced the pout. \u201cI burned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou burned letters addressed to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn how rude they were. You had no business reading them, let alone burning them!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed with temper. \u201cNothing is hidden from a Queen, Prince.Nothing. \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A cold fist wrapped around his spine\u2014and squeezed. \u201cThose letters. Who were they from?\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head and said dismissively, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>His temper slipped the leash for a moment and thundered through the room, knocking a painting off the wall and sending several useless porcelain figurines crashing to the floor.</p> <p>No color in her face. Fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho were they from?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cFerall and . . . I don\u2019t remember the other name. I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Ferall. Mother Night. He hadn\u2019t expected to getany response from Ferall. He couldn\u2019t ask the man to send the letter again. And outside of being \u201crude,\u201d which could mean anything, he had no idea what kind of answer he\u2019d been given to his carefully worded inquiries. He knew Ferall wouldn\u2019t serve Kermilla, but he wanted some assurance the other Warlord Prince wouldn\u2019t actively go after Dena Nehele\u2019s new Queen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d he said, breaking the seal on Cassidy\u2019s letter. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what youthink a Queen is entitled to do. Any correspondence addressed to me isprivate. You don\u2019t open it without my consent. Is that clear?\u201d</p> <p>She pulled her shoulders back and raised her chin, the picture of wounded dignity. \u201cPerfectly clear.\u201d</p><p>He began reading Cassidy\u2019s letter. No, not a letter. Some kind of official document that . . .</p><p>\u201cTheran, what about the invitation for this afternoon?\u201d Kermilla asked. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d he snarled. \u201cYou cold-bloodedbitch. \u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran!\u201d She sounded shocked.</p><p>He rushed out of the study and roared to release some temper. \u201cJulien! My coat!\u201d</p> <p>Julien hurried to the entranceway, holding the coat open. \u201cPrince?\u201d</p><p>Vanishing the document, Theran shoved his arms into the coat sleeves. *I\u2019ll be gone for the rest of the day,* he said on a spear thread when Kermilla rushed into the entranceway. *Hold on to any mail or messages until I return.*</p><p>*Done,* Julien said.</p><p>And when he returned he would put Green shields and locks around his study. Kermilla would be insulted, but better that than another error in judgment.</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d Kermilla\u2019s voice was a blend of distress and whiny-bitchy that he hadn\u2019t heard before. \u201cWhere are you going? What about our invitation to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend your regrets,\u201d he snapped as he headed for the door. \u201cI have an appointment.\u201dWith the Queen , he added silently.</p><p>Cassidy watched Shira remove the tangled web of dreams and visions from its wooden frame and drop the spider silk into a shallow bowl of witchfire.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cOr can\u2019t the vision be shared?\u201d</p> <p>Shira looked at her for a long time. Then the Shalador witch finished putting away her Hourglass supplies before saying, \u201cEndings and beginnings. I think most of us left in the Hourglass have seen the end of Dena Nehele\u2014and wept for it. Some of us saw hope and a new beginning, but it wasn\u2019t always there in the visions, so we knew the end was coming but couldn\u2019t be sure if anything good would follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to see orchards of honey pear trees growing out of the bodies of the men who had fallen in the killing fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Cassidy whispered.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, in nightmares, I would pick the fruit off one tree. I would bite into one of the pears, and it was better than anything I\u2019d ever tasted before. Then I would look down and see Ranon\u2019s face. The tree was growing out of what was left of Ranon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShira . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday I saw orchards of honey pear trees growing out of rich soil. Soil, Cassie. Not the bodies of our dead. And even though I couldn\u2019t see them, I could hear men talking and laughing, and I knew they were alive and helping with the harvest.\u201d Shira undid the Craft holding her hair up and let that dark hair flow around her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re the difference. Dena Nehele will break, and Shalador Nehele will rise. A new beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could still be war,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThose honey pears might still grow out of the bodies of the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Shira agreed. \u201cBut before, it was a certainty.\u201d</p><p>Shalador\u2019s Lady will rule this new land?</p><p>She will.</p><p>We will continue to walk the path she has shown us and reclaim the Old Ways of the Blood?</p><p>We will.</p><p>Then the people of Shalador will welcome this change, and we will strive to be worthy of the honor she has given us by naming her new Territory Shalador Nehele.</p><p>Gray rode into the landen community with Ranon and wondered if this meeting was really necessary. Prudent, sure. But necessary? They\u2019d used a small Coach that Ranon could handle so that they could ride the Opal Winds together. The news still arrived at the southern and western reserves ahead of them.</p><p>They were given the courtesy of being allowed to deliver their message to an assembly of elders and Tradition Keepers since they had made the journey. After their meeting in the western reserve, they were gently shooed home. Shalador\u2019s decision was made. They would stand with the Queen. Ranon and Jared Blaed should return home and tend to Shalador\u2019s Lady.</p><p>So they were back in Eyota in time to make this last visit and be home for dinner.</p><p>They rode in slowly, in part to give the guard on duty time to sense their presence but mostly because they could hear a dog barking and children laughing and squealing.</p><p>\u201cCows and sheep?\u201d Gray asked, reining in before they reached the floating balls of green witchlight.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d Ranon agreed.</p><p>Gray watched JuliDee evade the Sceltie and dart away from the corral of white witchlight. \u201cWynne doesn\u2019t seem to be doing too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWynne isn\u2019t trying very hard,\u201d Ranon replied dryly. \u201cI imagine if there was a reason to round up these \u2018sheep,\u2019 they\u2019d be rounded up.\u201d</p><p>James Weaver came out of one of the workshops and raised a hand in greeting as they dismounted.</p><p>\u201cWe were all putting away our tools and having a glass of ale as an end to the day. Would you join us? Or would you prefer something hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAle would be fine,\u201d Ranon replied. They tied their horses to a post and followed James into one of the workshops. Potter and Tanner were there. So was James\u2019s son, Rand, but the youngster got some signal from his father and excused himself.</p><p>Small glasses of ale were poured. Gray wondered if it was the cost of the ale that prevented them from enjoying a larger glass. Then he realized this wasn\u2019t about drinking. This was a ritual among them that acknowledged a day\u2019s work\u2014and the freedom to work without fear.</p><p>\u201cThere is something we felt you need to know,\u201d Gray said. He explained the court\u2019s decision to break from Dena Nehele and form a new Territory, just as he\u2019d been explaining it all day\u2014and would explain it when he and Ranon met the Warlord Princes living in the five southern Provinces.</p><p>James looked at Potter and Tanner, then rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWe thank you for the courtesy of telling us.\u201d</p><p>Ranon studied the men. \u201cYou already knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d Potter said. \u201cBut we appreciate you translating it into human.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked at Ranon. Ranon looked at Gray. Together they said, \u201cHuman?\u201d</p><p>James said, \u201cThe message we got earlier today was \u2018We don\u2019t like the other Queen. We\u2019re keeping Cassie. So her males are going to be busy for a while marking her territory.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cMarking\u2014\u201d Ranon choked. Then he blushed.</p><p>Potter nodded. \u201cOf course, the boys wanted to know what that meant, so Duffy demonstrated and . . .\u201d</p><p>Gray hunched his shoulders and groaned. \u201cHow many women are mad at us?\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t pee on any of the houses, I think you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Theran pounded on the boardinghouse\u2019s front door. Damn dogs were going to stir up the whole damn village before someone opened the damn door. How in the name of Hell could an animal that small make a noise that loud?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see them, but he recognized the psychic scents of Archerr and Shaddo. And he felt Talon\u2019s presence.</p><p>And he felt insulted that he\u2019d been \u201cescorted\u201d here by a guard.</p><p>Before he could bang on the door again\u2014or break it down\u2014it opened.</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran,\u201d Dryden said too courteously to be courteous.</p><p>\u201cI want to see Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you will wait here, I will see if the Lady is at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap,\u201d Theran snapped, bracing a hand against the door. \u201cShe\u2019ll see me, and she\u2019ll see me now.\u201d</p><p>Dryden\u2019s eyes blazed with anger, but his face and voice retained the butler poise. \u201cI will see\u2014\u201d</p><p>*Theran? Theran! You will wait in the visitors\u2019 parlor and be polite.*</p><p>Theran shoved at the door. \u201cShut up, Vae.\u201d</p><p>She snarled at him. A moment later, someone else snarled. Behind him.</p><p>Purple Dusk against Green? He could take her down. But he was having trouble getting a sense of the Sceltie behind him.</p><p>If it was a Sceltie behind him.</p><p>The memory of those two big cats flashed through his mind.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll wait and be polite.\u201d</p><p>Dryden and Vae escorted him to the visitors\u2019 parlor. Dryden left. Vae stood guard\u2014until Gray walked into the room.</p><p>How could a man change so much in a few months?Theran wondered. He recognized the face because it was so similar to his own. But he didn\u2019t recognize the look in those green eyes\u2014or that blend of power and assurance that was now part of Gray\u2019s psychic scent.</p><p>\u201cCassie is not available,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>It was the coldness in that voice that jabbed his temper. He called in the document and held it up. \u201cCan you explain this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gray flicked a glance at the paper. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be First Escort. I do. You don\u2019t want to serve Cassie. I do.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou? Hell\u2019s fire, Gray. Do you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>Kermilla will never forgive him.\u201cYou know Kermilla is going to become Queen in a couple of months. Signing on to serve Cassidy now is a slap in the face. She\u2019ll never consider you for any kind of position in her court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t consider taking one,\u201d Gray replied.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s required of a man to stand as First Escort? Gray, you can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the past few months training to be a First Escort, and I\u2019m qualified to serve Queen and court in that position. What kind of training do you have, Theran?\u201d</p><p>None.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019re acting so pissy about this,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou\u2019re up in Grayhaven. We\u2019re down here. You haven\u2019t fulfilled your duties to Queen or court for months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t dancing to Cassidy\u2019s tune, no, but that doesn\u2019t mean I haven\u2019t been working for the good of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u201d</p><p>Stung past insult, Theran vanished the document and took a step back. Gray had made his choice, and may the Darkness have mercy on him.</p><p>\u201cIs your position in the court official yet?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cI signed the contract this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m free to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have a contract with this court,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou\u2019re still in the First Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the circumstances, I think it\u2019s best if I resign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rule the town of Grayhaven on the Queen\u2019s behalf. If you ask to be dismissed from the court and Cassidy grants the request, you not only give up your place in the court, you also give up the town and its tithes.\u201d</p><p>Theran felt the blood drain out of his head. The only reason Kermilla was allowed to stay anywhere in Dena Nehele was that he ruled Grayhaven. If he lost the town, she could be driven out\u2014or killed. He couldn\u2019t risk that. Not when Cassidy\u2019s contract would end in a couple of months, freeing him from these chains.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning into a bastard, Gray.\u201d</p><p>Gray smiled\u2014and Theran saw the man who was comfortable around Daemon Sadi and Lucivar Yaslana\u2014and the High Lord of Hell. Sadi couldn\u2019t have played this hand any better.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I should call you Jared Blaed from now on,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cI guess you should.\u201d</p><p>When he walked out of the boardinghouse, the Scelties were gone. So were Archerr and Shaddo. But Talon stood at the edge of the street, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you back to the landing web,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>They walked halfway back before Theran spoke. \u201cHow did it go so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants the same thing. They just aren\u2019t seeing the same answer,\u201d Talon replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about what\u2019s going to happen to Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared Blaed can take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he have to do this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s following his heart. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever thinks it is.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak again until they reached the landing web.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, boy,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cTalon . . .\u201d What could he say to keep the people who mattered to him out of harm\u2019s way? \u201cCassidy isn\u2019t going to be ruling for much longer.\u201d</p><p>A long silence. Then Talon said quietly, \u201cNo, Cassidy isn\u2019t going to be ruling Dena Nehele for much longer.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>She looks tired,Ranon thought as he watched Cassidy enter the meeting room and take her seat between him and Gray. Of course, they were all tired, but this past week seemed to drain spirit as well as energy from their Queen.</p><p>A week of meetings, a week of talking\u2014a week where he\u2019d watched strong men struggle with a fear bred from hope.</p><p>Gray had shown the steel in his spine and his potential to be a leader. The other Warlord Princes had seen it too, and Ranon wondered how much that would sway opinions.</p><p>The rest of the First Circle drifted into the room, looking alert enough, despite the early hour. Cassie had chosen this dawn meeting so that Talon could be with them and hear Powell\u2019s report at the same time as the rest of the First Circle.</p><p>Talon took his seat opposite Gray, then nodded to Powell.</p><p>The Steward looked pale but excited as he laid five letters on the big meeting table.</p><p>\u201cThe five southern Provinces have agreed to join the Shalador reserves to create a new Territory,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAll the District Queens and the Warlord Princes who are ruling on behalf of our Queen support the court\u2019s decision to break away from Dena Nehele and build the kind of life we want in a land ruled by the Queen we have chosen to serve.\u201d</p><p>The men around the table released their breath in a collective sigh. Exhilaration and trepidation. None of them wanted war, but all of them were willing to step onto as many killing fields as it would take to buy freedom for the people they loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve drafted a document,\u201d Powell said, looking at Ranon and Gray.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it up to the Keep this afternoon and ask the High Lord to review it,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cUntil we know how Theran and his Lady are going to react to this news, everyone goes out in tandem,\u201d Talon said. \u201cAnd you Ladies are to have an escort with you at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cAlltimes.\u201d Talon stared at Shira until she nodded. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose either of you\u2014or Reyhana. You\u2019ll do what we need so that we can do what Shalador Nehele needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d Cassidy said, sounding too subdued for Ranon\u2019s liking. \u201cYou should remember to talk to the Scelties about helping to guard the Queen\u2019s square.\u201d</p><p>Talon nodded as if he\u2014and every other man in the room\u2014hadn\u2019t thought of that already. Having played hide-and-seek with the dogs in order to learn more of what they could do, the men had confirmed that no matter how well you could hide from another human, you couldn\u2019t cover yourself in shields well enough or disguise yourself well enough to hide from kindred senses unless you were downwind ofall of them.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lady,\u201d Powell replied.</p><p>Cassidy pushed away from the table and walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Ranon said, reaching across the empty space to stop Gray from following her.</p><p>He waited for Gray\u2019s nod before he left the room to look for Cassidy.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t hard to find her. The garden gave her comfort\u2014even when it slept under snow.</p><p>He stood on her left side, wanting to touch her, wanting to offer simple contact. But he wasn\u2019t sure she would welcome a touch right now, so he stayed where he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve put your faith in me as a Queen, and you\u2019re risking your lives and your people\u2019s lives based on that faith. What if I fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us know if we\u2019ll measure up to the demands of the day,\u201d Ranon said gently. \u201cConsidering what we\u2019re about to do, only a fool wouldn\u2019t be afraid of what may be ahead of us, and you\u2019re no fool. But I\u2019ll tell you the same thing Talon told me once: don\u2019t fail until you fail.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a puzzled look that made him smile. Then he looked away. It seemed easier to say the words when he wasn\u2019t looking right at her. \u201cI was seventeen the first time I stepped onto a killing field. Warlord Princes are born to stand on the killing fields, and everything we are gives us the temper and the instinctive skills to be predators and killers. But it also takes maturity to accept what you do on those fields. I was seventeen, and I wasn\u2019t ready. Neither were any of the other boys who were training in that camp up in the mountains. But a decision had been made to eliminate a Province Queen who had gone beyond cruel in what she was doing to the people, and part of that decision was to pay whatever price needed to be paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they sent young men to support the experienced warriors,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve kept such a strict watch over Janos, kept him hidden from the Queens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t want him to face that before he had to.</p><p>\u201cI remember Talon coming into the camp the night before the fight to talk to the leaders. He couldn\u2019t be with us for the attack. I think he was committed to another killing field farther north. Besides, Talon couldn\u2019t fight in daylight, but he was the best instructor we had. When he was done talking to the leaders, he took a couple of minutes with each of us. It got to be my turn, and instead of telling him I would be brave and strong and win the battle, I told him I was afraid to fail. And he said, \u2018Don\u2019t fail until you fail.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t. We destroyed that Queen and the warriors she sent against us. Most of us survived.\u201d Ranon hesitated, then decided not to tell her that some of the boys who survived went back into the mountains and never came down again. \u201cThere have been plenty of times in the years since then when things have looked too bleak for any hope to survive, when I watched other men fall in battle while trying to save what we could. There were days when I thought I couldn\u2019t stand to see another friend die, but I\u2019d tell myself that as long as I could stand and fight for my people I hadn\u2019t failed yet. I don\u2019t know if that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYes, it does. Thank you, Ranon.\u201d</p><p>He touched her shoulder. When she didn\u2019t pull away, he drew her against him for a hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do all right, Cassie,\u201d he said as he eased back. \u201cAnd since our land will be a third of Dena Nehele\u2019s size, there will be two-thirds less . . .\u201d Suddenly dizzy, he staggered back a step.</p><p>\u201cRanon?\u201d Cassidy grabbed his arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think of it. I swear we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tithes.\u201d</p><p>She looked baffled. Completely, totally baffled. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only get a third of the tithes you would have gotten if Dena Nehele stayed whole.\u201d How could they have overlooked something that obvious?</p><p>More bafflement. \u201cI know. Powell and I reviewed the accounts this week to make sure the court could still support itself, and we can, Ranon. All of you will receive your quarterly income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your income?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have plenty.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he believed her, so he\u2019d talk to Powell. Oh, he was certain that thecourt\u2019s expenses would be paid, and everyone who was owed a wage would get the full wage. He just wasn\u2019t sure Cassidy would have a copper left to call her own. The woman was quite capable of brushing that little detail aside.</p><p>He huffed out a breath and watched it cloud the air between them. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s colder than Hell out here. I could use a hot drink and some breakfast. How about you?\u201d</p><p>She studied him, and he had the sense that something in the past minute had shown her another point on the battlefield.</p><p>\u201cRanon? How do you think Theran will respond to this? Do you think he\u2019ll let us go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be pissed off, and I doubt he\u2019ll be the best of neighbors, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s enough of a fool to start a war. Not with Talon backing you.\u201d But her question made him think of the reason they were risking war to begin with. \u201cWhat about Kermilla? How is she going to respond?\u201d</p> <p>He looked into Cassidy\u2019s eyes and knew the answer\u2014just as he knew the reason before she said it.</p><p>\u201cI think Kermilla is going to be very unhappy about losing a third of the tithes, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll let go of that income without a fight.\u201d</p><p>Easy enough to take that stand when the bitch wasn\u2019t going to be the one standing on the killing fields.</p><p>Cassidy hooked her arm through his and headed back to the house. \u201cLet\u2019s save that worry for another day and focus on today\u2019s worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s anything besides porridge left for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he opened the kitchen door and they both hurried into the warmth.</p><p>Don\u2019t fail until you fail.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to fail the court or the people. And they weren\u2019t about to fail her.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Prince Ranon and Prince Jared Blaed arrived at the Keep thirty minutes after sunset. That was just enough time for a man to wake up, clean up, and drink a glass of yarbarah. In Saetan\u2019s experience, young men didn\u2019t show up with that kind of precision in order to make a casual request. The fact that Jaenelle would have considered those two as Second Circle gave him even more reason to pay attention to the timing.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Saetan said as they crossed the sitting room and stopped at the precise distance that was deemed courteous according to Protocol and gave him the precise bows owed his rank.</p><p>All that precision gave him a headache.</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>When Gray hesitated, Saetan supplied the rest. \u201cYou have something you want to discuss, but it needs to be in confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cWill my keeping this confidence put anyone I care about at risk?\u201d</p><p>A hesitation before Ranon said, \u201cNo one in Kaeleer.\u201d</p><p>Interesting answer. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they had that much assurance from him, they both relaxed.</p><p>Gray called in a folded paper and held it out. \u201cWe\u2019d like you to read this and tell us what we should fix. Powell said this is a copy, so you can mark it up if you want to.\u201d</p><p>Saetan called in his half-moon glasses, unfolded the paper, and read the carefully written words.</p><p>Mother Night. These children had balls.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to start a war or avoid one?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAvoid one,\u201d they replied.</p><p>Thank the Darkness for that. \u201cThen there are a few phrases that should be reworded.\u201d</p><p>As he turned toward a chair where he could work, he felt another dark presence in the Keep. Ranon and Gray felt it too and knew who was approaching the room. Since neither of them asked him to do anything to keep this meeting private, he settled into the chair, called in a lap desk and a pen, and began rereading the document that would break a Territory.</p><p>Lucivar walked into the room. A slashing glance at Gray and Ranon, an assessing look at him, and his Eyrien son had seen enough to know this wasn\u2019t a battlefield.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean Lucivar wouldn\u2019t turn it into one if he decided there was a reason.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cRanon. What brings you here?\u201d</p><p>The question wasn\u2019t as idle as it sounded. Ebon-gray was asking Purple Dusk and Opal to explain their presence\u2014and would get an explanation one way or another.</p><p>Since dealing with Lucivar had been a valuable lesson for all the boyos in Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle, Saetan pretended to be unaware of this particular pissing contest. He didn\u2019t want Gray and Ranon to get hurt, but he wasn\u2019t going to step in unless it was necessary because every man needed to know when to stand and when to yield.</p><p>Gray glanced at Ranon, who nodded slightly.</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador reserves and the five southern Provinces are breaking from the rest of Dena Nehele to form a new Territory,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cThat makes the Heartsblood River your northern boundary?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Foolish boy,Saetan thought, looking up to watch this part of the drama. An Eyrien could see a great deal from the air while riding the currents. Especially when that Eyrien was an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince.</p><p>Lucivar shrugged\u2014and then winced so slightly no one but family would notice. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural border, not to mention a means of travel and a source of water. Stands to reason you\u2019d want to hold on to one side of it. How many Warlord Princes on your side of the line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout forty,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost half of the adult Warlord Princes in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdult,\u201d Lucivar said. He gave Ranon a long look. \u201cIf this gets messy, your brother will end up on the killing fields with the rest of you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ranon said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m looking over this document,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cTo try to avoid the necessity of anyone standing on a killing field because of a preference for one Queen over another.\u201d</p><p>Another assessing look at him before Lucivar focused on the other two men. \u201cHave Talon deliver the copy of the document to Grayhaven. He\u2019s the one man Theran won\u2019t challenge.\u201d</p><p>Saetan crossed out a sentence and wrote his changes in the margin. \u201cAnd be sure to have a copy of the final, signed document brought here to the Keep. Documents can be lost or destroyed in a Territory when it\u2019s convenient to hide information. Nothing can touch them here.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t quite true, but there was no one else in the room, including Lucivar, who could destroy a race so completely that all trace of them was eliminated from all the Realms.</p><p>Gray had brought a map of Dena Nehele, so while he, Ranon, and Lucivar reviewed how to make the best use of the trained warriors they had, Saetan worked through Powell\u2019s draft, making subtle word changes that would place the burden of war squarely on Theran Grayhaven\u2019s shoulders. Only a fool would start a war under these circumstances.</p><p>Of course, a man driven to serve a particular Queen could be ten times a fool. He might hate himself for it, but he\u2019d still follow the Queen\u2019s command and be her instrument.</p><p>They would all have to wait and see how firmly Kermilla held Theran\u2019s leash.</p><p>He finished his changes, read them again, and then handed the document back to Gray. The Warlord Princes from Dena Nehele didn\u2019t linger, and Saetan thought that was wise. News would travel. Rumors would begin. The sooner the official document was in the open, the better.</p><p>When they were gone, Saetan looked at Lucivar. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray and Ranon are solid,\u201d Lucivar replied, rubbing his left biceps. \u201cAnd they\u2019re a good team. You fix their paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. It\u2019s still possible that Kermilla can goad Theran hard enough to try to start a war, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be equally successful in convincing enough Warlord Princes to join him on that particular killing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Saetan waited a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to answer that question again without lying to your father?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. A bruise. She didn\u2019t break skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Hell\u2019s fire, the woman\u2019s got some temper when she\u2019s riled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to upset Marian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being considerate. Don\u2019t women want men to be considerate?\u201d Lucivar looked like a puppy who had gotten smacked and had no idea what he\u2019d done wrong.</p><p>It took a formidable amount of self-control to convey nothing but calm interest, but he did it. \u201cOf course they do, but wives also expect to have sex with their husbands on occasion.\u201d After waiting a beat, he added, \u201cI take it you and Marian have resumed making love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any love in this particular bite,\u201d Lucivar growled. \u201cBut, yeah, we had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, my darling, why are you here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time Lucivar didn\u2019t try to hide the wince. \u201cThe village theater group is putting on a play tonight. It\u2019s a comedy. With singing. More or less.\u201d</p><p>Saetan waited. \u201cAre you asking me to watch Daemonar this evening or accompany Marian to the play?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar gave him a pained look.</p> <p>Everything has a price, boyo.\u201cWhat time should I come over to watch the boy?\u201d Saetan tipped his head to indicate the clock on the mantel.</p><p>Lucivar looked at the clock and sighed. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Saetan headed for the closest courtyard that had a landing web. \u201cYou are planning to get cleaned up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question.</p><p>\u201cIf I can have the damn bathroom to myself, it doesn\u2019t take me more than five minutes,\u201d Lucivar muttered.</p><p>If she really wants to see this play, she\u2019s going to clobber him,Saetan thought. \u201cGo. Tell Marian I\u2019ll be there by the time you\u2019re ready to leave. And Lucivar? If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re going to give your Lady more than just sex tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar went out the first available exit and launched himself skyward.</p><p>Saetan sent out a light psychic thread to the woman he considered the perfect match for his volatile son. *Marian?*</p><p>*Uncle Saetan?* Surprise turned to concern. *Lucivar was supposed to see you.*</p><p>*He did. He\u2019ll be home in a minute. I apologize for the delay, but a meeting with two Warlord Princes from Dena Nehele had to take priority.*</p><p>*And he didn\u2019t contact me because he wanted to wiggle out of going to the play tonight?*</p><p>Probably, but not consciously. Lucivar would rather crawl over broken glass than see a comedic play that included singing, but he wouldn\u2019t shrug off an event Marian wanted to attend.</p> <p>*I\u2019ll be over in a few minutes to watch Daemonar. Lucivar swears he can get cleaned up and be ready to leave for you to get to the play on time.*</p><p>*So I should be understanding when he comes roaring in?*</p><p>Hearing the amusement\u2014and the love\u2014in the words, Saetan smiled. *Darling, make him work for it. It won\u2019t hurt him.*</p><p>Her laughter filled the link between them before she broke the thread\u2014no doubt to deal with the husband who had just come thundering home.</p><p>Smiling, Saetan shook his head. \u201cShe used to be a gentle hearth witch before she had to deal with all of us.\u201d He felt the leash slip on his self-control and heard a peculiar sound come from behind his clenched teeth.</p><p>Imagining how well Marian would deal with Lucivar, Saetan leaned against a wall, let go of self-control, and laughed himself silly.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>TERREILLE</p> <p>Three copies of a document that would break a land that had survived cruelty she couldn\u2019t imagine, even when she heard some of the stories about Dena Nehele\u2019s past. Three copies of a document that would change all of their lives.</p><p>And change nothing that matters the most,Cassidy thought as she carefully pressed her seal into the wax on the third copy\u2014and heard the whole First Circle release the breath they\u2019d been holding while she took this last step.</p><p>As soon as she sat back, Powell pulled the copy away and positioned it in the center of the big table, along with the other two copies.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d her Steward said. \u201cTalon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the copy up to the Keep first.\u201d Talon carefully rolled two of the documents and vanished them. Then he hesitated. \u201cOnce I hand this paper to the High Lord and it\u2019s acknowledged at the Keep, the path is chosen. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her one last chance to walk away. A Queen\u2019s wants, wishes, and will came first, no matter the cost.</p><p>\u201cSafe journey, Prince Talon,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Her legs felt shaky, so she sat at the table while Talon and the rest of the court left the room. Naturally, Ranon and Gray were last and kept glancing at her as if trying to decide if they should stay or leave.</p><p>Shira made it simple by shoving the two of them out of the room. Before the Black Widow could close the door for a private chat, Reyhana slipped into the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d Reyhana squared her shoulders and lifted her chin.</p><p>How much death has this girl already seen?Cassidy wondered.How much more will she have to see? \u201cYou serve in my Second Circle, Sister, so you most certainly are going to help.\u201d She stood up and felt reassured that her legs weren\u2019t as wobbly as they\u2019d been a few minutes ago. \u201cI could use a bit more to eat than the half piece of toast I choked down earlier. After that, why don\u2019t the three of us review what needs to be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we first have to find out what Theran is going to do?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>Cassidy shook her head as she joined them at the door. \u201cWar or not, we\u2019ve got two months before spring. Fields will need to be plowed, and crops will need to be sown\u2014and the Queens need to affirm their bond to the land. We need to make sure all the Queens know how to enrich the land, we need to confirm that the villages\u2014landen and Blood\u2014have the plows and other tools they need for their farms and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d Shira said, laughing. \u201cAll right. Point taken. We have plenty to do.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at Shira and knew that, for a moment, they both pictured an orchard of honey pear trees growing out of the bodies of the dead.</p><p>Then they both pushed that image aside, and the three of them went to Cassidy\u2019s study and got on with the business of living.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Saetan read the document carefully. Then, assured that Powell had made all the changes he\u2019d written on the draft, he set the document on the library\u2019s large blackwood table and vanished his half-moon glasses. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure this is preserved. A place will be set aside in the library for any other documents or work from Shalador Nehele that you want preserved outside of your land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Talon replied.</p><p>Saetan studied the demon-dead Warlord Prince who had been a friend of Jared and Lia. \u201cThis is hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s hard. Not so much that it happened, but the reason why it happened. Makes me wonder what I\u2019ve been fighting for these past three hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you that,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting for honor and to protect what you cherish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed him.\u201d Talon shook his head. \u201cTheran doing this means I failed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Until he steps up to the line and makes the choice to start a war, you don\u2019t know that. And if there is enough of Jared in him, he may surprise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI served a Queen before I turned rogue. She was the reason I turned rogue. I never felt the pull with her that I feel with Cassie. I don\u2019t think I could turn away from Cassie, no matter what she did at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bond can wane or break, like any other kind of love,\u201d Saetan said. Having faced the possibility of killing a son in order to save his Queen, he knew what Talon was feeling, but there wasn\u2019t much comfort he, or anyone else, could give this man.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late in the morning for you to be traveling back to Dena Nehele,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to a guest room where you can rest until sunset.\u201d</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>A simple message was sent from the High Lord of Hell to Lord Khardeen, Lady Sabrina, and Prince Daemon Sadi. It said:</p><p>Dena Nehele has broken. Shalador Nehele rises with Cassidy as its Queen. May the Darkness have mercy on them.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran read the document a second time, then stared at the man who had raised him and loved him\u2014and was now an enemy.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He tossed the document on his desk. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Talon,why? \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear enough,\u201d Talon replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clear,\u201d Theran snapped. \u201cNothing is clear. Youbroke Dena Nehele. You broke the land that survived generations of twisted Queens and Dorothea SaDiablo\u2019s hatred for the sake of a bitch who should be leaving instead of trying to take control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same about you. And that\u2019s the last time you get to call my Queen a bitch without blood being shed.\u201d</p><p>Sick, scared, and furious, Theran clenched his teeth to avoid saying anything more. Talonwould shed blood. Even his.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this. She took a third of the Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy didn\u2019t take anything. The Provinces were free to make their choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what price would they pay if they didn\u2019t make the choice Lady Cassidy wanted?\u201d Theran asked bitterly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to dress Cassidy in another woman\u2019s temper,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking questions that don\u2019t fit her as a woman or a Queen, so maybe you\u2019re really wondering about someone else.\u201d</p><p>Theran rocked back on his heels, not sure how to answer that\u2014and sure hedidn\u2019t want to answer that. \u201cTalon, breaking Dena Nehele isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cassidy going to be the Queen of Dena Nehele two months from now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she is not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this is the only answer that gives both sides a choice besides war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoice.\u201d The word hooked its claws into him and left his heart bleeding. \u201cYou call this a choice? Kermilla will never accept this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t the Queen yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she isn\u2019t the Queen yet. And I guess, right now, that makes you the unofficial ruler of Dena Nehele. So it\u2019s up to you to accept this.\u201d</p><p>Theran staggered back a step. No Queen. No female hand to guide them once it became known that Cassidy had turned away from the Provinces north of the Heartsblood River.</p><p>No Queen again. At least, not until Kermilla formed a court.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m no longer part of Cassidy\u2019s court,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t serve the Queen of Shalador Nehele, so, no, you\u2019re no longer part of the court.\u201d</p><p>So much sadness in Talon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cTalon . . . are you really going to stand against me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet us go, Theran. We don\u2019t want a war, but if you send men against us or our Queen, we will fight. And I tell you now, boy, if we meet on a killing field I will do everything I can to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s eyes stung. He blinked away the tears. \u201cThat\u2019s it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201d Talon walked to the study door and opened it. He stopped and looked over his shoulder. \u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Theran.\u201d</p> <p>Theran said nothing until Talon left the room. Then he whispered, \u201cAnd you, Talon. And you.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla tapped on the study door and swallowed her resentment\u2014again\u2014about being locked out of Theran\u2019s study. That would change once she was the Queen. Yes, that would certainly change. But for now, she couldn\u2019t demand to know what had happened between Theran and that awful Prince Talon. Just looking at the man\u2019s maimed hand and the way he walked because of the missing part of his right foot made her shudder. At least she wouldn\u2019t have to considerhim for her court, no matter how Theran felt about him.</p><p>She knocked on the door, louder this time. And this time it opened.</p><p>When she walked in, Theran was pacing, the restless movement of a man incapable of remaining still. And the look on his face . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid something happen to your cousin?\u201d Not that she cared a finger snap about Gray since he\u2019d been so rude to her, but Therandid care, so it was appropriate to show concern.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost his mind, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Theran snapped. \u201cWith help, I\u2019m sure, from that Shalador bastard Ranon.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t tell her anything. \u201cTheran . . .\u201d</p><p>He strode to his desk, grabbed a document, and thrust it into her hands.</p><p>She read\u2014and felt a fury rise in her unlike anything she had felt before. \u201cThatbitch ! She\u2019s taken wholeProvinces ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything south of the Heartsblood River is now ruled by Lady Cassidy, Queen of Shalador Nehele,\u201d Theran said bitterly. \u201cA third of Dena Nehele is gone because of a piece of paper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Get them back. Theran, you have to get those Provinces back!\u201d A third of Dena Nehele? A third of the income that should be hers? Unthinkable! \u201cYou can\u2019t let her do this to us. To the land and the people who need our guidance,\u201d she amended when she noticed the uncertainty in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, they don\u2019t think they need anything from us.\u201d Theran resumed his pacing.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop this!\u201d Kermilla sank into a chair. Thatbitch . Should have known better than to offeranything. She\u2019d been willing to let Freckledy rule the Shalador reserves, hadn\u2019t she? Wasn\u2019t much there worth having anyway, but it had been a way to show how generous she could be by letting the Queen who had been dismissed remain in her little village and be useful. Of course Cassidy, being a fine draft horse of a Queen,was useful.</p><p>But no. The bitch got greedy andstole Provinces that should have beenhers. And that was something she couldn\u2019t allow.</p><p>That strange fury washed through her again. \u201cYou have to do something, Prince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an odd look\u2014more appreciative of this show of temper than wary of it.</p><p>Finally he stopped pacing, rubbed his hands over his face, and sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, Kermilla. A copy of that document is already at the Keep. There is no way to deny it exists. They did this behind my back, not even giving me the chance to challenge the decision, but it\u2019s done now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThenchange it,\u201d Kermilla said.</p><p>\u201cHow? War? Do you know what another war would do to us right now?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not a consideration. I doubt there is a Warlord Prince on this side of the Heartsblood River who would be willing to step onto a killing field against Ranon or Talon . . . or Jared Blaed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to give up athird of Dena Nehele toCassidy? \u201d Kermilla stared at him in disbelief. How could he give up her land so easily?</p><p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s already done.\u201d Retrieving the document, which she\u2019d dropped beside her chair, Theran set it on his desk. \u201cNo point chewing on a battle that\u2019s already been fought and lost. Not when we have to move fast to meet the next challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d She was too upset to try her sexy pout or any other maneuver on him.</p><p>Another odd look. \u201cConvincing eleven other men to stand with me and form your court.\u201d</p><p>Why is that a challenge?</p><p>Before she could ask him, there was a quick knock followed by the bell that signaled that dinner was ready to be served.</p><p>Theran opened the study door and looked at her. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t really a question, so she walked out of the room\u2014and swallowed the resentment that bubbled up again when he put a Green lock on the door.</p><p>She needed to form a court, and she couldn\u2019t do it without his help. But once she did, there would be more than one change in Dena Nehele.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Within three days, most of the people in Dena Nehele, Blood and landen alike, had heard some version of the news that Lady Cassidy had formed a new Territory out of the Shalador reserves and Dena Nehele\u2019s five southern Provinces.</p><p>According to the Warlord Princes in the southern Provinces, Lady Cassidy had stepped up to the line Theran Grayhaven had drawn and showed her courage by forming a new Territory that would live by the Old Ways of the Blood instead of allowing herself to be forced out by the unscrupulous Queen who was Theran\u2019s lover.</p><p>According to the Warlord Princes in the northernmost Provinces, Lady Cassidy had abandoned them without a second thought, splitting a land that had survived the landen uprisings as well as generations of Dorothea SaDiablo\u2019s machinations.</p><p>The Warlord Princes who lived in the Province on the other side of the Heartsblood River\u2014and could wave to the guards now keeping watch along the northern border of Shalador Nehele\u2014said nothing.</p><p>Four days after Shalador Nehele came into being, most of the Warlord Princes who lived north of the Heartsblood River gathered at the Grayhaven estate.</p><p>Most, but not all,Theran thought as uneasiness soured his belly. Ferall hadn\u2019t come, and because Kermilla had burned the one letter Ferall had sent to him weeks ago, Theran didn\u2019t know if there was something he could have done to convince the Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince that he knew what was best for the people and the land.</p><p>He walked up the steps to the platform and faced the men. Less than a year ago, Cassidy had stood in this same room and selected the men who became her First Circle. Every man who was here now had been in the room that day\u2014and they remembered. He saw it in their eyes.</p><p>Using Craft to enhance his voice, he said, \u201cBy now, you\u2019ve probably all heard that Lady Cassidy enticed the Warlord Princes in the five southern Provinces to abandon Dena Nehele and form a new Territory. She did this because her contract to rule as the Territory Queen would have ended in two months and was not going to be renewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d someone in the back of the room asked. \u201cFrom what I hear, her court is standing strong and there have been no complaints about the Lady herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any complaints either,\u201d someone else said. \u201cQuite the contrary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy did an adequate job of starting us on the right path,\u201d Theran said, \u201cbut another Lady more suited to Dena Nehele is ready to stand as our Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this Lady?\u201d Hikaeda asked.</p><p>Hikaeda and Elendill came from the Province that bordered the Heartsblood River and would, no doubt, be reporting back to Ferall and the other Warlord Princes who had settled there.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla, who is also from Dharo in the Realm of Kaeleer,\u201d Theran replied.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Hikaeda looked at his friend Elendill, then back at Theran. \u201cWhat is it you want from us, Prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla held back from forming a court here out of courtesy for Lady Cassidy, allowing Cassidy to finish her rule here uncontested. Because of that courtesy, Dena Nehele is left without a Queen or a ruling court. Our situation is a little better than it was a year ago, but the need for a Queen to rule our land remains. What I\u2019m asking of you, Hikaeda, is the same thing I asked a year ago\u2014that all of you offer yourselves for the Queen\u2019s consideration, and if chosen, serve in her First Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kermilla is the Queen you intend to have rule over us?\u201d Hikaeda asked.</p><p>How many times was he going to have to say it? \u201cYes, because Kermilla is the right Queen for us.\u201d</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your words, Theran,\u201d Hikaeda said politely. \u201cElendill and I will return to our Province and convey your message to the District Queens and the Warlord Princes who were unable to answer your summons. I am certain you will not wait long for an answer.\u201d</p><p>What in the name of Hell did that mean?</p><p>Hikaeda and Elendill turned away from the platform and headed for the door. The other Warlord Princes turned and followed, not even glancing at him to confirm that this meeting was over.</p><p>He wanted to call them back, wanted to demand some kind of answer. But there was nothing he could say to them right now\u2014and apparently, there was nothing they wanted to say to him.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cLibrary, library, library.\u201d Ranon set those three letters on the stack marked for Gray to handle. Only a week had passed since the official creation of Shalador Nehele, and the mail coming in for Queen and court had tripled.</p><p>The day had turned cold and snowy, with a wind that cut like a mean-tempered bitch. Cassie was tucked in for the afternoon and he was the escort on duty, so he\u2019d offered to sort the mail since Powell had more than enough to do right now. It wasn\u2019t a job he enjoyed, but he didn\u2019t mind it either, and doing something productive for the court made him feel less guilty about being warm and comfortable today while other members of the First Circle were out in that white misery fulfilling their own assignments.</p><p>\u201cRequest for a loan to repair a printing press and open a print shop and bookbindery.\u201d He frowned at that letter for a moment, then put it in Gray\u2019s stack. \u201cRequest for lessons with the Protocol instructors. Well, Gray can deal with that too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he hesitated and wondered if they were dumping too much on Gray, especially since hewas the First Escort and his first priority was taking care of the Queen.</p><p>\u201cWe really need a Second Circle to assist the First Circle,\u201d he muttered. The problem was paying a Second Circle, although Powellhad hinted they could afford to bring in a few more people to work for the court. Well, for the time being, they would do the best they could with what they had.</p><p>Could a Sceltie learn to sort mail?</p> <p>While he pondered what the dogs might be able to do with the reading skills they had, Dryden tapped on the door and said, \u201cPrince Ferall is asking to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d When Dryden nodded, Ranon set the unsorted letters at one end of the big meeting table. Nothing really confidential in the stacks he\u2019d sorted so far, but he used Craft to make a layer of witchlight over the papers, effectively preventing anyone from reading them. \u201cSend him in.\u201d</p><p>Ferall entered the room, still wearing his heavy winter coat and a shapeless hat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sense any shields around the man, but Ranon instinctively put a skintight Opal shield around himself under his clothing, just in case. A warrior like Ferall usually held on to his outer gear when he figured he\u2019d have to leave in a hurry\u2014and that usually meant after splattering the walls with blood.</p><p>He smiled and took a step forward as if he didn\u2019t see the fury in the other man\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Then Ferall grabbed two fistfuls of Ranon\u2019s shirt and slammed his back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou self-serving son of a whoring bitch,\u201d Ferall snarled. \u201cGot what you wanted so you just let the rest of us flounder, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Clamping his hands around Ferall\u2019s wrists to prevent a grab for his throat, Ranon snarled back, \u201cWhat in the name of Hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. This.\u201d Ferall shook him. \u201cDidn\u2019t we work hard enough, try hard enough? Couldn\u2019t you give us a chance before you cut us loose? I almost had a life. Damn you to the bowels of Hell, Ranon, I almost had a life! A widow with two young children, a boy and a girl. Lost her husband to one of those twisted bitches a few years back. Had the courage to let me into her life and into her bed. Let me be around her children. You know what that means, Ranon.You know. \u201d</p><p>Yes, he knew. And he understood now about those special gifts Ferall had purchased for Winsol.</p><p>Ferall leaned in, and despite the shield, Ranon could feel his chest muscles bruising under the pressure of the other man\u2019s fists.</p> <p>\u201cI never had much of a home when I was young, and nothing you could call ahome since I was fifteen. Do you know what it feels like to settle into a place and not have everyone look at you with fear in their eyes because they\u2019ve gotten used to you, gotten used to the idea that you\u2019re there to protect them as well as be an instrument of the Queen\u2019s will? Do you know what it feels like to be with a woman who cares about you? To have a boy waiting to see you at the end of the day to play a game of toss before dinner or have a little girl snuggle up next to you wanting you to read her a story? Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ranon said quietly. And he did know about that particular dream. He was hoping to have those same things with Shira someday.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Ferall pressed him harder into the wall. \u201cYou bastard! Tell me why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Ranon wondered why Vae\u2019s snarled words sounded so strange. Then he looked toward the door and thought,Oh, shit.</p><p>Cassie stood there, her red hair flowing down her back and her feet planted in a fighting stance. One hand held that club she\u2019d used to defend James Weaver and his family back in Grayhaven. Vae stood beside her.</p><p>Both witches snarled at Ferall.</p><p>Pushing away from Ranon\u2014and giving him a last knock into the wall in the process\u2014Ferall took a step toward Cassidy, measured the wild look in her eyes, and took a step back.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give us a chance to prove ourselves before cutting us loose like that?\u201d Ferall asked, his voice ringing with frustration and lost hope.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to cut anyone loose, Prince Ferall,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThen why set the line at the Heartsblood River?\u201d</p><p>She must have heard the same leashed pain in Ferall\u2019s voice that he did because she lost her defensive anger and stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s a natural boundary, and we didn\u2019t want to be greedy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the look of frustrated disbelief on Ferall\u2019s face.</p><p>Pulling off his hat, Ferall slapped it on his thigh and roared, \u201cWell, Hell\u2019s fire, woman! For just once in your life,be greedy !\u201d</p><p>The club slipped from Cassidy\u2019s suddenly limp fingers and almost conked Vae on the head. Cassidy stood there with her mouth hanging open, clearly shocked by the idea of being greedy.</p><p>It took her a long moment to gather herself. \u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable having your family live under Kermilla\u2019s hand, you can relocate, move to a village on the other side of the river. There is plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that,\u201d Ferall agreed. \u201cBut what about the other eleven Warlord Princes who live in that Province? What about the people in the towns and villages that I\u2019ve been ruling on behalf of the Queen? What about the farmers who don\u2019t want to leave land that\u2019s been held in their families for generations? What about them, Lady? What should I tell them when I pack up my family and move across the river?\u201d</p><p>Ranon watched Cassidy turn paler and paler until her freckles were the only color left in her face.</p><p>Come on, Cassie,he thought.Step up to the line.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t nudge her, couldn\u2019t urge her. She didn\u2019t ask for his opinion. Didn\u2019t even look his way for some kind of sign. Her eyes stayed on Ferall.</p><p>Then Cassidy, Queen of Shalador Nehele, squared her shoulders and quietly said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Prince Ferall. So many people should not be asked to leave their homes. But one man should not make such an important choice for so many.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cSo this is my decision. Go home, Ferall. Talk to the other Warlord Princes. Talk to the District Queens who rule in your Province. If, on behalf of themselves and the people they rule, the majority of them want to break from Dena Nehele and join us as part of Shalador Nehele, you will all be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes on Cassidy, Ferall called in a sheet of paper and held it out. \u201cHow about all of them?\u201d</p><p>Ranon leaned against the wall for support. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Ferall had come with the document in hand.</p><p>Cassidy got paler, if that was possible. But she stepped up to the line. \u201cIn that case, welcome to Shalador Nehele. Prince Powell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d</p><p>Powell stepped into the room. Must have gotten a sense of trouble and been hovering in the hallway. He wasn\u2019t a fighter, but if it had come down to a fight, Ranon would have locked with Ferall and Powell would have gotten Cassie out of the room.</p><p>\u201cPlease review the document Prince Ferall has brought. Then make a copy of it to add to the documents being preserved for us at the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be my pleasure, Lady,\u201d Powell said. \u201cPrince Ferall? If you would come to my office?\u201d</p><p>Ferall studied Cassidy for a moment. \u201cThank you, Lady. For all of us, thank you.\u201d He followed Powell out of the room.</p><p>The moment Ferall was out of the room, Ranon leaped toward Cassie, grabbing her before her legs buckled. He pulled out a chair. She collapsed into it.</p><p>\u201cHead down, darling,\u201d he said, holding one hand between her shoulder blades as she pressed her forehead against her knees. \u201cJust breathe now. That\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon? What did I just do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave a strong man the possibility of a good life.\u201d She\u2019d done a great deal more than that, but he figured she wasn\u2019t ready to hear all of it.</p><p>When she pushed up, he rubbed her back to soothe and comfort. She had a little color in her face, but she looked like she\u2019d had the wind knocked out of her.</p><p>He felt the same way. \u201cYou want some tea or brandy or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and yes.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly realizing that Vae had been unnaturally quiet, he looked at the Sceltie, who was staring at the club Cassie had dropped. He closed his hand over the club and vanished it. A Sceltie who knew her Craft probably wouldn\u2019t have any trouble burying a club even when the ground was frozen.</p><p>As he helped Cassie to her feet, he said, \u201cCome on, Vae. You deserve a treat too.\u201d</p><p>*Yes.*</p><p>Vae definitely sounded grumpy. Well, he\u2019d be grumpy too if he\u2019d come that close to being conked on the head.</p><p>He escorted his two Ladies to the Ladies\u2019 parlor. Within moments, Birdie, Frannie, Elle, and Maydra were all there, fussing over Cassie and Vae. The second time he got stepped on, he took the hint and retreated downstairs to the parlor used by the court.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d poured himself a second brandy, he felt steady enough to consider what had happened\u2014and what it meant.</p><p>They had Ferall on their side. Mother Night, they had Ferall, one of the most savage fighters in Dena Nehele. And they had Hikaeda, Elendill, and Rikoma, along with the other eight Warlord Princes who lived in that Province. And they had that land. That would change a lot of things, because that Province ran from the Tamanara Mountains to the western border. As the largest Province, it also meant that, landwise, Dena Nehele and Shalador Nehele were now equal in size. And the addition of those twelve Warlord Princes serving under Cassie\u2019s hand meant their fighting weight was equal or better to anything Theran could send against them.</p><p>Yes, this would change a lot of things, and he wondered how Theran and Kermilla were going to respond when they found out.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran stared at the document Archerr had delivered a few minutes ago.</p><p>Hikaeda said he wouldn\u2019t have to wait long for an answer from the Warlord Princes who lived in the Province that bordered the Heartsblood River. He just hadn\u2019t been prepared forthis answer.</p><p>Cassidy now held the leash for twelve more Warlord Princes\u2014including Ferall. Mother Night, she had Ferall on top of Talon and Ranon. Only a fool would stand on a killing field against those three. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she had Jared Blaed, who had become a formidable, dominant male, even if he didn\u2019t wear the Jewels or have the power he might have had.</p><p>Now Cassidy controlled the land and income from another Province. The Warlord Princes and Queens justgave it to her. Didn\u2019t they have any loyalty to their own land, their own heritage?</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d left the study door open. It seemed insulting to have Kermilla scratching on the door like a servant asking for admittance. Especially today. Besides, he\u2019d already tucked the correspondence away in a locked drawer in his desk.</p><p>He held out the document.</p><p>She read it, her brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she asked, handing it back to him.</p><p>\u201cIt means Cassidy holds Ferall\u2019s leash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, good riddance. He was a crude man. I didn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince. I\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s done on a killing field. He\u2019s no Lucivar Yaslana, but even so he was feared\u2014and with good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>No real comprehension. He heard that truth in her voice, saw it in her eyes. \u201cAnd it means that Cassidy now rules half of what used to be Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Thatshe understood, and those pretty blue eyes blazed with anger.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop this, Theran. You have to get the court formed andstop this. \u201d</p> <p>Hadn\u2019t he been trying for months to introduce her to the other Warlord Princes and give her a chance to shine? It wasn\u2019t his fault she\u2019d pissed off Ferall and some of the others. But she kept snapping at him because her position was still so tenuous, or she sulked over his tight control of the purse, or pouted over some real\u2014or imagined\u2014insult from Julien. Or wanted sex, which was becoming less and less appealing because there seemed to be less and less heart in the act.</p><p>Sometimes he wanted to shout at her to stop being a stupid, selfish girl and start being the Queen he knew she could be.</p><p>And yet, despite his growing frustration and anger with her, she still felt soright, and heknew if she could have a little more time to mature, shewould be the Queen Dena Nehele so desperately needed.</p><p>She was right about one thing: every day that slipped away without a court forming around her made Dena Nehele more vulnerable\u2014and made Cassidy, and her court, look better.</p><p>Over the next few days, Theran felt like a man bleeding to death from a wound he couldn\u2019t find.</p><p>Thinking that any court was better than no court, and figuring Kermilla wouldn\u2019t object since she considered these Blood acceptable companions socially, he\u2019d gone to visit the aristo families in Grayhaven\u2014and discovered they hadall left town on business of one kind or another. The servants couldn\u2019t tell him where the families had gone, couldn\u2019t tell him when they would return.</p><p>The message was clear enough: The men were afraid he would require them to serve in Kermilla\u2019s court, so they had removed themselves from his reach.</p><p>When he went to talk to the Warlord Princes living in his own Province, they stared at him with bleak eyes and offered nothing.</p> <p>And with each day and each failure, Kermilla became shriller and more demanding.</p><p>He sent another summons to the Warlord Princes in the remaining Provinces, demanding that they present themselves to Kermilla for consideration in her court.</p><p>This time, no one answered.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Ignoring her yip of protest, Gray bundled Cassidy into her winter coat and hustled her to the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cPut your boots on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>Well, she needed a break from the paperwork anyway, and he looked like he could be as stubborn as a Sceltie about showing her whatever this was.</p><p>When they were outside, Cassidy lifted her face to the sun. \u201cNot one word about my needing a hat. Not today when the air has that first scent of spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t going to say a thing.\u201d Taking her hand, he led her to the sitting area under the tree.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Delight filled her. \u201cOh, Gray! Look!\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThe first blooms of spring.\u201d</p><p>Sturdy little flowers poked up through the snow, purple and yellow and white. Similar to one of the spring flowers in Dharo, but not quite the same. The kind of flower Gray called common ground.</p><p>\u201cBulbs?\u201d Cassie asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. There are a couple more varieties planted around the tree, but they\u2019ll bloom later in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple\u2014\u201d Wondering how he knew that since the court hadn\u2019t been here last spring, she turned to look at him\u2014and saw something in his eyes that left her breathless. \u201cThese weren\u2019t here last spring, were they?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI planted them this past fall. Wanted it to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re the surprise.\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A choice. A chance.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you consider marrying me?\u201d</p><p>No expression on his face. Blank eyes. Then, hesitantly, \u201cReally? You\u2019re not teasing me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tease about that. I love you when you\u2019re Gray and when you\u2019re Jared Blaed. I want to build a life with you that spans the seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with me?\u201d His eyes looked a little less blank, but she wasn\u2019t sure his brain was fully working.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her with enough heat to sizzle through her body and melt bone. Then he wrapped his arms around her and held on.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with you the first time I met you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what gave me the courage to wake up and grow up. So that I could be with you.\u201d He eased back enough to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy me a wedding ring, right?\u201d</p><p>Happy tears stung her eyes. She laughed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to buy you a traditional ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Gray said. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>*Gray? Cassie?*</p><p>Vae trotted up to them. She wagged a greeting, then stared at both of them.</p><p>*Cassie is crying, and you are happy,* she told Gray, her words accompanied by a growl. *Why?*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy too,\u201d Cassie said, wiping tears off her face. \u201cGray and I are going to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know about human marriage?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>*I know.* The growling stopped and the tail wagged with more enthusiasm. *Is this a secret?*</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a secret.\u201d</p><p>Vae lifted her muzzle and howled. A few moments later, Khollie howled from the other side of the stone fence. A few moments after that, Lloyd and Kief joined in. Then Darcy. Then Keely.</p><p>They heard another faint howl coming from the direction of Eyota\u2019s main street.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell the whole village before we have time to get back to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, they ran back to the house, stomped snow off their boots, and smacked into Ranon and Shaddo, who were heading outside to find out what had stirred up the dogs.</p><p>By the time the First Circle gathered in the court\u2019s parlor and Dryden opened bottles of sparkling wine for the first of many celebrations, everyone who lived with or worked near a Sceltie had heard the news about Prince Jared Blaed and Lady Cassidy.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p><p>Daemon walked into one of the sitting rooms. Lucivar came in a step behind him and immediately swung to the left to give them both working room. Their father stood by a window, looking out and smiling an odd little smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Gray?\u201d Daemon asked. \u201cYou said he needed to talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he outside making mulch?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s outside,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cAnd once in a while he stops grinning and remembers what he\u2019s supposed to do with the piece of wood he\u2019s holding.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked at Lucivar, who shrugged.</p><p>*I\u2019m not picking up any temper,* Lucivar said on an Ebon-gray spear thread.</p><p>*Neither am I,* Daemon replied. But what his psychic probewas picking up from the boy was damn peculiar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give him a hard time,\u201d Saetan warned as he rapped on the window. \u201cThe only reason I chucked him out there was because he insisted that he wanted to wait until he could tell all three of us the news, and he\u2019s so bouncy it was exhausting to be in the same room with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Daemon smiled.</p><p>A minute later, still dressed in his heavy coat and holding a piece of wood, Gray bounced into the room.</p><p>*He\u2019s spending too much time with Vae,* Lucivar said.</p><p>Daemon stifled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Looking at those bright green eyes and sensing the almost skin-bursting excitement, Daemon didn\u2019t need to hear the words to know the news. But he kept his expression politely interested\u2014and noticed that Saetan was wearing the same expression.</p><p>Lucivar shook his head and said, \u201cGive me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gray looked at the chunk of wood Lucivar took from him and vanished. \u201cOh.\u201d Then he just grinned at all of them.</p><p>\u201cOkay, brainless,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cUse words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d Saetan groaned quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married. To Cassie. And she\u2019s getting married to me. It happened yesterday. Not the getting married part. The asking part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Gray,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cAnd worthy of a celebration.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stared at Gray until the weight of that stare quieted some of the excitement in the young Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided to live right up to the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray replied. \u201cI did. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Gray,\u201d Lucivar smiled. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>Draca entered the room, followed by a servant who brought in a tray filled with food and another servant who brought bottles of sparkling wine and glasses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When told the news, the Keep\u2019s Seneschal offered her congratulations and left. Daemon opened a bottle of wine and poured while Lucivar handed out the glasses.</p><p>After the first toast, Daemon set his glass aside and called in two small jeweler\u2019s boxes. \u201cHere, Gray. I had a feeling you were going to need these someday, and it looks like that day has come.\u201d</p><p>Gray set his own glass down and opened the first box. \u201cA man\u2019s traditional marriage ring. Do you think it will fit me?\u201d</p> <p>Daemon chuckled as Gray admired the plain gold band. \u201cDarling, I know it will fit you. Remember our trip to Amdarh for some of the Winsol shopping? Remember going to Banard\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cSurreal wanted to buy a ring for Rainier, and I tried some on so you could see how they fit.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhich actually made no sense, but at the time, itsounded like it made sense.\u201d</p><p>*What sort of spell did you wrap around him when you did that?* Saetan said.</p><p>*Nothing much,* Daemon replied. *And it wasn\u2019t around him, it was around my voice.*</p><p>*Ah.* \u201cExcept for a court ring or a marriage ring, the only ring a man usually wears is his Jewels,\u201d Saetan said.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Gray narrowed his eyes at Daemon. \u201cIt was a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small deception,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cBut with that little ruse, you obligingly provided Banard with your ring size. And then there is this.\u201d He flipped the other box open and held it out.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Gray whispered.</p><p>When Gray just stood there, staring, Daemon tipped the box so Saetan could see the ring.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cAnd it suits Cassie.\u201d</p><p>It did suit Cassidy. Amber in three colors, set in a clean design of gold.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford that ring,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cThe two rings are a wedding gift from the SaDiablo family,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cA gift to a Queen we admire\u2014and to a Warlord Prince who has had the courage to live up to his potential. I hope you\u2019ll accept them.\u201d</p><p>*I trust you have no objections to the gift?* he asked Lucivar and Saetan.</p><p>*None,* they replied.</p><p>Gray took the box that held Cassie\u2019s wedding ring. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, boyo,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down, have something to eat, and you can tell us every detail about your marriage proposal.\u201d He and Lucivar and Saetan all laughed at Gray\u2019s expression. \u201cAll right. Not every detail.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>TERREILLE</p> <p>There was nothing Theran could do. The more he tried to hold on to the land his family had guarded and cherished for so long, the more of it fell away.</p><p>Two weeks after the Heartsblood River Province deserted Dena Nehele and gave itself to Cassidy, one of the northern Provinces that bordered the Tamanara Mountains became part of Shalador Nehele. A week after that, the other Province that bordered the mountains turned away from its heritage.</p><p>Only four Provinces left. A land that had held for centuries had been reduced to a third of its size within the space of a couple of months. Kermilla was almost hysterical in her demands that hedo something, and hetried . But nothing worked.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>When the news about the second mountain Province reached him, he didn\u2019t summon the Warlord Princes living in the four remaining Provinces.</p><p>This time, they summoned him.</p><p>They met in an old barn next to an abandoned farmhouse. A familiar kind of gathering place, Theran thought as he slipped inside. During the years when these men had fought against the twisted Queens, they couldn\u2019t gather at an inn without coming to the attention of the Queens\u2019 guards and they wouldn\u2019t gather at anyone\u2019s home and put that man\u2019s family at risk.</p><p>He knew their names, but it was understood that no names were spoken at this kind of meeting. Foolish, really, when there were so few of them left they all knew one another, but that caution had been too well trained into them.</p><p>\u201cPrince.\u201d A Purple Dusk Warlord Prince stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to be the voice of my Brothers.\u201d</p><p>Theran tipped his head to acknowledge the man\u2014and to acknowledge that these men had gathered for a discussion at least once without him. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day after I reached my majority and my training was declared complete, I walked onto my first killing field. I\u2019ve been fighting for Dena Nehele in one way or another ever since. I guess that\u2019s true for all of us here.\u201d</p><p>The other twenty-six Warlord Princes nodded.</p><p>Only twenty-eight of us to guard four Provinces,Theran thought.How in the name of Hell are we going to do that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fought for Dena Nehele,\u201d the Warlord Prince said. \u201cMy father and my grandfather and his father before him all fought and bled and died for Dena Nehele. And as much as we respect Ranon and Jared Blaed, we want to live in Dena Nehele. The Queens in our Provinces feel the same. We don\u2019t want Dena Nehele to become nothing more than a memory.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness. \u201cThen come back to Grayhaven with me. Meet with Lady Kermilla. Help me form a court so that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Warlord Prince took a step back. \u201cWe\u2019ll protect Dena Nehele. We\u2019ll defend the Blood against the landens, and we\u2019ll fight to keep our Provinces safe from outside attack. But none of us will serve Kermilla.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s temper flared hot. \u201cYou\u2019ve never given her a chance. She\u2019s young, and she doesn\u2019t have as much experience as she thinks she has, but she\u2019s not an evil woman or a bad Queen. Befriending Correne was a mistake, and I know the girl\u2019s influence on Kermilla\u2019s behavior left a bad taste in a few men\u2019s mouths, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran.\u201d</p><p>The breach of etiquette shocked him cold.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard words like this before, Theran. Heard them from good men who couldn\u2019t see the blood on their Queens\u2019 hands or tried to justify brutality because they couldn\u2019t live with the truth.\u201d</p><p>Theran said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t serve her, and we won\u2019t stand by and let her become Queen of what is left of our land. We serve Dena Nehele, and we\u2019re willing to let the Grayhaven line stand as the ruler. But not her. Never her. If we have to meet you on a killing field and end the Grayhaven line to make sure she doesn\u2019t become Queen, then that is what we will do.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to believe the words, but he couldn\u2019t doubt what he saw in their eyes. If he helped Kermilla set up a court, they would kill him\u2014and then they would kill her.</p><p>\u201cShe gave up everything to stay here and be our Queen,\u201d he said, desperate to make them understand.</p><p>\u201cI doubt she gave up anything, but you believe what you choose. It\u2019s clear enough she\u2019s your Queen; that doesn\u2019t make her ours.\u201d The Warlord Prince sighed. \u201cTwo weeks, Prince. She\u2019s safe from us for two more weeks. After that, we\u2019ll come hunting.\u201d</p><p>They flowed around him, predators heading back to the territories they claimed as their own.</p><p>Theran stood there, alone, long after the last man had caught the Winds.</p><p>Where was the promise of a new life, a better life? Where was the hope? There had been hope a year ago, hadn\u2019t there? Gone now. All gone. He didn\u2019t know how to fix it, any of it.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t know what he was going to say to Kermilla.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Days ticked by. Theran spent the time riding through the town. Dena Nehele\u2019s capital had too many empty houses, too many empty shops. The people who remained watched him ride by, their eyes accepting and dull.</p><p>He rode into the landen part of town and stared at the craftsmen\u2019s courtyard where Cassidy had defended a landen family against a Warlord and his two sons.</p><p>People\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t been accepting and dull then.</p><p>To avoid Kermilla and the questions he couldn\u2019t answer, he walked around the Grayhaven estate, slogging on slushy paths and riding trails until his trousers were soaked and his legs ached. Or he\u2019d stare at the flower beds Gray had restored, at the spring flowers that had already bloomed or would bloom in a couple more weeks, according to Julien. And more often, he would end up in front of the bed full of witchblood, remembering the day they all discovered what it was\u2014and what it meant.</p><p>The days ticked by, and soon there would be no days left. He had to make a choice before the other Warlord Princes made it for him.</p><p>A gorgeous spring day. Sweet air and sun that gave warmth as well as light.</p><p>Theran stood on the terrace, enjoying this teasing hint of the days to come. It was still too early in the season for the land to shrug off winter altogether, but this was a day to savor.</p><p>And there, tucked in the shelter of the terrace\u2019s raised beds, was the little honey pear tree, which had survived the winter.</p><p>He heard the terrace door open and knew without turning who was there. Her psychic scent was irresistible even on a day like today when her physical presence had less than no appeal.</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d</p><p>Dredging up a smile, he turned toward the door. Kermilla was wrapped in a shawl and a sulky mood.</p><p>The shawl wasn\u2019t one he\u2019d seen before, and he wondered if that was because it was something she tended to wear in the spring or if he was going to receive an apology and a bill from one of the merchants.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wasting time?\u201d Kermilla asked. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bringing the Warlord Princes here so that I can choose my court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, Kermilla.\u201d He\u2019d been trying to work out a way for everyone to get something, even if he couldn\u2019t give her what she really wanted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not complicated, Theran. Justtell them.\u201d She walked over to the table where he\u2019d set a few papers down. Giving him a defiant look, she moved until she could read as much of the top page as was visible around the fist-sized rock serving as a paperweight.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019ttell them anything.\u201d</p><p>Since it wasn\u2019t interesting, she gave up on trying to read the top page. \u201cYou\u2019re the darkest-Jeweled Warlord Prince in this miserable excuse of a Territory. Of course you can tell them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bristled, insulted on behalf of his people and his land.</p><p>Then he tightened the leash and forced himself to keep his temper out of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s simple,\u201d he said with strained patience. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeeps you in control, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. Where was that bitterness coming from?</p><p>\u201cYou control the money, so I can\u2019t buyanything without coming to you first,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to show you the accounts and how much is still owed the merchants from the last time you went shopping without being \u2018controlled\u2019?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou control access to the other Warlord Princes and the aristo families, so I can\u2019t make friends on my own or establish any bonds with other men that don\u2019t go through you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou treat me like a child, but I\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKermilla\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Queen, damn you!I\u2019m a Queen, and I\u2019m the one who should be controlling the purse and the men and the land! Me! Not you!\u201d She grabbed the rock. \u201cNot you!\u201d</p><p>She threw the rock.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know\u2014would never know\u2014if her aim had been bad or if she hit exactly what she had intended to hit.</p> <p>The rock missed him completely and struck the old wish pot that held the honey pear tree.</p><p>For a long moment they stared at each other.</p><p>She looked magnificent in her fury, and he wanted, more than anything, to yield to her temper and her will.</p><p>Then he looked down at the pot that was now in pieces and the honey pear tree lying in the spilled dirt, its roots exposed to the too-cold air.</p><p>\u201cJulien!\u201d he shouted. \u201cJulien!\u201d</p><p>When the butler appeared in the doorway, Theran said, \u201cThe pot broke. See what you can find to replace it and do what you can for the honey pear tree.\u201d</p><p>Julien disappeared.</p><p>Theran picked up part of the broken pot, a piece about the size of his fully stretched hand.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Theran.\u201d Kermilla stood there, looking pretty and contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I threw that rock, but you made me so angry.\u201d</p><p>He could feel something breaking inside him, and he needed to get away from her, from everyone.</p><p>She studied him. \u201cI know you were fond of it but, Theran, it was just an old pot.\u201d</p><p>Something inside him breaking, breaking.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an old pot, Kermilla. It was a family heirloom, and because of who it belonged to, it was priceless.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open in shock.</p><p>And a truth ripped through him and left him bleeding.</p><p>He walked away from her and passed by Julien as the butler rushed back to the tree. He didn\u2019t allow himself to think or to feel until he was safely behind the locked door of his study.</p><p>Then he set the remnant of the wish pot on his desk, sat down . . . and cried.</p><p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>For a day and a half, Theran tried to reconcile a dream and a hard truth, but no matter how he looked at it, it came down to choosing between two loves.</p><p>It is better to break your own heart than to break your honor.</p><p>He finally understood Talon\u2019s words.</p><p>Kermilla mattered more to him than anyone he had ever known. But in the end, Dena Nehele mattered more. So he made his choice and wrote the letters that would bring the Warlord Princes to Grayhaven.</p><p>He still wanted Kermilla. Mother Night, how he wanted her! But every time he wavered, he looked at the two objects he\u2019d placed on his desk\u2014objects that reminded him of the difference between two Queens.</p><p>One was the piece from the broken wish pot.</p><p>The other was a leather-bound copy of Jared\u2019s story.</p><p>Two days later, twenty-seven Warlord Princes walked into a meeting room at Grayhaven.</p><p>This time, Theran didn\u2019t stand on a platform to address them. This time, he didn\u2019t try to stand as their leader. This time, they told him what he had to do.</p><p>Kermilla huffed andtsk ed and made unhappy sounds as she pushed dress after dress aside. Shehad to have some new clothes. When she became Queen, shecouldn\u2019t be seen in these old things!</p><p>And she wasfinally going to be Queen. The Warlord Princes had come. Theran hadn\u2019t said anything about this meeting, but she\u2019d seen the men arriving. Theran would give them a stern talking-to first, and then he\u2019d request her presence so that she could select her court. She really didn\u2019t want a First Circle made up completely of Warlord Princes\u2014they were so prickly!\u2014but she\u2019d settle for it to get the court established and then select more congenial men for her Second Circle. And once she was Queen, she could select a man with better training for her bed.</p><p>Not that she wasn\u2019t still fond of Theran, but he was better suited to being a First Escort or her Master of the Guard. He just didn\u2019t have the proper skills to be a Consort\u2014or even a lover.</p><p>So important to make the right impression this time. So important to look like what these men wanted.</p><p>But how was she supposed to do that withthese clothes?</p><p>Alone again, Theran closed his eyes and swayed as the pain raked through him.</p><p>It was done. The Warlord Princes would help him save what was left of Dena Nehele.</p><p>Now all he had to do was fulfill his part of the bargain before time ran out.</p><p>A handful of outfits were strewn on her bed and the chairs, souring Kermilla\u2019s mood as the inadequacy of her wardrobe became more and more clear. But she had to findsomething before . . .</p><p>She glanced out one of her bedroom windows, then stopped and stared at the Warlord Princes walking down the long drive toward the landing web just beyond the estate\u2019s double gates.</p><p>They were leaving? Why were theyleaving ?</p><p>She pulled on a simple housedress, stuffed her feet into soft house shoes, grabbed a shawl, and rushed downstairs to find Theran.</p><p>Theran went into his study and gave Julien a psychic tap on the shoulder. Within a minute the butler knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cLady Kermilla and I have something to discuss,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWhile she is here with me, you and Hanna need to move fast.\u201d</p><p>After receiving his instructions, Julien hurried out of the room. Moments later, Kermilla rushed in.</p><p>\u201cThey left!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy did they leave without seeing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Kermilla.\u201d Theran waved her toward a chair. \u201cI have to explain some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d She sat on the edge of the stuffed chair.</p><p>He nudged the footstool back and sat down. He didn\u2019t touch her. He didn\u2019t want her to realize he had a skintight Green shield protecting his skin, his face . . . his eyes. He felt foolish\u2014and deceitful\u2014doing that with her, but he couldn\u2019t ignore the warnings the other men had given him about how previous Queens had reacted to disappointment.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI love you, Kermilla. Everything I am wants to surrender to you. If my life was the only one at stake, I would give it to you. But I\u2019m the last of the Grayhaven line, and I have a duty to the land and the people of Dena Nehele, and what Dena Nehele needs is more important than what I want for myself as a man or a Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with the other Warlord Princes leaving before I could choose my court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a court.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla rolled her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t rule Dena Nehele without a formal court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I am so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment, but when she realized what he was saying she drew back a little.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a court,\u201d Theran said quietly, just to make sure she understood. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to rule Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she wailed. \u201cIs it because you\u2019re mad at me for breaking that old pot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, it is about the wish pot. Not because you broke it, but because all you see is an old pot that has no value to you. And what that tells me is that in all the months you\u2019ve been here, you haven\u2019t listened to anything I said about Dena Nehele. You\u2019ve haven\u2019t listened to anything I said about the people or our history or what we need from a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need the Warlord Princes,\u201d Kermilla said. \u201cI\u2019ll just fill a First Circle with Warlords and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you try to form a court here, the Warlord Princes will kill you,\u201d Theran said harshly.</p><p>The color drained from her face. \u201cTheythreatened me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen one Warlord Prince makes that kind of statement, it\u2019s a threat. When twenty-seven of them say that, it\u2019s a declaration of war.\u201d</p><p>She swayed, and he wondered if she was going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to rule Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is it can\u2019t be you. And that\u2019s why you have to leave.\u201dBefore they come back to kill you. He could feel his heart tearing into pieces.</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d She looked so young and so lost . . . and so lovely. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I stay with you? You love me. You said so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself the other day,\u201d he replied gently. \u201cYou\u2019re a Queen. If you stayed, you would want to rule. As much as I would want that for you, I would have to oppose you for the good of the people. We would destroy each other, Kermilla. And we would destroy what was left of Dena Nehele in the process.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, and he wasn\u2019t sure she understood anything.</p><p>For a moment, sly calculation filled her eyes and then was gone. But he saw it, and in that moment, he saw what the other Warlord Princes had seen in her\u2014and understood why they never would have served her.</p><p>Then the moment was gone, and she was the young woman who had dazzled him when he\u2019d first met her. She was lovely Kermilla, the Queen whose will could no longer be his life.</p><p>She leaned forward, her lips curved in a sexy smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go upstairs for a proper good-bye?\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cThat could take a day or two.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to yield. Mother Night, how he wanted to yield! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gone before sunrise\u2014or dead by tomorrow\u2019s sunset. That was all the time she had left if she stayed in Dena Nehele.

I\u2019m ready,* Julien replied.</p><p>\u201cAll your things are packed and in the Coach,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you to the Keep now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d Kermilla sprang away from him.</p> <p>He threw a Green shield around the desk, mostly to protect the wish pot and book.</p><p>Sensing the shield, she whirled toward him, her face filled with hurt and a growing rage.</p><p>\u201cI gave up everything for you!\u201d she screamed. \u201cEverything, Theran!\u201d</p><p>He wished he could still believe her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d What else was there to say? He stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>The hurt and rage disappeared. She was back to sexy pout. \u201cIcan\u2019t go to the Keep dressed likethis. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t mind.\u201d He walked over to her and reached out to take her arm.</p><p>Another change of mood. Watching her eyes, he knew the moment when she considered raking his face with her nails\u2014and knew the moment when she realized he was wearing a Green shield to prevent her from doing just that.</p><p>Taking a firm grip on her arm, he escorted her out of his family\u2019s home to the Coach waiting at the landing web.</p><p>Kermilla huddled in the passenger compartment of the Coach with no one for company but that horrid Julien, who was giving her a smothering kind of attention while Theran, who turned out to have no spine or balls at all, hid with the driver in the locked front compartment.</p><p>She had lost. Instead of ruling a Territory for a few years and being admired, she was being sent home tonothing . No court, no men, no income. Nothing. Her mother was being stingy, so if she went back to her parents\u2019 house, her father wouldn\u2019t give her anything. Besides, running back home was what old Freckledy had done, and she wasnever going to be like Cassidy in any way. Never.</p><p>But she had to do something. How long would they let her stay at the Keep? Were there any interesting men who worked there? Men who could be coaxed into helping a young, pretty Queen who had been misled by a nasty Warlord Prince whose honor was, at best, questionable?</p><p>That much decided, she settled in more comfortably, had Julien bring her a plate of food and some coffee, and spent the rest of the journey considering how to turn this loss to her advantage.</p><p>EBON ASKAVI</p> <p>Theran breathed a quiet sigh of relief when he walked out of the Coach and stepped on the landing web in one of the Keep\u2019s courtyards. He\u2019d kept away from Kermilla for the whole journey, afraid that if he stayed in that small compartment with her he would give in to her demands or his own desires.</p><p>But here at the Keep, the tug and pull of her presence faded, unable to compete with the mountain and its inhabitants.</p><p>Better that way for both of them.</p><p>He held out his left hand to her as she left the Coach. She ignored it and marched to the door. She rang the bell before he could join her, then stood there with her arms crossed and one foot tapping.</p><p>The man who opened the door had black eyes, black hair with a prominent widow\u2019s peak,white skin, and sensuous bloodred lips. Geoffrey, the Keep\u2019s historian/librarian.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d he said. \u201cPrince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m returning to Kaeleer,\u201d Kermilla said, raising her chin. \u201cPlease summon whoever opens the Gate.\u201d</p><p>Those black eyes glittered queerly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the Seneschal if the Gate is available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can itnot be available?\u201d Kermilla demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t let everyone into the Shadow Realm. However, if you wanted to go to Hell, that could be arranged easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeoffrey, why don\u2019t I handle this?\u201d</p><p>Theran trembled at the sound of the High Lord\u2019s voice.Never thought I\u2019d be glad to see him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Geoffrey asked as Saetan joined them.</p><p>\u201cBecause for some reason, you\u2019re even more pissed off with this Lady than my sons are, and I wouldn\u2019t have thought that possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I read history\u2014and have a long memory,\u201d Geoffrey replied too softly.</p><p>\u201cI, too, read history and have a long memory,\u201d Saetan replied just as softly. \u201cBut the Queen commands, Geoffrey. The Queen commands.\u201d</p><p>Tension hummed between the two men as black eyes stared into gold.</p><p>Then the tension eased and Geoffrey smiled. \u201cIn order for our guests to remain safe, she tossed your boys out of the Keep, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. It was quite entertaining\u2014and exciting\u2014to watch.\u201d</p><p>Geoffrey laughed. \u201cIn that case, High Lord, I will yield and leave our guests in your care.\u201d As he turned to leave, he added, \u201cIn whichever Realm you care to have them.\u201d</p><p>Kermilla looked like she was ready to faint, so Theran cupped a hand under one elbow to offer a little warmth and support. It was damn cold up in the mountains, but when he obeyed Saetan\u2019s subtle gesture and led Kermilla into the Keep, the outside cold couldn\u2019t compete with the freezing remnants of temper on the other side of the door.</p><p>Kermilla linked an arm through his and held on as Saetan led them deeper and higher into the mountain. When they reached the room that held the Gate, Theran gently unhooked her arm from his.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cThis is as far as I go.\u201d As far as he dared to go. \u201cMay the Darkness embrace you, Kermilla. I\u2019ll never forget you.\u201dOr stop loving you.</p><p>He stepped back, stepped out of reach.</p><p>Saetan opened the door.</p><p>*High Lord?* Theran said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in?\u201d Saetan told Kermilla. \u201cI\u2019ll join you in a moment.\u201d</p><p>She walked inside the room. Saetan closed the door and looked at him, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>Theran called in a package that was carefully wrapped in paper and sealed with wax. He held it out and waited for Saetan to take it.</p><p>\u201cFour hundred gold marks,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI\u2019d like Kermilla to have it. That\u2019s a year\u2019s income for me, and she\u2019ll probably spend it in a week, but I\u2019d like her to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give it to her yourself?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want her to think it was a payment of some kind\u2014or that she would get any more.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that she gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord? Is Kermilla going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>Saetan stared at him for a long time. \u201cLady Sabrina and her Steward are on their way to the Keep. They\u2019ll see that Kermilla gets back to Dharo safely.\u201d He looked behind Theran. \u201cThis Warlord will escort you back to the Coach and retrieve Lady Kermilla\u2019s trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing more to say, so he bowed to the High Lord of Hell and followed the servant to the Coach.</p><p>On the way back to Dena Nehele, Julien fixed him coffee and a plate of food. He didn\u2019t touch either. He sat in the passenger compartment of the Coach, breathing in Kermilla\u2019s lingering physical and psychic scents\u2014and wondered if this feeling of being torn and broken would ever go away.</p><p>After going through the Gate and arriving at the Keep in Kaeleer, Kermilla followed the High Lord to a sitting room. He\u2019d been awfully scary when she\u2019d first seen him, but hewas a handsome man. A little too old for her tastes. Older men could be soserious abouteverything. And they didn\u2019t have enough stamina to be fun. But the way he had handled that other strange man . . . Yes, he could be helpful.Very helpful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Theran didn\u2019t come with us,\u201d she said, giving him a sideways glance through her lashes. \u201cThat way we can get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>She started to link her arm through his, but when she touched his jacket, the air turned so bitingly cold it burned her skin.</p><p>He said nothing about the cold or the way she jerked away from him. When he opened the sitting room\u2019s door, she darted inside and went straight to the fireplace, hoping to warm up.</p><p>Her hands finally thawed enough to stop burning. She turned around and found him staring at her, his gold eyes glazed and sleepy.</p><p>\u201cI was ordered to give you a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was created especially for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift?\u201d That warmed her even better than the fire. She clapped her hands in delight and gave him a brilliant smile. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, raised his right hand, and pressed his fingers lightly against her chest.</p><p>At first it felt like a delicate necklace that rested on her skin in a web of fine metal. Then it meltedinto her skin, and threads of power flowed around her and through her, creating an odd flood of warmth that was there and gone.</p><p>Only moments passed before he raised his hand and stepped back to look at her.</p><p>\u201cHow appropriate,\u201d he said in a singsong croon.</p><p>She placed a hand on her chest, but she felt nothing.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said. A turn of his hand, and a large gilt-framed mirror floated in the air nearby. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>She looked. Then she screamed.</p><p>And the High Lord of Hell laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my dear. It\u2019s only an illusion spell, but it\u2019s a powerful one\u2014and unbreakable. You\u2019ll wear that face for a year and a day. Then the spell will fade gradually over the months that follow. Within two years, you\u2019ll have your own face again and, hopefully, a great deal more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kermilla wailed as she stared at a face that was even more homely than Freckledy\u2019s. Everyone would seethis when they looked at her? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tangled webs all said the same thing,\u201d the High Lord replied. \u201cIf you continue to be nothing more than a greedy little girl, you will be dead within a year. While some of us welcomed that solution to a noxious problem, the Queen decided to give you a second chance. Your pretty face was the tool you used to get what you wanted, regardless of what it cost anyone else. Now you\u2019ll have to earn what you want by proving your worth as a Queen. You\u2019re being given a chance to grow up, Lady Kermilla, instead of dying young. I hope you eventually appreciate the gift. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll meet again soon in Hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trailed after him as he walked to the sitting room\u2019s door. Then a gleam of silver caught her eye, drawing her toward one of the small tables scattered around the room. Plenty of expensive little nothings in this room. Who would notice if there were one or two less?</p><p>The silence turned heavy and cold and peculiar.</p><p>She looked at the High Lord, who studied her with those sleepy gold eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIf you steal something from the Keep, what guards this place will let you take it,\u201d he crooned. \u201cBut they will take your hand in exchange.\u201d</p><p>He walked out of the room and closed the door.</p><p>Something moved in the wall. A shadow where there shouldn\u2019t be a shadow.</p><p>Kermilla backed away from the table. Curling up in a chair, she remained there until Sabrina arrived to take her back to Dharo.</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Witch asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d the High Lord replied. \u201cWill it make a difference?\u201d</p><p>She rolled up the threads of her tangled web and dropped them in a shallow bowl of witchfire. \u201cThat\u2019s up to Kermilla now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Frustrated and heartsore, Theran sat at his desk, his head braced in his hands.</p><p>What was the point of the other Warlord Princes making him the ruler of Dena Nehele if they weren\u2019t going to work with him, weren\u2019t going to help him?</p> <p>They didn\u2019t trust him. That\u2019s what it came down to. As far as they were concerned, his bond with Kermilla had not only fouled his judgment, it had ruined the opportunities they would have had to bring in needed help for their people. And every time his efforts to restore Dena Nehele failed, he lost a little more of their conditional support.</p><p>They wanted the same things people were receiving from Cassidy\u2019s court, so he tried to approach Daemon Sadi about a loan similar to the one Gray had negotiated for Cassidy. Sadi\u2019s coldly civil reply made it clear that Theran would get no help from the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan.</p><p>He tried to contact the Queens in Kaeleer to hire Protocol instructors to teach the courts in Dena Nehele. The Queens didn\u2019t answer him at all.</p><p>He tried to talk to Cassidy, but her First Circle refused to grant him an audience. The only thing he received from that visit was an assurance from Talon that Lady Cassidy had no desire to start a war and no intention to seize any land. The Warlord Princes of Dena Nehele didn\u2019t need to worry about having Lady Cassidy for a neighbor.</p><p>No one wanted to work for him. The people in the town barely spoke to him.</p><p>And too many nights lately, he wondered if the Warlord Princes were waiting for him to fail enough for them to justify using their knives.</p><p>Julien rushed into the study without knocking and thrust an envelope into Theran\u2019s hand. \u201cYou have a visitor. Lady Rhahn from the Isle of Scelt. She said you should read the letter before you speak to her.\u201d</p><p>Theran stared at Julien. The butler looked dazed, dazzled, almost giddy with excitement.</p> <p>\u201cRead it,\u201d Julien said. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, man,read .\u201d He sprang for the door. \u201cRefreshments! I should get the Lady some refreshments!\u201d</p><p>He was gone as quickly as he\u2019d come in.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell is wrong with him?\u201d Theran muttered as he broke the black wax seal and removed the single sheet of paper.</p><p>Prince Grayhaven,</p><p>I am aware that you have become the Warlord Prince of Dena Nehele and have taken responsibility for ruling your people. I am also aware that you still need a Queen who can help your people remember Protocol and the Old Ways. Therefore, I have asked Lady Rhahn to stay with you for a year.</p><p>A second chance, Theran. If you turn away from this one, there will be no other.</p><p>Jaenelle Angelline</p><p>Theran folded the letter and vanished it.</p><p>Mother Night. Witch was giving him a second chance.</p><p>He straightened his clothes, ran his fingers through his hair in an effort to tidy it, and sprang to the study door much as Julien had. Then he paused. Would the Warlord Princes accept another Queen from Kaeleer if she was associated with him? Could they ever trust her with the well-being of their people?</p><p>He opened the study door.</p><p>The answer to those questions looked up at him and wagged her tail.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely wedding, Daughter.\u201d Devra lifted Cassidy\u2019s left hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is a beautiful ring.\u201d</p><p>A lovely, dizzy warmth spread through Cassidy. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Not just the amber ring\u2019s design, but what the ring stood for. Something she knew her mother understood.</p><p>She looked at the people milling around the backyard of the Residence and was glad her First Circle had declared the sitting area under the tree to be the Queen\u2019s private spot\u2014a place to catch her breath and a moment\u2019s quiet before talking to the next group of well-wishers.</p><p>\u201cThis was supposed to be a small wedding,\u201d she said as she caught sight of her cousin Aaron and his wife Kalush talking with Ranon, Shira, Reyhana, and Janos.</p><p>Devra chuckled. \u201cI imagine it is for a Territory Queen. You managed to limit the guest list to two Warlord Princes and two Queens from each of your Provinces, plus the elders and Tradition Keepers in Eyota, plus your court, family and personal friends. And everyone you invited accepted the invitation.\u201d</p><p>Except Theran.A small nugget of sorrow because of his rejection, but not for herself. Not anymore. Not when her life with Gray would be so full of dreams and challenges and work and love. Most of all, love.</p><p>Her eyes skipped over the crowd, searching for Gray. She found him talking with her father, and there was something in the way they were gesturing . . .</p><p>Devra sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t put those two anywhere near each other before they start talking about work and new projects. I\u2019ll just go over and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Cassidy murmured, feeling laughter bubble up as she watched Lucivar Yaslana and her cousin Aaron deftly separate her father and husband, herding them in opposite directions. \u201cI wonder. Did Scelties learn to play cows and sheep from Warlord Princes or did Warlord Princes learn from the Scelties?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she and Devra slipped arms around each other\u2019s waists and went out to meet the next group of well-wishers.</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven and Lady Rhahn have arrived,\u201d Dryden said quietly. \u201cHe asked to see you. I put them in the visitor\u2019s parlor.\u201d</p><p>Gray felt the bright joy of his wedding day fade. Cassie had insisted on sending Theran an invitation to the wedding. He was family, and their wedding was about friends and family, and not about courts and boundaries. So he\u2014and the rest of her court\u2014had yielded to her wishes, but no one had been disappointed that Theran hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>He looked over to where Cassie was talking and laughing with a group of women, including Lucivar\u2019s wife, Marian.</p><p>\u201cLet him wait,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Lucivar chuckled. \u201cGrayhaven can wait until the sun shines in Hell, but Lady Rhahn is a Green-Jeweled Queen. Trust me, boyo. You do not want to keep her waiting.\u201d</p><p>The sharp warning in Lucivar\u2019s eyes had Gray chaining his temper before Ranon or any of the others caught a scent of it. He wasn\u2019t going to spoil this day for any of them, especially Cassie.</p><p>\u201cGo meet her before you say or do something stupid,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>Gray handed his glass of sparkling wine to Lucivar. \u201cHere. That way I won\u2019t be tempted to throw it in her face.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s roar of laughter wasn\u2019t the reaction he expected, so he slipped into the Residence, more curious now than angry.</p><p>Then he stepped into the visitors\u2019 parlor.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. The Green-Jeweled Queen was aSceltie?</p><p>\u201cHello, Gray,\u201d Theran said, sounding uncertain. \u201cMay I introduce Lady Rhahn from the Isle of Scelt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored by the introduction,\u201d Gray replied, bowing as he would to any Queen.</p><p>\u201cLady, this is my cousin Prince Jared Blaed.\u201d</p><p>Rhahn wagged her tail. *You are called Gray. You are Cassie\u2019s mate now. Are you going to have puppies?*</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Was there a safe answer? He sent a psychic spear thread toward Lucivar. *You could have warned me.*</p><p>*Boyo, you have no idea yet. My darling sister sometimes has a wicked sense of justice.*</p><p>*Jaenellesent Rhahn to Dena Nehele?*</p><p>*Who else?*</p><p>Aware of the silence in the room, Gray looked into Rhahn\u2019s brown eyes and had a sudden urge to hide in the nearest clump of brambles.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201care you the Queen of Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>*No. Theran rules Dena Nehele, and I rule Theran.*</p><p>A Sceltie Queen ruling a territory made up of one Warlord Prince who didn\u2019t outrank her. No wonder Theran looked like he\u2019d gotten a hard whack upside the head.</p><p>May the Darkness have mercy on him.</p><p>*Rhahn!* Vae bounded into the room, dancing with delight. *You are here!*</p><p>Theran looked at Vae and turned a little green.</p><p>Gray took a step toward the door. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d A dumb question when the answer was so obvious.</p><p>He took another step toward the door.</p><p>*Rhahn is . . . * Vae appeared to be thinking hard. *Mother\u2019s sister.*</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Theran squeaked.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt?\u201d Gray felt something tickling inside his belly and throat. Might have been laughter. More likely, hysteria. \u201cRhahn is your aunt?\u201d</p><p>*Yes,* Rhahn said. *Aunt. Vae will introduce me to the Queen. Then we will play.* She looked at Theran and growled. *This is a happy day. You will behave and not fight with the Queen\u2019s males.*</p><p>The Scelties trotted out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the \u2018or else\u2019?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to say it; I heard it loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>Theran hunched his shoulders. \u201cWith Rhahn, \u2018bite him in the balls\u2019 isn\u2019t just an expression.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t kind to laugh, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cIs she as bossy as Vae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twice as bad.\u201d Theran shook his head. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Gray, when the Warlord Princes heard another Queen from Kaeleer was staying at Grayhaven, they came charging in, ready to fight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know what to do with her, did they?\u201dHe looks so confused and beaten, Gray thought, feeling sympathy for his cousin Theran even if he still felt wary of Prince Grayhaven.</p><p>\u201cThere she was, looking all furry and friendly, and before they realizedwhat she was, she was charging around, issuing orders and herding them where she wanted them to go, and they just trotted along with her, as docile as lambs.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Gray thought. Why would they oppose someone who expected them to take care of their flocks and had connections to Cassie\u2019s court as well as strong courts in Kaeleer? Theran might be the Warlord Prince of Dena Nehele and the ruler in public, but the court that truly ruled Dena Nehele would form around Rhahn.</p> <p>You wanted a powerful Queen who would dazzle the Warlord Princes enough to serve,Gray thought.Looks like you finally got her.</p><p>Lucivar was right. Jaenelledid have a wicked sense of justice.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the invitation, Gray,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>You didn\u2019t get here in time for the wedding.Cassie would have been sad about that if she\u2019d known, but Theran\u2019s absence hadn\u2019t been obvious. Noted by the First Circle, since they\u2019d all been on the lookout for him, but not obvious. The village was packed with personal guests and representatives from every Province and reserve, and trying to pick out a particular psychic scent among so many had been damn near impossible, especially after Lucivar and Marian arrived to represent the SaDiablo family as well as Cassie\u2019s other friends in Kaeleer.</p><p>\u201cI figured my presence would piss off Cassidy\u2019s First Circle, and I didn\u2019t want to spoil the day. But Rhahn insisted that we come for part of the celebration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d Gray said\u2014and realized he meant it. He\u2019d missed his cousin.</p><p>\u201cI brought this.\u201d Theran called in a small box and held it out. \u201cA token for Cassidy. It\u2019s a piece of Lia\u2019s jewelry. I thought she might like to have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she would.\u201d Gray didn\u2019t take the box. Instead, he put an arm around Theran\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou should give it to her yourself.\u201d</p><p>He guided Theran out the front door since Maydra had gotten snarly about people coming through the kitchen and snitching food from the platters before she got them set out.</p><p>As they rounded the corner, heading for the backyard and the guests, they heard Rhahn say, *Theran is not a bad human. He is just male and foolish. And confused.*</p><p>*Yes,* Vae agreed. *He needs you.*</p> <p>Gray looked at Theran. Theran looked at Gray.</p><p>\u201cMother Night, Theran,\u201d Gray whispered. \u201cYou are in so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>When the two men reached the backyard, Cassie, Lucivar, and all the others saw Jared Blaed and Theran Grayhaven holding on to each other, laughing. </p> </body></html>"]
