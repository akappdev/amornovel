There\u2019s the notion of being all powerful\u2014because nothing can stand against time, can it? Not mountains, not armies.</p><p>And time is, of course, all-healing. Give anything enough time, and everything is taken care of: all pain encompassed, all hardship erased, all loss subsumed.</p> <p>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Remember, man, that thou art dust; and unto dust thou shalt return.</p><p>And if Time is anything akin to God, I suppose that Memory must be the Devil.</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Rumors of War</p><p>1</p> <p>AN INTERRUPTED</p><p>CONVERSATION</p><p>THE DOG SENSED THEM FIRST. Dark as it was, Ian Murray felt rather than saw Rollo\u2019s head lift suddenly near his thigh, ears pricking. He put a hand on the dog\u2019s neck, and felt the hair there ridged with warning.</p><p>So attuned as they were to each other, he did not even think consciously, \u201cMen,\u201d but put his other hand to his knife and lay still, breathing. Listening.</p><p>The forest was quiet. It was hours \u2019til dawn and the air was still as that in a church, with a mist like incense rising slowly up from the ground. He had lain down to rest on the fallen trunk of a giant tulip tree, preferring the tickle of wood-lice to seeping damp. He kept his hand on the dog, waiting.</p><p>Rollo was growling, a low, constant rumble that Ian could barely hear but felt easily, the vibration of it traveling up his arm, arousing all the nerves of his body. He hadn\u2019t been asleep\u2014he rarely slept at night anymore\u2014but had been quiet, looking up into the vault of the sky, engrossed in his usual argument with God. Quietness had vanished with Rollo\u2019s movement. He sat up slowly, swinging his legs over the side of the half-rotted log, heart beating fast now.</p> <p>Rollo\u2019s warning hadn\u2019t changed, but the great head swiveled, following something unseen. It was a moonless night; Ian could see the faint silhouettes of trees and the moving shadows of the night, but nothing more.</p><p>Then he heard them. Sounds of passage. A good distance away, but coming nearer by the moment. He stood and stepped softly into the pool of black under a balsam fir. A click of the tongue, and Rollo left off his growling and followed, silent as the wolf who had been his father.</p><p>Ian\u2019s resting-place overlooked a game trail. The men who followed it were not hunting.</p><p>White men. Now that was odd, and more than odd. He couldn\u2019t see them, but didn\u2019t need to; the noise they made was unmistakable. Indians traveling were not silent, and many of the Highlanders he lived among could move like ghosts in the wood\u2014but he had no doubt whatever. Metal, that was it. He was hearing the jingle of harness, the clink of buttons and buckles\u2014and gun barrels.</p><p>A lot of them. So close, he began to smell them. He leaned forward a little, eyes closed, the better to snuff up what clue he could.</p><p>They carried pelts; now he picked up the dried-blood cold-fur smell that had probably waked Rollo\u2014but not trappers, surely; too many. Trappers moved in ones and twos.</p><p>Poor men, and dirty. Not trappers, and not hunters. Game was easy to come by at this season, but they smelled of hunger. And the sweat of bad drink.</p><p>Close by now, perhaps ten feet from the place where he stood. Rollo made a tiny snorting sound, and Ian closed his hand once more on the dog\u2019s ruff, but the men made too much noise to hear it. He counted the passing footsteps, the bumping of canteens and bullet boxes, foot-sore grunts and sighs of weariness.</p> <p>Twenty-three men, he made it, and there was a mule\u2014no, two mules with them; he could hear the creak of laden panniers and that querulous heavy breathing, the way a loaded mule did, always on the verge of complaint.</p><p>The men would never have detected them, but some freak of the air bore Rollo\u2019s scent to the mules. A deafening bray shattered the dark, and the forest erupted in front of him with a clishmaclaver of crashing and startled shouts. Ian was already running when pistol shots crashed behind him.</p><p>\u201cA Dhia!\u201d Something struck him in the head and he fell headlong. Was he killed?</p><p>No. Rollo was pushing a worried wet nose into his ear. His head buzzed like a hive and he saw bright flashes of light before his eyes.</p><p>\u201cRun! Ruith!\u201d he gasped, pushing at the dog. \u201cRun out! Go!\u201d The dog hesitated, whining deep in his throat. He couldn\u2019t see, but felt the big body lunge and turn, turn back, undecided.</p><p>\u201cRuith!\u201d He got himself up onto hands and knees, urging, and the dog at last obeyed, running as he had been trained.</p><p>There was no time to run himself, even could he have gained his feet. He fell facedown, thrust hands and feet deep into the leaf mold, and wriggled madly, burrowing in.</p><p>A foot struck between his shoulder blades, but the breath it drove out of him was muffled in wet leaves. It didn\u2019t matter, they were making so much noise. Whoever had stepped on him didn\u2019t notice; it was a glancing blow as the man ran over him in panic, doubtless thinking him a rotted log.</p><p>The shooting ceased. The shouting didn\u2019t, but he made no sense of it. He knew he was lying flat on his face, cold damp on his cheeks and the tang of dead leaves in his nose\u2014but felt as though very drunk, the world revolving slowly round him. His head didn\u2019t hurt much, past the first burst of pain, but he didn\u2019t seem able to lift it.</p><p>He had the dim thought that if he died here, no one would know. His mother would mind, he thought, not knowing what had become of him.</p><p>The noises grew fainter, more orderly. Someone was still bellowing, but it had the sound of command. They were leaving. It occurred to him dimly that he might call out. If they knew he was white, they might help him. And they might not.</p><p>He kept quiet. Either he was dying or he wasn\u2019t. If he was, no help was possible. If he wasn\u2019t, none was needed.</p><p>Well, I asked then, didn\u2019t I? he thought, resuming his conversation with God, calm as though he lay still on the trunk of the tulip tree, looking up into the depths of heaven above. A sign, I said. I didna quite expect Ye to be so prompt about it, though.</p><p>2</p><p>DUTCH CABIN</p><p>March 1773</p><p>NO ONE HAD KNOWN the cabin was there, until Kenny Lindsay had seen the flames, on his way up the creek.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna ha\u2019 seen at all,\u201d he said, for perhaps the sixth time. \u201cSave for the dark comin\u2019 on. Had it been daylight, I\u2019d never ha\u2019 kent it, never.\u201d He wiped a trembling hand over his face, unable to take his eyes off the line of bodies that lay at the edge of the forest. \u201cWas it savages, Mac Dubh? They\u2019re no scalped, but maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie laid the soot-smeared handkerchief gently back over the staring blue face of a small girl. \u201cNone of them is wounded. Surely ye saw as much when ye brought them out?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay shook his head, eyes closed, and shivered convulsively. It was late afternoon, and a chilly spring day, but the men were all sweating.</p><p>\u201cI didna look,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>My own hands were like ice; as numb and unfeeling as the rubbery flesh of the dead woman I was examining. They had been dead for more than a day; the rigor of death had passed off, leaving them limp and chilled, but the cold weather of the mountain spring had preserved them so far from the grosser indignities of putrefaction.</p><p>Still, I breathed shallowly; the air was bitter with the scent of burning. Wisps of steam rose now and then from the charred ruin of the tiny cabin. From the corner of my eye, I saw Roger kick at a nearby log, then bend and pick up something from the ground beneath.</p><p>Kenny had pounded on our door long before daylight, summoning us from warm beds. We had come in haste, even knowing that we were far too late to offer aid. Some of the tenants from the homesteads on Fraser\u2019s Ridge had come, too; Kenny\u2019s brother Evan stood with Fergus and Ronnie Sinclair in a small knot under the trees, talking together in low-voiced Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken what did for them, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie squatted beside me, face troubled. \u201cThe ones under the trees, that is.\u201d He nodded at the corpse in front of me. \u201cI ken what killed this puir woman.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s long skirt stirred in the wind, lifting to show long, slender feet shod in leather clogs. A pair of long hands to match lay still at her sides. She had been tall\u2014though not so tall as Brianna, I thought, and looked automatically for my daughter\u2019s bright hair, bobbing among the branches on the far side of the clearing.</p><p>I had turned the woman\u2019s apron up to cover her head and upper body. Her hands were red, rough-knuckled with work, and with callused palms, but from the firmness of her thighs and the slenderness of her body, I thought she was no more than thirty\u2014likely much younger. No one could say whether she had been pretty.</p><p>I shook my head at his remark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she died of the burning,\u201d I said. \u201cSee, her legs and feet aren\u2019t touched. She must have fallen into the hearth. Her hair caught fire, and it spread to the shoulders of her gown. She must have lain near enough to the wall or the chimney hood for the flames to touch; that caught, and then the whole bloody place went up.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded slowly, eyes on the dead woman.</p><p>\u201cAye, that makes sense. But what was it killed them, Sassenach? The others are singed a bit, though none are burned like this. But they must have been dead before the cabin caught alight, for none o\u2019 them ran out. Was it a deadly illness, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Let me look at the others again.\u201d</p><p>I walked slowly down the row of still bodies with their cloth-covered faces, stooping over each one to peer again beneath the makeshift shrouds. There were any number of illnesses that could be quickly fatal in these days\u2014with no antibiotics to hand, and no way of administering fluids save by mouth or rectum, a simple case of diarrhea could kill within twenty-four hours.</p><p>I saw such things often enough to recognize them easily; any doctor does, and I had been a doctor for more than twenty years. I saw things now and then in this century that I had never encountered in my own\u2014particularly horrible parasitical diseases, brought with the slave trade from the tropics\u2014but it was no parasite that had done for these poor souls, and no illness that I knew, to leave such traces on its victims.</p><p>All the bodies\u2014the burned woman, a much older woman, and three children\u2014had been found inside the walls of the flaming house. Kenny had pulled them out, just before the roof fell in, then ridden for help. All dead before the fire started; all dead virtually at the same time, then, for surely the fire had begun to smolder soon after the woman fell dead on her hearth?</p><p>The victims had been laid out neatly under the branches of a giant red spruce, while the men began to dig a grave nearby. Brianna stood by the smallest girl, her head bent. I came to kneel by the little body, and she knelt down across from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cPoison?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI think so. What gave you that idea?\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the blue-tinged face below us. She had tried to close the eyes, but they bulged beneath the lids, giving the little girl a look of startled horror. The small, blunt features were twisted in a rictus of agony, and there were traces of vomit in the corners of the mouth.</p><p>\u201cGirl Scout handbook,\u201d Brianna said. She glanced at the men, but no one was near enough to hear. Her mouth twitched, and she looked away from the body, holding out her open hand. \u201cNever eat any strange mushroom,\u201d she quoted. \u201cThere are many poisonous varieties, and distinguishing one from another is a job for an expert. Roger found these, growing in a ring by that log over there.\u201d</p><p>Moist, fleshy caps, a pale brown with white warty spots, the open gills and slender stems so pale as to look almost phosphorescent in the spruce shadows. They had a pleasant, earthy look to them that belied their deadliness.</p><p>\u201cPanther toadstools,\u201d I said, half to myself, and picked one gingerly from her palm. \u201cAgaricus pantherinus\u2014or that\u2019s what they will be called, once somebody gets round to naming them properly. Pantherinus, because they kill so swiftly\u2014like a striking cat.\u201d</p><p>I could see the gooseflesh ripple on Brianna\u2019s forearm, raising the soft, red-gold hairs. She tilted her hand and spilled the rest of the deadly fungus on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWho in their right mind would eat toadstools?\u201d she asked, wiping her hand on her skirt with a slight shudder.</p><p>\u201cPeople who didn\u2019t know better. People who were hungry, perhaps,\u201d I answered softly. I picked up the little girl\u2019s hand, and traced the delicate bones of the forearm. The small belly showed signs of bloat, whether from malnutrition or postmortem changes I couldn\u2019t tell\u2014but the collarbones were sharp as scythe blades. All of the bodies were thin, though not to the point of emaciation.</p><p>I looked up, into the deep blue shadows of the mountainside above the cabin. It was early in the year for foraging, but there was food in abundance in the forest\u2014for those who could recognize it.</p><p>Jamie came and knelt down beside me, a big hand lightly on my back. Cold as it was, a trickle of sweat streaked his neck, and his thick auburn hair was dark at the temples.</p><p>\u201cThe grave is ready,\u201d he said, speaking low, as though he might alarm the child. \u201cIs that what\u2019s killed the bairn?\u201d He nodded at the scattered fungi.</p><p>\u201cI think so\u2014and the rest of them, too. Have you had a look around? Does anyone know who they were?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot English; the clothes are wrong. Germans would have gone to Salem, surely; they\u2019re clannish souls, and no inclined to settle on their own. These were maybe Dutchmen.\u201d He nodded toward the carved wooden clogs on the old woman\u2019s feet, cracked and stained with long use. \u201cNo books nor writing left, if there was any to begin with. Nothing that might tell their name. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hadn\u2019t been here long.\u201d A low, cracked voice made me look up. Roger had come; he squatted next to Brianna, nodding toward the smoldering remains of the cabin. A small garden plot had been scratched into the earth nearby, but the few plants showing were no more than sprouts, the tender leaves limp and blackened with late frost. There were no sheds, no sign of livestock, no mule or pig.</p><p>\u201cNew emigrants,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cNot bond servants; this was a family. They weren\u2019t used to outdoor labor, either; the women\u2019s hands have blisters and fresh scars.\u201d His own broad hand rubbed unconsciously over a homespun knee; his palms were as smoothly callused as Jamie\u2019s now, but he had once been a tender-skinned scholar; he remembered the pain of his seasoning.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if they left people behind\u2014in Europe,\u201d Brianna murmured. She smoothed blond hair off the little girl\u2019s forehead, and laid the kerchief back over her face. I saw her throat move as she swallowed. \u201cThey\u2019ll never know what happened to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie stood abruptly. \u201cThey do say that God protects fools\u2014but I think even the Almighty will lose patience now and then.\u201d He turned away, motioning to Lindsay and Sinclair.</p><p>\u201cLook for the man,\u201d he said to Lindsay. Every head jerked up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cMan?\u201d Roger said, and then glanced sharply at the burned remnants of the cabin, realization dawning. \u201cAye\u2014who built the cabin for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women could have done it,\u201d Bree said, lifting her chin.</p><p>\u201cYou could, aye,\u201d he said, mouth twitching slightly as he cast a sidelong look at his wife. Brianna resembled Jamie in more than coloring; she stood six feet in her stockings and had her father\u2019s clean-limbed strength.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they could, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d Jamie said shortly. He nodded toward the shell of the cabin, where a few bits of furniture still held their fragile shapes. As I watched, the evening wind came down, scouring the ruin, and the shadow of a stool collapsed noiselessly into ash, flurries of soot and char moving ghostlike over the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I stood and moved beside him, looking into the house. There was virtually nothing left inside, though the chimney stack still stood, and jagged bits of the walls remained, their logs fallen like jackstraws.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no metal,\u201d he said, nodding at the blackened hearth, where the remnants of a cauldron lay, cracked in two from the heat, its contents vaporized. \u201cNo pots, save that\u2014and that\u2019s too heavy to carry away. Nay tools. Not a knife, not an ax\u2014and ye see whoever built it had that.\u201d</p><p>I did; the logs were unpeeled, but the notches and ends bore the clear marks of an ax.</p><p>Frowning, Roger picked up a long pine branch and began to poke through the piles of ash and rubble, looking to be sure. Kenny Lindsay and Sinclair didn\u2019t bother; Jamie had told them to look for a man, and they promptly went to do so, disappearing into the forest. Fergus went with them; Evan Lindsay, his brother Murdo, and the McGillivrays began the chore of collecting stones for a cairn.</p><p>\u201cIf there was a man\u2014did he leave them?\u201d Brianna murmured to me, glancing from her father to the row of bodies. \u201cDid this woman maybe think they wouldn\u2019t survive on their own?\u201d</p><p>And thus take her own life, and those of her children, to avoid a long-drawn-out death from cold and starvation?</p><p>\u201cLeave them and take all their tools? God, I hope not.\u201d I crossed myself at the thought, though even as I did so, I doubted it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t they have walked out, looking for help? Even with children . . . the snow\u2019s mostly gone.\u201d Only the highest mountain passes were still packed with snow, and while the trails and slopes were wet and muddy with runoff, they\u2019d been passable for a month, at least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found the man,\u201d Roger said, interrupting my thoughts. He spoke very calmly, but paused to clear his throat. \u201cJust\u2014just here.\u201d</p><p>The daylight was beginning to fade, but I could see that he had gone pale. No wonder; the curled form he had unearthed beneath the charred timbers of a fallen wall was sufficiently gruesome as to give anyone pause. Charred to blackness, hands upraised in the boxer\u2019s pose so common to those dead by fire, it was difficult even to be sure that it was a man\u2014though I thought it was, from what I could see.</p><p>Speculation about this new body was interrupted by a shout from the forest\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found them, milord!\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked up from contemplation of this new corpse, to see Fergus waving from the edge of the wood.</p><p>\u201cThem,\u201d indeed. Two men, this time. Sprawled on the ground within the shadow of the trees, found not together, but not far apart, only a short distance from the house. And both, so far as I could tell, probably dead of mushroom poisoning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no Dutchman,\u201d Sinclair said, for probably the fourth time, shaking his head over one body.</p><p>\u201cHe might be,\u201d said Fergus dubiously. He scratched his nose with the tip of the hook he wore in replacement of his left hand. \u201cFrom the Indies, non?\u201d</p><p>One of the unknown bodies was in fact that of a black man. The other was white, and both wore nondescript clothes of worn homespun\u2014shirts and breeches; no jackets, despite the cold weather. And both were barefoot.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie shook his head, rubbing one hand unconsciously on his own breeches, as though to rid himself of the touch of the dead. \u201cThe Dutch keep slaves on Barbuda, aye\u2014but these are better fed than the folk from the cabin.\u201d He lifted his chin toward the silent row of women and children. \u201cThey didna live here. Besides . . .\u201d I saw his eyes fix on the dead men\u2019s feet.</p><p>The feet were grubby about the ankles and heavily callused, but basically clean. The soles of the black man\u2019s feet showed yellowish pink, with no smears of mud or random leaves stuck between the toes. These men hadn\u2019t been walking through the muddy forest barefoot, that much was sure.</p><p>\u201cSo there were perhaps more men? And when these died, their companions took their shoes\u2014and anything else of value\u201d\u2014Fergus added practically, gesturing from the burned cabin to the stripped bodies\u2014\u201cand fled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe.\u201d Jamie pursed his lips, his gaze traveling slowly over the earth of the yard\u2014but the ground was churned with footsteps, clumps of grass uprooted and the whole of the yard dusted with ash and bits of charred wood. It looked as though the place had been ravaged by rampaging hippopotami.</p><p>\u201cI could wish that Young Ian was here. He\u2019s the best of the trackers; he could maybe tell what happened there, at least.\u201d He nodded into the wood, where the men had been found. \u201cHow many there were, maybe, and which way they\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>Jamie himself was no mean tracker. But the light was going fast now; even in the clearing where the burned cabin stood, the dark was rising, pooling under the trees, creeping like oil across the shattered earth.</p><p>His eyes went to the horizon, where streamers of cloud were beginning to blaze with gold and pink as the sun set behind them, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBury them. Then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>One more grim discovery remained. Alone among the dead, the burned man had not died of fire or poison. When they lifted the charred corpse from the ashes to bear him to his grave, something fell free of the body, landing with a small, heavy thunk on the ground. Brianna picked it up, and rubbed at it with the corner of her apron.</p><p>\u201cI guess they overlooked this,\u201d she said a little bleakly, holding it out. It was a knife, or the blade of one. The wooden hilt had burned entirely away, and the blade itself was warped with heat.</p><p>Steeling myself against the thick, acrid stench of burned fat and flesh, I bent over the corpse, poking gingerly at the midsection. Fire destroys a great deal, but preserves the strangest things. The triangular wound was quite clear, seared in the hollow beneath his ribs.</p><p>\u201cThey stabbed him,\u201d I said, and wiped my sweating hands on my own apron.</p><p>\u201cThey killed him,\u201d Bree said, watching my face. \u201cAnd then his wife\u2014\u201d She glanced at the young woman on the ground, the concealing apron over her head. \u201cShe made a stew with the mushrooms, and they all ate it. The children, too.\u201d</p><p>The clearing was silent, save for the distant calls of birds on the mountain. I could hear my own heart, beating painfully in my chest. Vengeance? Or simple despair?</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe,\u201d Jamie said quietly. He stooped to pick up an end of the sheet of canvas they had placed the dead man on. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it accident.\u201d</p><p>The Dutchman and his family were laid in one grave, the two strangers in another.</p><p>A cold wind had sprung up as the sun went down; the apron fluttered away from the woman\u2019s face as they lifted her. Sinclair gave a strangled cry of shock, and nearly dropped her.</p><p>She had neither face nor hair anymore; the slender waist narrowed abruptly into charred ruin. The flesh of her head had burned away completely, leaving an oddly tiny, blackened skull, from which her teeth grinned in disconcerting levity.</p><p>They lowered her hastily into the shallow grave, her children and mother beside her, and left Brianna and me to build a small cairn over them, in the ancient Scottish way, to mark the place and provide protection from wild beasts, while a more rudimentary resting place was dug for the two barefoot men.</p><p>The work finally done, everyone gathered, white-faced and silent, around the new-made mounds. I saw Roger stand close beside Brianna, his arm protectively about her waist. A small shudder went through her, which I thought had nothing to do with the cold. Their child, Jemmy, was a year or so younger than the smallest girl.</p><p>\u201cWill ye speak a word, Mac Dubh?\u201d Kenny Lindsay glanced inquiringly at Jamie, pulling his knitted bonnet down over his ears against the growing chill.</p><p>It was nearly nightfall, and no one wanted to linger. We would have to make camp, somewhere well away from the stink of burning, and that would be hard enough, in the dark. But Kenny was right; we couldn\u2019t leave without at least some token of ceremony, some farewell for the strangers.</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, let Roger Mac speak. If these were Dutchmen, belike they were Protestant.\u201d</p><p>Dim as the light was, I saw the sharp glance Brianna shot at her father. It was true that Roger was a Presbyterian; so was Tom Christie, a much older man whose dour face reflected his opinion of the proceedings. The question of religion was no more than a pretext, though, and everyone knew it, including Roger.</p><p>Roger cleared his throat with a noise like tearing calico. It was always a painful sound; there was anger in it now as well. He didn\u2019t protest, though, and he met Jamie\u2019s eyes straight on, as he took his place at the head of the grave.</p><p>I had thought he would simply say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, or perhaps one of the gentler psalms. Other words came to him, though.</p><p>\u201cBehold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and He hath set darkness in my paths.\u201d</p><p>His voice had once been powerful, and beautiful. It was choked now, no more than a rasping shadow of its former beauty\u2014but there was sufficient power in the passion with which he spoke to make all those who heard him bow their heads, faces lost in shadow.</p><p>\u201cHe hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath He removed like a tree.\u201d His face was set, but his eyes rested for a bleak moment on the charred stump that had served the Dutch family for a chopping block.</p><p>\u201cHe hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.\u201d I saw the three Lindsay brothers exchange glances, and everyone drew a little closer together, against the rising wind.</p><p>\u201cHave pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends,\u201d he said, and his voice softened, so that it was difficult to hear him, above the sighing of the trees. \u201cFor the hand of God has touched me.\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a slight movement beside him, and he cleared his throat once more, explosively, stretching his neck so that I caught a glimpse of the rope scar that marred it.</p><p>\u201cOh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever!\u201d</p><p>He looked slowly round from face to face, his own expressionless, then took a deep breath to continue, voice cracking on the words.</p><p>\u201cFor I know that my redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body\u201d\u2014Brianna shuddered convulsively, and looked away from the raw mound of dirt\u2014\u201cyet in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, and there was a brief collective sigh, as everyone let out the breath they had been holding. He wasn\u2019t quite finished, though. He had reached out, half-unconsciously, for Bree\u2019s hand, and held it tightly. He spoke the last words almost to himself, I thought, with little thought for his listeners.</p><p>\u201cBe ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, and Jamie\u2019s hand curled round my own, cold but strong. He looked down at me, and I met his eyes. I knew what he was thinking.</p><p>He was thinking, as I was, not of the present, but the future. Of a small item that would appear three years hence, in the pages of the Wilmington Gazette, dated February 13, 1776.</p><p>It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house in the settlement of Fraser\u2019s Ridge, on the night of January 21 last. Mr. Fraser, a nephew of the late Hector Cameron of River Run Plantation, was born at Broch Tuarach in Scotland. He was widely known in the Colony and deeply respected; he leaves no surviving children.</p><p>It had been easy, so far, not to think too much of it. So far in the future, and surely not an unchangeable future\u2014after all, forewarned was forearmed . . . wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>I glanced at the shallow cairn, and a deeper chill passed through me. I stepped closer to Jamie, and put my other hand on his arm. He covered my hand with his, and squeezed tight in reassurance. No, he said to me silently. No, I will not let it happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we left the desolate clearing, though, I could not free my mind of one vivid image. Not the burned cabin, the pitiful bodies, the pathetic dead garden. The image that haunted me was one I had seen some years before\u2014a gravestone in the ruins of Beauly Priory, high in the Scottish Highlands.</p><p>It was the tomb of a noble lady, her name surmounted by the carving of a grinning skull\u2014very like the one beneath the Dutchwoman\u2019s apron. Beneath the skull was her motto:</p><p>Hodie mihi cras tibi\u2014sic transit gloria mundi.</p><p>My turn today\u2014yours tomorrow. Thus passes the glory of the world.</p> <p>3</p><p>KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE</p><p>WE RETURNED TO FRASER\u2019S RIDGE just before sunset the next day, to discover a visitor waiting. Major Donald MacDonald, late of His Majesty\u2019s army, and even more lately of Governor Tryon\u2019s personal light-horse guard, was sitting on the front stoop, my cat in his lap and a jug of beer beside him.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! Your servant, mum,\u201d he called genially, seeing me approach. He tried to stand up, but then let out a gasp as Adso, objecting to the loss of his cozy nest, dug his claws into the Major\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cDo sit, Major,\u201d I said, waving him hastily back. He subsided with a grimace, but nobly refrained from flinging Adso into the bushes. I came up onto the stoop beside him and sat down, sighing with relief.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband is just seeing to the horses; he\u2019ll be down directly. I see that someone\u2019s made you welcome?\u201d I nodded at the beer, which he promptly offered to me with a courtly gesture, wiping the neck of the jug on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, mum,\u201d he assured me. \u201cMrs. Bug has been most assiduous of my welfare.\u201d</p><p>Not to seem uncordial, I accepted the beer, which in all truth went down very well. Jamie had been anxious to get back, and we\u2019d been in the saddle since dawn, with only a brief break for refreshment at midday.</p><p>\u201cIt is a most excellent brew,\u201d the Major said, smiling as I exhaled after swallowing, my eyes half-closing. \u201cYour own making, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and took another swallow, before handing the jug back to him. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Lizzie\u2019s. Lizzie Wemyss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your bondmaid; yes, of course. Will you give her my compliments?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she here?\u201d I glanced toward the open door behind him, rather surprised. At this time of day, I would have expected Lizzie to be in the kitchen, making supper, but she would surely have heard our arrival and come out. There was no smell of cooking, now that I noticed. She wouldn\u2019t have known when to expect us, of course, but . . .</p><p>\u201cMm, no. She is . . .\u201d The Major knitted his brows in the effort of recall, and I wondered how full the jug had been before he got at it; there were no more than a couple of inches left now. \u201cAh, yes. She went to the McGillivrays\u2019 with her father, Mrs. Bug said. To visit her affianced, I believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s engaged to Manfred McGillivray. But Mrs. Bug\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is in the springhoose,\u201d he said, with a nod up the hill toward the small shed. \u201cA matter of cheese, I believe she said. An omelette was most graciously proposed for my supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d I relaxed a bit more, the dust of the ride settling with the beer. It was wonderful to come home, though my sense of peace was uneasy, tainted by the memory of the burned cabin.</p><p>I supposed that Mrs. Bug would have told him our errand, but he made no reference to it\u2014nor to whatever had brought him up to the Ridge. Naturally not; all business would wait appropriately for Jamie. Being female, I would get impeccable courtesy and small bits of social gossip in the meantime.</p><p>I could do social gossip, but needed to be prepared for it; I hadn\u2019t a natural knack.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . Your relations with my cat seem somewhat improved,\u201d I hazarded. I glanced involuntarily at his head, but his wig had been expertly mended.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an accepted principle of politics, I believe,\u201d he said, ruffling his fingers through the thick silver fur on Adso\u2019s belly. \u201cKeep your friends close\u2014but your enemies closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sound,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cEr . . . I hope you haven\u2019t been waiting long?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, intimating that any wait was irrelevant\u2014which it generally was. The mountains had their own time, and a wise man did not try to hurry them. MacDonald was a seasoned soldier, and well-traveled\u2014but he had been born in Pitlochry, close enough to the Highland peaks to know their ways.</p><p>\u201cI came this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom New Bern.\u201d</p><p>Small warning bells went off in the back of my mind. It would have taken him a good ten days to travel from New Bern, if he had come directly\u2014and the state of his creased and mud-stained uniform suggested that he had.</p><p>New Bern was where the new royal governor of the colony, Josiah Martin, had taken up his residence. And for MacDonald to have said, \u201cFrom New Bern,\u201d rather than mentioning some later stop on his journey, made it reasonably plain to me that whatever business had impelled this visit, it had originated in New Bern. I was wary of governors.</p><p>I glanced toward the path that led to the paddock, but Jamie wasn\u2019t visible yet. Mrs. Bug was, emerging from the springhouse; I waved to her and she gestured enthusiastically in welcome, though hampered by a pail of milk in one hand, a bucket of eggs in the other, a crock of butter under one arm, and a large chunk of cheese tucked neatly underneath her chin. She negotiated the steep descent with success, and disappeared round the back of the house, toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOmelettes all round, it looks like,\u201d I remarked, turning back to the Major. \u201cDid you happen to come through Cross Creek, by chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did indeed, mum. Your husband\u2019s aunt sends you her kind regards\u2014and a quantity of books and newspapers, which I have brought with me.\u201d</p><p>I was wary of newspapers these days, too\u2014though such events as they reported had undoubtedly taken place several weeks\u2014or months\u2014previously. I made appreciative noises, though, wishing Jamie would hurry up, so I could excuse myself. My hair smelled of burning and my hands still remembered the touch of cold flesh; I wanted a wash, badly.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I had missed something MacDonald was saying. He bent politely closer to repeat it, then jerked suddenly, eyes bulging.</p><p>\u201cFrigging cat!\u201d</p><p>Adso, who had been doing a splendid imitation of a limp dishcloth, had sprung bolt upright in the Major\u2019s lap, eyes glowing and tail like a bottlebrush, hissing like a teakettle as he flexed his claws hard into the Major\u2019s legs. I hadn\u2019t time to react before he had leapt over MacDonald\u2019s shoulder and swarmed through the open surgery window behind him, ripping the Major\u2019s ruffle and knocking his wig askew in the process.</p><p>MacDonald was cursing freely, but I hadn\u2019t attention to spare for him. Rollo was coming up the path toward the house, wolflike and sinister in the gloaming, but acting so oddly that I was standing before conscious thought could bring me to my feet.</p><p>The dog would run a few steps toward the house, circle once or twice as though unable to decide what to do next, then run back into the wood, turn, and run again toward the house, all the while whining with agitation, tail low and wavering.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said. \u201cBloody Timmy\u2019s in the well!\u201d I flew down the steps and ran for the path, barely registering the Major\u2019s startled oath behind me.</p><p>I found Ian a few hundred yards down the path, conscious, but groggy. He was sitting on the ground, eyes closed and both hands holding his head, as though to keep the bones of his skull from coming apart. He opened his eyes as I dropped to my knees beside him, and gave me an unfocused smile.</p><p>\u201cAuntie,\u201d he said hoarsely. He seemed to want to say something else, but couldn\u2019t quite decide what; his mouth opened, but then simply hung that way, tongue moving thoughtfully to and fro.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Ian,\u201d I said, as calmly as possible. He did\u2014that was good. It was too dark to see whether his pupils were unnaturally dilated, but even in the evening shadow of the pines that edged the trail, I could see the pallor of his face, and the dark trail of bloodstains down his shirt.</p><p>Hurried steps were coming after me down the trail; Jamie, followed closely by MacDonald.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, lad?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gripped him by one arm, and Ian swayed very gently toward him, then dropped his hands, closed his eyes, and relaxed into Jamie\u2019s arms with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cIs he bad?\u201d Jamie spoke anxiously over Ian\u2019s shoulder, holding him up as I frisked him for damage. The back of his shirt was saturated with dried blood\u2014but it was dried. The tail of his hair was stiff with it, too, and I found the head wound quickly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Something\u2019s hit him hard on the head and taken out a chunk of his scalp, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tomahawk, do you think?\u201d</p><p>MacDonald leaned over us, intent.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Ian drowsily, his face muffled in Jamie\u2019s shirt. \u201cA ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, dog,\u201d Jamie said briefly to Rollo, who had stuck his nose in Ian\u2019s ear, eliciting a stifled squawk from the patient and an involuntary lifting of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a look in the light, but it may not be too bad,\u201d I said, observing this. \u201cHe walked some way, after all. Let\u2019s get him up to the house.\u201d</p><p>The men made shift to get him up the trail, Ian\u2019s arms over their shoulders, and within minutes, had him laid facedown on the table in my surgery. Here, he told us the story of his adventures, in a disjoint fashion punctuated by small yelps as I cleaned the injury, clipped bits of clotted hair away, and put five or six stitches into his scalp.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was dead,\u201d Ian said, and sucked air through his teeth as I drew the coarse thread through the edges of the ragged wound. \u201cChrist, Auntie Claire! I woke in the morning, though, and I wasna dead after all\u2014though I thought my head was split open, and my brains spilling down my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nearly was,\u201d I murmured, concentrating on my work. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a bullet, though.\u201d</p><p>That got everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shot?\u201d Ian sounded mildly indignant. One big hand lifted, straying toward the back of his head, and I slapped it lightly away.</p><p>\u201cKeep still. No, you aren\u2019t shot, no credit to you. There was a deal of dirt in the wound, and shreds of wood and tree bark. If I had to guess, one of the shots knocked a dead branch loose from a tree, and it hit you in the head when it fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure as it wasn\u2019t a tomahawk, are ye?\u201d The Major seemed disappointed, too.</p><p>I tied the final knot and clipped the thread, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen a tomahawk wound, but I don\u2019t think so. See how jagged the edges are? And the scalp\u2019s torn badly, but I don\u2019t believe the bone is fractured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pitch-dark, the lad said,\u201d Jamie put in logically. \u201cNo sensible person would fling a tomahawk into a dark wood at something he couldna see.\u201d He was holding the spirit lamp for me to work by; he moved it closer, so we could see not only the ragged line of stitches, but the spreading bruise around it, revealed by the hair I had clipped off.</p><p>\u201cAye, see?\u201d Jamie\u2019s finger spread the remaining bristles gently apart, tracing several deep scratches that scored the bruised area. \u201cYour auntie\u2019s right, Ian; ye\u2019ve been attacked by a tree.\u201d</p><p>Ian opened one eye a slit.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told ye what a comical fellow ye are, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ian closed the eye.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as well, because ye\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled, and squeezed Ian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFeeling a bit better then, are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, the thing is,\u201d Major MacDonald interrupted, \u201cthat the lad did meet with some sort of banditti, no? Had ye reason to think they might be Indians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Ian again, but this time he opened the eye all the way. It was bloodshot. \u201cThey weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald didn\u2019t appear pleased with this answer.</p><p>\u201cHow could ye be sure, lad?\u201d he asked, rather sharply. \u201cIf it was dark, as ye say.\u201d</p><p>I saw Jamie glance quizzically at the Major, but he didn\u2019t interrupt. Ian moaned a little, then heaved a sigh and answered.</p><p>\u201cI smelt them,\u201d he said, adding almost immediately, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d</p><p>He raised himself on one elbow and promptly did so. This effectively put an end to any further questions, and Jamie took Major MacDonald off to the kitchen, leaving me to clean Ian up and settle him as comfortably as I could.</p><p>\u201cCan you open both eyes?\u201d I asked, having got him tidied and resting on his side, with a pillow under his head.</p><p>He did, blinking a little at the light. The small blue flame of the spirit lamp was reflected twice over in the darkness of his eyes, but the pupils shrank at once\u2014and together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said, and put down the lamp on the table. \u201cLeave it, dog,\u201d I said to Rollo, who was nosing at the strange smell of the lamp\u2014it was burning a mix of low-grade brandy and turpentine. \u201cTake hold of my fingers, Ian.\u201d</p><p>I held out my index fingers and he slowly wrapped a large, bony hand round each of them. I put him through the drill for neurological damage, having him squeeze, pull, push, and then concluded by listening to his heart, which was thumping along reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cSlight concussion,\u201d I announced, straightening up and smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he asked, squinting up at me.</p><p>\u201cIt means your head aches and you feel sick. You\u2019ll feel better in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ha\u2019 told ye that,\u201d he muttered, settling back.</p><p>\u201cSo you could,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut \u2018concussion\u2019 sounds so much more important than \u2018cracked heid,\u2019 doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh, but smiled faintly in response. \u201cWill ye feed Rollo, Auntie? He wouldna leave me on the way; he\u2019ll be hungry.\u201d</p><p>Rollo pricked his ears at the sound of his name, and shoved his muzzle into Ian\u2019s groping hand, whining softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I said to the dog. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. And yes,\u201d I added to Ian, \u201cI\u2019ll bring something. Do you think you could manage a bit of bread and milk, yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said definitely. \u201cA dram o\u2019 whisky, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, just as definitely, and blew out the spirit lamp.</p><p>\u201cAuntie,\u201d he said, as I turned to the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I\u2019d left a single candlestick to light him, and he looked very young and pale in the wavering yellow glow.</p><p>\u201cWhy d\u2019ye suppose Major MacDonald wants it to be Indians I met in the wood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I imagine Jamie does. Or will, by now.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>SERPENT IN EDEN</p><p>BRIANNA PUSHED OPEN the door to her cabin, listening warily for the scamper of rodent feet or the dry whisper of scales across the floor. She\u2019d once walked in in the dark and stepped within inches of a small rattlesnake; while the snake had been nearly as startled as she was, and slithered madly away between the hearthstones, she\u2019d learned her lesson.</p><p>There was no scuttle of fleeing mice or voles this time, but something larger had been and gone, pushing its way through the oiled skin tacked over the window. The sun was just setting, and there was enough daylight left to show her the woven-grass basket in which she kept roasted peanuts, knocked from its shelf onto the floor and the contents cracked and eaten, a litter of shells scattered over the floor.</p><p>A loud rustling noise froze her momentarily, listening. It came again, followed by a loud clang as something fell to the ground, on the other side of the back wall.</p><p>\u201cYou little bastard!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in my pantry!\u201d</p><p>Fired with righteous indignation, she seized the broom and charged into the lean-to with a banshee yell. An enormous raccoon, tranquilly munching a smoked trout, dropped its prey at sight of her, dashed between her legs, and made off like a fat banker in flight from creditors, making loud birring noises of alarm.</p><p>Nerves pulsing with adrenaline, she put aside the broom and bent to salvage what she could of the mess, cursing under her breath. Raccoons were less destructive than squirrels, who would chew and shred with hapless abandon\u2014but they had bigger appetites.</p><p>God knew how long he\u2019d been in here, she thought. Long enough to lick all the butter out of its mold, pull down a cluster of smoked fish from the rafters\u2014and how something so fat had managed the acrobatic feat required for that . . . Luckily, the honeycomb had been stored in three separate jars, and only one had been despoiled. But the root vegetables had been dumped on the floor, a fresh cheese mostly devoured, and the precious jug of maple syrup had been overturned, draining into a sticky puddle in the dirt. The sight of this loss enraged her afresh, and she squeezed the potato she had just picked up so hard that her nails sank through its skin.</p><p>\u201cBloody, bloody, beastly, horrible, bloody beast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d said a voice behind her. Startled, she whirled and fired the potato at the intruder, who proved to be Roger. It struck him squarely in the forehead and he staggered, clutching the door frame.</p><p>\u201cOw! Christ! Ow! What the hell\u2019s going on in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaccoon,\u201d she said shortly, and stepped back, letting the waning light from the door illuminate the damage.</p><p>\u201cHe got the maple syrup? Bugger! Did you get the bastard?\u201d Hand pressed to his forehead, Roger ducked inside the lean-to pantry, glancing about for furry bodies.</p><p>Seeing that her husband shared both her priorities and her sense of outrage soothed her somewhat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe ran. Are you bleeding? And where\u2019s Jem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, taking the hand gingerly from his forehead and glancing at it. \u201cOw. You\u2019ve a wicked arm, girl. Jem\u2019s at the McGillivrays\u2019. Lizzie and Mr. Wemyss took him along to celebrate Senga\u2019s engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who did she pick?\u201d Both outrage and remorse were immediately subsumed in interest. Ute McGillivray, with German thoroughness, had carefully selected partners for her son and three daughters according to her own criteria\u2014land, money, and respectability ranking highest, with age, personal appearance, and charm coming well down the list. Not surprisingly, her children had other ideas\u2014though such was the force of Frau Ute\u2019s personality that both Inga and Hilda had married men that she approved of.</p><p>Senga, though, was her mother\u2019s daughter\u2014meaning that she possessed similarly strong opinions and a similar lack of inhibition in expressing them. For months, she had been hovering between two suitors: Heinrich Strasse, a dashing but poor young man\u2014and a Lutheran!\u2014from Bethania, and Ronnie Sinclair, the cooper. A well-off man, by the standards of the Ridge, and to Ute, the fact that Ronnie was thirty years Senga\u2019s senior was no bar.</p><p>The business of Senga McGillivray\u2019s marriage had been a topic of intense speculation on the Ridge for the last several months, and Brianna was aware of several substantial wagers riding on the outcome.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s the lucky man?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bug doesn\u2019t know, and it\u2019s driving her mad,\u201d Roger replied, breaking into a grin. \u201cManfred McGillivray came to fetch them yesterday morning, but Mrs. Bug hadn\u2019t come down to the Big House yet, so Lizzie left a note pinned to the back door to say where they\u2019d gone\u2014but she didn\u2019t think to say who the fortunate bridegroom is.\u201d</p><p>Brianna glanced at the setting sun; the orb itself had sunk out of sight, though the blazing light through the chestnut trees still lit the dooryard, making the spring grass look deep and soft as emerald velvet.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll have to wait \u2019til tomorrow to find out,\u201d she said, with some regret. The McGillivrays\u2019 place was a good five miles; it would be full dark long before they reached it, and even past the thaw, one didn\u2019t wander the mountains at night without a good reason\u2014or at least a better reason than mere curiosity.</p><p>\u201cAye. D\u2019ye want to go up to the Big House for supper? Major MacDonald\u2019s come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d She considered for a moment. She would like to hear any news the Major had brought\u2014and there was something to be said for having Mrs. Bug make supper. On the other hand, she was really in no mood to be sociable, after a grim three days, a long ride, and the desecration of her pantry.</p><p>She became aware that Roger was carefully not contributing an opinion. One arm leaning on the shelf where the dwindling stock of winter apples was spread, he idly caressed one of the fruits, a forefinger slowly stroking the round yellow cheek of it. Faint, familiar vibrations were coming off him, suggesting silently that there might be advantages to an evening at home, sans parents, acquaintances\u2014or baby.</p><p>She smiled at Roger.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your poor head?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her briefly, the waning rays of the sun gilding the bridge of his nose and striking a flash of green from one eye. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI suppose ye might kiss it,\u201d he suggested diffidently. \u201cIf ye liked.\u201d</p><p>She obligingly rose on her tiptoes and did so, gently, brushing back the thick black hair from his brow. There was a noticeable lump, though it hadn\u2019t begun to bruise yet.</p><p>\u201cIs that better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Better try again. Maybe a bit lower?\u201d</p><p>His hands settled on the swell of her hips, drawing her in. She was nearly as tall as he was; she\u2019d noticed before what an advantage of fit this was, but the impression struck her forcibly anew. She wriggled slightly, enjoying it, and Roger drew a deep, rasping breath.</p><p>\u201cNot quite that low,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicky, picky,\u201d she said tolerantly, and kissed him on the mouth. His lips were warm, but the scent of bitter ash and damp earth clung to him\u2014as it did to her\u2014and she shivered a little, drawing back.</p><p>He kept a hand lightly on her back, but leaned past her, running a finger along the edge of the shelf where the jug of maple syrup had been overturned. He ran the finger lightly along her lower lip, then his own, and bent again to kiss her, sweetness rising up between them.</p><p>\u201cI CAN\u2019T REMEMBER how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen ye nak*d.\u201d</p><p>She closed one eye and looked at him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cAbout three days. I guess it wasn\u2019t all that memorable.\u201d It had been a great relief to shed the clothes she\u2019d been wearing for the last three days and nights. Even nak*d and hastily washed, though, she still smelled dust in her hair and felt the grime of the journey between her toes.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, aye. That\u2019s not what I mean, though\u2014I mean, it\u2019s been a long while since we\u2019ve made love in the daylight.\u201d He lay on his side, facing her, and smiled as he passed a light hand over the deep curve of her waist and the swell of buttock. \u201cYe\u2019ve no idea how lovely ye look, stark nak*d, wi\u2019 the sun behind you. All gold, like ye were dipped in it.\u201d</p><p>He closed one eye, as though the sight dazzled him. She moved, and the sun shone in his face, making the open eye glow like an emerald in the split second before he blinked.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She put out a lazy hand and drew his head in close to kiss him.</p><p>She did know what he meant. It felt strange\u2014almost wicked, in a pleasant sort of way. Most often, they made love at night, after Jem was asleep, whispering to each other in the hearth-lit shadows, finding each other among the rustling, secret layers of quilts and nightclothes. And while Jem normally slept as though he\u2019d been poleaxed, they were always half-conscious of the small, heavy-breathing mound beneath the quilt of his trundle bed nearby.</p><p>She was oddly just as conscious of Jem now, in his absence. It felt strange to be apart from him; not constantly aware of where he was, not feeling his body as a small, very mobile extension of her own. The freedom was exhilarating, but left her feeling uneasy, as though she had misplaced something valuable.</p><p>They\u2019d left the door open, the better to enjoy the flood of light and air on their skins. The sun was nearly down now, though, and while the air still glowed like honey, there was a shadow of chill in it.</p><p>A sudden gust of wind rattled the hide tacked over the window and blew across the room, slamming the door and leaving them abruptly in the dark.</p><p>Brianna gasped. Roger grunted in surprise and swung off the bed, going to open the door. He flung it wide, and she gulped in the freshet of air and sunshine, only then aware that she had held her breath when the door closed, feeling momentarily entombed.</p><p>Roger seemed to feel the same. He stood in the doorway, bracing himself against the frame, letting the wind stir the dark, curling hairs of his body. His hair was still bound in a tail; he hadn\u2019t bothered undoing it, and she had a sudden desire to come behind him, untie the leather thong and run her fingers through the soft, glossy black of it, the legacy of some ancient Spaniard, shipwrecked among the Celts.</p><p>She was up and doing it before she had consciously decided to, combing tiny yellow catkins and twigs from his locks with her fingers. He shivered, from her touch or that of the wind, but his body was warm.</p><p>\u201cYou have a farmer\u2019s tan,\u201d she said, lifting the hair off his neck and kissing him on the bone at the base of his nape.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. Am I not a farmer, then?\u201d His skin twitched under her lips, like a horse\u2019s hide. His face, neck, and forearms had paled over the winter, but were still darker than the flesh of back and shoulders\u2014and a faint line still lingered round his waist, demarcating the soft buckskin color of his torso from the startling paleness of his backside.</p><p>She cupped his buttocks, enjoying the high, round solidity of them, and he breathed deeply, leaning back a little toward her, so her br**sts pressed against his back and her chin rested on his shoulder, looking out.</p><p>It was still daylight, but barely. The last long shafts of the sinking sun burst through the chestnut trees, so the tender spring green of their leaves burned with cool fire, brilliant above the lengthening shadows. It was near evening, but it was spring; the birds were still at it, chattering and courting. A mockingbird sang from the forest nearby, in a medley of trills, liquid runs, and odd yowls, which she thought it must have learned from her mother\u2019s cat.</p><p>The air was growing nippy, and gooseflesh stippled her arms and thighs\u2014but Roger\u2019s body against her own was very warm. She wrapped her arms around his waist, the fingers of one hand playing idly with the thicket of his short and curlies.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she asked softly, for his eyes were fixed on the far side of the dooryard, where the trail emerged from the forest. The trailhead was dim, shadowed by a growth of dark pines\u2014but empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching out for a snake bearing apples,\u201d he said, and laughed, then cleared his throat. \u201cAre ye hungry, Eve?\u201d His hand came down to twine with hers.</p><p>\u201cGetting there. Are you?\u201d He must be starving; they had had only a hasty snack at midday.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am, but\u2014\u201d He broke off, hesitating, and his fingers tightened in hers. \u201cYe\u2019ll think I\u2019m mad, but\u2014would ye mind if I went to fetch wee Jem tonight, instead of waiting for the morning? It\u2019s only, I\u2019d feel a bit better to have him back.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand in return, her heart lifting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both go. It\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but it\u2019s five miles to McGillivrays\u2019, too. It\u2019ll be long dark before we\u2019re there.\u201d He was smiling, though, and his body brushed against her br**sts as he turned to face her.</p><p>Something moved by her face, and she drew back sharply. A tiny caterpillar, green as the leaves on which it fed and vibrant against Roger\u2019s dark hair, reared itself into an S-shape, looking vainly for sanctuary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger slid his eyes sideways, trying to see what she was looking at.</p><p>\u201cFound your snake. I expect he\u2019s looking for an apple, too.\u201d She coaxed the tiny worm onto her finger, stepped outside, and squatted to let it crawl onto a grass blade that matched its vivid green. But the grass was in shadow. In only an instant, the sun had gone down, the forest no longer the color of life.</p><p>A thread of smoke reached her nose; chimney smoke from the Big House, but her throat closed at the smell of burning. Suddenly her uneasiness was stronger. The light was fading, night coming on. The mockingbird had fallen silent, and the forest seemed full of mystery and threat.</p><p>She rose to her feet, shoving a hand through her hair.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ye not want supper, first?\u201d Roger looked quizzically at her, breeches in hand.</p><p>She shook her head, chill beginning to creep up her legs.</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d Nothing seemed to matter, save to get Jem, and be together again, a family.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Roger said mildly, eyeing her. \u201cI do think ye\u2019d best put on your fig leaf first, though. Just in case we meet an angel with a flaming sword.\u201d</p> <p>5</p><p>THE SHADOWS WHICH</p><p>FIRE THROWS</p><p>I ABANDONED IAN AND ROLLO to the juggernaut of Mrs. Bug\u2019s benevolence\u2014let Ian try telling her he didn\u2019t want bread and milk\u2014and sat down to my own belated supper: a hot, fresh omelette, featuring not only cheese, but bits of salty bacon, asparagus, and wild mushroom, flavored with spring onions.</p><p>Jamie and the Major had finished their own meals already, and sat by the fire beneath a companionable fug of tobacco smoke from the Major\u2019s clay pipe. Evidently, Jamie had just finished telling Major MacDonald about the gruesome tragedy, for MacDonald was frowning and shaking his head in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cPuir gomerels!\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019ll be thinking that it was the same banditti, perhaps, who set upon your nephew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jamie replied. \u201cI shouldna like to think there were two such bands prowling the mountains.\u201d He glanced toward the window, cozily shuttered for the night, and I noticed suddenly that he had taken down his fowling piece from over the hearth and was absently wiping the spotless barrel with an oily rag. \u201cDo I gather, a charaid, that ye\u2019ve heard some report of similar doings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree others. At least.\u201d The Major\u2019s pipe threatened to go out, and he drew on it mightily, making the tobacco in the bowl glow and crackle sudden red.</p><p>A small qualm made me pause, a bite of mushroom warm in my mouth. The possibility that a mysterious gang of armed men might be roaming at large, attacking homesteads at random, had not occurred to me \u2019til this moment.</p><p>Obviously, it had occurred to Jamie; he rose, put the fowling piece back on its hooks, touched the rifle that hung above it for reassurance, then went to the sideboard, where his dags and the case with its elegant pair of dueling pistols were kept.</p><p>MacDonald watched with approval, puffing clouds of soft blue smoke, as Jamie methodically laid out guns, shot pouches, bullet molds, patches, rods, and all the other impedimenta of his personal armory.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cA verra nice piece, that, Colonel.\u201d He nodded at one of the dags, a long-barreled, elegant thing with a scroll butt and silver-gilt fittings.</p><p>Jamie gave MacDonald a narrow glance, hearing the \u201cColonel,\u201d but answered calmly enough.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s a bonny thing. It doesna aim true at anything over two paces, though. Won it in a horse race,\u201d he added, with a small apologetic gesture at the gun, lest MacDonald think him fool enough to have paid good money for it.</p> <p>He checked the flint nonetheless, replaced it, and set the gun aside.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jamie said casually, reaching for the bullet mold.</p><p>I had resumed chewing, but looked inquiringly at the Major myself.</p><p>\u201cMind, it\u2019s only what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d MacDonald warned, taking the pipe from his mouth for a moment, then hastily putting it back for another puff. \u201cA homestead some distance from Salem, burned to the ground. Folk called Zinzer\u2014Germans.\u201d He sucked hard, cheeks hollowing.</p><p>\u201cThat was in February, late in the month. Then three weeks later, a ferry, on the Yadkin north of Woram\u2019s Landing\u2014the house robbed, and the ferryman killed. The third\u2014\u201d Here he broke off, puffing furiously, and cut his eyes at me, then back at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cSpeak, o, friend,\u201d Jamie said in Gaelic, looking resigned. \u201cShe will have been seeing more dreadful things than you have, by far.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at this, forking up another bite of egg, and the Major coughed.</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, saving your presence, mum\u2014I happened to find myself in a, er, establishment in Edenton. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA brothel?\u201d I put in. \u201cYes, quite. Do go on, Major.\u201d</p><p>He did, rather hurriedly, his face flushing dark beneath his wig.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . to be sure. Well, d\u2019ye see, \u2019twas one of the, er, lasses in the place, told me as she\u2019d been stolen from her home by outlaws who set upon the place one day without warning. She\u2019d no but an auld grannie she lived with, and said they\u2019d kilt the auld woman, and burned the house above her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who did she say had done it?\u201d Jamie had turned his stool to face the hearth, and was melting lead scrap in a ladle for the bullet mold.</p><p>\u201cAh, mmphm.\u201d MacDonald\u2019s flush deepened, and the smoke fumed from his pipe with such ferocity that I could barely make out his features through the curling wreaths.</p><p>It transpired, with much coughing and circumlocution, that the Major had not really believed the girl at the time\u2014or had been too interested in availing himself of her charms to pay much attention. Putting the story down simply as one of the tales whores often told to elicit sympathy and the odd extra glass of geneva, he had not bothered to ask for further detail.</p><p>\u201cBut when I heard by chance later of the other burnings . . . well, d\u2019ye see, I\u2019ve had the luck to be charged by the Governor with keeping an ear to the ground, as it were, in the backcountry, for signs of unrest. And I began to think that this particular instance of unrest was maybe not just sae much of a coincidence as might at first appear.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged glances at that, Jamie\u2019s tinged with amusement, mine with resignation. He\u2019d bet me that MacDonald\u2014a half-pay cavalry officer who survived by freelancing\u2014would not only survive Governor Tryon\u2019s resignation, but would succeed in worming his way promptly into some position with the new regime, now that Tryon had left to take up a superior position as governor of New York. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman o\u2019 fortune, our Donald,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>The militant smell of hot lead began to permeate the room, competing with the Major\u2019s pipe smoke, and quite overpowering the pleasantly domestic atmosphere of rising bread, cooking, dried herbs, scouring rushes, and lye soap that normally filled the kitchen.</p><p>Lead melts suddenly; one instant, a deformed bullet or a bent button sits in the ladle, whole and distinct; the next, it\u2019s gone, a tiny puddle of metal shimmering dully in its place. Jamie poured the molten lead carefully into the mold, averting his face from the fumes.</p><p>\u201cWhy Indians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, \u2019twas what the whore in Edenton said. She said some of those who burned her house and stole her away were Indians. But as I say, at the time I paid her story little mind.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a Scottish noise indicating that he took the point, but with skepticism.</p><p>\u201cAnd when did ye meet this lassie, Donald, and hear her story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear Christmas.\u201d The Major poked at the bowl of his pipe with a stained forefinger, not looking up. \u201cYe mean when was her house attacked? She didna say, but I think . . . perhaps not too long before. She was still . . . fairly, er, fresh.\u201d He coughed, caught my eye, caught his breath, and coughed again, hard, going red in the face.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s mouth pressed tight, and he looked down, flipping open the mold to drop a new-made ball onto the hearth.</p><p>I put down my fork, the remnants of appetite vanished.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHow did this young woman come to be in the brothel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, they sold her, mum.\u201d The flush still stained MacDonald\u2019s cheeks, but he had recovered his countenance enough to look at me. \u201cThe brigands. They sold her to a river trader, she said, a few days after they\u2019d stolen her. He kept her for a bit, on his boat, but then a man came one night to do business, took a fancy to her, and bought her. He brought her as far as the coast, but I suppose he\u2019d tired of her by then. . . .\u201d His words trailed off, and he stuck the pipe back into his mouth, drawing hard.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I did, and the half of the omelette I\u2019d eaten lay in a small hard ball in the bottom of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cStill fairly fresh.\u201d How long did it take, I wondered? How long would a woman last, passed from hand to casual hand, from the splintered planks of a riverboat\u2019s deck to the tattered mattress of a hired room, given only what would keep her alive? It was more than possible that the brothel in Edenton had seemed a haven of sorts by the time she reached it. The thought didn\u2019t make me feel any more kindly toward MacDonald, though.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember her name at least, Major?\u201d I asked, with icy courtesy.</p><p>I thought I saw the edge of Jamie\u2019s mouth twitch, from the corner of my eye, but kept my stare focused on MacDonald.</p><p>He took the pipe from his mouth, exhaled a long stream of smoke, then looked up into my face, his eyes pale blue and very direct.</p><p>\u201cIn truth, mum,\u201d he said, \u201cI just call them all Polly. Saves trouble, ken?\u201d</p><p>I was saved from reply\u2014or from something worse\u2014by the return of Mrs. Bug, bearing an empty bowl.</p><p>\u201cThe laddie\u2019s eaten, and now he\u2019ll sleep,\u201d she announced. Her sharp eyes flicked from my face to my half-empty plate. She opened her mouth, frowning, but then glanced at Jamie, and seeming to pick up some unspoken command from him, shut her mouth again, and picked up the plate with a brief \u201chmp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bug,\u201d said Jamie quietly. \u201cWill ye awa\u2019 just now, and ask Arch to come down to me? And, if it\u2019s no troubling ye too much, the same word to Roger Mac?\u201d</p><p>Her small black eyes went round, then narrowed as she glanced at MacDonald, obviously suspecting that if there were mischief afoot, he was behind it.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said, and shaking her head with admonishment at me for my lack of appetite, she put down the dishes and went out, leaving the door on the latch.</p><p>\u201cWoram\u2019s Landing,\u201d Jamie said to MacDonald, resuming their conversation as though it had not been interrupted. \u201cAnd Salem. And if it is the same men, Young Ian met them in the forest, a day\u2019s travel west of here. Near enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear enough to be the same? Aye, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early in the spring.\u201d Jamie glanced at the window as he spoke; it was dark now, and the shutters closed, but a cool breeze crept through and stirred the threads where I had strung mushrooms to dry, dark wizened shapes that swayed like tiny dancers, frozen against the pale wood.</p><p>I knew what he meant by that. The ground in the mountains was impassable during the winter; the high passes still held snow, and the lower slopes had only begun to green and blossom in the last few weeks. If there was an organized gang of marauders, they might only now be moving into the backcountry, after a winter spent lying low in the piedmont.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d MacDonald agreed. \u201cEarly enough, perhaps, to have folk on their guard. But before your men come, sir\u2014perhaps we should speak of what brought me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie said, squinting carefully as he poured a glittering stream of lead. \u201cOf course, Donald. I should have kent no small matter would bring ye so far. What is it?\u201d</p><p>MacDonald smiled like a shark; now we\u2019d come to it.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve done well wi\u2019 your place here, Colonel. How many families it is ye have on your land the noo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four,\u201d Jamie said. He didn\u2019t look up, but turned out another bullet into the ashes.</p><p>\u201cRoom for a few more, perhaps?\u201d MacDonald was still smiling. We were surrounded by thousands of miles of wilderness; the handful of homesteads on Fraser\u2019s Ridge made scarcely a dent in it\u2014and could vanish like smoke. I thought momentarily of the Dutch cabin, and shivered, despite the fire. I could still taste the bitter, cloying smell of burned flesh, thick in the back of my throat, lurking beneath the lighter flavors of the omelette.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Jamie replied equably. \u201cThe new Scottish emigrants, is it? From up past Thurso?\u201d</p><p>Major MacDonald and I both stared at him.</p><p>\u201cHow the devil d\u2019ye ken that?\u201d MacDonald demanded. \u201cI heard it myself only ten days since!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMet a man at the mill yesterday,\u201d Jamie replied, picking up the ladle again. \u201cA gentleman from Philadelphia, come into the mountains to collect plants. He\u2019d come up from Cross Creek and seen them.\u201d A muscle near his mouth twitched. \u201cApparently, they made a bit of a stir at Brunswick, and didna feel themselves quite welcome, so they came up the river on flatboats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit of a stir? What did they do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, d\u2019ye see, mum,\u201d the Major explained, \u201cthere are a great many folk come flooding off ships these days, straight from the Highlands. Whole villages, packed into the bowels of a ship\u2014and looking as though they\u2019ve been shat out when they disembark, too. There\u2019s nothing for them on the coast, though, and the townsfolk are inclined to point and snigger, seein\u2019 them in their outlandish rig\u2014so for the most part, they get straight onto a barge or a flatboat and head up the Cape Fear. Campbelton and Cross Creek at least have folk who can talk to them.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me, brushing a smudge of dirt from the skirts of his uniform coat.</p><p>\u201cThe folk in Brunswick willna be quite accustomed to such rawboned Highlanders, they having seen only such civilized Scotch persons as your husband and his aunt.\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward Jamie, who gave him a small, ironic bow in return.</p><p>\u201cWell, relatively civilized,\u201d I murmured. I was not ready to forgive MacDonald for the whore in Edenton. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve barely a word of English among them, from what I hear,\u201d MacDonald hurried on. \u201cFarquard Campbell came down to speak wi\u2019 them, and brought them north to Campbelton, or I doubt not but they\u2019d be milling about onshore yet, wi\u2019 no notion at all where to go or what to do next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Campbell done wi\u2019 them?\u201d Jamie inquired.</p><p>\u201cAh, they\u2019re parceled out amongst his acquaintance in Campbelton, but \u2019twon\u2019t suit in the long run, ye can see that, of course.\u201d MacDonald shrugged. Campbelton was a small settlement near Cross Creek, centered around Farquard Campbell\u2019s successful trading store, and the land around it was entirely settled\u2014mostly by Campbells. Farquard had eight children, many of whom were also married\u2014and as fertile as their father.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jamie said, looking wary. \u201cBut they\u2019re from the northern coast. They\u2019ll be fishermen, Donald, not crofters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but they\u2019re willing to make a change, no?\u201d MacDonald gestured toward the door, and the forest beyond. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for them left in Scotland. They\u2019ve come here, and now they must make the best of it. A man can learn to farm, surely?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked rather dubious, but MacDonald was in the full flush of his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen many a fisher-lad and plowboy become a soldier, man, and so have you, I\u2019ll wager. Farming\u2019s no more difficult than soldiering, surely?\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled a little at that; he had left farming at nineteen and fought as a mercenary in France for several years before returning to Scotland.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, that\u2019s maybe true, Donald. But the thing about being a soldier is that someone\u2019s tellin\u2019 ye what to do, from the moment ye rise until ye fall down at night. Who\u2019s to tell these poor wee gomerels which end o\u2019 the cow to milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be you, I expect,\u201d I said to him. I stretched myself, easing my back, stiff from riding, and glanced across at MacDonald. \u201cOr at least I suppose that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, Major?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour charm is exceeded only by your quickness of wit, mum,\u201d said MacDonald, bowing gracefully in my direction. \u201cAye, that\u2019s the meat of it. All your folk are Highlanders, sir, and crofters; they can speak to these newcomers in their own tongue, show them what they\u2019ll need to know\u2014help them to make their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a good many other folk in the colony who have the Gaidhlig,\u201d Jamie objected. \u201cAnd most of them a great deal more convenient to Campbelton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but you\u2019ve vacant land that needs clearing, and they haven\u2019t.\u201d Obviously feeling that he had won the argument, MacDonald sat back and took up his neglected mug of beer.</p><p>Jamie looked at me, one eyebrow raised. It was perfectly true that we had vacant land: ten thousand acres, but barely twenty of them under cultivation. It was also true that lack of labor was acute in the entire colony, but even more so in the mountains, where the land didn\u2019t lend itself to tobacco or rice\u2014the sorts of crops suited to slave labor.</p><p>At the same time, though\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe difficulty is, Donald, how to settle them.\u201d Jamie bent to turn out another ball on the hearth, and straightened, brushing back a loose strand of auburn hair behind his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve land, aye, but little else. Ye canna be loosing folk straight from Scotland into the wilderness, and expect them to claw a living out of it. I couldna even give them the shoon and suit of clothes a bondsman would have, let alone tools. And to feed them and all their wives and weans through the winter? To offer them protection?\u201d He lifted his ladle in illustration, then shook his head and dropped in another lump of lead.</p><p>\u201cAh, protection. Well, since ye\u2019ve mentioned that, let me proceed to another wee matter of interest.\u201d MacDonald leaned forward, lowering his voice confidentially, though there was no one to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said I\u2019m the Governor\u2019s man, aye? He\u2019s charged me to travel about, over the western part of the colony, and keep an ear to the ground. There are Regulators still unpardoned, and\u201d\u2014he glanced warily to and fro, as though expecting one of these persons to bound out of the fireplace\u2014\u201cye\u2019ll have heard of the Committees of Safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll not have one established yet, here in the backcountry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard of, no.\u201d Jamie had run out of lead to melt, and now stooped to scoop the new-made balls from the ashes at his feet, the warm light of the fire glowing red on the crown of his head. I sat down beside him on the settle, picking up the shot pouch from the table and holding it open for him.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said MacDonald, looking pleased. \u201cI see I\u2019ve come in good time, then.\u201d</p><p>In the wake of the civil unrest that surrounded the War of the Regulation a year before, a number of such informal citizens\u2019 groups had sprung up, inspired by similar groups in the other colonies. If the Crown was no longer able to assure the safety of the colonists, they argued, then they must take the matter into their own hands.</p><p>The sheriffs could no longer be trusted to keep order; the scandals that had inspired the Regulator movement had assured that. The difficulty, of course, was that since the committees were self-appointed, there was no more reason to trust them than the sheriffs.</p><p>There were other committees, too. The Committees of Correspondence, loose associations of men who wrote letters to and fro, spreading news and rumor between the colonies. And it was out of these various committees that the seeds of rebellion would spring\u2014were germinating even now, somewhere out in the cold spring night.</p><p>As I did now and then\u2014and much more often, now\u2014I reckoned up the time remaining. It was nearly April of 1773 And on the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five . . . as Longfellow so quaintly put it . . .</p><p>Two years. But war has a long fuse, and a slow match. This one had been lit at Alamance, and the bright, hot lines of the creeping fire in North Carolina were already visible\u2014for those who knew to look.</p><p>The lead balls in the shot pouch I held rolled and clicked together; my fingers had tightened on the leather. Jamie saw it and touched my knee, quick and light, in reassurance, then took the pouch and rolled it up, tucking it into the cartridge box.</p><p>\u201cGood time,\u201d he repeated, looking at MacDonald. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean by that, Donald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, who should lead such a committee other than yourself, Colonel? I had suggested as much to the Governor.\u201d MacDonald tried to look modest, and failed.</p><p>\u201cVerra obliging of ye, Major,\u201d Jamie said dryly. He raised an eyebrow at me. The state of the colony\u2019s government must be worse even than he had supposed, for Governor Martin to be not only tolerating the existence of the committees\u2014but clandestinely sanctioning them.</p><p>The long-drawn whine of a dog\u2019s yawn reached me faintly from the hall, and I excused myself, to go and check on Ian.</p><p>I wondered whether Governor Martin had the slightest idea what he was loosing. I rather thought he did, and was making the best of a bad job, by trying to ensure that some, at least, of the Committees of Safety were run by men who had backed the Crown during the War of the Regulation. The fact remained that he could not control\u2014or even know about\u2014many such committees. But the colony was beginning to seethe and bump like a teakettle on the boil, and Martin had no official troops at his command, only such irregulars as MacDonald\u2014and the militia.</p><p>Which was why MacDonald was calling Jamie \u201cColonel,\u201d of course. The previous governor, William Tryon, had appointed Jamie\u2014quite against his will\u2014colonel of militia for the backcountry above the Yadkin.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I said to myself. Neither MacDonald nor Martin was a fool. Inviting Jamie to set up a Committee of Safety meant that he would call upon those men who had served under him in the militia\u2014but would commit the government to nothing, in terms of paying or equipping them\u2014and the Governor would be clear of any responsibility for their actions, since a Committee of Safety was not an official body.</p><p>The danger to Jamie\u2014and all of us\u2014in accepting such a proposal, though\u2014that was considerable.</p><p>It was dark in the hall, with no light but the spill from the kitchen behind me, and the faint glow of the single candle in the surgery. Ian was asleep, but restless, a faint frown of discomfort wrinkling the soft skin between his brows. Rollo raised his head, thick tail swishing to and fro across the floor in greeting.</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t respond when I spoke his name, or when I set a hand on his shoulder. I shook him gently, then harder. I could see him struggling, somewhere under the layers of unconsciousness, like a man drifting in the underwater currents, yielding to the beckoning depths, then snagged by an unexpected fishhook, a stab of pain in cold-numbed flesh.</p><p>His eyes opened suddenly, dark and lost, and he stared at me in incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cHallo there,\u201d I said softly, relieved to see him wake. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I could see that the question made no sense to him at once, and repeated it, patiently. Awareness stirred somewhere in the depths of his dilated pupils.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d he said in Gaelic. He said something else, slurred, in Mohawk, and his eyelids fluttered, closing.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Ian,\u201d I said firmly, resuming the shaking. \u201cTell me who you are.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened again, and he squinted at me in confusion.</p><p>\u201cTry something easier,\u201d I suggested, holding up two fingers. \u201cHow many fingers do you see?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of awareness sprang up in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDinna let Arch Bug see ye do that, Auntie,\u201d he said drowsily, the hint of a smile touching his face. \u201cThat\u2019s verra rude, ken.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least he had recognized me, as well as the \u201cV\u201d sign; that was something. And he must know who he was, if he was calling me Auntie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your full name?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cIan James FitzGibbons Fraser Murray,\u201d he said, rather crossly. \u201cWhy d\u2019ye keep asking me my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFitzGibbons?\u201d I said. \u201cWhere on earth did you get that one?\u201d</p><p>He groaned and put two fingers against his eyelids, wincing as he pressed gently.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie gave it me\u2014blame him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for his auld godfather, he said. Murtagh FitzGibbons Fraser, he was called, but my mother didna want me named Murtagh. I think I\u2019m going to puke again,\u201d he added, taking his hand away.</p><p>In the event, he heaved and retched a bit over the basin, but didn\u2019t actually vomit, which was a good sign. I eased him back onto his side, white and clammy with sweat, and Rollo stood on his hind legs, front paws braced on the table, to lick his face, which made him giggle between groans and try feebly to push the dog away.</p><p>\u201cTheirig dhachaigh, Okwaho,\u201d he said. \u201cTheirig dhachaigh\u201d meant \u201cgo home,\u201d in Gaelic, and Okwaho was evidently Rollo\u2019s Mohawk name. Ian seemed to be having some difficulty choosing among the three languages in which he was fluent, but was obviously lucid, in spite of that. After I had made him answer a few more annoyingly pointless questions, I wiped his face with a damp cloth, let him rinse his mouth with well-watered wine, and tucked him in again.</p><p>\u201cAuntie?\u201d he said drowsily, as I was turning for the door. \u201cD\u2019ye think I\u2019ll ever see my Mam again?\u201d</p><p>I stopped, having no idea how to answer that. In fact, there was no need; he had dropped back into sleep with the suddenness that concussion patients often showed, and was breathing deeply before I could find any words.</p><p>6</p><p>AMBUSH</p><p>IAN WOKE ABRUPTLY, hand closing round his tomahawk. Or what should have been his tomahawk, but was instead a handful of breeches. For an instant, he had no notion at all where he was, and sat up straight, trying to make out shapes in the dark.</p><p>Pain shot through his head like heat lightning, making him gasp soundlessly and clutch it. Somewhere in the dark below him, Rollo gave a small, startled wuff?</p><p>Christ. The piercing smells of his aunt\u2019s surgery stabbed the back of his nose, alcohol and burned wick and dried medicine leaves and the foul brews she called penny-syllin. He closed his eyes, put his forehead on his drawn-up knees, and breathed slowly through his mouth.</p><p>What had he been dreaming? Some dream of danger, something violent\u2014but no clear image came to him, only the feel of being stalked, something following him through the wood.</p><p>He had to piss, badly. Fumbling for the edge of the table he lay on, he eased himself slowly upright, squinting against the flashes of pain in his head.</p><p>Mrs. Bug had left him a pot, he remembered her saying so, but the candle had gone out and he\u2019d no mind to crawl round the floor looking for it. Faint light showed him where the door was; she had left it ajar, and a glow spread down the hall from the kitchen hearth. With that as bearing, he made his way to the window, got it open, fumbled free the shutter fastening, and stood in the flood of air from the cool spring night, eyes closed in relief as his bladder eased.</p><p>That was better, though with the relief came new awareness of the queasiness of his stomach and the throbbing in his head. He sat down, putting his arms on his knees and his head on his arms, waiting for everything to ease.</p><p>There were voices in the kitchen; he could hear them clearly, now that he paid attention.</p><p>It was Uncle Jamie and yon MacDonald, and old Arch Bug, as well, with Auntie Claire now and again putting in a word, her English voice sharp by contrast with the gruff mutter of Scots and Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cWould ye care, perhaps, to be an Indian agent?\u201d MacDonald was saying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was that? he wondered\u2014then it came to him. Aye, of course; the Crown employed men to go out to the tribes, offer them gifts, tobacco, and knives and the like. Tell them silliness about German Geordie, as though the King was like to come and sit down by the council fires at the next Rabbit Moon and speak like a man.</p><p>He smiled grimly to think of it. The notion was plain enough; cozen the Indians to fight for the English, when fighting was needed. But why should they think it needed now? The French had yielded, retreated to their northern foothold in Canada.</p><p>Oh. He remembered belatedly what Brianna had told him about the new fighting to come. He\u2019d not known whether to believe her\u2014perhaps she was right, though, in which case . . . he didn\u2019t want to think about it. Or about anything.</p><p>Rollo padded over to him, sat and leaned heavily against him. He leaned back, resting his head in the thick fur.</p> <p>An Indian agent had come once, while he lived in Snaketown. A fat wee fellow, shifty-eyed and with a tremble in his voice. He thought the man\u2014Christ, what was his name? The Mohawk had called him Bad Sweat, and that fit; he stank as though with a mortal illness\u2014he thought the man was not accustomed to the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka; he\u2019d not much of their speech, and plainly expected them to take his scalp at any moment, something they had thought hilarious\u2014and one or two would likely have tried it, for a joke, save that Tewaktenyonh said to treat him with respect. Ian had been pressed to interpret for him, a job he\u2019d done, though without much pleasure in it. He would much sooner think himself Mohawk than acknowledge any kinship with Bad Sweat.</p><p>Uncle Jamie, though . . . he\u2019d make a better job of it, by far. Would he do it? Ian listened to the voices with a vague sense of interest, but it was clear that Uncle Jamie would not be pressed for a decision. MacDonald might as soon get a grip on a frog in a spring, he thought, hearing his uncle elude commitment.</p><p>He sighed, put his arm around Rollo, and eased more of his weight onto the dog. He felt awful. He would have supposed he was dying, save that Auntie Claire had said he\u2019d feel poorly for several days. He was sure she would have stayed if he were dying, not gone and left him with only Rollo for company.</p><p>The shutters were still open, and cold air poured over him, chilly and soft at once, the way spring nights were. He felt Rollo raise his nose, sniffing, and utter a low, eager whine. Possum, maybe, or a raccoon.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d he said, straightening up and giving the dog a small push. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>The dog sniffed him suspiciously, and tried to lick the back of his head, where the stitches were, but left off when Ian yelped and covered them with his hands.</p><p>\u201cGo, I said!\u201d He cuffed the dog gently, and Rollo snorted, circled once, then sailed over his head and out through the window, hitting the ground outside with a solid thump. A frightful screech rent the air and there was the sound of scrabbling feet and heavy bodies tearing through shrubbery.</p><p>Startled voices came from the direction of the kitchen, and he heard Uncle Jamie\u2019s step in the hall, an instant before the surgery door pushed in.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d called his uncle softly. \u201cWhere are ye, lad? What\u2019s amiss?\u201d</p><p>He stood up, but a sheet of blinding white came down inside his eyes and he staggered. Uncle Jamie caught him by the arm, and set him down on a stool.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, lad?\u201d His vision clearing, he could see his uncle in the light from the door, rifle in one hand, his face looking concerned but humorous as he glanced toward the open window. He sniffed deeply. \u201cNot a skunk, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, I suppose it\u2019s one thing or the other,\u201d Ian said, touching his head gingerly. \u201cEither Rollo\u2019s gone after a painter, or he\u2019s treed Auntie\u2019s cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. He\u2019d fare better wi\u2019 the painter.\u201d His uncle set the rifle down and went to the window. \u201cShall I close the shutter, or d\u2019ye need the air, lad? You\u2019re that bit peaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel peaked,\u201d Ian admitted. \u201cAye, leave it, if ye will, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall ye rest, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. His stomach still lurched uneasily and he felt very much that he would like to lie down again\u2014but the surgery made him uneasy, with its strong smells and the glints here and there of tiny blades and other mysterious and painful things. Uncle Jamie seemed to guess the trouble, for he bent and got a hand under Ian\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cCome along, lad. Ye can sleep upstairs in a proper bed, if ye dinna mind Major MacDonald in the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna mind,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll stay here, I think.\u201d He gestured toward the window, not wanting to nod and bother his head again. \u201cRollo will likely be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Jamie didn\u2019t argue with him, something he was grateful for. Women fussed. Men just got on with it.</p> <p>His uncle boosted him unceremoniously back into his bed, covered him up, then began rootling about in the dark, in search of the rifle he had put down. Ian began to feel that perhaps he could do with just a wee bit of fuss, after all.</p><p>\u201cCould ye get me a cup o\u2019 water, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh? Oh, aye.\u201d</p><p>Auntie Claire had left a jug of water close to hand. There was the comfortable sound of glugging liquid, and then the rim of a pottery cup held to his mouth, his uncle\u2019s hand at his back to keep him upright. He didn\u2019t need it, but didn\u2019t object; the touch was warm and comforting. He hadn\u2019t realized how chilled he was from the night air, and shivered briefly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, laddie?\u201d Uncle Jamie murmured, his hand tightening on Ian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAye, fine. Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMphm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Auntie Claire tell ye about\u2014about a war? One coming, I mean. With England.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence, his uncle\u2019s big form gone still against the light from the door.</p><p>\u201cShe has,\u201d he said, and took away his hand. \u201cDid she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cousin Brianna did.\u201d He lay down on his side, careful of his tender head. \u201cD\u2019ye believe them?\u201d</p><p>There was no hesitation this time.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d It was said with his uncle\u2019s usual dry matter-of-factness, but something in it prickled the hairs on the back of Ian\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then.\u201d</p><p>The goose-down pillow was soft under his cheek, and smelled of lavender. His uncle\u2019s hand touched his head, smoothed the ruffled hair back from his face.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself about it, Ian,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s time, yet.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the gun and left. From where he lay, Ian could see across the dooryard and above the trees where they dropped from the edge of the Ridge, past the slope of Black Mountain, and on into the black sky beyond, thick with stars.</p><p>He heard the back door open, and Mrs. Bug\u2019s voice, rising high above the others.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re no to hame, sir,\u201d she was saying, breathless. \u201cAnd the hoose is dark, no fire in the hearth. Wherever might they go, this time o\u2019 night?\u201d</p><p>He wondered dimly who was gone, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter much. If it was trouble, Uncle Jamie would deal with it. The thought was comforting; he felt like a small boy, safe in bed, hearing his father\u2019s voice outside, talking to a tenant in the cold dark of a Highland dawn.</p><p>Warmth spread slowly over him beneath the quilt, and he slept.</p><p>THE MOON WAS beginning to rise when they set out, and a good thing, too, Brianna thought. Even with the big, lopsided gold orb sailing up out of a cradle of stars and shedding its borrowed radiance over the sky, the trail beneath their feet was invisible. So were their feet, drowned in the absolute black of the forest at night.</p><p>Black, but not quiet. The giant trees rustled overhead, small things squealed and snuffled in the dark, and now and then the silent flutter of a bat passed close enough to startle her, as though part of the night had suddenly come loose and taken wing under her nose.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat is an apprehensive cat?\u201d Roger suggested, as she gasped and clutched at him in the wake of one such leather-winged visitation.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat is an . . . appreciative cat,\u201d she replied, squeezing his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d They\u2019d likely end up sleeping on their cloaks in front of the McGillivrays\u2019 fire, instead of cozily tucked up in their own bed\u2014but at least they\u2019d have Jemmy.</p><p>He squeezed back, his hand bigger and stronger than hers, very reassuring in the dark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI want him, too. It\u2019s a night to have your family all together, safe in one place.\u201d</p><p>She made a small sound in her throat, acknowledgment and appreciation, but wanted to keep up the conversation, as much to keep the sense of connection with him as because it would keep the dark at bay.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat was a very eloquent cat,\u201d she said delicately. \u201cAt the\u2014the funeral, I mean. For those poor people.\u201d</p><p>Roger snorted; she saw the brief curl of his breath, white on the air.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat was a highly embarrassed cat,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father!\u201d</p><p>She smiled, since he couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>\u201cYou did really well,\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said, with another brief snort. \u201cAs for eloquence . . . if there was any, it was none of mine. All I did was quote bits of some psalm\u2014I couldna even tell ye which it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. Why did you pick\u2014what you said, though?\u201d she asked, curious. \u201cI sort of thought you\u2019d say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, or maybe the Twenty-Third Psalm\u2014everybody knows that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I would, too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI meant to. But when I came to it . . .\u201d He hesitated, and she saw in memory those raw, cold mounds, and shivered, smelling soot. He tightened his grasp on her hand, and drew her closer, tucking the hand into the crook of his elbow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cIt just seemed\u2014more suitable, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she said quietly, but didn\u2019t pursue the subject, choosing instead to steer the conversation into a discussion of her latest engineering project, a hand pump to raise water from the well.</p><p>\u201cIf I had something to use for pipe, I could get water into the house, easy as anything! I\u2019ve already got most of the wood I need for a nice cistern, if I can get Ronnie to cooper it for me\u2014so we can shower with rainwater, at least. But hollowing out tree limbs\u201d\u2014the method employed for the small amount of piping used for the pump\u2014\u201cit would take me months to manage enough just to get from the well to the house, let alone the stream. And there\u2019s not a chance of getting any rolled copper. Even if we could afford any, which we can\u2019t, bringing it up from Wilmington would be\u2014\u201d She threw her free hand up in frustration at the monumental nature of the undertaking.</p><p>He considered that for a bit, the chuff of their shoes on the rocky trail a comforting rhythm.</p><p>\u201cWell, the ancient Romans did it with concrete; the recipe\u2019s in Pliny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it takes a particular kind of sand, which we don\u2019t happen to have. Likewise, quicklime, which we likewise don\u2019t have. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but what about clay?\u201d he interrupted. \u201cDid ye see that plate at Hilda\u2019s wedding? The big brown and red one, with the beautiful patterns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUte McGillivray said someone from Salem brought it. I dinna recall the name, but she said he was quite the big noise in potting\u2014or whatever ye call making dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you any amount of money she didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, words to that effect.\u201d He went on, undeterred. \u201cThe point being that he made it here; it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d brought from Germany. So there\u2019s clay about that\u2019s suitable for firing, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Hmm. Well, now, that\u2019s an idea, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was, and an attractive one whose discussion occupied them for most of the rest of the journey.</p><p>They had come down off the Ridge and were within a quarter-mile of the McGillivrays\u2019 place when she began to have an uneasy feeling down the back of her neck. It could be only imagination; after the sights they had seen in that deserted hollow, the dark air of the wood seemed thick with threat, and she had been imagining ambush at every blind bend, tensing with the anticipation of attack.</p><p>Then she heard something crack in the trees to her right\u2014a small dry branch breaking, in a way that neither wind nor animal would break it. Real danger had its own taste, vivid as lemon juice, by contrast with the weak lemonade of imagination.</p><p>Her hand tightened on Roger\u2019s arm in warning, and he stopped at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered, hand on his knife. \u201cWhere?\u201d He hadn\u2019t heard it.</p><p>Damn, why hadn\u2019t she brought her gun, or at least her own dirk? All she had was her Swiss Army knife, carried always in her pocket\u2014and what weapons the landscape offered.</p><p>She leaned into Roger, pointing, her hand close to his body to be sure he followed the direction of her gesture. Then she stooped, feeling about in the darkness for a rock, or a stick to use as a club.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat is a fraidy cat, is she?\u201d he said, his tone one of fairly convincing teasing.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat is a ferocious cat,\u201d she replied, trying to match his bantering tone, meanwhile fumbling one-handed in her pocket. Her other hand closed on a stone, and she pulled it free of the clinging dirt, cold and heavy in her palm. She rose, all her senses focused on the darkness to their right. \u201cShe\u2019ll freaking disembowel anything that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said a voice in the woods behind her.</p><p>She shrieked, and Roger jerked in reflex, spun on his heel to face the threat, grabbed her and thrust her behind him, all in the same motion.</p><p>The push sent her staggering backward. She caught a heel in a hidden root in the dark, and fell, landing hard on her backside, from which position she had an excellent view of Roger in the moonlight, knife in hand, charging into the trees with an incoherent roar.</p><p>Belatedly, she registered what the voice had said, as well as the unmistakable tone of disappointment in it. A very similar voice, loud with alarm, spoke from the wood on the right.</p><p>\u201cJo?\u201d it said. \u201cWhat? Jo, what?\u201d</p><p>There was a lot of thrashing and yelling going on in the woods to the left. Roger\u2019d got his hands on someone.</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d she shouted. \u201cRoger, stop! It\u2019s the Beardsleys!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d dropped the rock when she fell, and now got to her feet, rubbing the dirt from her hand on the side of her skirt. Her heart was still pounding, her left buttock was bruised, and her urge to laugh was tinged with a strong desire to strangle one or both of the Beardsley twins.</p><p>\u201cKezzie Beardsley, come out of there!\u201d she bellowed, then repeated it, even louder. Kezzie\u2019s hearing had improved after her mother had removed his chronically infected tonsils and adenoids, but he was still rather deaf.</p><p>A loud rustling in the brush yielded the slight form of Keziah Beardsley, dark-haired, white-faced, and armed with a large club, which he swung off his shoulder and tried abashedly to hide behind him when he saw her.</p><p>Meanwhile, much louder rustling and a certain amount of cursing behind her portended the emergence of Roger, gripping the scrawny neck of Josiah Beardsley, Kezzie\u2019s twin.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of God d\u2019ye wee bastards think ye\u2019re up to?\u201d Roger said, shoving Jo across to stand by his brother in a patch of moonlight. \u201cD\u2019ye realize I nearly killed you?\u201d</p><p>There was just enough light for Brianna to make out the rather cynical expression that crossed Jo\u2019s face at this, before it was erased and replaced with one of earnest apology.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re that sorry, Mr. Mac. We heard someone coming, and thought it might be brigands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrigands,\u201d Brianna repeated, feeling the urge to laugh rising, but keeping it firmly in check. \u201cWhere on earth did you get that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jo looked at his feet, hands clasped behind his back. \u201cMiss Lizzie was a-readin\u2019 to us, from that book what Mr. Jamie brought. \u2019Twas in there. About brigands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She glanced at Roger, who met her eye, his annoyance obviously waning into amusement, as well. \u201cThe Pirate Gow,\u201d she explained. \u201cDefoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Roger sheathed his dirk. \u201cAnd why, exactly, did ye think there might be brigands coming?\u201d</p><p>Kezzie, with the quirks of his erratic hearing, picked that up and answered, as earnestly as his brother, though his voice was louder and slightly flat, the result of his early deafness.</p><p>\u201cWe come across Mr. Lindsay, sir, on his way home, and he did tell us what passed, up by Dutchman\u2019s Creek. It\u2019s true, so, what he said? They was all burned to cinders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were all dead.\u201d Roger\u2019s voice had lost any tinge of amusement. \u201cWhat\u2019s that to do with you lot lurking in the woods with clubs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, sir, McGillivrays\u2019 is a fine, big place, what with the cooper\u2019s shop and the new house and all, and being on a road, like\u2014well, if I was a brigand, sir, \u2019tis just the sort of place I might choose,\u201d replied Jo.</p><p>\u201cAnd Miss Lizzie\u2019s there, with her Pap. And your son, Mr. Mac,\u201d Kezzie added pointedly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t want no harm to come to \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Roger smiled a little crookedly. \u201cWell, thanks to ye, then, for the kind thought. I doubt the brigands will be anywhere near, though; Dutchman\u2019s Creek is a long way away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d Jo agreed. \u201cBut brigands might be anywhere, mightn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>This was undeniable, and sufficiently true as to give Brianna a renewed feeling of chill in the pit of the stomach.</p><p>\u201cThey might be, but they aren\u2019t,\u201d Roger assured them. \u201cCome along to the house with us, aye? We\u2019re just going to collect wee Jem. I\u2019m sure Frau Ute would give ye a bed by the fire.\u201d</p><p>The Beardsleys exchanged inscrutable looks. They were nearly identical\u2014small and lithe, with thick dark hair, distinguished only by Kezzie\u2019s deafness and the round scar on Jo\u2019s thumb\u2014and to see the two fine-boned faces wearing precisely the same expression was a little unnerving.</p><p>Whatever information had been exchanged by that look, it had evidently included as much consultation as was required, for Kezzie nodded slightly, deferring to his brother.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, sir,\u201d Josiah said politely. \u201cWe\u2019ll bide, I think.\u201d And with no further talk, the two of them turned and crunched off into the dark, scuffling leaves and rocks as they went.</p><p>\u201cJo! Wait!\u201d Brianna called after them, her hand having found something else in the bottom of her pocket.</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am?\u201d Josiah was back, appearing by her elbow with unsettling abruptness. His twin was no stalker, but Jo was.</p><p>\u201cOh! I mean, oh, there you are.\u201d She took a deep breath to slow her heart, and handed him the carved whistle she\u2019d made for Germain. \u201cHere. If you\u2019re going to stand guard, this might be helpful. To call for help, if someone should come.\u201d</p><p>Jo Beardsley had plainly never seen a whistle before, but didn\u2019t care to admit it. He turned the little object over in his hand, trying not to stare at it.</p><p>Roger reached out, took it from him, and blew a healthy blast that shattered the night. Several birds, startled from their rest, shot out of the nearby trees, shrieking, followed closely by Kezzie Beardsley, eyes huge with amazement.</p><p>\u201cBlow in that end,\u201d Roger said, tapping the appropriate end of the whistle before handing it back. \u201cSqueeze your lips a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch obliged, sir,\u201d Jo murmured. His normal stoic facade had shattered with the silence, and he took the whistle with the wide-eyed look of a boy on Christmas morning, turning at once to show the prize to his twin. It struck her quite suddenly that neither boy likely ever had had a Christmas morning\u2014or any other sort of gift.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make another one for you,\u201d she told Kezzie. \u201cThen the two of you can signal back and forth. If you see any brigands,\u201d she added, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll do that, we surely will!\u201d he assured her, scarcely glancing at her in his eagerness to examine the whistle his brother had put in his hands.</p><p>\u201cBlow it three times, if ye want help,\u201d Roger called after them, taking her arm.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir!\u201d came back from the darkness, followed by a belated faint \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am!\u201d\u2014this in turn followed at once by a fusillade of puffs, gasps, and breathless rattles, punctuated by briefly successful shrill toots.</p><p>\u201cLizzie\u2019s been teaching them manners, I see,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAs well as their letters. D\u2019ye think they\u2019ll ever be truly civilized, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, with a trace of regret.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She couldn\u2019t see his face in the dark, but heard the surprise in his voice. \u201cI was only joking. Ye really think not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014and no wonder, after the way they grew up. Did you see the way they were with that whistle? No one\u2019s ever given them a present, or a toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. D\u2019ye think that\u2019s what makes boys civilized? If so, I imagine wee Jem will be a philosopher or an artist or something. Mrs. Bug spoils him rotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, as if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said tolerantly. \u201cAnd Da, and Lizzie, and Mama, and everyone else in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Roger said, unembarrassed at the accusation. \u201cWait \u2019til he has a bit of competition. Germain\u2019s in no danger of spoiling, is he?\u201d Germain, Fergus and Marsali\u2019s eldest son, was harried by two small sisters, known to one and all as the hell-kittens, who followed their brother constantly, teasing and pestering.</p><p>She laughed, but felt a slight sense of uneasiness. The thought of another baby always made her feel as though she were perched at the top of a roller coaster, short of breath and stomach clenched, poised somewhere between excitement and terror. Particularly now, with the memory of their lovemaking still softly heavy, shifting like mercury in her belly.</p><p>Roger seemed to sense her ambivalence, for he didn\u2019t pursue the subject, but reached for her hand and held it, his own large and warm. The air was cold, the last vestiges of a winter chill lingering in the hollows.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Fergus, then?\u201d he asked, taking up an earlier thread of the conversation. \u201cFrom what I hear, he hadn\u2019t much of a childhood, either, but he seems fairly civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt Jenny had the raising of him from the time he was ten,\u201d she objected. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met my aunt Jenny, but believe me, she could have civilized Adolf Hitler, if she put her mind to it. Besides, Fergus grew up in Paris, not the backwoods\u2014even if it was in a brothel. And it sounds like it was a pretty high-class brothel, too, from what Marsali tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? What does she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just stories that he\u2019s told her, now and then. About the clients, and the wh\u2014the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan ye not say \u2018whore,\u2019 then?\u201d he asked, amused. She felt the blood rise in her cheeks, and was pleased that it was dark; he teased her more when she blushed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it that I went to a Catholic school,\u201d she said, defensive. \u201cEarly conditioning.\u201d It was true; she couldn\u2019t say certain words, save when in the grip of fury or when mentally prepared. \u201cWhy can you, though? You\u2019d think a preacher\u2019s lad would have the same problem.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a little wryly.</p><p>\u201cNot precisely the same problem. It was more a matter of feeling obliged to curse and carry on in front of my friends, to prove I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of carrying on?\u201d she asked, scenting a story. He didn\u2019t often talk about his early life in Inverness, adopted by his great-uncle, a Presbyterian minister, but she loved hearing the small tidbits he sometimes let fall.</p><p>\u201cOch. Smoking, drinking beer, and writing filthy words on the walls in the boys\u2019 toilet,\u201d he said, the smile evident in his voice. \u201cTipping over dustbins. Letting air out of automobile tires. Stealing sweeties from the Post Office. Quite the wee criminal I was, for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe terror of Inverness, huh? Did you have a gang?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, and laughed. \u201cGerry MacMillan, Bobby Cawdor, and Dougie Buchanan. I was odd man out, not only for being the preacher\u2019s lad, but for having an English father and an English name. So I was always out to show them I was a hard man. Meaning I was usually the one in most trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were a juvenile delinquent,\u201d she said, charmed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, not for long,\u201d he assured her wryly. \u201cCome the summer I was fifteen, the Reverend signed me up on a fishing boat, and sent me to sea with the herring fleet. Couldna just say whether he did it to improve my character, keep me out of jail, or only because he couldn\u2019t stand me round the house any longer, but it did work. Ye want to meet hard men sometime, go to sea with a bunch of Gaelic fishermen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that,\u201d she said, trying not to giggle and producing a series of small, wet snorts instead. \u201cDid your friends end up in jail, then, or did they go straight, without you to mislead them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougie joined the army,\u201d he said, a tinge of wistfulness in his voice. \u201cGerry took over his dad\u2019s shop\u2014his dad was a tobacconist. Bobby . . . aye, well, Bobby\u2019s dead. Drowned, that same summer, out lobstering with his cousin off Oban.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer to him and squeezed his hand, her shoulder brushing his in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, then paused. \u201cOnly . . . he isn\u2019t dead, is he? Not yet. Not now.\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, and made a small sound of mingled humor and dismay.</p><p>\u201cIs that a comfort?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is it horrible to think about?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to keep him talking; he hadn\u2019t talked so much in one go since the hanging that had taken his singing voice. Being forced to speak in public made him self-conscious, and his throat tightened. His voice was still rasping, but relaxed as he was now, he wasn\u2019t choking or coughing.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he said, and made the sound again. \u201cI\u2019ll never see him again, either way.\u201d He shrugged slightly, pushing the thought away. \u201cD\u2019ye think of your old friends much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not much,\u201d she said softly. The trail narrowed here, and she linked her arm in his, drawing close as they approached the last turn, which would bring them in sight of the McGillivrays\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s too much here.\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to talk about what wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Jo and Kezzie are just playing?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr are they up to something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should they be up to?\u201d he asked, accepting her change of subject without comment. \u201cI canna think they\u2019re lying in wait to commit highway robbery\u2014not at this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe them about standing guard,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d do anything to protect Lizzie. Only\u2014\u201d She paused. They had come out of the forest onto the wagon road; the far verge fell away in a steep bank, looking at night like a bottomless pool of black velvet\u2014by daylight, it would be a tangled mass of fallen snags, clumps of rhododendron, redbud, and dogwood, overgrown with the snarls of ancient grapevines and creepers. The road made a switchback further on and curved back on itself, arriving gently at the McGillivrays\u2019 place, a hundred feet below.</p><p>\u201cThe lights are still on,\u201d she said with some surprise. The small group of buildings\u2014the Old Place, the New Place, Ronnie Sinclair\u2019s cooper\u2019s shop, Dai Jones\u2019s blacksmith\u2019s forge and cabin\u2014were mostly dark, but the lower windows of the McGillivrays\u2019 New Place were striped with light, leaking through the cracks of the shutters, and a bonfire in front of the house made a brilliant blot of light against the dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKenny Lindsay,\u201d Roger said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe Beardsleys said they\u2019d met him. He\u2019ll have stopped to share the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. We\u2019d better be careful, then; if they\u2019re looking out for brigands, too, they might shoot at anything that moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight; it\u2019s a party, remember? What were ye saying, though, about the Beardsley boys protecting Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her toe stubbed against some hidden obstacle, and she clutched his arm to keep from falling. \u201cOof! Only that I wasn\u2019t sure who they thought they were protecting her from.\u201d</p> <p>Roger tightened his grip on her arm in reflex.</p><p>\u201cWhatever d\u2019ye mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that if I were Manfred McGillivray, I\u2019d take good care to be nice to Lizzie. Mama says the Beardsleys follow her around like dogs, but they don\u2019t. They follow her like tame wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Ian said it wasn\u2019t possible to tame wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s hurry, before they smoor the fire.\u201d</p> <p>THE BIG LOG HOUSE was literally overflowing with people. Light spilled from the open door and glowed in the row of tiny arrow-slit windows that marched across the front of the house, and dark forms wove in and out of the bonfire\u2019s light. The sounds of a fiddle came to them, thin and sweet through the dark, borne on the wind with the scent of roasting meat.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Senga\u2019s truly made her choice, then,\u201d Roger said, taking her arm for the final steep descent to the crossroad. \u201cWho d\u2019ye bet it is? Ronnie Sinclair or the German lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a bet? What are the stakes? Woops!\u201d She stumbled, tripping on a half-buried rock in the path, but Roger tightened his grip, keeping her upright.</p><p>\u201cLoser sets the pantry to rights,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cI think she chose Heinrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? Well, ye may be right,\u201d he said, sounding amused. \u201cBut I have to tell you, it was five to three in favor of Ronnie, last I heard. Frau Ute\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Brianna admitted. \u201cAnd if it was Hilda or Inga, I\u2019d say it was no contest. But Senga\u2019s got her mother\u2019s personality; nobody\u2019s telling her what to do\u2014not even Frau Ute.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they get \u2018Senga,\u2019 anyway?\u201d she added. \u201cThere are lots of Ingas and Hildas over toward Salem, but I\u2019ve never heard of another Senga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, ye wouldn\u2019t\u2014not in Salem. It\u2019s not a German name, ken\u2014it\u2019s Scots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScots?\u201d she said in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, the grin evident in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s Agnes, spelt backward. A girl named that is bound to be contrary, don\u2019t ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding! Agnes, spelled backward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna say it\u2019s common, exactly, but I\u2019ve certainly met one or two Sengas in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p> <p>\u201cDo the Scots do that with any other names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack-spelling?\u201d He considered. \u201cWell, I did go to school with a lass named Adnil, and there was a grocer\u2019s lad who got in the messages for old ladies in the neighborhood\u2014his name\u2019s pronounced \u2018Kirry,\u2019 but it\u2019s spelt \u2018C-i-r-e.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She looked sharply at him, in case he was teasing, but he wasn\u2019t. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI think Mama\u2019s right about Scots. So yours spelled backward would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegor,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cSounds like something from a Godzilla film, doesn\u2019t it? A giant eel, maybe, or a beetle with death-ray eyes.\u201d He sounded pleased at the notion.</p><p>\u201cYou thought about it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cWhich would you rather be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when I was a kid, I thought the beetle with the death-ray eyes would be best,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThen I went to sea and started hauling up the occasional Moray eel in my net. Those are not the kind of thing ye\u2019d want to meet in a dark alley, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore agile than Godzilla, at least,\u201d she said, shuddering slightly at the recollection of the one Moray eel she\u2019d met personally. A four-foot length of spring steel and rubber, fast as lightning and equipped with a mouthful of razors, it had come up from the hold of a fishing boat she\u2019d watched being unloaded in a little port town called MacDuff.</p><p>She and Roger had been leaning on a low rock wall, idly watching the gulls hover in the wind, when a shout of alarm from the fishing boat just below had made them look down in time to see fishermen scrambling back from something on deck.</p><p>A dark sine wave had flashed through the silver wash of fish on deck, shot under the rail, and landed on the wet stones of the quay, where it had caused similar panic among the fishermen hosing down their gear, writhing and lashing about like a crazed high-tension cable until one rubber-booted man, gathering his self-possession, had rushed up and kicked it back into the water.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re no really bad sorts, eels,\u201d Roger said judiciously, evidently recalling the same memory. \u201cYe canna blame them, after all; being dragged up from the bottom of the sea without warning\u2014anyone would thrash about a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they would,\u201d she said, thinking of themselves. She took his hand, threading her fingers between his, and found his firm, cold grip a comfort.</p><p>They were close enough now to catch snatches of laughter and talk, billowing up into the cold night with the smoke of the fire. There were children running loose; she saw two small forms dart through the legs of the crowd around the fire, black and thin-limbed as Halloween goblins.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Jem, surely? No, he was smaller, and surely Lizzie wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cMej,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem, backward,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was just thinking it would be a lot of fun to see Godzilla films with him. Maybe he\u2019d like to be the beetle with death-ray eyes. Be fun, aye?\u201d</p><p>He sounded so wistful that a lump came to her throat, and she squeezed his hand hard, then swallowed.</p><p>\u201cTell him Godzilla stories,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s make-believe anyway. I\u2019ll draw him pictures.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you do, and they\u2019ll be stoning ye for trafficking with the devil, Bree. Godzilla looks like something straight out of the Book of Revelation\u2014or so I was told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho . . . oh,\u201d she said, going into mental reverse. \u201cReggie? Who\u2019s Reggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Reverend.\u201d His great-uncle, his adoptive father. There was still a smile in his voice, but one tinged with nostalgia. \u201cWhen we went to the monster films together of a Saturday. Eigger and Regor\u2014and ye should have seen the looks on the faces of the Ladies\u2019 Altar and Tea Society, when Mrs. Graham let them in without announcing them, and they came into the Reverend\u2019s study to find us stamping round and roaring, kicking hell out of a Tokyo built of blocks and soup tins.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but felt tears prick at the backs of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known the Reverend,\u201d she said, squeezing his hand.</p><p>\u201cI wish ye had, too,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHe would have liked ye so much, Bree.\u201d</p><p>For the space of a few moments, while he talked, the dark forest and the flaming fire below had faded away; they were in Inverness, cozy in the Reverend\u2019s study, with rain on the windows and the sound of traffic going by in the street. It happened so often when they talked like this, between themselves. Then some small thing would fracture the moment\u2014now, it was a shout from the fire as people began to clap and sing\u2014and the world of their own time vanished in an instant.</p><p>What if he were gone, she thought suddenly. Could I bring it back, all by myself?</p><p>A spasm of elemental panic gripped her, just for a moment, at the thought. Without Roger as her touchstone, with nothing but her own memories to serve as anchor to the future, that time would be lost. Would fade into hazy dreams, and be lost, leaving her no firm ground of reality to stand upon.</p><p>She took a deep breath of the cold night air, crisp with woodsmoke, and dug the balls of her feet hard into the ground as they walked, trying to feel solid.</p><p>\u201cMamaMamaMAMA!\u201d A small blob detached itself from the confusion round the fire and rocketed toward her, crashing into her knees with enough force to make her grab hold of Roger\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cJem! There you are!\u201d She scooped him up and buried her face in his hair, which smelled pleasantly of goats, hay, and spicy sausage. He was heavy, and more than solid.</p><p>Then Ute McGillivray turned and saw them. Her broad face was creased in a frown, but broke into a beam of delight at seeing them. People turned at her call of greeting, and they were engulfed at once by the crowd, everyone asking questions, expressing gratified surprise at their coming.</p><p>A few questions were asked about the Dutch family, but Kenny Lindsay had brought the news of the burning earlier; Brianna was glad of that. People clucked and shook their heads, but by now they had exhausted most of their horrified speculations, and were turning to other matters. The cold of the graves beneath the fir trees still lingered as a faint chill on her heart; she had no wish to make that experience real again by talking about it.</p><p>The newly engaged couple were seated together on a pair of upturned buckets, holding hands, faces blissful in the glow of the bonfire.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d Brianna said, smiling at sight of them. \u201cDon\u2019t they look happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d Roger agreed. \u201cI doubt Ronnie Sinclair is. Is he here?\u201d He glanced round, and so did she, but the cooper was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014he\u2019s in his shop,\u201d she said, putting a hand on Roger\u2019s wrist and nodding toward the small building on the opposite side of the road. There were no windows on this side of the cooper\u2019s shop, but a faint glow showed round the edge of the closed door.</p><p>Roger glanced from the darkened shop to the convivial crowd round the fire; a good many of Ute\u2019s relations had ridden over with the lucky bridegroom and his friends from Salem, bringing with them an immense barrel of black beer, which was adding to the festivities. The air was yeasty with the tang of hops.</p><p>By contrast, the cooper\u2019s shop had a desolate, glowering sort of air about it. She wondered whether anyone around the fire had yet missed Ronnie Sinclair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and have a bit of a blether with him, aye?\u201d Roger touched her back in brief affection. \u201cHe could maybe use a sympathetic ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and a stiff drink?\u201d She nodded toward the house, where Robin McGillivray was visible through the open door, pouring what she assumed to be whisky for a select circle of friends.</p><p>\u201cI imagine he will have managed that for himself,\u201d Roger replied dryly. He left her, making his way around the convivial group by the fire. He disappeared in the dark, but then she saw the door of the cooper\u2019s shop open, and Roger silhouetted briefly against the glow from within, his tall form blocking the light before vanishing inside.</p><p>\u201cWanna drink, Mama!\u201d Jemmy was wriggling like a tadpole, trying to get down. She set him on the ground, and he was off like a shot, nearly upsetting a stout lady with a platter of corn fritters.</p><p>The aroma of the steaming fritters reminded her that she hadn\u2019t had any supper, and she made her way after Jemmy to the table of food, where Lizzie, in her role as almost-daughter-of-the-house, helped her importantly to sauerkraut, sausages, smoked eggs, and something involving corn and squash.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sweetheart, Lizzie?\u201d she asked, teasing. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be spooning with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him?\u201d Lizzie looked like someone recalling a thing of vague general interest, but no immediate importance. \u201cManfred, ye mean? He\u2019s . . . ower there.\u201d She squinted against the glow of the fire, then pointed with her serving spoon. Manfred McGillivray, her own betrothed, was with three or four other young men, all with arms linked, swaying to and fro as they sang something in German. They appeared to have trouble remembering the words, as each verse dissolved into giggles and shoving accusations.</p><p>\u201cHere, Sch\u00e4tzchen\u2014that\u2019s \u2018sweetheart,\u2019 ken, in German,\u201d Lizzie explained, leaning down to give Jemmy a bite of sausage. He snapped the tidbit up like a starving seal and chewed industriously, then mumbled, \u201cWagga gink,\u201d and wandered off into the night.</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d Brianna made to go after him, but was hampered by an oncoming crowd headed for the table.</p><p>\u201cAh, dinna fash yourself about him,\u201d Lizzie assured her. \u201cEveryone kens who he is; he\u2019ll come to nay harm.\u201d</p><p>She might still have gone after him, save that she saw a small blond head pop up beside Jem\u2019s. Germain, Jem\u2019s bosom friend. Germain was two years older, and had a great deal more worldly knowledge than the average five-year-old, thanks in great part to his father\u2019s tutelage. She did hope he wasn\u2019t picking pockets in the crowd, and made a mental note to frisk him for contraband, later.</p><p>Germain had Jem firmly by the hand, so she allowed herself to be persuaded to sit down with Lizzie, Inga, and Hilda, on the bales of straw that had been placed a little way from the fire.</p><p>\u201cUnd where\u2019s your sweetheart, then?\u201d teased Hilda. \u201cYon big bonny black devil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him?\u201d Brianna said, mimicking Lizzie, and they all broke into rather unladylike roars of laughter; evidently the beer had been making the rounds for some time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s comforting Ronnie,\u201d she said, with a nod toward the darkened cooper\u2019s shop. \u201cIs your mother upset about Senga\u2019s choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, aye,\u201d said Inga, rolling her eyes with great expressiveness. \u201cShould ha\u2019 heard them at it, her and Senga. Hammer and tongs, hammer and tongs. Da went out to the fishing, and stayed awa\u2019 three days.\u201d</p><p>Brianna ducked her head to hide a grin. Robin McGillivray liked a peaceful life, something he was never likely to enjoy in the company of his wife and daughters.</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Hilda said philosophically, leaning back a little to ease the strain of her first pregnancy, which was well advanced. \u201cShe couldna really say so much, meine Mutter. Heinrich\u2019s her own cousin\u2019s son, after all. Even if he is poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut young,\u201d Inga added practically. \u201cDa says Heinrich will have time to get rich.\u201d Ronnie Sinclair wasn\u2019t precisely rich\u2014and he was thirty years older than Senga. On the other hand, he did own both his cooper\u2019s shop and half of the house in which he and the McGillivrays lived. And Ute, having shepherded both her elder daughters to solid marriages with men of property, had obviously seen the advantages of a match between Senga and Ronnie.</p><p>\u201cI can see that it might be a little awkward,\u201d Brianna said tactfully. \u201cRonnie going on living with your family, after\u2014\u201d She nodded at the betrothed couple, who were feeding each other bits of cake.</p><p>\u201cHoo!\u201d Hilda exclaimed, rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m that glad not to be living here!\u201d</p><p>Inga nodded vigorous agreement, but added, \u201cWell, but Mutti isna the one to be greetin\u2019 over spilt milk. She\u2019s got an eye out for a wife for Ronnie. Just watch her.\u201d She nodded toward the food table, where Ute was chatting and smiling with a group of German women.</p><p>\u201cWho d\u2019ye think it is she has picked out?\u201d Inga asked her sister, eyes narrowed as she watched her mother operate. \u201cThat wee Gretchen? Or your Archie\u2019s cousin, maybe? The walleyed one\u2014Seona?\u201d</p><p>Hilda, married to a Scot from Surry County, shook her head at this.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll want a German girl,\u201d she objected. \u201cFor she\u2019ll be thinkin\u2019 of what will happen if Ronnie dies, and the wife marries again. If it\u2019s a German girl, chances are Mama can bully her into a new marriage with one of her nephews or cousins\u2014keep the property in the family, aye?\u201d</p><p>Brianna listened with fascination as the girls discussed the situation, with perfect matter-of-factness\u2014and wondered whether Ronnie Sinclair had the slightest idea that his fate was being decided in this pragmatic fashion. But he\u2019d been living with the McGillivrays for more than a year, she reasoned; he must have some idea of Ute\u2019s methods.</p><p>Thanking God silently that she was not herself compelled to live in the same house with the redoubtable Frau McGillivray, she looked round for Lizzie, feeling a pang of sympathy for her erstwhile bondmaid. Lizzie would be living with Ute, once her marriage to Manfred took place next year.</p><p>Hearing the name \u201cWemyss,\u201d she returned to the conversation at hand, only to discover that the girls were not discussing Lizzie, but rather her father.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Gertrud,\u201d declared Hilda, and belched softly, fist to her mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s a widow-woman herself; she\u2019d be the best for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie Gertrud would have poor wee Mr. Wemyss dead in a year,\u201d Inga objected, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s twice his size. If she didna kill him from exhaustion, she\u2019d roll over in her sleep and squash him flat.\u201d</p><p>Hilda clapped both hands to her mouth, but less in shock than to stifle her giggles. Brianna thought she\u2019d had her share of beer, too; her cap was awry and her pale face looked flushed, even by firelight.</p><p>\u201cAye, weel, I think he\u2019s no much bothered at the thought. See him?\u201d Hilda nodded past the beer-drinkers, and Brianna had no trouble picking out Mr. Wemyss\u2019s head, his hair pale and flyaway as his daughter\u2019s. He was in animated conversation with a stout woman in apron and cap, who nudged him intimately in the ribs, laughing.</p><p>As she watched, though, Ute McGillivray made her way toward them, followed by a tall blond woman, who hesitated a little, hands folded under her apron.</p><p>\u201cOh, who\u2019s that?\u201d Inga craned her neck like a goose, and her sister elbowed her, scandalized.</p><p>\u201cLass das, du alte Ziege! Mutti\u2019s looking this way!\u201d</p><p>Lizzie had half-risen to her knees, peering.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014?\u201d she said, sounding like an owl. Her attention was momentarily distracted by Manfred, who dropped beside her in the straw, grinning amiably.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then, Herzchen?\u201d he said, putting an arm round her waist and trying to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that, Freddie?\u201d she said, adroitly eluding his embrace and pointing discreetly toward the blond woman, who was smiling shyly as Frau Ute introduced her to Mr. Wemyss.</p><p>Manfred blinked, swaying a little on his knees, but answered readily enough.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s Fraulein Berrisch. Pastor Berrisch\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Inga and Hilda made little cooing sounds of interest; Lizzie frowned a little, but then relaxed, seeing her father tilt back his head to address the newcomer; Fraulein Berrisch was nearly as tall as Brianna herself.</p><p>Well, that explains why she\u2019s still a Fraulein, Brianna thought with sympathy. The woman\u2019s hair was streaked with gray, where it showed beneath her cap, and she had a rather plain face, though her eyes held a calm sweetness.</p><p>\u201cOh, a Protestant, then,\u201d Lizzie said, in a dismissive tone that made it clear that the Fraulein could hardly be considered as a potential mate for her father.</p><p>\u201cAye, but she\u2019s a nice woman, for a\u2019 that. Come and dance, Elizabeth.\u201d Manfred had clearly lost any interest in Mr. Wemyss and the Fraulein; he pulled Lizzie, protesting, to her feet, and propelled her toward the circle of dancers. She went reluctantly, but Brianna saw that by the time they had reached the dance, Lizzie was laughing at something Manfred had said, and he was smiling down at her, the firelight glowing on the handsome planes of his face. They were a nice-looking couple, she thought, better-matched in appearance than Senga and her Heinrich\u2014who was tall, but spindly and rather hatchet-faced.</p><p>Inga and Hilda had begun arguing with each other in German, allowing Brianna to devote herself to the wholehearted consumption of the excellent supper. Hungry as she was, she would have enjoyed almost anything, but the tart, crisp sauerkraut and the sausages, bursting with juice and spices, were a rare treat.</p><p>It was only as she wiped the last of the juice and grease from her wooden plate with a chunk of corn bread that she cast a glance at the cooper\u2019s shop, thinking guiltily that she ought perhaps to have saved some for Roger. He was so kind, taking thought for poor Ronnie\u2019s feelings. She felt a rush of pride and affection for him. Maybe she should go over there and rescue him.</p><p>She had put down her plate and was sorting out her skirts and petticoats, in preparation for putting this plan into action, when she was forestalled by a pair of small figures who came weaving out of the darkness.</p><p>\u201cJem?\u201d she said, startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>The flames gleamed on Jemmy\u2019s hair like freshly minted copper, but the face under it was white, and his eyes enormous dark pools, fixed and staring.</p><p>\u201cJemmy!\u201d</p><p>He turned a blank face to her, said \u201cMama?\u201d in a small, uncertain voice, then sat down suddenly, his legs collapsing under him like rubber bands.</p><p>She was dimly aware of Germain, swaying like a sapling in a high breeze, but had no attention to spare for him. She seized Jemmy, lifting his head and shaking him a little.</p><p>\u201cJemmy! Wake up! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wee laddie\u2019s dead drunk, a nighean,\u201d said a voice above her, sounding amused. \u201cWhatever have ye been givin\u2019 him?\u201d Robin McGillivray, rather obviously a little the worse for wear himself, leaned over and prodded Jemmy gently, eliciting nothing more than a soft gurgle. He picked up one of Jemmy\u2019s arms, then let it go; it fell, boneless as a strand of boiled spaghetti.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give him anything,\u201d she replied, panic giving way to a rising annoyance, as she saw that Jemmy was in fact merely asleep, his small chest rising and falling with a reassuring rhythm. \u201cGermain!\u201d</p><p>Germain had subsided into a small heap, and was singing \u201cAlouette\u201d to himself in a dreamy sort of way. Brianna had taught it to him; it was his favorite song.</p><p>\u201cGermain! What did you give Jemmy to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . j\u2019te plumerai la tete. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGermain!\u201d She grabbed him by the arm, and he ceased singing, looking surprised to see her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you give Jemmy, Germain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was thirsty, m\u2019dame,\u201d Germain said, with a smile of surpassing sweetness. \u201cHe wanted a drink.\u201d Then his eyes rolled back in his head, and he keeled over backward, limp as a dead fish.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus Christ on a piece of toast!\u201d</p><p>Inga and Hilda looked shocked, but she was in no mood to worry about their sensibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhere the bloody hell is Marsali?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no here,\u201d Inga said, bending forward to inspect Germain. \u201cShe stopped at hame wi\u2019 the wee maedchen. Fergus is . . .\u201d She straightened up, looking vaguely round. \u201cWell, I saw him a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d The hoarse voice at her shoulder surprised her, and she turned to find Roger looking quizzical, his face relaxed from its usual sternness.</p><p>\u201cYour son is a drunkard,\u201d she informed him. Then she caught a whiff of Roger\u2019s breath. \u201cFollowing in his father\u2019s footsteps, I see,\u201d she added coldly.</p><p>Disregarding this, Roger sat down beside her and gathered Jemmy up into his lap. Holding the little boy propped against his knees, he patted Jemmy\u2019s cheek, gently but insistently.</p><p>\u201cHallo there, Mej,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHallo, then. Ye\u2019re all right, are ye?\u201d</p><p>Like magic, Jemmy\u2019s eyelids floated up. He smiled dreamily at Roger.</p><p>\u201cHallo, Daddy.\u201d Still smiling beatifically, his eyes closed and he relaxed into utter limpness, cheek flattened against his father\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d Roger told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, good,\u201d she said, not particularly mollified. \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ve been drinking? Beer?\u201d</p><p>Roger leaned forward and sniffed at his offspring\u2019s red-stained lips.</p><p>\u201cCherry Bounce, at a guess. There\u2019s a vat of it, round by the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God!\u201d She\u2019d never drunk Cherry Bounce, but Mrs. Bug had told her how to make it: \u201cTak\u2019 the juice of a bushel o\u2019 cherries, dissolve twenty-four pound o\u2019 sugar ower it, then ye put it into a forty-gallon cask and fill it up wi\u2019 whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right.\u201d Roger patted her arm. \u201cIs that Germain over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She leaned over to check, but Germain was peacefully asleep, also smiling. \u201cThat Cherry Bounce must be good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. Like industrial-strength cough syrup. I will say it makes ye very cheerful, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking it?\u201d She eyed him narrowly, but his lips appeared to be their usual color.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her, to prove it. \u201cSurely ye dinna think a Scotsman like Ronnie would deal wi\u2019 disappointment by drinking Cherry Bounce? When there\u2019s decent whisky to hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said. She glanced at the cooperage. The faint glow from the hearth fire had faded and the outline of the door had disappeared, leaving the building no more than a faint rectangle of black against the darker mass of the forest beyond. \u201cHow is Ronnie dealing with it?\u201d She glanced round, but Inga and Hilda had taken themselves off to help Frau Ute; all of them were clustered round the food table, clearing things away.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s all right, Ronnie.\u201d Roger moved Jemmy off his lap, placing him gently on his side in the straw near Germain. \u201cHe wasna in love with Senga, after all. He\u2019s suffering from sexual frustration, not a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, if that\u2019s all,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cHe won\u2019t have to suffer much longer; I\u2019m informed that Frau Ute has the matter well in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she\u2019s told him she\u2019ll find him a wife. He\u2019s what ye might call philosophical about the matter. Though still reeking wi\u2019 lust,\u201d he added, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cEw. Do you want anything to eat?\u201d She glanced at the little boys, getting her feet under her. \u201cI\u2019d better get you something before Ute and the girls clear it all away.\u201d</p><p>Roger yawned, suddenly and immensely.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m all right.\u201d He blinked, smiling sleepily at her. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell Fergus where Germain is, maybe snatch a bite on the way.\u201d He patted her shoulder, then stood up, swaying only a little, and moved off toward the fire.</p><p>She checked the boys again; both were breathing deeply and regularly, dead to the world. With a sigh, she bundled them close together, piling up the straw around them, and covered them with her cloak. It was growing colder, but winter had gone; there was no feel of frost in the air.</p><p>The party was still going on, but it had shifted to a lower gear. The dancing had stopped and the crowd broken up into smaller groups, men gathered in a circle near the fire, lighting their pipes, the younger men disappeared somewhere. All around her, families were settling in for the night, making nests for themselves in the hay. Some were in the house, more in the barn; she could hear the sound of a guitar from somewhere behind the house, and a single voice, singing something slow and wistful. It made her yearn suddenly for the sound of Roger\u2019s voice as it had been, rich and tender.</p><p>Thinking of that, though, she realized something; his voice had been much better when he came back from consoling Ronnie. Still husky and with only a shadow of its former resonance\u2014but it had come easily, without that choked note in it. Perhaps alcohol relaxed the vocal cords?</p><p>More likely, she thought, it simply relaxed Roger; removed some of his inhibitions about the way he sounded. That was worth knowing. Her mother had opined that his voice would improve, if he would stretch it, work with it, but he was shy of using it, wary of pain\u2014whether from the actual sensation of speaking, or from the contrast with the way he had sounded before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll make a little Cherry Bounce,\u201d she said aloud. Then she looked at the two small forms slumbering in the hay, and contemplated the prospect of waking up alongside three hangovers, come morning. \u201cWell, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>She bunched up enough hay for a pillow, spread her folded kerchief over it\u2014they\u2019d be picking hay out of their clothes most of tomorrow\u2014and lay down, curling her body round Jem\u2019s. If either boy stirred or vomited in his sleep, she\u2019d feel it and rouse.</p><p>The bonfire had burned down; only a ragged fringe of flames now flickered over the bed of glowing embers, and the lanterns set around the yard had all gone out or been thriftily extinguished. Guitar and singer had ceased. Without light and noise to keep it at bay, the night came in, spreading wings of cold silence over the mountain. The stars burned bright above, but they were pinpricks, millennia away. She closed her eyes against the immensity of the night, bowing to put her lips against Jem\u2019s head, cradling his warmth.</p><p>She tried to compose her mind for sleep, but without the distractions of company, and with the scent of burning timber strong in the air, memory stole back, and her normal prayers of blessing became pleas for mercy and protection.</p> <p>\u201cHe hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t forget you, she said silently to the dead. It seemed so pitiful a thing to say\u2014so small and futile. And yet the only thing in her power.</p><p>She shivered briefly, tightening her grip on Jemmy.</p><p>A sudden rustle of the hay, and Roger slid in behind her. He fumbled a bit, spreading his own cloak over her, then sighed with relief, his body relaxing heavily against hers as his arm came round her waist.</p><p>\u201cBeen a bloody long day, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She groaned faintly in agreement. Now that everything was quiet, with no more need to talk, watch, pay attention, every fiber of her muscles seemed about to dissolve with fatigue. There was no more than a thin layer of hay between her and cold, hard ground, but she felt sleep lapping at her like the waves of the tide creeping up a sandy shore, soothing and inexorable.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Did you get something to eat?\u201d She put a hand on his leg, and his arm tightened in reflex, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cAye, if ye think beer\u2019s food. Many folk do.\u201d He laughed, a warm fog of hops on his breath. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The warmth of his body was beginning to seep through the layers of cloth between them, dispelling the night\u2019s chill.</p><p>Jem always gave off heat when he slept; it was like holding a clay firepot, with him curled against her. Roger was putting out even more heat, though. Well, her mother did say that an alcohol lamp burned hotter than oil.</p><p>She sighed and snuggled back against him, feeling warm, protected. The cold immensity of the night had lifted, now that she had her family close, together again, and safe.</p><p>Roger was humming. She realized it quite suddenly. There was no tune to it, but she felt the vibration of his chest against her back. She didn\u2019t want to chance stopping him; surely that was good for his vocal cords. He stopped on his own, though, after a moment. Hoping to start him again, she reached back to stroke his leg, essaying a small questioning hum of her own.</p> <p>\u201cHmmm-mmmm?\u201d</p><p>His hands cupped her buttocks and fastened tight.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmmm,\u201d he said, in what sounded like a combination of invitation and satisfaction.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, but made a slight dissentient motion of the behind. Under normal conditions, this would have caused him to let go. He did let go, but only with one hand, and this in order to slide it down her leg, evidently meaning to get hold of her skirt and ruckle it up.</p><p>She reached back hastily and grabbed the roving hand, bringing it round and placing it on her breast, as an indication that while she appreciated the notion and under other circumstances would be thrilled to oblige, just this moment she thought\u2014</p><p>Roger was usually very good at reading her body language, but evidently this skill had dissolved in whisky. That, or\u2014the thought came suddenly to her\u2014he simply didn\u2019t care whether she wanted\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He had started humming again, the sound now interspersed with the low, bumping noises a teakettle makes, just before the boil. He\u2019d got his hand down her leg and up her skirt, hot on the flesh of her thigh, groping swiftly upward\u2014and inward. Jemmy coughed, jerking in her arms, and she made an attempt to kick Roger in the shin, as a signal of discouragement.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he murmured into the curve of her neck. \u201cOh, God, so beautiful. So beautiful . . . so . . . hmmm . . .\u201d The next words were a mumble against her skin, but she thought he\u2019d said \u201cslippery.\u201d His fingers had reached their goal, and she arched her back, trying to squirm away.</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d she said, keeping her voice low. \u201cRoger, there are people around!\u201d And a snoring toddler wedged like a doorstop in front of her.</p><p>He mumbled something in which the words \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cnobody\u2019ll see\u201d were distinguishable, and then the groping hand retreated\u2014only to grab a handful of her skirts and start shoving them out of the way.</p><p>He had resumed the humming, pausing momentarily to murmur, \u201cLove you, love you so much. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said, reaching back and trying to catch his hand. \u201cRoger, stop that!\u201d</p><p>He did, but immediately reached around her, and grasped her by the shoulder. A quick heave, and she was lying on her back staring up at the distant stars, which were at once blotted out by Roger\u2019s head and shoulders as he rolled on top of her in a tremendous rustling of hay and loosened clothing.</p><p>\u201cJem\u2014\u201d She flung out a hand toward Jemmy, who appeared not to have been disturbed by the sudden disappearance of his backstop, but was still curled up in the hay like a hibernating hedgehog.</p><p>Roger was, of all things, singing now, if one could call it that. Or chanting, at least, the words to a very bawdy Scottish song, about a miller who is pestered by a young woman wanting him to grind her corn. Whereupon he does.</p><p>\u201cHe flung her down upon the sacks, and there she got her corn ground, her corn ground. . . .\u201d Roger was chanting hotly in her ear, his full weight pinning her to the ground and the stars spinning madly far above.</p><p>She\u2019d thought his description of Ronnie as \u201creeking wi\u2019 lust\u201d merely a figure of speech, but evidently not. Bare flesh met bare flesh, and then some. She gasped. So did Roger.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said. He paused, frozen for an instant against the sky above her, then sighed in an ecstasy of whisky fumes and began to move with her, humming. It was dark, thank God, though not nearly dark enough. The remnants of the fire cast an eerie glow over his face, and he looked for an instant the bonny big, black devil Inga had called him.</p><p>Lie back and enjoy it, she thought. The hay made a tremendous rustling\u2014but there were other rustlings nearby, and the sound of the wind soughing through the trees in the cove was nearly enough to drown them all in sibilance.</p><p>She had managed to suppress her embarrassment and was indeed beginning to enjoy it, when Roger got his hands under her, lifting.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs round me,\u201d he whispered, and nipped her earlobe with his teeth. \u201cWrap them round my back and hammer my arse wi\u2019 your heels.\u201d</p><p>Moved partly by an answering wantonness, and partly by a desire to squeeze the breath out of him like an accordion, she flung her legs apart and swung them high, scissoring them tight across his heaving back. He gave an ecstatic groan and redoubled his efforts. Wantonness was winning; she had nearly forgotten where they were.</p><p>Hanging on for dear life and thrilled by the ride, she arched her back and jerked, shuddering against the heat of him, the night wind\u2019s touch cool and electric on thighs and buttocks, bared to the dark. Trembling and moaning, she melted back against the hay, her legs still locked around his hips. Boneless and nerveless, she let her head roll to the side, and slowly, languidly, opened her eyes.</p><p>Someone was there; she saw movement in the dark, and froze. It was Fergus, come to fetch his son. She heard the murmur of his voice, speaking French to Germain, and the quiet rustle of his footsteps in the hay, moving off.</p><p>She lay still, heart pounding, legs still locked in place. Roger, meanwhile, had reached his own quietus. Head hanging so that his long hair brushed her face like cobwebs in the dark, he murmured, \u201cLove you . . . God, I love you,\u201d and lowered himself, slowly and gently. Whereupon he breathed, \u201cThank you,\u201d in her ear and lapsed into warm half-consciousness on top of her, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, looking up to the peaceful stars. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d She unlocked her stiff legs, and with some difficulty, got herself and Roger disentangled, more or less covered, and restored to blessed anonymity in their hay-lined nest, Jemmy safely stowed between them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said suddenly, and Roger stirred.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of monster was Eigger?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the sound was low and clear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Eigger was a giant sponge cake. With chocolate icing. He\u2019d fall on the other monsters, and smother them wi\u2019 sweetness.\u201d He laughed again, hiccuped, and subsided in the hay.</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d she said softly, a moment later. There was no answer, and she stretched a hand across the slumbering body of her son, to rest light on Roger\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSing to me,\u201d she whispered, though she knew that he already was asleep.</p><p>7</p><p>JAMES FRASER, INDIAN AGENT</p><p>JAMES FRASER, Indian Agent,\u201d I said, closing one eye as though reading it off a screen. \u201cIt sounds like a Wild West television show.\u201d</p><p>Jamie paused in the act of pulling off his stockings, and eyed me warily.</p><p>\u201cIt does? Is that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsofar as the hero of a television show never dies, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m in favor of it,\u201d he said, examining the stocking he\u2019d just pulled off. He sniffed it suspiciously, rubbed a thumb over a thin patch on the heel, shook his head, and tossed it into the laundry basket. \u201cMust I sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi\u2014oh,\u201d I said, recollecting that the last time I had tried to explain television to him, my descriptions had focused largely on The Ed Sullivan Show. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Nor yet swing from a trapeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a comfort. I\u2019m none sae young as I was, ken.\u201d He stood up and stretched himself, groaning. The house had been built with eight-foot ceilings, to accommodate him, but his fists brushed the pine beams, even so. \u201cChrist, but it\u2019s been a long day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nearly over,\u201d I said, sniffing in turn at the bodice of the gown I\u2019d just shed. It smelled strongly, though not disagreeably, of horse and woodsmoke. Air it a bit, I decided, and see whether it could go another little while without washing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have swung on a trapeze even when I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pay money to see ye try,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhat is an Indian agent?\u201d I inquired. \u201cMacDonald seemed to think he was doing you a signal favor by suggesting you for the job.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, unbuckling his kilt.</p><p>\u201cNay doubt he thinks he is.\u201d He shook the garment experimentally, and a fine sifting of dust and horsehair bloomed on the floor beneath it. He went to the window, opened the shutters, and, thrusting the kilt outside, shook it harder.</p><p>\u201cHe would be\u201d\u2014his voice came faintly from the night outside, then more strongly, as he turned round again\u2014\u201cwere it not for this war of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf mine?\u201d I said, indignant. \u201cYou sound as though you think I\u2019m proposing to start it, single-handed.\u201d</p><p>He made a small gesture of dismissal.</p><p>\u201cYe ken what I mean. An Indian agent, Sassenach, is what it sounds like\u2014a fellow who goes out and parleys wi\u2019 the local Indians, giving them gifts and talking them round, in hopes that they\u2019ll be inclined to ally themselves with the Crown\u2019s interests, whatever those might happen to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what\u2019s this Southern Department that MacDonald mentioned?\u201d I glanced involuntarily toward the closed door of our room, but muffled snoring from across the hall indicated that our guest had already collapsed into the arms of Morpheus.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. There\u2019s a Southern Department and a Northern Department that deal wi\u2019 Indian affairs in the colonies. The Southern Department is under John Stuart, who\u2019s an Inverness man. Turn round, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back gratefully to him. With expertise born of long experience, he had the lacing of my stays undone in seconds. I sighed deeply as they loosened and fell. He plucked the shift away from my body, massaging my ribs where the boning had pressed the damp fabric into my skin.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sighed in bliss and leaned back against him. \u201cAnd being an Inverness man, MacDonald thinks this Stuart will have a natural predisposition to employ other Highlanders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might depend upon whether Stuart\u2019s ever met any of my kin,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cBut MacDonald thinks so, aye.\u201d He kissed the top of my head in absent affection, then withdrew his hands and began untying the lace that bound his hair.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d I said, stepping out of my fallen stays. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the stool in his shirt, closing his eyes in momentary relaxation as I unbraided his hair. He\u2019d worn it clubbed in a tight queue for riding, bound up for the last three days; I ran my hands up into the warm fiery mass as it unraveled from its plait, and the loosened waves of it spilled cinnamon and gold and silver in the firelight as I rubbed the pads of my fingers gently into his scalp.</p><p>\u201cGifts, you said. Does the Crown supply these gifts?\u201d The Crown, I had noticed, had a bad habit of \u201chonoring\u201d men of substance with offices that required them to come up with large amounts of their own money.</p><p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d He yawned hugely, broad shoulders slumping comfortably as I took up my hair brush and set about tidying him. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice. That\u2019s why MacDonald thinks it a favor; there\u2019s the possibility of doing well in trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides generally excellent opportunities for corruption. Yes, I see.\u201d I worked for a few minutes before asking, \u201cWill you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken. I must think a bit. Ye were mentioning Wild West\u2014Brianna\u2019s said such a thing, telling me about cowherds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCowboys.\u201d</p><p>He waved off the correction. \u201cAnd the Indians. That\u2019s true, is it\u2014what she says about the Indians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what she says is that they\u2019ll be largely exterminated over the next century or so\u2014yes, she\u2019s right.\u201d I smoothed his hair, then sat down on the bed facing him and set about brushing my own. \u201cDoes that trouble you?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together a little as he considered it, and he scratched absently at his chest, where the curly red-gold hairs showed at the open neck of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNot precisely. It\u2019s not as though I should be doing them to death wi\u2019 my own hands. But . . . we\u2019re coming to it, are we not? The time when I must tread wi\u2019 some care, if I\u2019m to walk betwixt the fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we are,\u201d I said, an uneasy tightness hovering between my shoulder blades. I saw what he meant, all too clearly. The battle lines were not clear yet\u2014but they were being drawn. To become an Indian agent for the Crown was to appear to be a Loyalist\u2014all very well for the moment, when the Rebel movement was no more than a radical fringe, with pockets of disaffection. But very, very dangerous, as we grew closer to the point where the disaffected seized power, and independence was declared.</p><p>Knowing the eventual outcome, Jamie dare not wait too long to ally himself to the Rebel side\u2014but to do so too early was to risk arrest for treason. Not a good prospect for a man who was already a pardoned traitor.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said diffidently, \u201cif you were to be an Indian agent I suppose you might actually persuade some of the Indian tribes into supporting the American side\u2014or staying neutral, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d he agreed, with a certain note of bleakness in his voice. \u201cBut putting aside any question as to the honor of such a course\u2014that would help condemn them, no? Would the same thing happen to them in the end, d\u2019ye think, if the English were to win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d I said, with a slight edge.</p><p>He glanced sharply at me.</p><p>\u201cI do believe ye,\u201d he said, with a similar edge. \u201cI\u2019ve reason to, aye?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my lips pressed together. I didn\u2019t want to talk about the earlier Rising. I didn\u2019t want to talk about the oncoming Revolution, either, but there was little choice about that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and took a deep breath. \u201cNo one can say\u2014since it didn\u2019t happen\u2014but if I were to guess . . . then I think the Indians might quite possibly do better under British rule.\u201d I smiled at him, a little ruefully.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, the British Empire did\u2014or will, I should say\u2014generally manage to run its colonies without entirely exterminating the native people in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBar the Hieland folk,\u201d he said, very dryly. \u201cAye, I\u2019ll take your word for it, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, running a hand back through his hair, and I caught a glimpse of the tiny streak of white that ran through it, legacy of a bullet wound.</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Roger about it,\u201d I said. \u201cHe knows a great deal more than I do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t reply, beyond a faint grimace.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suppose Roger and Bree went, speaking of Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the MacGillivrays\u2019, I suppose,\u201d he replied, surprised. \u201cTo fetch wee Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I asked, equally surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s mischief abroad, a man wants his family safe under his eye, ken?\u201d He raised one brow at me, and reaching to the top of the wardrobe, took down his sword. He drew it halfway from its scabbard, then put it back and set the scabbard gently back in place, the sword loosened, hilt ready to hand.</p><p>He\u2019d brought a loaded pistol upstairs with him; that was placed on the washstand by the window. The rifle and fowling piece too had been left loaded and primed, hanging from their hooks above the hearth downstairs. And, with a small ironic flourish, he drew the dirk from its belt sheath and slid it neatly under our pillow.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget,\u201d I said a little wistfully, watching this. There had been a dirk under the pillow of our wedding couch\u2014and under many a one since then.</p><p>\u201cDo ye?\u201d He smiled at that; a little lopsidedly, but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you? Ever?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still smiling, though it had a rueful tinge.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wish I did.\u201d</p><p>This colloquy was interrupted by a spluttering snort across the hall, followed at once by a thrashing of bedclothes, violent oaths, and a sharp thump! as something\u2014likely a shoe\u2014struck the wall.</p><p>\u201cFucking cat!\u201d bellowed Major MacDonald. I sat, hand pressed across my mouth, as the stomp of bare feet vibrated through the floorboards, succeeded briefly by the crash of the Major\u2019s door, which flung open, then shut with a bang.</p><p>Jamie too had stood frozen for an instant. Now he moved, very delicately, and soundlessly eased our own door open. Adso, tail arrogantly S-shaped, strolled in. Magnificently ignoring us, he crossed the room, leapt lightly onto the washstand, and sat in the basin, where he stuck a back leg into the air and began calmly licking his testicles.</p><p>\u201cI saw a man once in Paris who could do that,\u201d Jamie remarked, observing this performance with interest.</p><p>\u201cAre there people willing to pay to watch such things?\u201d I assumed that no one was likely to engage in a public exhibition of that sort merely for the fun of it. Not in Paris, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasna the man, so much. More his female companion, who was likewise flexible.\u201d He grinned at me, his eyes glinting blue in the candlelight. \u201cLike watching worms mate, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d I murmured. I glanced at the washstand, where Adso was now doing something even more indelicate. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky the Major doesn\u2019t sleep armed, cat. He might have potted you like a jugged hare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt that. Our Donald likely sleeps with a blade\u2014but he kens well enough which side of his bread\u2019s buttered. Ye wouldna be likely to give him breakfast, and he\u2019d skewered your cat.\u201d</p><p>I glanced toward the door. The mattress-heaving and muttered curses across the hall had died down; the Major, with the practiced ease of a professional soldier, was already well on his way back to dreamland.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. You were right about his worming his way into a position with the new governor. Which is the real reason for his desire for your political advancement, I imagine?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, but had plainly lost interest in discussing MacDonald\u2019s machinations.</p><p>\u201cI was right, no? That means ye owe me a forfeit, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me with an air of dawning speculation, which I hoped had not been too much inspired by his memories of the wormlike Parisians.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I regarded him warily. \u201cAnd, um, what precisely . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I havena quite worked out all the details as yet, but I think ye should maybe lie on the bed, to begin with.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a reasonable start to the matter. I piled up the pillows at the head of the bed\u2014pausing to remove the dirk\u2014then began to climb onto it. I paused again, though, and instead bent to wind the bedkey, tightening the ropes that supported the mattress until the bedstead groaned and the ropes gave a creaking twang.</p><p>\u201cVerra canny, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said behind me, sounding amused.</p><p>\u201cExperience,\u201d I informed him, clambering over the newly tautened bed on hands and knees. \u201cI\u2019ve waked up often enough after a night with you, with the mattress folded up round my ears and my arse no more than an inch off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I expect your arse will end up somewhat higher than that,\u201d he assured me.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to let me be on top?\u201d I had mixed feelings about that. I was desperately tired, and while I enjoyed riding Jamie, all right, I\u2019d been riding a beastly horse for more than ten hours, and the thigh muscles required for both activities were trembling spasmodically.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps later,\u201d he said, eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cLie back, Sassenach, and ruckle up your shift. Then open your legs for me, there\u2019s a good lass no, a bit wider, aye?\u201d He began\u2014with deliberate slowness\u2014to remove his shirt.</p><p>I sighed and shifted my buttocks a little, looking for a position that wouldn\u2019t give me cramp if I had to hold it for long.</p><p>\u201cIf you have in mind what I think you have in mind, you\u2019ll regret it. I haven\u2019t even bathed properly,\u201d I said reproachfully. \u201cI\u2019m desperately filthy and I smell like a horse.\u201d</p><p>Naked, he raised one arm and sniffed appraisingly.</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, so do I. That\u2019s no matter; I\u2019m fond of horses.\u201d He\u2019d abandoned any pretense of delay, but paused to survey his arrangements, looking me over with approval.</p><p>\u201cAye, verra good. Now then, if ye\u2019ll just put your hands above your head and seize the bedstead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d I said, and then lowered my voice, with an involuntary glance toward the door. \u201cNot with MacDonald just across the hall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I would,\u201d he assured me, \u201cand the devil wi\u2019 MacDonald and a dozen more like him.\u201d He paused, though, studying me thoughtfully, and after a moment, sighed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNot tonight. Ye\u2019re still thinking of that poor Dutch bastard and his family, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside me on the bed with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying verra hard not to,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cBut the new dead dinna lie easy in their graves, do they?\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand on his arm, relieved that he felt the same. The night air seemed restless with the passage of spirits, and I had felt the dragging melancholy of that desolate garden, that row of graves, all through the events and alarums of the evening.</p><p>It was a night to be securely locked inside, with a good fire on the hearth, and people nearby. The house stirred, shutters creaking in the wind.</p><p>\u201cI do want ye, Claire,\u201d Jamie said softly. \u201cI need . . . if ye will?\u201d</p><p>And had they spent the night before their deaths like this, I wondered? Peaceful and snug betwixt their walls, husband and wife whispering together, lying close in their bed, having no notion what the future held. I saw in memory her long white thighs as the wind blew over her, and the glimpse I\u2019d had of the small curly mat between them, the pudenda beneath its nimbus of brown hair pale as carved marble, the seam of it sealed like a virgin\u2019s statue.</p><p>\u201cI need, too,\u201d I said, just as softly. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, and pulled the drawstring neatly from the neck of my shift, so the worn linen wilted off my shoulders. I made a grab for the fabric, but he caught my hand, and held it down by my side. One-fingered, he brushed the shift lower, then put out the candle, and in a dark that smelled of wax and honey and the sweat of horses, kissed my forehead, eyes, the corners of my cheeks, my lips and chin, and so continued, slow and soft-lipped, to the arches of my feet.</p><p>He raised himself then, and suckled my br**sts for a long time, and I ran my hand up his back and cupped his buttocks, nak*d and vulnerable in the dark.</p><p>Afterward, we lay in a pleasantly vermiform tangle, the only light in the room a faint glow from the banked hearth. I was so tired that I could feel my body sinking into the mattress, and desired nothing more than to keep going down, down, into the welcoming dark of oblivion.</p><p>\u201cSassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm?\u201d</p><p>A moment\u2019s hesitation, then his hand found mine, curling round it.</p><p>\u201cYe wouldna do what she did, would ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer. The Dutchwoman.\u201d</p><p>Snatched back from the edge of sleep, I was muzzy and confused, sufficiently so that even the image of the dead woman, shrouded in her apron, seemed unreal, no more disturbing than the random fragments of reality my brain tossed overboard in a vain effort to keep afloat as I sank down into the depths of sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Fall into the fire? I\u2019ll try not,\u201d I assured him, yawning. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Wake up.\u201d He shook my arm gently. \u201cTalk to me, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNg.\u201d It was a considerable effort, but I pushed away the enticing arms of Morpheus, and flounced over onto my side, facing him. \u201cMm. Talk to you. About . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dutchwoman,\u201d he repeated patiently. \u201cIf I were to be killed, ye wouldna go and kill your whole family, would ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I rubbed my free hand over my face, trying to make some sense of this, amid the drifting shreds of sleep. \u201cWhose whole\u2014oh. You think she did it on purpose? Poisoned them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe so.\u201d</p><p>His words were no more than a whisper, but they brought me back to full consciousness. I lay silent for a moment, then reached out, wanting to be sure he was really there.</p><p>He was; a large, solid object, the smooth bone of his hip warm and live under my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt might as well have been an accident,\u201d I said, voice pitched low. \u201cYou can\u2019t know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I canna keep from seeing it.\u201d He turned restlessly onto his back.</p><p>\u201cThe men came,\u201d he said softly, to the beams overhead. \u201cHe fought them, and they killed him there, on his own threshold. And when she saw her man was gone I think she told the men she must feed the weans first, before . . . and then she put toadstools into the stew, and fed it to the bairns and her mother. She took the two men with them, but I think it was that that was the accident. She only meant to follow him. She wouldna leave him there, alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted to tell him that this was a rather dramatic interpretation of what we had seen. But I couldn\u2019t very well tell him he was wrong. Hearing him describe what he saw in thought, I saw it, too, all too clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d I said at last, softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t know.\u201d Unless you find the other men, I thought suddenly, and ask them. I didn\u2019t say that, though.</p><p>Neither of us spoke for a bit. I could tell that he was still thinking, but the quicksand of sleep was once more pulling me down, clinging and seductive.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I canna keep ye safe?\u201d he whispered at last. His head moved suddenly on the pillow, turning toward me. \u201cYou and the rest of them? I shall try wi\u2019 all my strength, Sassenach, and I dinna mind if I die doing it, but what if I should die too soon\u2014and fail?\u201d</p> <p>And what answer was there to that?</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d I whispered back. He sighed, and bent his head, so his forehead rested against mine. I could smell eggs and whisky, warm on his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not,\u201d he said, and I put my mouth on his, soft against mine, acknowledgment and comfort in the dark.</p><p>I laid my head against the curve of his shoulder, wrapped a hand round his arm, and breathed in the smell of his skin, smoke and salt, as though he had been cured in the fire.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like a smoked ham,\u201d I murmured, and he made a low sound of amusement and wedged his hand into its accustomed spot, clasped between my thighs.</p> <p>I let go then, at last, and let the heavy sands of sleep engulf me. Perhaps he said it, as I fell into darkness, or perhaps I only dreamed it.</p><p>\u201cIf I die,\u201d he whispered in the dark, \u201cdinna follow me. The bairns will need ye. Stay for them. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>A Gathering of Shadows</p><p>8</p><p>VICTIM OF A MASSACRE</p> <p>From Lord John Grey</p><p>To Mr. James Fraser, Esq.</p><p>April 14, 1773</p><p>My dear friend\u2014</p><p>I write you in good Health, and trust that I find you and yours in similar condition.</p><p>My Son has returned to England, there to complete his Education. He writes with Delight of his Experiences (I inclose a Copy of his most recent Letter), and assures me of his Well-being. More importantly, my Mother also writes to assure me that he flourishes, though I believe\u2014more from what she does not say than from what she does\u2014that he introduces an unaccustomed Element of Confusion and Upheaval in her Household.</p><p>I confess to feeling the Lack of this Element in my own Household. So orderly and well-regulated a Life as mine is these Days, you would be astonished. Still, the Quiet seems oppressive to me, and while I am in Health in terms of Body, I find my Spirit somewhat flagging. I miss William sadly, I fear.</p><p>For Distraction from my solitary State, I have of late undertaken a new Employment, that of making Wine. While I admit the Product lacks the Power of your own Distillations, I flatter myself that it is not undrinkable, and if allowed to stand for a Year or two, might eventually be palatable. I shall send you a dozen Bottles later in the Month, by the Hand of my new Servant, Mr. Higgins, whose History you may find interesting.</p> <p>You will perhaps have heard something of a disreputable Brawl occurring in Boston in March of three Years past, which I have often seen in Newspaper and Broadside called a \u201cMassacre,\u201d most irresponsibly\u2014and most inaccurately, to one who has been privy to the actual Occurrence.</p><p>I was not present myself, but have spoken to numerous of the Officers and Soldiers who were. If they speak truly, and I believe they do, such a View as is given by the Boston Press of the Matter has been monstrous.</p><p>Boston is by all Accounts a perfect Hellhole of republican Sentiment, with so-called \u201cMarching Societies\u201d at large in the Streets in every Weather, these being no more than an Excuse for the Assembly of Mobs, whose chief Sport is the tormenting of the Troops quartered there.</p><p>Higgins tells me that no Man would dare go out alone in Uniform, for fear of these Mobs, and that even when in greater Numbers, harassment from the public soon drove them back to their Quarters, save when compelled by Duty to persist.</p><p>A Patrol of five Soldiers was so beset one Evening, pursued not only by insults of the grossest Nature, but by hurled Stones, Clods of Earth and Dung, and other such Rubbish. Such was the Press of the Mob around them that the Men feared for their Safety, and thus presented their Weapons, in hopes of discouraging the raucous Attentions rained upon them. So far from accomplishing this Aim, the Action provoked still greater Outrages from the Crowd, and at some Point, a Gun was fired. No one can say for sure whether the Shot was discharged from the Crowd, or from one of the Soldier\u2019s Weapons, let alone whether it were by Accident or in Deliberation, but the Effect of it . . . well, you will have sufficient Knowledge of such Matters to imagine the Confusion of subsequent Events.</p><p>In the End, five of the Mob were killed, and while the Soldiers were buffeted and badly handled, they escaped alive, only to be made Scapegoats by the malicious Rantings of the mob\u2019s Leaders in the Press, these so styled as to make it seem a wanton and unprovoked Slaughter of Innocents, rather than a Matter of Self-defense against a Mob inflamed by Drink and Sloganeering.</p><p>I confess that my Sympathies must lie altogether with the Soldiers; I am sure so much is obvious to you. They were brought to Trial, where the Judge discovered Three to be Innocent, but no Doubt felt it would be Dangerous to his own Situation to free them all.</p><p>Higgins, with one other, was convicted of Manslaughter, but pled Clergy and was released after his Branding. The Army of course discharged him, and without means of making a Living and subject to the Opprobrium of the Populace, he found himself in sad Case. He tells me that he was beaten in a Tavern soon after his Release, injuries inflicted therein depriving him of the Sight in one Eye, and in fact, his very Life was threatened on more than one Occasion. So seeking Safety, he took Passage on a Sloop captained by my Friend, Captain Gill, working as a Sailor, though I have seen him sail and I assure you he is not one.</p><p>This state of Affairs became soon evident to Captain Gill, who terminated his Employment upon arrival at their first Port. I was in the Town on Business, and encountered Captain Gill, who told me of Higgins\u2019s desperate Situation.</p><p>I contrived to find the Man, feeling some Pity for a Soldier who appeared to me to have performed his Duty honorably, and thinking it hard that he should suffer by it. Discovering him to be intelligent and of a generally agreeable Character, I engaged him in Service, wherein he has proved most faithful.</p><p>I send him with the Wine, in Hopes that your Wife might be so kind as to examine him. The local Physician, one Dr. Potts, has seen him, and declares the Injury to his Eye irretrievable, as indeed it may be. Having some personal Experience of your Wife\u2019s skill, however, I wonder whether she might suggest Treatment for his other Ills; Dr. Potts was unable to be of much Help. Tell her, please, that I am her humble Servant, and remain in perpetual Gratitude for her Kindness and Ability.</p><p>My warmest Regards to your Daughter, for whom I have sent a small Present, to arrive with the Wine. I trust her Husband will not take Offense at my Familiarity, by Consideration of my long Acquaintance with your Family, and will allow her to accept it.</p><p>As always, I remain your Ob\u2019t. Servant,</p><p>John Grey</p><p>9</p><p>THE THRESHOLD OF WAR</p><p>April 1773</p><p>ROBERT HIGGINS WAS a slight young man, so thin as to seem that his bones were barely held together by his clothes, and so pale that it was easy to imagine you could in fact see through him. He was, however, graced with large, candid blue eyes, a mass of wavy, light-brown hair, and a shy manner that caused Mrs. Bug to take him at once under her wing and declare a firm intent to \u201cfeed him up,\u201d before he should depart back to Virginia.</p><p>I quite liked Mr. Higgins myself; he was a sweet-natured boy, with the soft accent of his native Dorset. I did rather wonder, though, whether Lord John Grey\u2019s generosity toward him was as unselfish as it seemed.</p><p>I had come reluctantly to like John Grey, too, after our shared experience of the measles a few years earlier, and his friendship to Brianna while Roger was held captive by the Iroquois. Still, I remained acutely aware of the fact that Lord John did like men\u2014specifically, Jamie, but certainly other men, as well.</p><p>\u201cBeauchamp,\u201d I said to myself, laying out trillium roots to dry, \u201cyou have a very suspicious mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye have,\u201d said a voice behind me, sounding amused. \u201cWhom do ye suspect of doing what?\u201d</p><p>I jerked in startlement and sent trilliums flying in all directions.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cWhy must you sneak up on me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Jamie said, kissing me on the forehead. \u201cI shouldna like to lose my touch at stalking game. Why d\u2019ye talk to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt assures me of a good listener,\u201d I said tartly, and he laughed, bending to help me pick up the roots from the floor.</p><p>\u201cWho are ye suspecting, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but was unable to come up with anything but the truth.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering whether John Grey\u2019s buggering our Mr. Higgins,\u201d I said baldly. \u201cOr intends to.\u201d</p><p>He blinked slightly, but didn\u2019t look shocked\u2014which in itself suggested to me that he\u2019d considered the same possibility.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes ye think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very pretty young man, for the one thing,\u201d I said, taking a handful of the roots from him and beginning to spread them out on a sheet of gauze. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got the worst case of piles I\u2019ve ever seen in a man of his age, for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let ye look at them?\u201d Jamie had flushed up himself at the mention of buggery; he disliked me being indelicate, but he\u2019d asked, after all.</p><p>\u201cWell, it took no little persuasion,\u201d I said. \u201cHe told me about them readily enough, but he wasn\u2019t keen to have me examine them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna care for that prospect, either,\u201d Jamie assured me, \u201cand I\u2019m wed to ye. Why on earth would ye want to look at such a thing, beyond morbid curiosity?\u201d He cast a wary glance at my big black casebook, open on the table. \u201cYe\u2019re no drawing pictures of poor Bobby Higgins\u2019s backside in there, are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I can\u2019t imagine a physician in any time who doesn\u2019t know what piles look like. The ancient Israelites and Egyptians had them, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the Bible. Ask Mr. Christie,\u201d I advised.</p><p>He gave me a sidelong look.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve been discussing the Bible wi\u2019 Tom Christie? Ye\u2019re a braver man than I am, Sassenach.\u201d Christie was a most devout Presbyterian, and never happier than when hitting someone over the head with a fistful of Sacred Scripture.</p><p>\u201cNot me. Germain asked me last week what \u2018emerods\u2019 are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiles. Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines,\u201d I quoted, \u201cor something of the sort. That\u2019s as close as I can come from memory. Mr. Christie made Germain write out a verse from the Bible as punishment, and having an inquiring sort of mind, Germain wondered what it was he was writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wouldna ask Mr. Christie, of course.\u201d Jamie frowned, rubbing a finger down the bridge of his nose. \u201cDo I want to know what it was Germain did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly not.\u201d Tom Christie earned the quitrent on his land by serving as the local schoolmaster, and seemed capable of keeping discipline on his own terms. My opinion was that having Germain Fraser as a pupil was probably worth the entire amount, in terms of labor.</p><p>\u201cGold emerods,\u201d Jamie murmured. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a thought.\u201d He had assumed the faintly dreamy air he often had just before coming up with some hair-raising notion involving the possibility of maiming, death, or life imprisonment. I found this expression mildly alarming, but whatever the train of thought triggered by golden hemorrhoids, he abandoned it for the moment, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. We were speaking of Bobby\u2019s backside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. As for why I wanted to look at Mr. Higgins\u2019s emerods,\u201d I said, returning to the previous point of conversation, \u201cI wanted to see whether the best treatment was amelioration, or removal.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows went up at that.</p><p>\u201cRemove them? How? Wi\u2019 your wee knife?\u201d He glanced at the case where I kept my surgical tools, and hunched his shoulders in aversion.</p><p>\u201cI could, yes, though I imagine it would be rather painful without anesthesia. There was a much simpler method just coming into widespread use, though, when I . . . left.\u201d Just for a moment, I felt a deep twinge of longing for my hospital. I could all but smell the disinfectant, hear the murmur and bustle of nurses and orderlies, touch the glossy covers of the research journals bulging with ideas and information.</p><p>Then it was gone, and I was estimating the desirability of leeches versus string, with reference to Mr. Higgins\u2019s achieving ideal anal health.</p><p>\u201cDr. Rawlings advises the use of leeches,\u201d I explained. \u201cTwenty or thirty, he says, for a serious case.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, showing no particular revulsion at the idea. Of course, he\u2019d been leeched a few times himself, and assured me that it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cAye. Ye havena got that many on hand, do ye? Shall I collect the wee lads and set them to gathering?\u201d</p><p>Jemmy and Germain would like nothing better than an excuse to go bogging through the creeks with their grandfather, coming back festooned with leeches and mud to the eyebrows, but I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. Or I mean, yes,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAt your convenience\u2014but I don\u2019t need them immediately. Using leeches would relieve the situation temporarily, but Bobby\u2019s hemorrhoids are badly thrombosed\u2014have clots of dried blood in them\u2014\u201d I emended, \u201cand I think he really would be better off if I remove them entirely. I believe I can ligate them\u2014tie a thread very tightly round the base of each hemorrhoid, I mean. That starves them of blood, and eventually, they just dry up and fall off. Very neat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra neat,\u201d Jamie murmured, in echo. He looked mildly apprehensive. \u201cHave ye done it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He pursed his lips, apparently envisioning the process. \u201cHow . . . er, I mean . . . can he shit, d\u2019ye think, while this is going on? It must take a bit of time, surely.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, tapping a finger on the countertop.</p><p>\u201cHis chief difficulty is that he doesn\u2019t shit,\u201d I said. \u201cNot often enough, I mean, and not with the proper consistency. Horrible diet,\u201d I said, pointing an accusatory finger at him. \u201cHe told me. Bread, meat, and ale. No vegetables, no fruit. Constipation is absolutely rife in the British army, I don\u2019t doubt. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if every man jack of them has piles hanging out of his arse like grape clusters!\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cThere are a great many things I admire about ye, Sassenach\u2014especially the delicate manner of your conversation.\u201d He coughed, glancing downward. \u201cBut if ye say it\u2019s costiveness that causes piles\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s only\u2014what ye were saying about John Grey. I mean, ye don\u2019t think the state of Bobby\u2019s arse is to do with . . . mmphm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, no, not directly.\u201d I paused. \u201cIt was more that Lord John said in his letter that he wanted me to\u2014how did he put it?\u2014I might suggest treatment for his other ills. I mean, he might possibly know about Bobby\u2019s difficulty, without . . . er . . . personal inspection, shall we say? But as I say, piles are so commonplace an affliction, why ought he be concerned to the point of asking me to do something about them\u2014unless he thought that they might hamper his own eventual . . . er . . . progress?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face had resumed its normal hue during the discussion of leeches and constipation, but at this point, went red again.</p><p>\u201cHis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d I said, folding my arms beneath my bosom, \u201cI\u2019m just a trifle put off . . . by the notion that he\u2019s sent Mr. Higgins down for repair, you might say.\u201d I had been suffering from a niggling feeling of unease regarding the matter of Bobby Higgins\u2019s backside, but hadn\u2019t put this notion into words before. Now that I had, I realized precisely what was bothering me.</p><p>\u201cThe thought that I\u2019m meant to be fixing up poor little Bobby, and then sending him home to be\u2014\u201d I pressed my lips tight together, and turned abruptly back to my roots, needlessly turning them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the thought,\u201d I said, to the cupboard door. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can for Mr. Higgins, mind. Bobby Higgins hasn\u2019t many prospects; no doubt he\u2019d do . . . whatever his Lordship required. But perhaps I\u2019m wronging him. Lord John, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps ye are.\u201d</p><p>I turned round, to find Jamie sitting on my stool, fiddling with a jar of goose grease that seemed to have his full attention.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cYou know him better than I do. If you think he isn\u2019t . . .\u201d My words trailed off. Outside, there was a sudden soft thump as a falling spruce cone struck the wooden stoop.</p><p>\u201cI ken more about John Grey than I wish I did,\u201d Jamie said finally, and glanced at me, a rueful smile in the corner of his mouth. \u201cAnd he kens a great deal more about me than I like to think on. But\u201d\u2014he leaned forward, setting down the jar, then put his hands on his knees and looked at me\u2014\u201cI ken the one thing beyond doubt. He\u2019s an honorable man. He wouldna take advantage of Higgins, nor any other man under his protection.\u201d</p><p>He sounded very definite about it, and I felt reassured. I did like John Grey. And still . . . the appearance of his letters, regular as clockwork, always gave me a faint sense of unease, like the hearing of distant thunder. There was nothing about the letters themselves to evoke such a response; they were like the man himself\u2014erudite, humorous, and sincere. And he had reason to write, of course. More than one.</p><p>\u201cHe does still love you, you know,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t look at me, his gaze still fixed somewhere beyond the trees that edged the dooryard.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather he didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He paused, then nodded again. This time, though, he did turn to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI would, aye. For myself. For him, certainly. But for William?\u201d He shook his head, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cOh, he may have taken William on for your sake,\u201d I said, leaning back against the counter. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen the two of them, remember. I\u2019ve no doubt he loves Willie for his own sake now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna doubt that, either.\u201d He got up, restless, and beat imaginary dust from the pleats of his kilt. His face was closed, looking inward at something he didn\u2019t wish to share with me.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014\u201d I began, but stopped when he glanced up at me. \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He tilted his head to one side, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, merely intensified the stare.</p><p>\u201cI can see from your face that it\u2019s not, Sassenach. What?\u201d</p><p>I breathed deeply through my nose, fists wrapped in my apron.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014and I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s only a passing thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>He made a low Scottish noise, indicating that I had better stop blethering and cough it up. Having enough experience to realize that he wouldn\u2019t leave the matter \u2019til I did, I coughed.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wonder whether Lord John might have taken him because . . . well, William does look terribly like you, and evidently did from an early age. Since Lord John finds you physically . . . attractive . . .\u201d The words died, and I could have cut my throat for speaking them, seeing the look on his face.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, to stop me looking in. His fists were curled up so tightly that the veins stood out from knuckle to forearm. Very slowly, he relaxed his hands. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, complete conviction in his voice. He gave me a straight, hard look. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no that I canna bear the thought of it, either. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said hastily, eager to leave the subject.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he repeated more sharply. His two stiff fingers tapped, once, against his leg, and then stilled. \u201cI thought of it, too. When he first told me he meant to wed Isobel Dunsany.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, staring out through the window. Adso was in the dooryard, stalking something in the grass.</p><p>\u201cI offered him my body,\u201d Jamie said abruptly, not looking round. The words were steady enough, but I could see from the knotted shoulders how much it cost him to speak them. \u201cIn thanks, I said. But it was\u2014\u201d He made an odd convulsive movement, as though trying to free himself from some constraint. \u201cI meant to see, ken, what sort of man he might be, for sure. This man who would take my son for his own.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook, very slightly, when he said, \u201ctake my son,\u201d and I moved to him by instinct, wanting somehow to patch the open wound beneath those words.</p><p>He was stiff when I touched him, not wanting to be embraced\u2014but he took my hand and squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cCould you . . . really tell, do you think?\u201d I was not shocked; John Grey had told me of that offer, years before, in Jamaica. I didn\u2019t think he had realized the true nature of it, though.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand tightened on mine, and his thumb traced the outline of mine, rubbing lightly over the nail. He looked down at me, and I felt his eyes search my face\u2014not in question, but in the way one does when seeing anew some object grown familiar\u2014seeing with the eyes what has been seen for a long time only with the heart.</p><p>His free hand rose and traced the line of my brows, two fingers resting for an instant on the bone of my cheek, then moved up, back, cool in the warmth of my hair.</p><p>\u201cYe canna be so close to another,\u201d he said finally. \u201cTo be within each other, to smell their sweat, and rub the hairs of your body with theirs and see nothing of their soul. Or if ye can do that . . .\u201d He hesitated, and I wondered whether he thought of Black Jack Randall, or of Laoghaire, the woman he had married, thinking me dead. \u201cWell . . . that is a dreadful thing in itself,\u201d he finished softly, and his hand dropped away.</p><p>There was silence between us. A sudden rustle came from the grass outside as Adso lunged and disappeared, and a mockingbird began to shriek alarm from the big red spruce. In the kitchen, something was dropped with a clang, and then the rhythmic shoosh of sweeping began. All the homely sounds of this life we had made.</p><p>Had I ever done that? Lain with a man, and seen nothing of his soul? Indeed I had, and he was right. A breath of coldness touched me, and the hairs rose, silent on my skin.</p><p>He heaved a sigh that seemed to come from his feet, and rubbed a hand over his bound hair.</p><p>\u201cBut he wouldna do it. John.\u201d He looked up then, and gave me a crooked smile. \u201cHe loved me, he said. And if I couldna give him that in return\u2014and he kent I couldn\u2019t\u2014then he\u2019d not take counterfeit for true coin.\u201d</p><p>He shook himself, hard, like a dog coming out of the water.</p><p>\u201cNo. A man who would say such a thing is not one who\u2019d bugger a child for the sake of his father\u2019s bonny blue eyes, I\u2019ll tell ye that for certain, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me . . .\u201d I hesitated, and he looked at me, one eyebrow up. \u201cIf\u2014if he had . . . er . . . taken you up on that offer\u2014and you\u2019d found him . . .\u201d I fumbled for some reasonable wording. \u201cLess, um, decent than you might hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have broken his neck there by the lake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldna have mattered if they\u2019d hanged me; I\u2019d not have let him have the boy.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t, and I did,\u201d he added with a half-shrug. \u201cAnd if wee Bobby goes to his Lordship\u2019s bed, I think it will be of his own free will.\u201d</p><p>NO MAN IS really at his best with someone else\u2019s hand up his arse. I had noticed this before, and Robert Higgins was no exception to the general rule.</p><p>\u201cNow, this won\u2019t hurt much at all,\u201d I said as soothingly as possible. \u201cAll you need to do is to keep quite still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I s\u2019all do that, mum, indeed I will,\u201d he assured me fervently.</p><p>I had him on the surgery table, wearing only his shirt, and situated foursquare on hands and knees, which brought the area of operation conveniently to eye level. The forceps and ligatures I should need were placed on the small table to my right, with a bowl of fresh leeches alongside, in case of need.</p><p>He emitted a small shriek when I applied a wet cloth soaked in turpentine to the area, in order to cleanse it thoroughly, but was as good as his word and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNow, we are going to obtain a very good effect here,\u201d I assured him, taking up a pair of long-nosed forceps. \u201cBut if the relief is to be permanent, there will have to be a drastic change in your diet. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>He gasped deeply, as I grasped one of the hemorrhoids and pulled it toward me. There were three, a classic presentation, at nine, two, and five o\u2019clock. Bulbous as raspberries, and quite the same color.</p><p>\u201cOh! Y-yes, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOatmeal,\u201d I said firmly, transferring the forceps to my other hand without lessening the grip, and taking up a needle threaded with silk thread in my right. \u201cPorridge every morning, without fail. Have you noticed a change for the better in your bowel habits, since Mrs. Bug has been feeding you parritch for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>I passed the thread loosely round the base of the hemorrhoid, then delicately pushed the needle up beneath the loop, making a small noose of it, and pulled tight.</p><p>\u201cAhhh . . . oh! Erm . . . tell \u2019ee truth, mum, it\u2019s like shitting house bricks covered with hedgehog skin, makes no matter what I eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it will,\u201d I assured him, securing the ligature with a knot. I released the hemorrhoid, and he breathed deeply. \u201cNow, grapes. You like grapes, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2019m. Sets me teeth on edge to bite \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His teeth didn\u2019t look badly decayed; I should have a closer look at his mouth; he might be suffering from marginal scurvy. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have Mrs. Bug make a nice raisin pie for you; you can eat that with no difficulty. Does Lord John have a capable cook?\u201d I took aim with my forceps and got hold of the next one. Now accustomed to the sensation, he only grunted a bit.</p><p>\u201cYessum. Be an Indian, he is, named Manoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Round, up, tighten, tie off. \u201cI\u2019ll write out a receipt for the raisin pie, for you to carry back to him. Does he cook yams, or beans? Beans are quite good for the purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI b\u2019lieve he does, mum, but his Lordship\u2014\u201d</p><p>I had the windows open for ventilation\u2014Bobby was no filthier than the average, but he was certainly no cleaner\u2014and at this point, I heard sounds from the trailhead; voices, and the jingle of harness.</p><p>Bobby heard them, too, and glanced wildly at the window, hindquarters tensing as though to spring off the table like a grasshopper. I grasped him by one leg, but then thought better of it. There was no way of covering the window, bar closing the shutters, and I needed the light.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and stand up,\u201d I told him, letting go and reaching for a towel. \u201cI\u2019ll go and see who it is.\u201d He followed this direction with alacrity, scrambling down and reaching hastily for his breeches.</p><p>I stepped out onto the porch, in time to greet the two men who led their mules up over the last arduous slope and into the yard. Richard Brown, and his brother Lionel, from the eponymously named Brownsville. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was surprised to see them; it was a good three-day ride to Brownsville from the Ridge, and there was little commerce between the two settlements. It was at least that far to Salem, in the opposite direction, but the inhabitants of the Ridge went there much more frequently; the Moravians were both industrious and great traders, taking honey, oil, salt fish, and hides in trade for cheese, pottery, chickens, and other small livestock. So far as I knew, the denizens of Brownsville dealt only in cheap trade goods for the Cherokee, and in the production of a very inferior type of beer, not worth the ride.</p><p>\u201cGood day, mistress.\u201d Richard, the smaller and elder of the brothers, touched the brim of his hat, but didn\u2019t take it off. \u201cIs your husband to home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out by the hay barn, scraping hides.\u201d I wiped my hands carefully on the towel I was carrying. \u201cDo come round to the kitchen; I\u2019ll bring up some cider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble.\u201d Without further ado, he turned and set off purposefully round the house. Lionel Brown, a bit taller than his brother, though with the same spare, almost gangly build and the same tobacco-colored hair, nodded briefly to me as he followed.</p> <p>They had left their mules, reins hanging, evidently for me to tend. The animals were beginning to amble slowly across the yard, pausing to crop the long grass that edged the path.</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d I said, glaring after the brothers Brown.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d said a low voice behind me. Bobby Higgins had come out and was peering off the corner of the porch with his good eye. Bobby tended to be wary of strangers\u2014and no wonder, given his experiences in Boston.</p><p>\u201cNeighbors, such as they are.\u201d I lunged off the porch and caught one of the mules by the bridle as he reached for the peach sapling I had planted near the porch. Disliking this interference in his affairs, he brayed ear-splittingly in my face, and attempted to bite me.</p><p>\u201cHere, mum, let me.\u201d Bobby, already holding the other mule\u2019s reins, leaned past to take the halter from me. \u201cHark at \u2019ee!\u201d he said to the obstreperous mule. \u201cHush tha noise, else I take a stick to \u2019ee, then!\u201d</p> <p>Bobby had been a foot soldier rather than cavalry, it was clear to see. The words were bold enough, but ill-matched with his tentative manner. He gave a perfunctory yank on the mule\u2019s reins. The mule promptly laid back its ears and bit him in the arm.</p><p>He screamed and let go both sets of reins. Clarence, my own mule, hearing the racket, set up a loud bray of greeting from his pen, and the two strange mules promptly trotted off in that direction, stirrup leathers bouncing.</p><p>Bobby wasn\u2019t badly hurt, though the mule\u2019s teeth had broken the skin; spots of blood seeped through the sleeve of his shirt. As I was turning back the cloth to have a look at it, I heard footsteps on the porch, and looked up to see Lizzie, a large wooden spoon in hand, looking alarmed.</p><p>\u201cBobby! What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>He straightened at once, seeing her, assuming nonchalance, and brushed a lock of curly brown hair off his brow.</p><p>\u201cAh, oh! Naught, miss. Bit o\u2019 trouble with tha sons o\u2019 Belial, like. No fear, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>Whereupon his eyes rolled up in his head and he fell over in a dead faint.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lizzie flew down the steps and knelt beside him, urgently patting his cheek. \u201cIs he all right, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d I said frankly. \u201cI think so, though.\u201d Bobby appeared to be breathing normally, and I found a reasonable pulse in his wrist.</p><p>\u201cShall we carry him inside? Or should I fetch a burnt feather, do you think? Or the spirits of ammonia from the surgery? Or some brandy?\u201d Lizzie hovered like an anxious bumblebee, ready to fly off in any of several different directions.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think he\u2019s coming round.\u201d Most faints last only a few seconds, and I could see his chest lift as his breathing deepened.</p><p>\u201cBit o\u2019 brandy wouldn\u2019t come amiss,\u201d he murmured, eyelids beginning to flutter.</p><p>I nodded to Lizzie, who vanished back into the house, leaving her spoon behind on the grass.</p><p>\u201cFeeling a bit peaky, are you?\u201d I inquired sympathetically. The injury to his arm was no more than a scratch, and I certainly hadn\u2019t done anything of a shocking nature to him\u2014well, not physically shocking. What was the trouble here?</p> <p>\u201cI dunno, mum.\u201d He was trying to sit up, and while he was white as a sheet, seemed otherwise all right, so I let him. \u201cIt\u2019s only, every now and again, I gets these spots, like, whirring round me head like a swarm o\u2019 bees, and then it all goes black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and again? It\u2019s happened before?\u201d I asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cYessum.\u201d His head wobbled like a sunflower in the breeze, and I put a hand under his armpit, lest he fall over again. \u201cHis Lordship was in hopes you might know summat would stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Lord\u2014oh, he knew about the fainting?\u201d Well, of course he would, if Bobby were in the habit of falling over in front of him.</p><p>He nodded, and took a deep, gasping breath.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Potts bled me regular, twice a week, but it didn\u2019t seem to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay not. I hope he was of somewhat more help with your piles,\u201d I remarked dryly.</p><p>A faint tinge of pink\u2014he had scarcely enough blood to provide a decent blush, poor boy\u2014rose in his cheeks, and he glanced away, fixing his gaze on the spoon.</p><p>\u201cErm . . . I, um, didn\u2019t mention that to anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d I was surprised at that. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, \u2019twas only the riding. From Virginia.\u201d The pink tinge grew. \u201cI\u2019d not have let on, save I was in such agony after a week on yon bloody horse\u2014saving your presence, mum\u2014I\u2019d no chance of hiding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lord John didn\u2019t know about that, either?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head vigorously, making the disheveled brown curls flop back over his forehead. I felt rather annoyed\u2014with myself for having evidently misjudged John Grey\u2019s motives, and with John Grey, for making me feel a fool.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . are you feeling a bit better, now?\u201d Lizzie was not appearing with the brandy, and I wondered momentarily where she was. Bobby was still very pale, but nodded gamely, and struggled to his feet, where he stood swaying and blinking, trying to keep his balance. The \u201cM\u201d branded on his cheek stood out, an angry red against the pallid skin.</p><p>Distracted by Bobby\u2019s faint, I had ignored the sounds coming from the other side of the house. Now, though, I became aware of voices, and approaching footsteps.</p><p>Jamie and the two Browns came into sight round the corner of the house, then stopped, seeing us. Jamie had been frowning slightly; the frown grew deeper. The Browns, by contrast, seemed oddly elated, though in a grim sort of way.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true, then.\u201d Richard Brown stared hard at Bobby Higgins, then turned to Jamie. \u201cYou\u2019ve a murderer on your premises!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d Jamie was coldly polite. \u201cI\u2019d no idea.\u201d He bowed to Bobby Higgins with his best French-court manner, then straightened, gesturing to the Browns. \u201cMr. Higgins, may I present Mr. Richard Brown and Mr. Lionel Brown. Gentlemen, my guest, Mr. Higgins.\u201d The words \u201cmy guest\u201d were spoken with a particular emphasis that made Richard Brown\u2019s thin mouth compress to near invisibility.</p><p>\u201cHave a care, Fraser,\u201d he said, staring hard at Bobby, as though daring him to evaporate. \u201cKeeping the wrong company can be dangerous, these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI choose my company as I will, sir.\u201d Jamie spoke softly, biting off each word between his teeth. \u201cAnd I do not choose yours. Joseph!\u201d</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s father, Joseph Wemyss, appeared round the corner, leading the two renegade mules, who now seemed docile as kittens, though either of them dwarfed Mr. Wemyss.</p><p>Bobby Higgins, flabbergasted by the proceedings, looked wildly at me for explanation. I shrugged slightly, and kept silence as the two Browns mounted and rode out of the clearing, backs stiff with anger.</p><p>Jamie waited \u2019til they\u2019d disappeared from view, then blew out his breath, rubbing a hand viciously through his hair and muttering something in Gaelic. I didn\u2019t follow the finer points, but I gathered that he was comparing the character of our recent visitors to that of Mr. Higgins\u2019s piles\u2014to the detriment of the former.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon, sir?\u201d Higgins looked bewildered, but anxious to please.</p><p>Jamie glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cLet them awa\u2019 and bile their heids,\u201d he said, dismissing the Browns with a flip of the hand. He caught my eye and turned toward the house. \u201cCome ben, Bobby; I\u2019ve a thing or two to say to ye.\u201d</p><p>I FOLLOWED them in, both from curiosity and in case Mr. Higgins should feel faint again; he seemed steady enough, but still very pale. By contrast with Bobby Higgins, Mr. Wemyss\u2014fair-haired and slight as his daughter\u2014looked the picture of ruddy health. Whatever was the matter with Bobby? I wondered. I stole a discreet look at the seat of his breeches as I followed him, but that was all right; no bleeding.</p><p>Jamie led the way into his study, gesturing at the motley collection of stools and boxes he used for visitors, but both Bobby and Mr. Wemyss chose to stand\u2014Bobby for obvious reasons, Mr. Wemyss from respect; he was never comfortable sitting in Jamie\u2019s presence, save at meals.</p><p>Unhampered by either bodily or social reservations, I settled myself on the best stool and raised one eyebrow at Jamie, who had sat down himself at the table he used as a desk.</p><p>\u201cThis is the way of it,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cBrown and his brother have declared themselves head of a Committee of Safety, and came to enlist me and my tenants as members of it.\u201d He glanced at me, the corner of his mouth curling a little. \u201cI declined, as ye doubtless noticed.\u201d</p><p>My stomach contracted slightly, thinking of what Major MacDonald had said\u2014and of what I knew. It was beginning, then.</p><p>\u201cCommittee of Safety?\u201d Mr. Wemyss looked bewildered, and glanced at Bobby Higgins\u2014who was beginning to look substantially less so.</p><p>\u201cHave they, so?\u201d Bobby said softly. Strands of curly brown hair had escaped from their binding; he fingered one back behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve heard of such committees before, Mr. Higgins?\u201d Jamie inquired, raising one brow.</p><p>\u201cMet one, zur. Close-like.\u201d Bobby touched a finger briefly below his blind eye. He was still pale, but beginning to recover his self-possession. \u201cMobs they be, zur. Like they mules, but more of them\u2014and more wicious.\u201d He gave a lopsided smile, smoothing the shirt-sleeve over the bite on his arm.</p><p>The mention of mules reminded me abruptly, and I stood up, putting a sudden stop to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cLizzie! Where\u2019s Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for an answer to this rhetorical question, I went to the study door and shouted her name\u2014only to be met by silence. She\u2019d gone in for brandy; there was plenty, in a jug in the kitchen, and she knew that\u2014I\u2019d seen her reach it down for Mrs. Bug only the night before. She must be in the house. Surely she wouldn\u2019t have gone\u2014</p><p>\u201cElizabeth? Elizabeth, where are you?\u201d Mr. Wemyss was right behind me, calling, as I strode down the hall to the kitchen.</p><p>Lizzie was lying in a dead faint on the hearth, a limp bundle of clothes, one frail hand flung out as though she had tried to save herself as she fell.</p><p>\u201cMiss Wemyss!\u201d Bobby Higgins shouldered his way past me, looking frantic, and scooped her up into his arms.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth!\u201d Mr. Wemyss elbowed his way past me as well, his face nearly as white as his daughter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDo let me look at her, will you?\u201d I said, elbowing firmly back. \u201cPut her down on the settle, Bobby, do.\u201d</p><p>He rose carefully with her in his arms, then sat down on the settle, still holding her, wincing slightly as he did so. Well, if he wanted to be a hero, I hadn\u2019t time to argue with him. I knelt and seized her wrist in search of a pulse, smoothing the pale hair off her face with my other hand.</p><p>One look had been enough to tell me what was likely the matter. She was clammy to the touch, and the pallor of her face was tinged with gray. I could feel the tremor of oncoming chills that ran through her flesh, unconscious as she was.</p><p>\u201cThe ague\u2019s back, is it?\u201d Jamie asked. He\u2019d appeared by my side, and was gripping Mr. Wemyss by the shoulder, at once comforting and restraining.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said briefly. Lizzie had malaria, contracted on the coast a few years before, and was subject to occasional relapses\u2014though she hadn\u2019t had one in more than a year.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss took a deep, audible breath, a little color coming back to his face. He was familiar with malaria, and had confidence that I could deal with it. I had, several times before.</p><p>I hoped that I could this time. Lizzie\u2019s pulse was fast and light under my fingers, but regular, and she was beginning to stir. Still, the speed and suddenness with which the attack had come on was frightening. Had she had any warning? I hoped the concern I felt didn\u2019t show on my face.</p><p>\u201cTake her up to her bed, cover her, get a hot stone for her feet,\u201d I said, rising and addressing Bobby and Mr. Wemyss briskly in turn. \u201cI\u2019ll start some medicine brewing.\u201d</p><p>Jamie followed me down to the surgery, glancing back over his shoulder to be sure that the others were out of earshot before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI thought ye were out of the Jesuit bark?\u201d he asked, low-voiced.</p><p>\u201cI am. Damn it.\u201d Malaria was a chronic disease, but for the most part, I had been able to keep it under control with small, regular doses of cinchona bark. But I had run out of cinchona during the winter, and no one had yet been able to travel down to the coast for more.</p><p>\u201cSo, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>I pulled open the door of the cupboard, and gazed at the neat ranks of glass bottles therein\u2014many of them empty, or with no more than a few scattered crumbs of leaf or root inside. Everything was depleted, after a cold, wet winter of grippe, influenza, chilblains, and hunting accidents.</p><p>Febrifuges. I had a number of things that would help a normal fever; malaria was something else. There was plenty of dogwood root and bark, at least; I had collected immense quantities during the fall, foreseeing the need. I took that down, and after a moment\u2019s thought, added the jar containing a sort of gentian known locally as \u201cagueweed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut on the kettle, will you?\u201d I asked Jamie, frowning to myself as I crumbled roots, bark, and weed into my mortar. All I could do was to treat the superficial symptoms of fever and chill. And shock, I thought, better treat for that, too.</p><p>\u201cAnd bring me a little honey, too, please!\u201d I called after him, as he had already reached the door. He nodded and went hurriedly toward the kitchen, his footsteps quick and solid on the oak floorboards.</p><p>I began to pound the mixture, still turning over additional possibilities. Some small part of my mind was half-glad of the emergency; I could put off for a little while the necessity of hearing about the Browns and their beastly committee.</p><p>I had a most uneasy feeling. Whatever they wanted, it didn\u2019t portend anything good, I was sure; they certainly hadn\u2019t left on friendly terms. As for what Jamie might feel obliged to do in response to them\u2014</p><p>Horse chestnut. That was sometimes used for the tertian ague, as Dr. Rawlings called it. Did I have any left? Glancing quickly over the jars and bottles in the medicine chest, I stopped, seeing one with an inch or so of dried black globules left at the bottom. Gallberries, the label read. Not mine; it was one of Rawlings\u2019s jars. I\u2019d never used them for anything. But something niggled at my memory. I\u2019d heard or read something about gallberries; what was it?</p><p>Half-unconsciously, I picked up the jar and opened it, sniffing. A sharp, astringent smell rose from the berries, slightly bitter. And slightly familiar.</p><p>Still holding the jar, I went to the table where my big black casebook lay, and flipped hastily to the early pages, those notes left by the man who had first owned both book and medicine chest, Daniel Rawlings. Where had it been?</p><p>I was still flipping pages, scanning for the shape of a half-remembered note, when Jamie came back, a jug of hot water and a dish of honey in hand\u2014and the Beardsley twins dogging his steps.</p><p>I glanced at them, but said nothing; they tended to pop up unexpectedly, like a pair of jack-in-the boxes.</p><p>\u201cIs Miss Lizzie fearfully sick?\u201d Jo asked anxiously, peering around Jamie to see what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said briefly, only half paying attention to him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though; I\u2019m fixing her some medicine.\u201d</p><p>There it was. A brief notation, added as an obvious afterthought to the account of treatment of a patient whose symptoms seemed clearly malarial\u2014and who had, I noticed with an unpleasant twinge, died.</p><p>I am told by the Trader from whom I procured Jesuit Bark that the Indians use a Plant called Gallberry, which rivals the Bark of Cinchona for bitterness and is thought capital for Use in tertian and quartan Fevers. I have collected some for Experiment and propose to try an Infusion so soon as the Opportunity presents itself.</p><p>I picked out one of the dried berries and bit into it. The pungent taste of quinine at once flooded my mouth\u2014accompanied by a copious flood of saliva, as my mouth puckered at the eye-watering bitterness. Gallberry, indeed!</p><p>I dived for the open window, spat into the herb bed beneath and went on spitting, to the accompaniment of giggles and snorts from the Beardsleys, who were most diverted at the unexpected entertainment.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d Amusement was fighting with worry for dominance of Jamie\u2019s face. He poured a bit of water from the jug into a clay beaker, added a dollop of honey as an afterthought, and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I croaked. \u201cDon\u2019t drop that!\u201d Kezzie Beardsley had picked up the jar of gallberries and was sniffing cautiously at it. He nodded at my admonition, but didn\u2019t put the jar down, instead handing it off to his brother.</p><p>I took a good mouthful of hot, honeyed water, and swallowed. \u201cThose\u2014they have something like quinine in them.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face changed at once, the worry lessening.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll help the lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. There aren\u2019t many, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye mean you need more o\u2019 these things for Miss Lizzie, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d Jo glanced up at me, dark eyes sharp over the little jar.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean you know where to get any, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am,\u201d Kezzie said, his voice a little loud, as usual. \u201cIndians got \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Indians?\u201d Jamie asked, his gaze sharpening.</p><p>\u201cThem Cherokee,\u201d Jo said, waving vaguely over one shoulder. \u201cBy the mountain.\u201d</p><p>This description might have suited half a dozen villages, but evidently it was a specific village that they had in mind, for the two of them turned as one, obviously intending to go directly and fetch back gallberries.</p><p>\u201cWait a bit, lads,\u201d Jamie said, snagging Kezzie by the collar. \u201cI\u2019ll go along with ye. Ye\u2019ll be needing something to trade, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we got hides a-plenty, sir,\u201d Jo assured him. \u201c\u2019Twas a good season.\u201d</p><p>Jo was an expert hunter, and while Kezzie still hadn\u2019t sufficiently keen hearing to hunt well, his brother had taught him to run traplines. Ian had told me that the Beardsleys\u2019 shack was stacked nearly to the rooftree with the hides of beaver, marten, deer, and ermine. The smell of it always clung to them, a faint miasma of dried blood, musk, and cold hair.</p><p>\u201cAye? Well, that\u2019s generous of ye, Jo, to be sure. But I\u2019ll come, nonetheless.\u201d Jamie glanced at me, acknowledging the fact that he had made his decision\u2014but asking for my approval, nonetheless. I swallowed, tasting bitterness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and cleared my throat. \u201cIf\u2014if you\u2019re going, let me send some things, and tell you what to ask for in trade. You won\u2019t leave until morning, surely?\u201d</p><p>The Beardsleys were vibrating with impatience to be gone, but Jamie stood still, looking at me, and I felt him touch me, without words or movement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwe\u2019ll bide for the night.\u201d He turned then to the Beardsleys. \u201cGo up, will ye, Jo, and ask Bobby Higgins to come down. I\u2019ll need to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s up with Miss Lizzie?\u201d Jo Beardsley looked displeased at this, and his brother\u2019s face echoed his expression of slit-eyed suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he a-doin\u2019 in her room, then? Don\u2019t he know she\u2019s betrothed?\u201d Kezzie asked, righteously.</p><p>\u201cHer father\u2019s with her, too,\u201d Jamie assured them. \u201cHer reputation\u2019s safe, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jo snorted briefly, but the brothers exchanged glances, then left together, slender shoulders set in determination to oust this threat to Lizzie\u2019s virtue.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll do it?\u201d I set down the pestle. \u201cBe an Indian agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I must. If I do not\u2014Richard Brown surely will. I think I canna risk that.\u201d He hesitated, then drew close and touched me lightly, fingers on my elbow. \u201cI\u2019ll send the lads back at once with the berries ye need. I may need to stay for a day, maybe two. For the talking, aye?\u201d To tell the Cherokee that he was now an agent for the British Crown, he meant\u2014and to make arrangements for word to be spread that the headmen of the mountain villages should come down later to a council for parley and gifts.</p><p>I nodded, feeling a small bubble of fear swell under my breastbone. It was starting. No matter how much one knows that something dreadful is going to happen in the future, one somehow never thinks it will be today.</p><p>\u201cNot\u2014don\u2019t stay away too long, will you?\u201d I blurted, not wanting to burden him with my fears, but unable to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, and his hand rested for an instant in the small of my back. \u201cDinna fash yourself; I\u2019ll not tarry.\u201d</p><p>The sound of feet descending the stairs echoed in the hall. I supposed Mr. Wemyss had shooed the Beardsleys out, along with Bobby. They didn\u2019t stop, but went off without speaking, casting looks of veiled dislike at Bobby, who seemed quite oblivious to them.</p><p>\u201cYon lad said you wanted to speak to me, zur?\u201d He\u2019d regained some color, I was glad to see, and seemed steady enough on his feet. He glanced uneasily at the table, still spread with the sheet I\u2019d put him on, and then at me, but I merely shook my head. I\u2019d finish dealing with his piles later.</p><p>\u201cAye, Bobby.\u201d Jamie made a brief gesture toward a stool, as though to invite Bobby to sit, but I cleared my throat in a meaningful manner, and he stopped, then leaned against the table, rather than sitting down himself.</p><p>\u201cThose two who came\u2014Brown, they\u2019re called. They\u2019ve a settlement some way away. Ye said ye\u2019ve heard of the Committees of Safety, aye? So ye\u2019ll have some notion what they\u2019re about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, zur. Tha Browns, zur\u2014did they want me?\u201d He spoke calmly enough, but I saw him swallow briefly, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing in his slender throat.</p><p>Jamie sighed, and ran a hand through his hair. The sun was slanting through the window now, and struck him directly, making his red hair glow with flame\u2014and picking out here and there a flicker of the silver that was beginning to show among the ruddy strands.</p><p>\u201cThey did. They kent ye were here; heard of ye, doubtless from someone ye met along the way. Ye\u2019ll have told folk where ye were headed, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded, wordless.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they want with him?\u201d I asked, tipping the ground root bark and berries into a bowl and pouring hot water over them to steep.</p><p>\u201cThey didna make that quite clear,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cBut then, I didna give them the chance. I only told them they\u2019d take a guest from my hearth over my dead body\u2014and theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thanks \u2019ee for that, zur.\u201d Bobby took a deep breath. \u201cThey\u2014knew, I reckon? About Boston? I\u2019d not told anyone that, surely.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s frown deepened slightly.</p><p>\u201cAye, they did. They pretended to think I didna ken; told me I was harboring a murderer unbeknownst, and a threat to the public welfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first is true enough,\u201d Bobby said, touching his brand gingerly, as though it still burned him. He offered a wan smile. \u201cBut I dunno as I s\u2019ould be a threat to anyone, these days.\u201d</p><p>Jamie dismissed that.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, Bobby, that they do ken ye\u2019re here. They\u2019ll not come and drag ye away, I think. But I\u2019d ask ye to go canny about the place. I\u2019ll make provision to see ye safely back to Lord John, when the time comes, with an escort. I gather ye\u2019re no quite finished with him?\u201d he asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d I replied equably. Bobby looked apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Jamie reached into the waist of his breeches, and drew out a pistol, which had been hidden by the folds of his shirt. It was, I saw, the fancy gilt-edged one.</p><p>\u201cKeep it by ye,\u201d Jamie said, handing it to Bobby. \u201cThere\u2019s powder and shot in the sideboard. Will ye look out for my wife and family, then, whilst I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Bobby looked startled, but then nodded, tucking the pistol away in his own breeches. \u201cI will so, zur. Depend upon it!\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled at him, his eyes warming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a comfort to me, Bobby. Will ye maybe go and find my son-in-law? I\u2019ll need a word with him before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, zur. Right away!\u201d He squared his shoulders and set off, an expression of determination on his poet\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they would have done with him?\u201d I asked softly, as the outer door closed behind him. \u201cThe Browns.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGod knows. Hanged him at a crossroad, maybe\u2014or maybe only beaten him and driven him out of the mountains. They want to make a show of being able to protect the folk, aye? From dangerous criminals and the like,\u201d he added, with a twist of the mouth.</p><p>\u201cA government derives its powers from the just consent of the governed,\u201d I quoted, nodding. \u201cFor a Committee of Safety to have any legitimacy, there needs to be an obvious threat to the public safety. Clever of the Browns to have reasoned that out.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, one auburn brow raised.</p><p>\u201cWho said that? The consent of the governed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas Jefferson,\u201d I replied, feeling smug. \u201cOr rather, he will say it in another two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll steal it from a gentleman named Locke in another two years,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI suppose Richard Brown must ha\u2019 been decently educated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike me, you mean?\u201d I said, unruffled. \u201cIf you expect trouble from the Browns, though, should you have given Bobby that particular pistol?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need the good ones. And I doubt verra much that he\u2019ll fire that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounting on its deterrent effect?\u201d I was skeptical, but he was likely right.</p><p>\u201cAye, that. But more on Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019d fire a gun again to save his own life\u2014but he would, maybe, to save yours. And should it come to such a pass, they\u2019ll be too close to miss.\u201d He spoke with dispassion, but I felt the hairs prickle down my nape.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a comfort,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd just how do you know what he\u2019d do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked to him,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cThe man he shot in Boston was the first he\u2019d ever killed. He doesna want to do it again.\u201d He straightened, and moved restlessly toward the counter, where he busied himself in straightening a scatter of small instruments I had laid out for cleaning.</p><p>I moved to stand beside him, watching. There was a handful of small cautery irons and scalpels, soaking in a beaker of turpentine. He took them out, one by one, wiped them dry and laid them back in their box, neatly, side by side. The spade-shaped metal ends of the irons were blackened by use; the scalpel blades were weathered to a soft glow, but the sharp edges gleamed, a hairbreadth of bright silver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said quietly. I meant it to be a reassuring statement, but it came out with a tinge of question.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d he said. He put the last iron in its box, but didn\u2019t replace the lid. Instead, he stood, hands spread flat on the counter, looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cI dinna want to go,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI dinna want to do this.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was speaking to me, or to himself\u2014but I thought he wasn\u2019t referring only to his journey to the Cherokee village.</p> <p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I whispered, and moved a little closer, so I felt his breathing. He lifted his hands then and turned toward me, taking me into his arms, and we stood wrapped close, listening to each other\u2019s breathing, the bitter smell of the brewing tea seeping through the homely scents of linen, dust, and sun-warmed flesh.</p><p>There were still choices to be made, decisions to reach, actions to take. Many of them. But in one day, one hour, one single declaration of intent, we had stepped across the threshold of war.</p><p>10</p><p>DUTY CALLS</p><p>JAMIE HAD SENT BOBBY after Roger Mac, but found himself too restless to wait, and set off himself, leaving Claire to her brewing.</p> <p>Everything seemed peaceful and beautiful outside. A brown sheep with a pair of lambs stood indolently in her pen, jaws moving in a slow stupor of satisfaction, the lambs hopping awkwardly to and fro like fuzzy grasshoppers behind her. Claire\u2019s herb bed was full of leafing greens and sprouting flowers.</p><p>The well lid was ajar; he bent to draw it into place and found the boards had warped. He added fixing that to the constant list of chores and repairs that he carried in his head, wishing fervently that he could devote the next few days to digging, hauling manure, shingling, and the like, instead of what he was about to do.</p><p>He\u2019d rather bury the old privy pit or castrate pigs than go and ask Roger Mac what he kent about Indians and revolutions. He found it mildly gruesome to discuss the future with his son-in-law, and tried never to do it.</p><p>The things Claire told him of her own time seemed often fantastic, with the enjoyable half-real sense of faery tales, and sometimes macabre, but always interesting, for what he learned of his wife from the telling. Brianna tended to share with him small, homely details of machinery, which were interesting, or wild stories of men walking on the moon, which were immensely entertaining, but no threat to his peace of mind.</p><p>Roger Mac, though, had a cold-blooded way of talking that reminded him to an uncomfortable degree of the works of the historians he\u2019d read, and had therefore a sense of concrete doom about it. Talking to Roger Mac made it seem all too likely that this, that, or the other frightful happenstance was not only indeed going to happen\u2014but would most likely have direct and personal consequences.</p><p>It was like talking to a particularly evil-minded fortune-teller, he thought, one you hadn\u2019t paid enough to hear something pleasant. The thought made a sudden memory pop up on the surface of his mind, bobbing like a fishing cork.</p> <p>In Paris. He\u2019d been with friends, other students, drinking in the piss-smelling taverns near the universit\u00e9. He\u2019d been fairly drunk himself when someone took a fancy to have his palms read, and he had pushed with the others into the corner where the old woman who did it always sat, scarcely visible amid the gloom and clouds of pipe smoke.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t intended to do it himself; he had only a few pennies in his pocket, and didn\u2019t mean to waste them on unholy nonsense. He\u2019d said so, loudly.</p><p>Whereupon a scraggy claw had shot out of the darkness and seized his hand, sinking long, filthy nails into his flesh. He\u2019d yelped in surprise, and his friends all laughed. They laughed harder when she spat in his palm.</p><p>She rubbed the spittle into his skin in a businesslike way, bent close enough that he could smell the ancient sweat of her and see the lice crawling in the grizzled hair that keeked from the edge of her rusty-black shawl. She peered into his hand and a dirty nail traced the lines of it, tickling. He tried to pull his hand away, but she tightened her grip on his wrist, and he found to his surprise that he could not break it.</p><p>\u201cT\u2019es un chat, toi,\u201d the old woman had remarked, in tones of malicious interest. \u201cYou\u2019re a cat, you. A little red cat.\u201d</p><p>Dubois\u2014that was his name, Dubois\u2014had at once begun to miaou and yowl, to the amusement of the others. He himself refused to rise to the bait, and saying only, \u201cMerci, madame,\u201d tried again to pull away.</p><p>\u201cNeuf,\u201d she said, tapping rapid random places on his palm, then seizing a finger and wiggling it by way of emphasis. \u201cYou have a nine in your hand. And death,\u201d she\u2019d added offhandedly. \u201cYou\u2019ll die nine times before you rest in your grave.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d let go then, amidst a chorus of sarcastic \u201caou-la-las!\u201d from the French students, and laughter from the rest.</p> <p>He snorted, sending the memory back where it came from, and good riddance to it. The old woman refused to go so easily, though, and called to him through the years, as she\u2019d called through the raucous, beer-filled air of the tavern.</p><p>\u201cSometimes dying doesn\u2019t hurt, mon p\u2019tit chat,\u201d she\u2019d called after him, mocking. \u201cBut more often it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he muttered, and stopped, appalled, hearing himself. Christ. It wasn\u2019t himself he was hearing, but his godfather.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, laddie. It doesna hurt a bit, to die.\u201d He missed his footing and staggered, caught himself and stood still, a taste of metal on the back of his tongue.</p><p>His heart was thumping, suddenly, for no reason, as though he had run miles. He saw the cabin, certainly, and heard the calling of jays in the half-leafed chestnut trees. But he saw even more clearly Murtagh\u2019s face, the grim lines of it relaxing into peace and the deep-set black eyes fixed on his, shifting in and out of focus, as though his godfather looked at once at him and at something far beyond him. He felt the weight of Murtagh\u2019s body in his arms, growing suddenly heavy as he died.</p><p>The vision vanished, as abruptly as it had come, and he found himself standing next to a rain puddle, staring at a wooden duck half-mired in the mud.</p><p>He crossed himself, with a quick word for the repose of Murtagh\u2019s soul, then bent and retrieved the duck, washing the mud away in the puddle. His hands were trembling, and little wonder. His memories of Culloden were few and fragmentary\u2014but they were beginning to come back.</p><p>So far, such things had come to him only in glimpses at the edge of sleep. He\u2019d seen Murtagh there before, and in the dreams that followed.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told Claire about them. Not yet.</p><p>He pushed open the door of the cabin, but it was empty, the hearth smoored, spinning wheel and loom standing idle. Brianna was likely at Fergus\u2019s place, visiting Marsali. Where would Roger Mac be now? He stepped back outside and stood listening.</p><p>The thump of an ax came faintly from somewhere in the forest beyond the cabin. It stopped, then, and he heard men\u2019s voices, raised in greeting. He turned and headed for the trail that led upslope, half grown over with spring grass, but showing the black smudges of fresh footmarks.</p><p>What might the old woman have told him if he\u2019d paid her? he wondered. Had she lied to spite him for his miserliness\u2014or told him the truth, for the same reason?</p><p>One of the more disagreeable things about talking to Roger Mac was that Jamie was sure he always told the truth.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten to leave the duck at the cabin. Wiping it on his breeches, he pushed grimly through the sprouting weeds, to hear what fate awaited him.</p><p>11</p><p>BLOODWORK</p><p>I PUSHED THE MICROSCOPE toward Bobby Higgins, who had returned from his errand, his own discomforts forgotten in worry for Lizzie.</p><p>\u201cSee the round pinkish things?\u201d I said. \u201cThose are Lizzie\u2019s blood cells. Everyone has blood cells,\u201d I added. \u201cThey\u2019re what make your blood red.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Strewth,\u201d he muttered, amazed. \u201cI never knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you do,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you see that some of the blood cells are broken? And that some have little spots in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, mum,\u201d he said, screwing up his face and peering intently. \u201cWhat are \u2019ey, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParasites. Little beasts that get into your blood if a certain kind of mosquito bites you,\u201d I explained. \u201cThey\u2019re called Plasmodium. Once you\u2019ve got them, they go on living in your blood\u2014but every so often, they begin to . . . er . . . breed. When there are too many of them, they burst out of the blood cells, and that\u2019s what causes a malarial attack\u2014the ague. The sludge of the broken blood cells sort of silts up, you see, in the organs, and makes you feel terribly sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He straightened up, making a face of deep aversion at the microscope. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . that\u2019s pure gashly, that is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said, succeeding in keeping a straight face. \u201cBut quinine\u2014Jesuit bark, you know?\u2014will help stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good, mum, very good,\u201d he said, his face lightening. \u201cHowever you do come to know such things,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201c\u2019Tis a wonder!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know quite a lot of things about parasites,\u201d I said casually, taking the saucer off the bowl in which I had been brewing the mix of dogwood bark and gallberries. The liquid was a rich purplish black, and looked slightly viscous, now that it had cooled. It also smelled lethal, from which I deduced that it was about ready.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Bobby\u2014have you ever heard of hookworms?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me blankly.</p><p>\u201cNo, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. Would you hold this for me, please?\u201d I put a folded square of gauze over the neck of a flask and handed him the bottle to hold while I poured the purple mixture into it.</p><p>\u201cThese fainting fits of yours,\u201d I said, eyes on the stream. \u201cHow long have you had them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . six months, mebbe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Did you by chance notice any sort of irritation\u2014itching, say? Or a rash? Happening maybe seven months ago? Most likely on your feet.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, soft blue eyes thunderstruck as though I had performed some feat of mind reading.</p><p>\u201cWhy, so I did have, mum. Last autumn, \u2019twas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, then. I think, Bobby, that you may just possibly have a case of hookworms.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at himself in horror.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d I took the bottle from him and corked it. \u201cHookworms are parasites that burrow through the skin\u2014most often through the soles of the feet\u2014and then migrate through the body until they reach your intestines\u2014your, um, innards,\u201d I amended, seeing incomprehension cross his face. \u201cThe adult worms have nasty little hooked bills, like this\u201d\u2014I crooked my index finger in illustration\u2014\u201cand they pierce the intestinal lining and proceed to suck your blood. That\u2019s why, if you have them, you feel very weak, and faint frequently.\u201d</p><p>From the suddenly clammy look of him, I rather thought he was about to faint now, and guided him hastily to a stool, pushing his head down between his knees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s the problem,\u201d I told him, bending down to address him. \u201cI was just looking at the slides of Lizzie\u2019s blood, though, and thinking of parasites, and\u2014well, it came to me suddenly that a diagnosis of hookworms would fit your symptoms rather well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said faintly. The thick tail of wavy hair had fallen forward, leaving the back of his neck exposed, fair-skinned and childlike.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, Bobby?\u201d I asked, suddenly realizing that I had no idea.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three, mum,\u201d he said. \u201cMum? I think I s\u2019all have to puke.\u201d</p><p>I snatched a bucket from the corner and got it to him just in time.</p><p>\u201cHave I got rid of them?\u201d he asked weakly, sitting up and wiping his mouth on his sleeve as he peered into the bucket. \u201cI could do it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d I said sympathetically. \u201cAssuming that you have got hookworms, they\u2019re attached very firmly, and too far down for vomiting to dislodge them. The only way to be sure about it, though, is to look for the eggs they shed.\u201d</p><p>Bobby eyed me apprehensively.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly as I\u2019m horrible shy, mum,\u201d he said, shifting gingerly. \u201cYou know that. But Dr. Potts did give me great huge clysters of mustard water. Surely that would ha\u2019 burnt they worms right out? If I was a worm, I s\u2019ould let go and give up the ghost at once, did anyone souse me with mustard water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you would think so, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I said. \u201cUnfortunately not. But I won\u2019t give you an enema,\u201d I assured him. \u201cWe need to see whether you truly do have the worms, to begin with, and if so, there\u2019s a medicine I can mix up for you that will poison them directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looked a little happier at that. \u201cHow d\u2019ye mean to see, then, mum?\u201d He glanced narrowly at the counter, where the assortment of clamps and suture jars were still laid out.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be simpler,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI do a process called fecal sedimentation to concentrate the stool, then look for the eggs under the microscope.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, plainly not following. I smiled kindly at him.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do, Bobby, is shit.\u201d</p><p>His face was a study in doubt and apprehension.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, mum,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep the worms.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>FURTHER MYSTERIES</p><p>OF SCIENCE</p><p>LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, Roger MacKenzie came back from the cooper\u2019s shop to discover his wife deep in contemplation of an object sitting on his dinner table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that? Some type of prehistoric Christmas tinned goods?\u201d Roger extended a ginger forefinger toward a squat jar made of greenish glass and sealed with a cork, the latter covered with a stout layer of red wax. An amorphous chunk of something was visible inside, evidently submerged in liquid.</p><p>\u201cHo ho,\u201d said his wife tolerantly, moving the jar out of his reach. \u201cYou think you\u2019re being funny. It\u2019s white phosphorus\u2014a present from Lord John.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her; she was excited, the tip of her nose gone pink and bits of red hair pulled loose and waving in the breeze; like her father, she was inclined to run her hands through her hair when thinking.</p><p>\u201cAnd you intend to do . . . what with it?\u201d he asked, trying to keep any note of foreboding from his voice. He had the vaguest memories of hearing about the properties of phosphorus in his distant school days; he thought either it made you glow in the dark or it blew up. Neither prospect was reassuring.</p><p>\u201cWellll . . . make matches. Maybe.\u201d Her upper teeth fastened momentarily in the flesh of her lower lip as she considered the jar. \u201cI know how\u2014in theory. But it might be a little tricky in practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>\u201cWell, it bursts into flame if you expose it to air,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s packed in water. Don\u2019t touch, Jem! It\u2019s poisonous.\u201d Grabbing Jemmy round the middle, she pulled him down from the table, where he had been eyeing the jar with greedy curiosity.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, why worry about that? It will explode in his face before he has a chance to get it in his mouth.\u201d Roger picked up the jar for safekeeping, holding it as though it might go off in his hands. He wanted to ask whether she were insane, but had been married long enough to know the price of injudicious rhetorical questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere d\u2019ye mean to keep it?\u201d He cast an eloquent glance round the confines of the cabin, which in terms of storage boasted a blanket chest, a small shelf for books and papers, another for comb, toothbrushes, and Brianna\u2019s small cache of personal belongings, and a pie hutch. Jemmy had been able to open the pie hutch since the age of seven months or so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019d better put it in Mama\u2019s surgery,\u201d she replied, keeping an absentminded grip on Jem, who was struggling with single-minded energy to get at the pretty thing. \u201cNobody touches anything in there.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough; the people who were not afraid of Claire Fraser personally were generally terrified of the contents of her surgery, these featuring fearsomely painful-looking implements, mysterious murky brews, and vile-smelling medicines. In addition, the surgery had cupboards too high for even a determined climber like Jem to reach.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Roger said, anxious to get the jar out of Jem\u2019s vicinity. \u201cI\u2019ll take it up now, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Before Brianna could answer, a knock came at the door, followed immediately by Jamie Fraser. Jem instantly ceased trying to get at the jar and instead flung himself on his grandfather with shrieks of joy.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then, a bhailach?\u201d Jamie inquired amiably, neatly turning Jem upside down and holding him by the ankles. \u201cA word, Roger Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Ye\u2019ll sit, maybe?\u201d He\u2019d told Jamie earlier what he knew\u2014lamentably little\u2014regarding the role of the Cherokee in the upcoming Revolution. Had he come to inquire further? Reluctantly setting down the jar, Roger pulled out a stool and pushed it in his father-in-law\u2019s direction. Jamie accepted it with a nod, dexterously transferring Jemmy to a position over one shoulder and sitting down.</p><p>Jemmy giggled madly, squirming until his grandfather slapped him lightly on the seat of his breeches, whereupon he subsided, hanging contentedly upside-down like a sloth, his bright hair spilling down the back of Jamie\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way, a charaid,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI must be going in the morning to the Cherokee villages, and there is a thing I\u2019d ask ye to do in my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. D\u2019ye want me to see to the barley harvest, then?\u201d The early grain was still ripening. Everyone had his fingers crossed that the weather would keep fair for another few weeks, but the prospects were good.</p><p>\u201cNo, Brianna can do that\u2014if ye will, lass?\u201d He smiled at his daughter, who raised thick ruddy eyebrows, the twins of his.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhat are you planning to do with Ian, Roger, and Arch Bug, though?\u201d Arch Bug was Jamie\u2019s factor, and the logical person to be overseeing the harvest in Jamie\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I shall take Young Ian with me. The Cherokee ken him well, and he\u2019s comfortable wi\u2019 their speech. I\u2019ll take the Beardsley lads, too, so they can fetch back the berries and bits o\u2019 things your mother wants for Lizzie, straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go, too?\u201d Jemmy inquired hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, a bhailach. In the autumn, maybe.\u201d He patted Jemmy on the bottom, then returned his attention to Roger.</p><p>\u201cThat being so,\u201d he said, \u201cI need ye to go to Cross Creek, if ye will, and collect the new tenants.\u201d Roger felt a small surge of excitement\u2014and alarm\u2014at the prospect, but merely cleared his throat and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye. Of course. Will they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll take Arch Bug along, and Tom Christie.\u201d</p><p>A moment of incredulous silence greeted this statement.</p><p>\u201cTom Christie?\u201d Bree said, exchanging a glance of bafflement with Roger. \u201cWhat on earth for?\u201d The schoolmaster was a notably dour sort, and no one\u2019s idea of a congenial traveling companion.</p><p>Her father\u2019s mouth twisted wryly.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. There\u2019s the one small thing MacDonald neglected to tell me, when he asked if I\u2019d take them. They\u2019re Protestants, the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Roger. \u201cI see.\u201d Jamie met his eye and nodded, relieved to be so immediately understood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see.\u201d Brianna patted her hair, frowning, then pulled off the ribbon and began to comb her fingers slowly through it, undoing the tangles as a preliminary to brushing it. \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d</p><p>Roger and Jamie exchanged a brief but eloquent glance. Jamie shrugged, and pulled Jem down into his lap.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Roger rubbed his chin, trying to think how to explain two centuries of Scottish religious intolerance in any way that would make sense to an American of the twentieth century. \u201cAhh . . . ye recall the civil-rights thing in the States, integration in the South, all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cOkay. So, which side are the Negroes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d Jamie looked entirely baffled. \u201cWhere do Negroes come into the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite that simple,\u201d Roger assured her. \u201cJust an indication of the depth of feeling involved. Let us say that the notion of having a Catholic landlord is likely to cause our new tenants severe qualms\u2014and vice versa?\u201d he asked, glancing at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Negroes?\u201d Jemmy asked with interest.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . .dark-skinned people,\u201d Roger replied, suddenly aware of the potential quagmire opened up by this question. It was true that the term \u201cNegro\u201d didn\u2019t invariably mean also \u201cslave\u201d\u2014but near enough that there was little difference. \u201cD\u2019ye not remember them, from your great-auntie Jocasta\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>Jemmy frowned, adopting for an unsettling instant the precise expression his grandfather was wearing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d Bree said, calling the meeting to order with a sharp rap of her hairbrush on the table, \u201cthe point is that Mr. Christie is enough of a Protestant to make the new people feel comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething of the sort,\u201d her father agreed, one side of his mouth curling up. \u201cBetween your man here and Tom Christie, at least they\u2019ll not think they\u2019re entering the Devil\u2019s realm entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Roger said again, in a slightly different tone. So it wasn\u2019t only his position as son of the house and general right-hand man, was it\u2014but the fact that he was a Presbyterian, at least in name. He raised a brow at Jamie, who shrugged in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Roger said, resigned.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d said Jamie, satisfied.</p><p>\u201cStop doing that,\u201d Brianna said crossly. \u201cFine. So you and Tom Christie are going to Cross Creek. Why is Arch Bug going?\u201d</p><p>Roger became aware, in a subliminally marital way, that his wife was disgruntled at the thought of being left behind to organize the harvest\u2014a filthy, exhausting job at the best of times\u2014whilst he frolicked with a squad of his co-religionists in the romantically exciting metropolis of Cross Creek, population two hundred.</p><p>\u201cIt will be Arch, mostly, helping them to settle and build themselves shelter before the cold,\u201d Jamie said logically. \u201cYe dinna mean to suggest, I hope, that I send him alone to talk to them?\u201d</p><p>Brianna smiled involuntarily at that; Arch Bug, married for decades to the voluble Mrs. Bug, was famous for his lack of speech. He could talk, but seldom did so, limiting his conversational contributions to the occasional genial \u201cMmp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ll likely never realize that Arch is Catholic,\u201d Roger said, rubbing his upper lip with a forefinger. \u201cOr is he, come to that? I\u2019ve never asked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Jamie said, very dryly. \u201cBut he\u2019s lived long enough to ken when to be silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see this is going to be a jolly expedition,\u201d Brianna said, raising one brow. \u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Roger said, feeling a stab of guilt at the casual blasphemy. He\u2019d have to revise his habits, and quickly. \u201cA month? Six weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d his father-in-law said cheerfully. \u201cThey\u2019ll be on foot, mind.\u201d</p><p>Roger took a deep breath, contemplating a slow march, en masse, from Cross Creek to the mountains, with Arch Bug on one side of him and Tom Christie on the other, twin pillars of taciturnity. His eyes lingered wistfully on his wife, envisioning six weeks of sleeping by the roadside, alone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . um . . . go speak to Tom and Arch tonight, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy go?\u201d Catching the gist of the conversation, Jem scrambled off his grandfather\u2019s knee and scampered over to Roger, grabbing him round the leg. \u201cGo with you, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d He caught sight of Bree\u2019s face, resigned, and then the green and red jar on the table behind her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said suddenly, and smiled at Jem. \u201cGreat-Auntie Jocasta would love to see you. And Mummy can blow things up to her heart\u2019s content without worrying where you are, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can do what?\u201d Jamie looked startled.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t explode,\u201d Brianna said, picking up the jar of phosphorus and cradling it possessively. \u201cIt just burns. Are you sure?\u201d This last was addressed to Roger, and accompanied by a searching look.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, affecting confidence. He glanced at Jemmy, who was chanting \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d, meanwhile hopping up and down like a demented popcorn kernel. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll have someone to talk to on the way.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>SAFE HANDS</p><p>IT WAS NEARLY DARK when Jamie came in to find me sitting at the kitchen table, head on my arms. I jerked upright at the sound of his footstep, blinking.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d He sat down on the opposite bench, eyeing me. \u201cYe look as though ye\u2019ve been dragged through a hedge backward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I patted vaguely at my hair, which did seem to be sticking out a bit. \u201cUm. Fine. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. Have ye eaten, yourself?\u201d</p><p>I squinted and rubbed my face, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I decided at last. \u201cI was waiting for you, but I seem to have fallen asleep. There\u2019s stew. Mrs. Bug left it.\u201d</p><p>He got up and peered into the small cauldron, then pushed the swinging hook back to bring it over the fire to warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye been doing, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, coming back. \u201cAnd how\u2019s the wee lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wee lass is what I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d I said, suppressing a yawn. \u201cMostly.\u201d I rose, slowly, feeling my joints protest, and staggered over to the sideboard to cut some bread.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t keep it down,\u201d I said. \u201cThe gallberry medicine. Not that I blame her,\u201d I added, cautiously licking my lower lip. After she\u2019d thrown it up the first time, I\u2019d tasted it myself. My tastebuds were still in a state of revolt; I\u2019d never met a more aptly named plant, and being boiled into syrup had merely concentrated the flavor.</p><p>Jamie sniffed deeply as I turned.</p><p>\u201cDid she vomit on ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was Bobby Higgins,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s got hookworms.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to hear about them whilst I\u2019m eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d I said, sitting down with the loaf, a knife, and a crock of soft butter. I tore off a piece, buttered it thickly, and gave it to him, then took one for myself. My tastebuds hesitated, but wavered on the edge of forgiving me for the gallberry syrup.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d I asked, beginning to wake up enough to take notice. He seemed tired, but more cheerful than he had been when he\u2019d left the house.</p><p>\u201cTalking to Roger Mac about Indians and Protestants.\u201d He frowned at the half-eaten chunk of bread in his hand. \u201cIs there something amiss wi\u2019 the bread, Sassenach? It tastes odd.\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand apologetically.</p><p>\u201cSorry, that\u2019s me. I washed several times, but I couldn\u2019t get it off completely. Perhaps you\u2019d better do the buttering.\u201d I pushed the loaf toward him with my elbow, gesturing at the crock.</p><p>\u201cCouldna get what off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we tried and tried with the syrup, but no good; Lizzie simply couldn\u2019t hold it down, poor thing. But I remembered that quinine can be absorbed through the skin. So I mixed the syrup into some goose grease, and rubbed it all over her. Oh, yes, thanks.\u201d I leaned forward and took a delicate bite of the buttered bit of bread he held out for me. My tastebuds gave in gracefully, and I realized that I hadn\u2019t eaten all day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd it worked?\u201d He glanced up at the ceiling. Mr. Wemyss and Lizzie shared the smaller room upstairs, but all was quiet above.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said, swallowing. \u201cThe fever finally broke, at least, and she\u2019s asleep. We\u2019ll keep using it; if the fever doesn\u2019t come back in two days, we\u2019ll know it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, and then there was Bobby and his hookworms. Fortunately, I have some ipecacuanha and turpentine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFortunately for the worms, or for Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither, really,\u201d I said, and yawned. \u201cIt will probably work, though.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly, and uncorked a bottle of beer, passing it automatically under his nose. Finding it all right, he poured some for me.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s a comfort to know I\u2019m leaving things in your capable hands, Sassenach. Ill-smelling,\u201d he added, wrinkling his long nose in my direction, \u201cbut capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much.\u201d The beer was better than good; must be one of Mrs. Bug\u2019s batches. We sipped companionably for a bit, both too tired to get up and serve the stew. I watched him beneath my lashes; I always did, when he was about to leave on a journey, storing up small memories of him against his return.</p> <p>He looked tired, and there were small twin lines between his heavy brows, betokening slight worry. The candlelight glowed on the broad bones of his face, though, and cast his shadow clear on the plastered wall behind him, strong and bold. I watched the shadow raise its spectral beer glass, the light making an amber glow in the shadow glass.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said suddenly, putting down the glass, \u201chow many times, would ye say, have I come close to dying?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, but then shrugged and began to reckon, mustering my synapses into reluctant activity.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I don\u2019t know what horrible things happened to you before I met you, but after . . . well, you were dreadfully ill at the abbey.\u201d I glanced covertly at him, but he seemed not to be bothered at the thought of Wentworth prison, and what had been done to him there that had caused the illness. \u201cHmm. And after Culloden\u2014you said you had a terrible fever then, from your wounds, and thought you might die, only Jenny forced you\u2014I mean, nursed you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Laoghaire shot me,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cAnd you forced me through it. Likewise, when the snake bit me.\u201d He considered for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI had the smallpox when I was a wean, but I think I wasna in danger of dying then; they said it was a light case. So only four times, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the day I first met you?\u201d I objected. \u201cYou nearly bled to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I did not,\u201d he protested. \u201cThat was no but a wee scratch.\u201d</p><p>I lifted one brow at him, and leaning over to the hearth, scooped a ladle of aromatic stew into a bowl. It was rich with the juices of rabbit and venison, swimming in a thick gravy spiced with rosemary, garlic, and onion. So far as my tastebuds were concerned, all was forgiven.</p><p>\u201cHave it your way,\u201d I said. \u201cBut wait\u2014what about your head? When Dougal tried to kill you with an ax. Surely that\u2019s five?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, accepting the bowl.</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, seeming displeased. \u201cFive, then.\u201d</p><p>I regarded him gently over my own bowl of stew. He was very large, solid, and beautifully formed. And if he was a bit battered by circumstance, that merely added to his charm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very hard person to kill, I think,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great comfort to me.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, reluctant, but then reached out and lifted his glass in salute, touching it first to his own lips, then to mine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drink to that, Sassenach, shall we?\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>PEOPLE OF THE</p><p>SNOWBIRD</p><p>GUNS,\u201d Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning said. \u201cTell your King we want guns.\u201d</p><p>Jamie suppressed the urge to reply, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d for a moment, but then gave in to it, surprising the war chief into a blink of startlement, followed by a grin.</p><p>\u201cWho, indeed?\u201d Bird was a short man, shaped like a barrel, and young for his office\u2014but shrewd, his affability no disguise to his intelligence. \u201cThey all tell you this, all the village war chiefs, eh? Of course they do. What do you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I can.\u201d Jamie lifted one shoulder, let it fall. \u201cTrade goods are certain, knives are likely\u2014guns are possible, but I cannot yet promise them.\u201d</p><p>They were speaking a slightly unfamiliar dialect of Cherokee, and he hoped he had got right the manner of indicating probability. He did well enough with the usual tongue in casual matters of trade and hunting, but the matters he dealt in here would not be casual. He glanced briefly at Ian, who was listening closely, but evidently what he\u2019d said was all right. Ian visited the villages near the Ridge frequently, and hunted with the young men; he shifted into the tongue of the Tsalagi as easily as he did into his native Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cSo, well enough.\u201d Bird settled himself more comfortably. The pewter badge Jamie had given him as a present glinted on his breast, firelight flickering over the broadly amiable planes of his face. \u201cTell your King about the guns\u2014and tell him why we need them, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish me to tell him that, do you? Do you think he will be willing to send you guns with which to kill his own people?\u201d Jamie asked dryly. The incursion of white settlers across the Treaty Line into the Cherokee lands was a sore point, and he risked something by alluding to it directly, rather than addressing Bird\u2019s other needs for guns: to defend his village from raiders\u2014or to go raiding himself.</p><p>Bird shrugged in reply.</p><p>\u201cWe can kill them without guns, if we want to.\u201d One eyebrow lifted a little, and Bird\u2019s lips pursed, waiting to see what Jamie made of this statement.</p><p>He supposed Bird meant to shock him. He merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. You are wise enough not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Bird\u2019s lips relaxed into a charming smile. \u201cYou tell the King\u2014not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Majesty will be pleased to hear that you value his friendship so much.\u201d</p><p>Bird burst into laughter at that, rocking back and forth, and his brother Still Water, who sat beside him, grinned broadly.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Bear-Killer,\u201d he said, recovering. \u201cYou\u2019re a funny man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be,\u201d Jamie said in English, smiling. \u201cGive it time.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave a small snort of amusement at that, causing Bird to look sharply at him, then away, clearing his throat. Jamie raised one brow at his nephew, who replied with a bland smile.</p><p>Still Water was watching Ian narrowly. The Cherokee welcomed them both with respect, but Jamie had noticed at once a particular edge in their response to Ian. They perceived Ian to be Mohawk\u2014and he made them wary. In all honesty, he himself sometimes thought there was some part of Ian that had not come back from Snaketown, and perhaps never would.</p><p>Bird had given him an avenue to inquire about something, though.</p><p>\u201cYou have been much troubled by persons who come into your lands to settle,\u201d he said, nodding sympathetically. \u201cYou of course do not kill these persons, being wise. But not everyone is wise, are they?\u201d</p><p>Bird\u2019s eyes narrowed briefly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Bear-Killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear of burning, Tsisqua.\u201d He held the other man\u2019s eyes with his own, careful to give no hint of accusation. \u201cThe King hears of houses burning, men killed and women taken. This does not please him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmp,\u201d Bird said, and pressed his lips together. He did not, however, say he had not heard of such things himself, which was interesting.</p><p>\u201cEnough of such stories, and the King may send soldiers to protect his people. If he should do that, he will hardly wish to have them face guns that he himself has given,\u201d Jamie pointed out logically.</p><p>\u201cAnd what should we do, then?\u201d Still Water broke in hotly. \u201cThey come across the Treaty Line, build houses, plant fields, and take the game. If your King cannot keep his people where they belong, how can he protest if we defend our lands?\u201d</p><p>Bird made a small flattening gesture with one hand, not looking at his brother, and Still Water subsided, though with bad grace.</p><p>\u201cSo, Bear-Killer. You will tell the King these things, will you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie inclined his head gravely.</p><p>\u201cThat is my office. I speak of the King to you, and I will take your words to the King.\u201d</p><p>Bird nodded thoughtfully, then waved a hand for food and beer, and the talk changed firmly to neutral matters. No more business would be done tonight.</p><p>IT WAS LATE when they left Tsisqua\u2019s house for the small guesthouse. He thought it was well past moonrise, but there was no moon to be seen; the sky glowed thick with cloud, and the scent of rain was live on the wind.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Ian said, yawning and stumbling. \u201cMy bum\u2019s gone asleep.\u201d</p><p>Jamie yawned, too, finding it contagious, but then blinked and laughed. \u201cAye, well. Dinna bother waking it up; the rest of ye can join it.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a derisive noise with his lips.</p><p>\u201cJust because Bird says ye\u2019re a funny man, Uncle Jamie, I wouldna go believing it. He\u2019s only being polite, ken?\u201d</p><p>Jamie ignored this, murmuring thanks in Tsalagi to the young woman who had shown them the way to their quarters. She handed him a small basket\u2014filled with corn bread and dried apples, from the smell\u2014then wished them a soft \u201cGood night, sleep well,\u201d before vanishing into the damp, restless night.</p><p>The small hut seemed stuffy after the cool freshness of the air, and he stood in the doorway for a moment, enjoying the movement of the wind through the trees, watching it snake through the pine boughs like a huge, invisible serpent. A spatter of moisture bloomed on his face, and he experienced the deep pleasure of a man who realizes that it\u2019s going to rain and he isn\u2019t going to have to spend the night out in it.</p><p>\u201cAsk about, Ian, when ye\u2019re gossiping tomorrow,\u201d he said, ducking inside. \u201cLet it be known\u2014tactfully\u2014that the King would be pleased to know exactly who in hell\u2019s been burning cabins\u2014and might be pleased enough to cough up a few guns in reward. They\u2019ll not tell ye if it\u2019s them that\u2019s been doing it\u2014but if it\u2019s another band, they might.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, yawning again. A small fire burned in a stone ring, the smoke of it wisping up toward a smoke hole in the roof overhead, and by its light, a fur-piled sleeping platform was visible across one side of the hut, with another stack of furs and blankets on the floor.</p><p>\u201cToss ye for the bed, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said, digging in the pouch at his waist and coming out with a battered shilling. \u201cCall it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTails,\u201d Jamie said, setting down the basket and unbelting his plaid. It fell in a warm puddle of fabric round his legs and he shook out his shirt. The linen was creased and grimy against his skin, and he could smell himself; thank God this was the last of the villages. One more night, perhaps, two at the most, and they could go home.</p><p>Ian swore, picking up the coin.</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019ye do that? Every night ye\u2019ve said \u2018tails,\u2019 and every night, tails it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s your shilling, Ian. Dinna blame me.\u201d He sat down on the bed platform and stretched himself pleasurably, then relented. \u201cLook at Geordie\u2019s nose.\u201d</p><p>Ian flipped the shilling over in his fingers and held it to the light of the fire, squinting, then swore again. A tiny splotch of beeswax, so thin as to be invisible unless you were looking, ornamented the aristocratically prominent nose of George III, Rex Britannia.</p><p>\u201cHow did that get there?\u201d Ian narrowed his eyes suspiciously at his uncle, but Jamie merely laughed and lay down.</p><p>\u201cWhen ye were showing wee Jem how to spin a coin. Remember, he knocked the candlestick over; hot wax went everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ian sat looking at the coin in his hand for a moment, then shook his head, scraped the wax away with a thumbnail, and put the shilling away.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said, sliding into the furs on the ground with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been ignoring his tiredness, holding it like Gideon, on a short rein. Now he dropped the reins and gave it leave to carry him off, his body relaxing into the comfort of the bed.</p><p>MacDonald, he reflected cynically, would be delighted. Jamie had planned on visits only to the two Cherokee villages closest to the Treaty Line, there to announce his new position, distribute modest gifts of whisky and tobacco\u2014this last hastily borrowed from Tom Christie, who had fortunately purchased a hogshead of the weed on a seed-buying trip to Cross Creek\u2014and inform the Cherokee that further largesse might be expected when he undertook ambassage to the more distant villages in the autumn.</p><p>He had been most cordially received in both villages\u2014but in the second, Pigtown, several strangers had been visiting; young men in search of wives. They were from a separate band of Cherokee, called the Snowbird band, whose large village lay higher in the mountains.</p><p>One of the young men had been the nephew of Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, headman of the Snowbird band, and had been exigent in pressing Jamie to return with him and his companions to their home village. Taking a hasty private inventory of his remaining whisky and tobacco, Jamie had agreed, and he and Ian had been most royally received there, as agents of His Majesty. The Snowbird had never been visited by an Indian agent before, and appeared most sensible of the honor\u2014and prompt about seeing what advantages might accrue to themselves in consequence.</p><p>He thought Bird was the sort of man with whom he could do business, though\u2014on various fronts.</p><p>That thought led him to belated recollection of Roger Mac and the new tenants. He\u2019d had no time over the last few days to spare much worry there\u2014but he doubted there was any cause for concern. Roger Mac was capable enough, though his shattered voice made him less certain than he should be. With Christie and Arch Bug, though. . .</p><p>He closed his eyes, the bliss of absolute fatigue stealing over him as his thoughts grew more disjointed.</p><p>A day more, maybe, then home in time to make the hay. Another malting, two maybe, before the cold weather. Slaughtering . . . could it be time at last to kill the damned white sow? No . . . the vicious creature was unbelievably fecund. What kind of boar had the balls to mate with her? he wondered dimly, and did she eat him, after? Wild boar . . . smoked hams, blood pudding . . .</p><p>He was just drifting down through the first layers of sleep when he felt a hand on his privates. Jerked out of drowsiness like a salmon out of a sea-loch, he clapped a hand to the intruder\u2019s, gripping tight. And elicited a faint giggle from his visitor.</p><p>Feminine fingers wiggled gently in his grasp, and the hand\u2019s fellow promptly took up operations in its stead. His first coherent thought was that the lassie would be an excellent baker, so good as she was at kneading.</p><p>Other thoughts followed rapidly on the heels of this absurdity, and he tried to grab the second hand. It playfully eluded him in the dark, poking and tweaking.</p><p>He groped for a polite protest in Cherokee, but came up with nothing but a handful of random phrases in English and Gaelic, none of them faintly suitable to the occasion.</p><p>The first hand was purposefully wriggling out of his grasp, eel-like. Reluctant to crush her fingers, he let go for an instant, and made a successful grab for her wrist.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d he hissed, in desperation. \u201cIan, are ye there?\u201d He couldn\u2019t see his nephew in the pool of darkness that filled the cabin, nor tell if he slept. There were no windows, and only the faintest light came from the dying coals.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>There was a stirring on the floor, bodies shifting, and he heard Rollo sneeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Uncle?\u201d He\u2019d spoken in Gaelic, and Ian answered in the same language. The lad sounded calm, and not as though he\u2019d just come awake.</p><p>\u201cIan, there is a woman in my bed,\u201d he said in Gaelic, trying to match his nephew\u2019s calm tone.</p><p>\u201cThere are two of them, Uncle Jamie.\u201d Ian sounded amused, damn him! \u201cThe other will be down by your feet. Waiting her turn.\u201d</p><p>That unnerved him, and he nearly lost his grip on the captive hand.</p><p>\u201cTwo of them! What do they think I am?\u201d</p><p>The girl giggled again, leaned over, and bit him lightly on the chest.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, Uncle, they don\u2019t think you\u2019re Him,\u201d Ian said, obviously suppressing his own mirth. \u201cThey think you\u2019re the King. So to speak. You\u2019re his agent, so they\u2019re doing honor to His Majesty by sending you his women, aye?\u201d</p><p>The second woman had uncovered his feet and was slowly stroking his soles with one finger. He was ticklish and would have found this bothersome, were he not so distracted by the first woman, with whom he was being compelled into a most undignified game of hide-the-sausage.</p><p>\u201cTalk to them, Ian,\u201d he said between clenched teeth, fumbling madly with his free hand, meanwhile forcing back the questing fingers of the captive hand\u2014which were languidly stroking his ear\u2014and wiggling his feet in a frantic effort to discourage the second lady\u2019s attentions, which were growing bolder.</p><p>\u201cErm . . . what d\u2019ye want me to say?\u201d Ian inquired, switching back to English. His voice quivered slightly.</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019m deeply sensible of the honor, but\u2014gk!\u201d Further diplomatic evasions were cut off by the sudden intrusion of someone\u2019s tongue into his mouth, tasting strongly of onions and beer.</p><p>In the midst of his subsequent struggles, he was dimly aware that Ian had lost any sense of self-control and was lying on the floor giggling helplessly. It was filicide if you killed a son, he thought grimly; what was the word for assassinating a nephew?</p><p>\u201cMadam!\u201d he said, disengaging his mouth with difficulty. He seized the lady by the shoulders and rolled her off his body with enough force that she whooped with surprise, bare legs flying\u2014Jesus, was she nak*d?</p><p>She was. Both of them were; his eyes adapted to the faint glow of the embers, he caught the shimmer of light from shoulders, br**sts, and rounded thighs.</p><p>He sat up, gathering furs and blankets round him in a sort of hasty redoubt.</p><p>\u201cCease, the two of you!\u201d he said severely in Cherokee. \u201cYou are beautiful, but I cannot lie with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d said one, sounding puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the other.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . because there is an oath upon me,\u201d he said, necessity producing inspiration. \u201cI have sworn . . . sworn . . .\u201d He groped for the proper word, but didn\u2019t find it. Luckily, Ian leaped in at this point, with a stream of fluent Tsalagi, too fast to follow.</p><p>\u201cOoo,\u201d breathed one girl, impressed. Jamie felt a distinct qualm.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name did ye tell them, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them the Great Spirit came to ye in a dream, Uncle, and told ye that ye mustn\u2019t go with a woman until ye\u2019d brought guns to all the Tsalagi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I what?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was the best I could think of in a hurry, Uncle,\u201d Ian said defensively.</p><p>Hair-raising as the notion was, he had to admit it was effective; the two women were huddled together, whispering in awed tones, and had quite left off pestering him.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cI suppose it could be worse.\u201d After all, even if the Crown were persuaded to provide guns, there were a damn lot of Tsalagi.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re welcome, Uncle Jamie.\u201d The laughter was gurgling just below the surface of his nephew\u2019s voice, and emerged in a stifled snort.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said testily.</p><p>\u201cThe one lady is saying it\u2019s a disappointment to her, Uncle, because you\u2019re verra nicely equipped. The other is more philosophical about it, though. She says they might have borne ye children, and the bairns might have red hair.\u201d His nephew\u2019s voice quivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong wi\u2019 red hair, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, quite, but I gather it\u2019s not something ye want your bairn to be marked with, and ye can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNo danger of it, is there? Can they not go home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian pointed out logically. It was; the wind had brought a patter of rain, and now the main shower arrived, beating on the roof with a steady thrum, drops hissing into the hot embers through the smoke hole. \u201cYe wouldna send them out in the wet, would ye? Besides, ye just said ye couldna lie wi\u2019 them, not that ye meant them to go.\u201d</p><p>He broke off to say something interrogative to the ladies, who replied with eager confidence. Jamie thought they\u2019d said\u2014they had. Rising with the grace of young cranes, the two of them clambered nak*d as jaybirds back into his bed, patting and stroking him with murmurs of admiration\u2014though sedulously avoiding his private parts\u2014pressed him down into the furs, and snuggled down on either side of him, warm bare flesh pressed cozily against him.</p><p>He opened his mouth, then shut it again, finding absolutely nothing to say in any of the languages he knew.</p><p>He lay on his back, rigid and breathing shallowly. His c*ck throbbed indignantly, clearly meaning to stay up and torment him all night in revenge for its abuse. Small chortling noises came from the pile of furs on the ground, interspersed with hiccuping snorts. He thought it was maybe the first time he\u2019d heard Ian truly laugh since his return.</p><p>Praying for fortitude, he drew a long, slow breath, and closed his eyes, hands folded firmly across his ribs, elbows pressed to his sides.</p><p>15</p><p>STAKIT TO DROON</p><p>ROGER WALKED OUT ONTO the terrace at River Run, feeling pleasantly exhausted. After three weeks of strenuous work, he\u2019d gathered the new tenants from the highways and byways of Cross Creek and Campbelton, become acquainted with all the heads of households, managed to equip them at least minimally for the journey, in terms of food, blankets, and shoes\u2014and got them all collected in one place, firmly overcoming their tendency to panic and stray. They\u2019d start in the morning for Fraser\u2019s Ridge, and not a moment too soon.</p><p>He looked out over the terrace in satisfaction, toward the meadow that lay beyond Jocasta Cameron Innes\u2019s stables. They were all bedded down in a temporary camp there: twenty-two families, with seventy-six individual souls, four mules, two ponies, fourteen dogs, three pigs, and God only knew how many chickens, kittens, and pet birds, bundled into wicker cages for carrying. He had all the names on a list\u2014animals excluded\u2014dog-eared and crumpled in his pocket. He had several other lists there, as well, scribbled over, crossed out, and amended to the point of illegibility. He felt like a walking Book of Deuteronomy. He also felt like a very large drink.</p><p>This was luckily forthcoming; Duncan Innes, Jocasta\u2019s husband, had returned from his own day\u2019s labor and was sitting on the terrace, in company with a cut-glass decanter, from which the rays of the sinking sun struck a mellow amber glow.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then, a charaid?\u201d Duncan greeted him genially, gesturing toward one of the basketwork chairs. \u201cYe\u2019ll take a dram, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>He sank gratefully into the chair, which creaked amiably beneath his weight. He accepted the glass Duncan handed him, and tossed it back with a brief \u201cSl\u00e0inte.\u201d</p><p>The whisky burned through the strictures that bound his throat, making him cough, but seeming suddenly to open things, so that the constant faint sense of choking began to leave him. He sipped, grateful.</p><p>\u201cReady to go, are they?\u201d Duncan nodded toward the meadow, where the smoke of campfires hung in a low golden haze.</p><p>\u201cReady as they\u2019ll ever be. Poor things,\u201d Roger added with some sympathy.</p><p>Duncan raised one shaggy brow.</p><p>\u201cFish out of water,\u201d Roger amplified, holding out his glass to accept the proffered refill. \u201cThe women are terrified, and so are the men, but they hide it better. Ye\u2019d think I was taking them all to be slaves on a sugar plantation.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cOr sell them to Rome to clean the Pope\u2019s shoon,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cI misdoubt most of them had ever smelt a Catholic before embarking. And from the wrinkled noses, they dinna care so much for the scent now, I think. Do they so much as tak\u2019 a dram now and then, d\u2019ye ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly medicinally, and only if in actual danger of death, I think.\u201d Roger took a slow, ambrosial swallow and closed his eyes, feeling the whisky warm his throat and curl in his chest like a purring cat. \u201cMeet Hiram yet, did you? Hiram Crombie, the head man of this lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wee sour-drap wi\u2019 the stick up his arse? Aye, I met him.\u201d Duncan grinned, his drooping mustache lifting at the end. \u201cHe\u2019ll be at supper with us. Best have another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thanks,\u201d said Roger, extending his glass. \u201cThough they\u2019re none of them much for hedonistic pleasure, so far as I can tell. Ye\u2019d think they were all still Covenanters to the bone. The Frozen Chosen, aye?\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed immoderately at that.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no like it was in my grandsire\u2019s day,\u201d he said, recovering and reaching across for the decanter. \u201cAnd thank the Lord for that.\u201d He rolled his eyes, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cYour grandsire was a Covenanter, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Shaking his head, Duncan poured a goodly measure, first for Roger, then himself. \u201cA fierce auld bastard, he was. Not that he\u2019d no cause, mind. His sister was stakit to droon, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas\u2014Christ.\u201d He bit his tongue in penance, but was too interested to pay it much mind. \u201cYe mean\u2014executed by drowning?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, eyes on his glass, then took a good gulp and held it for a moment in his mouth before swallowing.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d he said. \u201cHer name was Margaret. Eighteen she was, at the time. Her father and her brother\u2014my grandfather, aye?\u2014they\u2019d fled, after the battle at Dunbar; hid in the hills. The troops came a-hunting them, but she wouldna say where they\u2019d gone\u2014and she had a Bible by her. They tried to make her recant then, but she wouldna do that, either\u2014the women on that side o\u2019 the family, ye might as well talk to a stone,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no moving them. But they dragged her doon to the shore, her and an auld Covenanter woman from the village, stripped them, and tied them both to stakes at the tide line. Waited there, the crowd o\u2019 them, for the water to come in.\u201d</p><p>He took another swallow, not waiting for the taste of it.</p><p>\u201cThe auld woman went under first; they\u2019d tied her closer to the water\u2014I suppose thinking Margaret would give in, if she saw the auld woman die.\u201d He grunted, shaking his head. \u201cBut nay, not a bit of it. The tide rose, and the waves came up ower her. She choked, and she coughed, and her hair loose, hanging over her face, plastered doon like kelp, when the water went out.</p><p>\u201cMy mither saw it,\u201d he explained, lifting his glass. \u201cShe was but seven at the time, but she never forgot. After the first wave, she said, there was the space of three breaths, and the wave came ower Margaret again. And then out . . . three breaths . . . and in again once more. And ye couldna see anything then but the swirl of her hair, floating on the tide.\u201d</p><p>He raised his glass an inch higher, and Roger lifted his own in involuntary toast. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said, and it was no blasphemy.</p><p>The whisky burned his throat as it went down and he breathed deep, giving thanks to God for the gift of air. Three breaths. It was the single malt of Islay, and the iodine taste of sea and kelp was strong and smoky in his lungs.</p><p>\u201cMay God give her peace,\u201d he said, his voice rasping.</p><p>Duncan nodded, and reached again for the decanter.</p><p>\u201cI would suppose she earned it,\u201d he said. \u201cThough they\u201d\u2014he pointed with his chin toward the meadow\u2014\u201cthey\u2019d say \u2019twas none of her doing at all; God chose her for salvation and chose the English to be damned; nay more to be said on the matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The light was fading and the campfires began to glow in the dimness of the meadow beyond the stables. The smoke of them reached Roger\u2019s nose, the scent warm and homelike, but nonetheless adding to the burn in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no found sae much worth dyin\u2019 for, myself,\u201d Duncan said reflectively, then gave one of his quick, rare smiles. \u201cBut my grandsire, he\u2019d say it only meant I was chosen to be damned. \u2018By the decree of God, for His everlasting glory, some men and angels are predestined unto everlasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.\u2019 He\u2019d say that, whenever anyone spoke of Margaret.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, recognizing the statement from the Westminster Confession. When was that\u20141646? 1647? A generation\u2014or two\u2014before Duncan\u2019s grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI expect it was easier for him to think her death was God\u2019s will, and nothing to do with him,\u201d Roger said, not without sympathy. \u201cYe\u2019ll not believe it yourself, then? Predestination, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>He asked with true curiosity. The Presbyterians of his own time did still espouse predestination as a doctrine\u2014but, a bit more flexible in attitude, tended to soft-pedal the notion of predestined damnation, and not to think too much on the idea that every detail of life was so predestined. Himself? God knew.</p><p>Duncan lifted his shoulders, the right rising higher and making him seem momentarily twisted. \u201cGod knows,\u201d he said, and laughed. He shook his head, and drained his glass again.</p><p>\u201cNay, I think I don\u2019t. But I wouldna say as much before Hiram Crombie\u2014nor yet yon Christie.\u201d Duncan lifted his chin toward the meadow, where he could see two dark figures, walking side by side toward the house. Arch Bug\u2019s tall, stooped frame was easy to recognize, as was Tom Christie\u2019s shorter, blocky build. He looked pugnacious even in silhouette, Roger thought, making short, sharp gestures as he walked, clearly arguing something with Arch.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019d be wicked fights ower it sometimes, in Ardsmuir,\u201d Duncan said, watching the progress of the two figures. \u201cThe Catholics took it amiss, to be told they were damned. And Christie and his wee band took the greatest pleasure in telling them so.\u201d His shoulders shook a little in suppressed laughter, and Roger wondered just how much whisky Duncan had had before he came out to the terrace. He\u2019d never seen the older man so jovial.</p><p>\u201cMac Dubh put a stop to it, finally, when he made us all be Freemasons,\u201d he added, leaning forward to pour a fresh glass. \u201cBut a few men were nearly killed, before that.\u201d He lifted the decanter inquiringly in Roger\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Looking forward to a supper including both Tom Christie and Hiram Crombie, Roger accepted.</p><p>As Duncan leaned toward him to pour, still smiling, the last of the sun shone across his weathered face. Roger caught a glimpse of a faint white line through Duncan\u2019s upper lip, half-visible beneath the hair, and realized quite suddenly why Duncan wore a long mustache\u2014an unusual adornment, in a time when most men were clean-shaven.</p><p>He would not have spoken, likely, save for the whisky and the mood of strange alliance between them\u2014two Protestants, amazingly bound to Catholics and bemused at the strange tides of fate that had washed over them; two men left quite alone by the misfortunes of life, and now surprised to find themselves the heads of households, holding the lives of strangers in their hands.</p><p>\u201cYour lip, Duncan.\u201d He touched his own mouth briefly. \u201cWhat did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, that?\u201d Duncan touched his own lip, surprised. \u201cNay, I was born wi\u2019 a harelip, or so they said. I dinna recall it, myself; it was mended when I was nay more than a week old.\u201d</p><p>It was Roger\u2019s turn to be surprised.</p> <p>\u201cWho mended it?\u201d</p><p>Duncan shrugged, one-shouldered this time.</p><p>\u201cA traveling healer, my mither said. She\u2019d quite resigned herself to losin\u2019 me, she said, because I couldna suck, of course. She and my aunties all took it in turn to drap milk into my mouth from a rag, but she said I\u2019d wasted nearly to a wee skeleton, when this charmer came by the village.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle self-consciously over his lip, smoothing the thick, grizzled hairs of his mustache.</p><p>\u201cMy faither gave him six herrings and a mull o\u2019 snuff, and he stitched it up, and gave my mither a bit o\u2019 some ointment to put on the wound. Well, and so . . .\u201d He shrugged again, with a lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was destined to live, after all. My grandsire said the Lord had chosen me\u2014though God only kens what for.\u201d</p><p>Roger was conscious of a faint ripple of unease, dulled though it was by whisky.</p><p>A Highland charmer who could repair a harelip? He took another drink, trying not to stare, but covertly examining Duncan\u2019s face. He supposed it was possible; the scar was just barely visible\u2014if you knew to look\u2014under Duncan\u2019s mustache, but didn\u2019t extend up into the nostril. It must have been a fairly simple harelip, then, not one of the hideous cases like that one he\u2019d read about\u2014unable to look away from the page for horror\u2014in Claire\u2019s big black doctor\u2019s book, where Dr. Rawlings had described a child born not only with a split lip, but missing the roof of its mouth, and most of the center of its face, as well.</p> <p>There had been no drawing, thank God, but the visual picture conjured up by Rawlings\u2019s spare description had been bad enough. He closed his eyes and breathed deep, inhaling the whisky\u2019s perfume through his pores.</p><p>Was it possible? Perhaps. People did do surgery now, bloodstained, crude, and agonizing as it was. He\u2019d seen Murray MacLeod, the apothecary from Campbelton, expertly stitch up a man\u2019s cheek, laid open when the man was trampled by a sheep. Would it be any more difficult to stitch a child\u2019s mouth?</p><p>He thought of Jemmy\u2019s lip, tender as a blossom, pierced by needle and black thread, and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cAre ye cold, then, a charaid? Shall we go in?\u201d Duncan got his feet under him, as though to rise, but Roger waved the older man back.</p><p>\u201cAh, no. Goose walking on my grave.\u201d He smiled, and accepted another drop to keep the nonexistent evening chill away. And yet he felt the hairs on his arms rise, just a little. Could there be another one\u2014more\u2014like us?</p><p>There had been, he knew. His own multiple-times great-grandmother, Geillis, for one. The man whose skull Claire had found, complete with silver fillings in its teeth, for another. But had Duncan met another, in some remote Highland village half a century before?</p><p>Christ, he thought, freshly unnerved. How often does it happen? And what happens to them?</p><p>Before they had quite reached the bottom of the decanter, he heard footsteps behind him, and the rustle of silk.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cameron.\u201d He rose at once, the world tilting just a little, and took his hostess\u2019s hand, bowing over it.</p><p>Her long hand touched his face, as was her habit, her sensitive fingertips confirming his identity.</p><p>\u201cOch, there ye are, Jo. Had a good journey wi\u2019 the wee lad, did ye?\u201d Duncan struggled to rise, handicapped by whisky and his single arm, but Ulysses, Jocasta\u2019s butler, had materialized silently out of the twilight behind his mistress in time to move her wicker chair into place. She sank into it without so much as putting a hand out to see that it was there, Roger noticed; she simply knew it would be.</p><p>Roger viewed the butler with interest, wondering who Jocasta had bribed to get him back. Accused\u2014and very likely guilty of\u2014the death of a British naval officer on Jocasta\u2019s property, Ulysses had been forced to flee the colony. But Lieutenant Wolff had not been considered a great loss to the navy\u2014and Ulysses was indispensable to Jocasta Cameron. All things might not be possible with gold\u2014but he was willing to bet that Jocasta Cameron hadn\u2019t yet met a circumstance she couldn\u2019t mend with money, political connections, or guile.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d she replied to her husband, smiling and putting out a hand to him. \u201c\u2019Twas such fun to show him off, husband! We\u2019d a wonderful luncheon with old Mrs. Forbes and her daughter, and the wee bairn sang a song and charmed them all. Mrs. Forbes had the Montgomery lasses in, as well, and Miss Ogilvie, and we had wee lamb cutlets wi\u2019 raspberry sauce and fried apples and\u2014oh, is that you, Mr. Christie? Do come and join us!\u201d She raised her voice a little, and her face, appearing to look expectantly into the gloom over Roger\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cameron. Your servant, madam.\u201d Christie stepped up onto the terrace, making a courtly bow that was no less punctilious for the fact that its recipient was blind. Arch Bug followed him, bowing in turn over Jocasta\u2019s hand, and making a genial noise in his throat by way of greeting.</p><p>Chairs were brought out, more whisky, a plate of savories appeared as by magic, candles were lit\u2014and suddenly it was a party, echoing on a higher plane the sense of slightly nervous festivity taking place in the meadow below. There was music in the distance; the sound of a tin whistle, playing a jig.</p><p>Roger let it all wash over him, enjoying the brief sense of relaxation and irresponsibility. Just for tonight, there was no need to worry; everyone was gathered, safe, fed, and prepared for the morrow\u2019s journey.</p><p>He needn\u2019t even trouble to keep up his end of the conversation; Tom Christie and Jocasta were enthusiastically discussing the literary scene in Edinburgh and a book he\u2019d never heard of, with Duncan, looking so mellow that he might slide out of his chair any minute, putting in the occasional remark, and old Arch\u2014where was Arch? Oh, there; gone back toward the meadow, having doubtless thought of some last minute thing he must tell someone.</p><p>He blessed Jamie Fraser for his forethought in sending Arch and Tom with him. Between the two of them, they\u2019d saved him from any number of blunders, managed the ten thousand necessary details, and eased the fears of the new tenants regarding this latest leap into the unknown.</p><p>He took a deep, contented breath of air scented with the homely smells of campfires in the distance and roasting dinner near at hand\u2014and belatedly recalled the one small detail whose welfare was still his exclusive concern.</p><p>Excusing himself, he made his way into the house, and discovered Jem down below in the main kitchen, cozily ensconced in the corner of a settle, eating bread pudding with melted butter and maple syrup on it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never your dinner, is it?\u201d he asked, sitting down beside his son.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Want some, Daddy?\u201d Jem extended a dripping spoon upward toward him, and he bent hastily to take the offered mouthful before it fell off. It was delicious, bursting-sweet and creamy on the tongue.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, swallowing. \u201cWell, let\u2019s not tell Mummy or Grannie, shall we? They\u2019ve this odd prejudice toward meat and vegetables.\u201d</p><p>Jem nodded, agreeable, and offered him another spoonful. They consumed the bowl together in a companionable silence, after which Jem crawled into his lap, and leaning a sticky face against his chest, fell sound asleep.</p><p>Servants bustled to and fro around them, smiling kindly now and then. He should, he thought vaguely, get up. Dinner would be being served in a moment\u2014he saw the platters of roasted duck and mutton being skillfully laid out, bowls mounded with heaps of fluffy, steaming rice soaked with gravy, and a huge sallet of greens being tossed with vinegar.</p><p>Filled with whisky, bread pudding, and contentment, though, he lingered, putting off from moment to moment the necessity of parting from Jem and ending the sweet peace of holding his sleeping son.</p><p>\u201cMister Roger? I take him, shall I?\u201d said a soft voice. He looked up from an examination of Jem\u2019s hair, which had bits of bread pudding stuck in it, to see Phaedre, Jocasta\u2019s body servant, stooping before him, hands held out to receive the boy.</p><p>\u201cI wash him, put him to his bed, sir,\u201d she said, her oval face as soft as her voice as she looked at Jem.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, sure. Thanks.\u201d Roger sat up, Jem in his arms, and rose carefully, holding Jem\u2019s considerable weight. \u201cHere\u2014I\u2019ll carry him up for you.\u201d</p><p>He followed the slave up the narrow stairs from the kitchen, admiring\u2014in a purely abstract and aesthetic sort of way\u2014the grace of her carriage. How old was she? he wondered. Twenty, twenty-two? Would Jocasta allow her to marry? She must have admirers, surely. But he knew how valuable she was to Jocasta, too\u2014seldom out of her mistress\u2019s presence. Not easy to reconcile that with a home and family of her own.</p><p>At the top of the stair, she stopped and turned to take Jem from him; he surrendered his limp burden with reluctance, but also with some relief. It was stifling-hot down below, and his shirt was damp with sweat where Jem had pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cMister Roger?\u201d Phaedre\u2019s voice stopped him, as he was about to take his leave. She was looking at him over Jem\u2019s shoulder, eyes hesitant beneath the white curve of her head scarf.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>The thump of feet coming up the stairs made him move, narrowly avoiding Oscar, charging upstairs with an empty platter under his arm, evidently bound for the summer kitchen, where the fish were being fried. Oscar grinned at Roger as he passed, and blew a kiss toward Phaedre, whose lips tightened at the gesture.</p><p>She made a slight motion with her head, and Roger followed her down the hall, away from the bustle of the kitchen. She stopped near the door that led out to the stables, glancing round to be sure they were not overheard.</p><p>\u201cI maybe shouldn\u2019t say nothin\u2019, sir\u2014may be as it is nothin\u2019. But I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I should tell you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, shoving back the damp hair at his temple. The door stood open, and there was a little breeze here, thank God.</p><p>\u201cWe was in the town, sir, this morning, at Mr. Benjamin\u2019s warehouse, you know the one? Down by the river.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, and she licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cMaster Jem, he got restless and went to pokin\u2019 round, whilst the mistress talked with Mr. Benjamin. I followed him, seein\u2019 as he falls into no trouble, and so I was right there when the man come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? Which man was this?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, dark eyes serious.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, sir. Was a big man, tall as you. Light-haired; he wasn\u2019t wearin\u2019 no wig. Was a gentleman, though.\u201d By which, he assumed, she meant the man was well-dressed.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks round, sees Mr. Benjamin a-talkin\u2019 with Miss Jo, and he takes a step to the side, like as he don\u2019t want no one takin\u2019 notice he there. But then he sees Mr. Jem, and he get a sharp kind of look on his face.\u201d</p><p>She pulled Jem a little closer, recalling.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t likin\u2019 that look, sir, tell you truly. I see him start toward Jemmy and I go quick and pick the lad up, same as I got him now. The man look surprised, then like he think something\u2019s funny; he smile at Jem and ax him who his daddy be?\u201d</p><p>She gave a quick smile, patting Jem\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cFolk ax him that all the time, sir, downtown, and he speak right up, say his daddy Roger MacKenzie, same as he always do. This man, he laugh and ruffle Jem\u2019s hair\u2014they all do that, sir, he gots such pretty hair. Then he say, \u2018Is he, then, my wee maneen, is he indeed?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Phaedre was a natural mimic. She caught the Irish lilt of it perfectly, and the sweat turned cold on Roger\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Unconsciously, he glanced over her shoulder through the open door, searching the night outside for danger.</p><p>Phaedre hunched her shoulders, shivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t do nothin\u2019, sir. But he look at Jem real close, and then at me, and he smile, right in my eyes. I ain\u2019t likin\u2019 that smile, sir, not one bit.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut then I hear Mr. Benjamin lift his voice behind me, callin\u2019 out to say does the gentleman want him? And the man turn quick-like on his heel, and be gone out the door, just like that.\u201d She clutched Jem with one arm, and snapped the fingers of her free hand briefly.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The bread pudding had formed a solid mass that lay like iron in his stomach. \u201cDid you say anything to your mistress about this man?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, solemn.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. He ain\u2019t really done nothin\u2019, like I say. But he trouble me, sir, and so I study on it, comin\u2019 home, and think finally, well, I best tell you, sir, and I gets the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe did right,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you, Phaedre.\u201d He fought the urge to take Jem from her, hold him tight. \u201cWould ye\u2014when ye\u2019ve got him to bed, will ye stay with him? Just until I come up. I\u2019ll tell your mistress I asked you to.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes met his with perfect understanding, and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir. I keep him safe.\u201d She bobbed the shadow of a curtsy, and went up the stairs toward the room he shared with Jem, humming something soft and rhythmic to the boy.</p><p>He breathed slowly, trying to master the overwhelming urge to seize a horse from the stables, ride to Cross Creek, and search the place, going from house to house in the dark until he found Stephen Bonnet.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d His fists curled up involuntarily, knowing quite well what to do, even as his mind acknowledged the futility of such a course.</p><p>He fought down rage and helplessness, the last of the whisky lighting his blood, throbbing in his temples. He stepped abruptly through the open door into the night, for it was full dark now. From this side of the house, the meadow was invisible, but he could still smell the smoke of their fires, and catch the faint trill of music on the air.</p><p>He\u2019d known Bonnet would come again, one day. Down beside the lawn, the white bulk of Hector Cameron\u2019s mausoleum was a pale smear on the night. And safe inside it, hidden in the coffin that waited for Hector\u2019s wife, Jocasta, lay a fortune in Jacobite gold, the long-held secret of River Run.</p><p>Bonnet knew the gold existed, suspected it was on the plantation. He had tried for it once before, and failed. He was not a careful man, Bonnet\u2014but he was persistent.</p><p>Roger felt his bones strain in his flesh, urgent with desire to hunt and kill the man who had raped his wife, threatened his family. But there were seventy-six people depending on him\u2014no, seventy-seven. Vengeance warred with responsibility\u2014and, most reluctantly, gave way.</p><p>He breathed slow and deep, feeling the knot of the rope scar tighten in his throat. No. He had to go, see the new tenants safe. The thought of sending them with Arch and Tom, while he remained behind to search for Bonnet, was tempting\u2014but the job was his; he couldn\u2019t abandon it for the sake of a time-consuming\u2014and likely futile\u2014personal quest.</p><p>Nor could he leave Jem unprotected.</p><p>He must tell Duncan, though; Duncan could be trusted to take steps for the protection of River Run, to send word to the authorities in Cross Creek, to make inquiries.</p><p>And Roger would make sure that Jem was safe away, too, come morning, held before him on his saddle, kept in his sight every inch of the way to the sanctuary of the mountains.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your daddy?\u201d he muttered, and a fresh surge of rage pulsed through his veins. \u201cGod damn it, I am, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>To Every Thing</p><p>There Is a Season</p><p>16</p><p>LE MOT JUSTE</p><p>August 1773</p><p>YE\u2019RE SMILING TO yourself,\u201d Jamie said in my ear. \u201cNice, was it?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and opened my eyes, finding them on a level with his mouth\u2014which was smiling, too.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d I said thoughtfully, tracing the line of his wide lower lip with the tip of one finger. \u201cAre you being deliberately modest, or are you hoping to inspire me to raptures of praise by means of classic understatement?\u201d</p><p>The mouth widened further, and his teeth closed gently on my questing finger for a moment before releasing it.</p><p>\u201cOh, modesty, to be sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019d hopes of inspiring ye to raptures, it wouldna be with my words, now, would it?\u201d</p><p>One hand ran lightly down my back in illustration.</p><p>\u201cWell, the words help,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just now, I was actually trying to rank \u2018I love you, I like you, I worship you, I have to have my c*ck inside you,\u2019 in terms of their relative sincerity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that?\u201d he said, sounding slightly startled.</p><p>\u201cYes. Weren\u2019t you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI meant every word of it, though.\u201d His hand cupped one buttock, weighing it appreciatively. \u201cStill do, come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, even the last one?\u201d I laughed and rubbed my forehead gently against his chest, feeling his jaw rest snugly on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, gathering me firmly against him with a sigh. \u201cI will say the flesh requires a bit of supper and a wee rest before I think of doin\u2019 it again, but the spirit is always willing. God, ye have the sweetest fat wee bum. Only seeing it makes me want to give it ye again directly. It\u2019s lucky ye\u2019re wed to a decrepit auld man, Sassenach, or ye\u2019d be on your knees with your arse in the air this minute.\u201d</p><p>He smelled delectably of road dust and dried sweat and the deep musk of a man who has just enjoyed himself thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cNice to be missed,\u201d I said contentedly into the small space beneath his arm. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>My breath tickled him and his skin shivered suddenly, like a horse shedding flies. He shifted a bit, turning me so that my head fit into the hollow of his shoulder, and sighed in matching content.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. I see the place is still standing.\u201d</p><p>It was. It was late afternoon, the windows open, and the sun came low through the trees to make shifting patterns on the walls and linen sheets, so that we floated in a bower of murmuring shadow leaves.</p><p>\u201cThe house is standing, the barley is mostly in, and nothing\u2019s died,\u201d I said, settling myself comfortably to report. Now that we\u2019d taken care of the most important thing, he\u2019d want to know how the Ridge had fared in his absence.</p><p>\u201cMostly?\u201d he said, neatly catching the dicey bit. \u201cWhat happened? It rained, aye, but the barley should all have been in a week before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot rain. Grasshoppers.\u201d I shuddered in memory. A cloud of the nasty goggle-eyed things had come whirring through, just at the end of the barley harvest. I\u2019d gone up to my garden to pick greens, only to discover said greens seething with wedge-shaped bodies and shuffling, clawed feet, my lettuces and cabbages gnawed to ragged nubbins and the morning-glory vine on the palisade hanging in shreds.</p><p>\u201cI ran and got Mrs. Bug and Lizzie, and we drove them off with brooms\u2014but then they all rose up in a big cloud and headed up through the wood to the field beyond the Green Spring. They settled in the barley; you could hear the chewing for miles. It sounded like giants walking through rice.\u201d Goosebumps of revulsion rose on my shoulders, and Jamie rubbed my skin absently, his hand large and warm.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Was it only the one field they got, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I took a deep breath, still smelling the smoke. \u201cWe torched the field, and burnt them alive.\u201d</p><p>His body jerked in surprise, and he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said, not without pride. In cold-blooded retrospect, it was a sensible thing to have done; there were other fields at risk, not only of barley, but of ripening corn, wheat, potatoes, and hay\u2014to say nothing of the garden patches most families depended on.</p><p>In actual fact, it had been a decision made in boiling rage\u2014sheer, bloody-minded revenge for the destruction of my garden. I would happily have ripped the wings off each insect and stamped on the remains\u2014burning them had been nearly as good, though.</p><p>It was Murdo Lindsay\u2019s field; slow in both thought and action, Murdo hadn\u2019t had time to react properly to my announcement that I meant to fire the barley, and was still standing on the stoop of his cabin, mouth hanging open, as Brianna, Lizzie, Marsali, Mrs. Bug, and I ran round the field with armsful of faggots, lighting them from torches and hurling the blazing sticks as far as we could out into the sea of ripe, dry grain.</p><p>The dry grass went up with a crackle, and then a roar, as the fire took hold. Confused by the heat and smoke of a dozen fires, the grasshoppers flew up like sparks, igniting as their wings caught fire and vanishing into the rising column of smoke and whirling ash.</p><p>\u201cOf course, it would be just then that Roger chose to arrive with the new tenants,\u201d I said, repressing an urge to laugh inappropriately at the memory. \u201cPoor things. It was getting dark, and here they all were, standing in the woods with their bundles and children, watching this\u2014this bally conflagration going on, and all of us dancing round barefoot with our shifts kirtled up, hooting like gibbons and covered with soot.\u201d</p><p>Jamie covered his eyes with one hand, plainly visualizing the scene. His chest shook briefly, and a wide grin spread beneath the hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. They must ha\u2019 thought Roger Mac had brought them to hell. Or to a coven meeting, at least.\u201d</p><p>A bubble of guilty laughter was forcing itself up from under my ribs.</p><p>\u201cThey did. Oh, Jamie\u2014the looks on their faces!\u201d I lost my grip and buried my own face in his chest. We shook together for a moment, laughing almost soundlessly.</p><p>\u201cI did try to make them welcome,\u201d I said, snorting a little. \u201cWe gave them supper, and found them all places to sleep\u2014as many as we could fit in the house, the rest spread between Brianna\u2019s cabin, the stable, and the barn. I came down quite late at night, though\u2014I couldn\u2019t sleep, for all the excitement\u2014and found a dozen of them praying in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>They had been standing in a circle near the hearth, hands linked and heads bowed reverently. All the heads had snapped up at my appearance, eyes showing white in thin, haggard faces. They\u2019d stared at me in total silence, and one of the women had let go the hand of the man beside her to hide her own hand under her apron. In another time and place, I should have thought she was reaching for some weapon\u2014and perhaps she was, at that; I was fairly sure she was making the sign of the horns beneath the shelter of the ragged cloth.</p><p>I\u2019d already discovered that only a few of them spoke English. I asked in my halting Gaelic whether they needed anything? They stared at me as though I had two heads, then after a moment, one of the men, a wizened creature with a thin mouth, had shaken his head the barest inch.</p><p>\u201cThen they went right back to their praying, leaving me to skulk off back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe went down in your shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yes. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to be awake at that hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d His knuckles grazed my breast, and I could tell exactly what he was thinking. My summer night rail was thin, worn linen, and yes, all right, dammit, I supposed one could see through it a bit in the light, but the kitchen had been lit only by the ruddy glow of a smoored hearth.</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose ye went down in a proper nightcap, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie asked, running a thoughtful hand through my hair. I\u2019d loosened it to go to bed with him, and it was writhing off merrily in all directions, \u00e0 la Medusa.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I had it plaited, though,\u201d I protested. \u201cQuite respectable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite,\u201d he agreed, grinning, and pushing his fingers up into the wild mass of my hair, cradled my head in his hands and kissed me. His lips were chapped from wind and sun, but agreeably soft. He hadn\u2019t shaved since his departure and his beard was short and curly, springy to the touch.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. They\u2019re sorted now, I expect? The tenants?\u201d His lips brushed my cheek, and nibbled gently at my ear. I inhaled deeply.</p><p>\u201cAh. Oh. Yes. Arch Bug took them off in the morning; he\u2019s got them parceled out with families all over the Ridge, and already working on . . .\u201d My train of thought temporarily derailed, and I closed my fingers by reflex in the muscle of his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye told Murdo I\u2019d make it right with him, of course. About the barley?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d My drifting attention snagged momentarily and I laughed. \u201cHe just stared at me, and then nodded in a dazed sort of way, and said, oh, just as Himself liked, to be sure. I don\u2019t know if he realized even then why I\u2019d burnt his field; perhaps he just thought I\u2019d taken a sudden fancy to set fire to his barley.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed, too\u2014a most unsettling sensation, as he had his teeth fixed in my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said faintly, feeling the tickle of red beard on my neck and the very warm, firm flesh beneath my palm. \u201cThe Indians. How did you manage with the Cherokee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>He moved suddenly, rolling over on top of me. He was very big, and very warm, and he smelled of desire, strong and sharp. The leafy shadows moved across his face and shoulders, dappled the bed and the white skin of my thighs, opened wide.</p><p>\u201cI like ye fine, Sassenach,\u201d he murmured in my ear. \u201cI can see ye there, half-naked in your shift and your hair down, curling over your breest. . . . I love you. I wor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about a rest and supper?\u201d</p><p>His hands were worming themselves under me, cupping my buttocks, squeezing, his breath soft and hot on my neck.</p><p>\u201cI have to have my\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Sassenach.\u201d He rose up abruptly, kneeling on the bed before me. There was a faint smile on his face, but his eyes were dark blue and intent. He cupped his heavy balls in one hand, the thumb moving up and down his exigent member in a slow and thoughtful manner.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, a nighean,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>THE LIMITS OF POWER</p><p>From James Fraser, Esq., Fraser\u2019s Ridge</p> <p>to Lord John Grey of Mount Josiah Plantation</p><p>August 14, 1773</p><p>My lord\u2014</p><p>I write to inform you of my new Office, viz, that of Indian Agent to the Crown, by Appointment to the Southern Department under John Stuart.</p><p>I was originally of two Minds regarding Acceptance of this Appointment, but found my Views made more singular by Reason of a Visit by Mr. Richard Brown, a distant Neighbor, and his Brother. I expect that Mr. Higgins will already have given you an Account of their so-called Committee of Safety, and its immediate Object of arresting him.</p><p>Have you encountered such ad hoc Bodies in Virginia? I think perhaps your Situation is not so unsettled as is our own, or that in Boston, where Mr. Higgins also reports their Presence. I hope it is not.</p><p>I think a Person of Sense must deplore these committees in Principle. Their stated Purpose is to provide Protection from Vagabonds and Banditti, and to arrest Criminals in those Areas where no Sheriff or Constable is available. With no Law to regulate their Behavior save Self-interest, though, plainly there is Nothing to prevent an irregular Militia from becoming more of a Threat to the Citizenry than the Dangers from which it offers to preserve them.</p><p>The Appeal is plain, though, particularly in such Case as we find ourselves here, so remotely situated. The nearest Courthouse is\u2014or was\u2014three days\u2019 Ride, and in the constant Unrest that has followed the Regulation, Matters have decayed even from this unsatisfactory State. The Governor and his Council are in constant Conflict with the Assembly, the Circuit Court has effectually ceased to exist, Judges are no longer appointed, and there is no Sheriff of Surry County at present, the latest Holder of that Office having resigned under Threat of having his House fired.</p> <p>The Sheriffs of Orange and Rowan Counties still boast Office\u2014but their Corruption is so well known that no one may depend upon them, save those whose Interest is invested in them.</p><p>We hear frequent reports these Days of House-burnings, Assaults, and similar Alarums in the Wake of the recent War of Regulation. Governor Tryon officially pardoned some of those involved in the Conflict, but did nothing to prevent local Retribution against them; his Successor is still less able to deal with such Events\u2014which are in any Case occurring in the Backcountry, far from his Palace in New Bern and thus the more easily ignored. (In all Justice, the Man doubtless has Troubles nearer at Hand to deal with.)</p><p>Still, while Settlers here are accustomed to defend themselves from the normal Threats of the Wilderness, the Occurrence of such random Attacks as these\u2014and the Possibility of Irruption of the Indians, so close to the Treaty Line\u2014is sufficient to unnerve them, and cause them to greet with Relief the Appearance of any Body willing to undertake the Role of public Protection. Hence the Vigilantes of the Committees are welcomed\u2014at least to begin with.</p><p>I give you so much Detail by way of explaining my Thoughts regarding the Appointment. My friend Major MacDonald (late of the 32nd Cavalry) had told me that should I ultimately decline to become an Indian Agent, he would approach Mr. Richard Brown, Brown being in the way of doing substantial Trade with the Cherokee, and thus in a position of Acquaintance and presumed Trust that would predispose his Acceptance by the Indians.</p><p>My Acquaintance with Mr. Brown and his Brother inclines me to regard this Prospect with Alarm. With such Rise in Influence as such an Appointment would bring, Brown\u2019s Stature in this unsettled Region might shortly become so great that no man could easily oppose him in any Venture\u2014and that, I think, is dangerous.</p><p>My Son-in-law astutely observes that a Man\u2019s sense of Morality tends to decrease as his Power increases, and I suspect that the Brothers Brown possess relatively little of the Former to begin with. It may be mere Hubris on my part, to assume that I have more. I have seen the corrosive Effects of Power upon a Man\u2019s Soul\u2014and I have felt its Burden, as you will understand, having borne it so often yourself. Still, if it is a choice between myself and Richard Brown, I suppose I must resort to the old Scottish Adage that the Devil you ken is better than the Devil you don\u2019t.</p><p>I am likewise made uneasy at the Thought of the long Absences from Home which my new Duties must require. And yet I cannot in Conscience allow the People under my Dominion to be subject to the Vagaries and possible Injuries of Brown\u2019s Committee.</p><p>I could of course convene my own such Committee\u2014I think you would urge such a Course\u2014but will not. Beyond the Inconvenience and Expense of such a Move, it would be Tantamount to declaring open War with the Browns, and I think that not prudent, not if I must be frequently away from home, leaving my Family unprotected. This new Appointment, though, will extend my own Influence, and\u2014I trust\u2014put some Limit to the Browns\u2019 Ambitions.</p><p>So having reached this Decision, I sent Word at once to accept the Appointment, and essayed my first Visit to the Cherokee in the Office of Indian Agent during the last Month. My initial Reception was most Cordial, and I hope my Relations with the Villages will remain so.</p><p>I shall visit the Cherokee again in the Autumn. If you should have any Matters of Business that my new Office might assist, send to me regarding them, and rest assured that I shall make every Effort on your Behalf.</p><p>To more domestic Matters. Our small Population has nearly doubled, as the Result of an Influx of Settlers newly arrived from Scotland. While most desirable, this Incursion has caused no little Turmoil, the Newcomers being Fisher-folk from the Coast. To these, the Mountain Wilderness is full of Threat and Mystery, such Threats and Mysteries being personified by Pigs and Plowshares.</p><p>(With regard to Pigs, I am not sure but that I share their Views. The white Sow has lately taken up Residence beneath the Foundation of my House and there engages in such debauches that our Dinner is disturbed daily by hellish Noises resembling the Sounds of Souls in Torment. These Souls apparently being torn Limb from Limb and devoured by Demons beneath our Feet.)</p><p>Since I speak of Matters hellish, I must observe that our Newcomers are also, alas, stern Sons of the Covenant, to whom a Papist such as myself presents himself as one fully furnished with Horns and Tail. You will recall one Thomas Christie, I think, from Ardsmuir? By comparison of these stiff-necked Gentlemen, Mr. Christie appears the Soul of compassionate Generosity.</p><p>I had not thought to thank Providence for the Fact that my Son-in-law is Presbyterian by inclination, but I see now how true it is that the Almighty does indeed have Designs beyond the Ken of us poor mortals. While even Roger MacKenzie is a sadly depraved Libertine by their Lights, the new Tenants are at least able to speak to him without the Necessity of small Gestures and Signs intended to repel Evil, which are the constant Accompaniment to their Conversations with myself.</p><p>As for their Behavior with Respect to my Wife, you would think her the Witch of Endor, if not the Great Whore of Babylon. This, because they consider the Furnishments of her Surgery to be \u201cEnchantments,\u201d and were appalled at witnessing the Entrance therein of a Number of Cherokee, gaily festooned for visiting, who had come to Trade in such Arcana as Snakes\u2019 Fangs and the Gallbladders of Bears.</p><p>My wife begs me express her Pleasure at your kind Compliments regarding Mr. Higgins\u2019s improved Health\u2014and still more, at your Offer to procure medicinal Substances for her from your Friend in Philadelphia. She bids me send you the enclosed List. As I cast an Eye upon this, I suspect that your supplying of her Desires will do nothing to allay the Suspicions of the Fisher-folk, but pray do not desist on that Account, as I think nothing save Time and Custom will decrease their Fears of her.</p><p>My Daughter likewise bids me express her Gratitude for your Present of the Phosphorus. I am not certain that I share this Sentiment, given that her Experiments with the Substance prove frighteningly incendiary to date. Fortunately, none of the Newcomers observed these Experiments, or they would be in no Doubt that Satan is indeed a particular Friend to me and mine.</p><p>In happier Vein, I congratulate you upon your latest Vintage, which is indeed drinkable. I send in return a Jug of Mrs. Bug\u2019s best Cider, and a Bottle of the barrel-aged Three-year-old, which I flatter myself you will find less corrosive to the Gullet than the last Batch.</p><p>Your ob\u2019t. servant,</p><p>J. Fraser</p><p>Postscriptum: I have had Report of a Gentleman who by Description resembles one Stephen Bonnet, this Man appearing briefly in Cross Creek last Month. If it was indeed the Gentleman, his Business is unknown, and he seems to have vanished without Trace; my Uncle-in-law, Duncan Innes, has made Inquiries in the Area, but writes to tell me that these have proved fruitless. Should you hear of anything in this Regard, I pray you will advise me at once.</p><p>18</p><p>VROOM!</p><p>From the Dreambook</p><p>Last night I dreamed of running water. Generally, this means I drank too much before I went to bed, but this was different. The water was coming from the faucet in the sink at home. I was helping Mama do the dishes; she was running hot water from the hose-sprayer over the plates, then handing them to me to dry; I could feel the hot china through the dish towel, and feel the mist of water on my face.</p><p>Mama\u2019s hair was curling up like mad because of the humidity, and the pattern on the plates was the lumpy pink roses of the good wedding china. Mama didn\u2019t let me wash that until I was ten or so, for fear I\u2019d drop it, and when I got to wash it at last, I was so proud!</p><p>I can still see every last thing in the china cabinet in the living room: Mama\u2019s great-grandfather\u2019s hand-painted cake stand (he was an artist, she said, and won a competition with that cake stand, a hundred years ago), the dozen crystal goblets that Daddy\u2019s mother left him, along with the cut-glass olive dish and the cup and saucer hand-painted with violets and gilt rims.</p><p>I was standing in front of it, putting away the china\u2014but we didn\u2019t keep the china in that cabinet; we kept it in the shelf over the oven\u2014and the water was overflowing from the sink in the kitchen, and running out across the floor, puddling round my feet. Then it started to rise, and I was sloshing back and forth to the kitchen, kicking up the water so it sparkled like the cut-glass olive dish. The water got deeper and deeper, but nobody seemed to be worried; I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The water was warm, hot, in fact, I could see steam rising off it.</p><p>That\u2019s all there was to the dream\u2014but when I got up this morning, the water in the basin was so cold I had to warm water in a pan on the fire before I washed Jemmy. All the time I was checking the water on the fire, I kept remembering my dream, and all those gallons and gallons of hot, running water.</p><p>What I wonder is, these dreams I have about then\u2014they seem so vivid and detailed; more than the dreams I have about now. Why do I see things that don\u2019t exist anywhere except inside my brain?</p><p>What I wonder about the dreams is\u2014all the new inventions people think up\u2014how many of those things are made by people like me\u2014like us? How many \u201cinventions\u201d are really memories, of the things we once knew? And\u2014how many of us are there?</p><p>\u201cIT ISN\u2019T REALLY that hard to have hot, running water. In theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I suppose not.\u201d Roger only half-heard, concentrated as he was on the object taking shape beneath his knife.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it would be a big, horrible job to do. But it\u2019s simple in concept. Dig ditches or build sluices\u2014and around here, it would probably be sluices. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would?\u201d Here was the tricky bit. He held his breath, chiseling delicate, tiny slivers of wood away, one shaving at a time.</p><p>\u201cNo metal,\u201d Bree said patiently. \u201cIf you had metal, you could make surface pipes. But I bet there isn\u2019t enough metal in the whole colony of North Carolina to make the piping you\u2019d need to bring water from the creek to the Big House. Let alone a boiler! And if there was, it would cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Feeling that this was perhaps not an adequate response, Roger added hastily, \u201cBut there\u2019s some metal available. Jamie\u2019s still, for instance.\u201d</p><p>His wife snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I asked him where he got it\u2014he said he won it in a high-stakes game of loo against a ship\u2019s captain in Charleston. Think I could travel four hundred miles to bet my silver bracelet against a few hundred feet of rolled copper?\u201d</p><p>One more sliver . . . two . . . the smallest scrape with the tip of the knife . . . ah. The tiny circle came free of the matrix. It turned!</p><p>\u201cEr . . . sure,\u201d he said, belatedly realizing that she\u2019d asked him a question. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard one single word I\u2019ve said, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure I have,\u201d he protested. \u201c\u2018Ditch,\u2019 ye said. And \u2018water.\u2019 I\u2019m sure I remember that one.\u201d</p><p>She snorted again, though mildly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d have to do it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d His thumb sought the little wheel, and set it spinning.</p><p>\u201cGamble. No one\u2019s going to let me into a high-stakes card game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, in reflex.</p><p>\u201cBless your little Presbyterian heart,\u201d she said tolerantly, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not any kind of a gambler, Roger, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you are, I suppose.\u201d He said it jokingly, wondering even as he did so why he should feel vaguely reproached by her remark.</p><p>She merely smiled at that, wide mouth curving in a way that suggested untold volumes of wicked enterprise. He felt a slight sense of unease at that. She was a gambler, though so far . . . He glanced involuntarily at the large, charred spot in the middle of the table.</p><p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. At least your eyebrows have grown back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf. I\u2019m nearly there. One more batch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what ye said last time.\u201d He was aware that he was treading on dangerous ground, but seemed unable to stop.</p><p>She took a slow, deep breath, gazing at him through slightly narrowed eyes, like one taking the range before firing off some major piece of artillery. Then she seemed to think better of whatever she had been going to say; her features relaxed and she stretched out her hand toward the object he was holding.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve been making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a wee bawbee for Jem.\u201d He let her take it, feeling the warmth of modest pride. \u201cThe wheels all turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, Daddy?\u201d Jemmy had been wallowing on the floor with Adso the cat, who was tolerant of small children. Hearing his name, though, he abandoned the cat, who promptly escaped through the window, and popped up to see the new toy.</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d Brianna ran the little car over the palm of her hand and lifted it, letting all four tiny wheels spin free. Jem grabbed eagerly for it, pulling at the wheels.</p><p>\u201cCareful, careful! You\u2019ll pull them off! Here, let me show you.\u201d Crouching, Roger took the car and rolled it along the hearthstones. \u201cSee? Vroom. Vroom-vroom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroom!\u201d Jemmy echoed. \u201cLemme do it, Daddy, let me!\u201d</p><p>Roger surrendered the toy to Jemmy, smiling.</p><p>\u201cBroom! Broom-broom!\u201d The little boy shoved the car enthusiastically, then, losing his grip on it, watched open-mouthed as it zoomed to the end of the hearthstone by itself, hit the edge, and flipped over. Squealing with delight, he scampered after the new toy.</p><p>Still smiling, Roger glanced up, to see Brianna looking after Jem, a rather odd expression on her face. She felt his eyes on her, and looked down at him.</p><p>\u201cVroom?\u201d she said quietly, and he felt a small internal jolt, like a punch in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhatsit, Daddy, what\u2019s it?\u201d Jemmy had recaptured the toy and ran up to him, clutching it to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a . . . a . . .\u201d he began, helpless. It was in fact a crude replica of a Morris Minor, but even the word \u201ccar,\u201d let alone \u201cautomobile,\u201d had no meaning here. And the internal combustion engine, with its pleasantly evocative noises, was at least a century away.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a vroom, honey,\u201d said Bree, a distinct tone of sympathy in her voice. He felt the gentle weight of her hand, resting on his head.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . yeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d he said, and cleared a thickening in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a vroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroom,\u201d said Jemmy happily, and knelt to roll it down the hearth again. \u201cBroom-broom!\u201d</p><p>STEAM. It would have to be steam- or wind-powered; a windmill would work, maybe, to pump water into the system, but if I want hot water, there would be steam anyway\u2014why not use it?</p><p>Containment is the problem; wood burns and leaks, clay won\u2019t hold against pressure. I need metal, that\u2019s all there is to it. What would Mrs. Bug do, I wonder, if I took the laundry cauldron? Well, I know what she\u2019d do, and a steam explosion is no comparison; besides, we do need to do the laundry. I\u2019ll have to dream up something else.</p><p>19</p><p>MAKING HAY</p><p>MAJOR MACDONALD returned on the final day of haymaking. I was just maneuvering my way along the side of the house with an immense basket of bread, when I saw him near the trailhead, tying up his horse to a tree. He lifted his hat to me and bowed, then came across the dooryard, looking curiously round at the preparations taking place.</p><p>We had set up trestles under the chestnut trees, with boards laid across them for tables, and a constant stream of women scurried to and fro like ants between the house and yard, fetching food. The sun was setting, and the men would be in soon for a celebratory feast; filthy, exhausted, starving\u2014and exhilarated by the end of their labors.</p><p>I greeted the Major with a nod, and accepted with relief his offer to carry the bread to the tables for me.</p><p>\u201cHaying, is it?\u201d he said, in answer to my explanation. A nostalgic smile spread across his weathered face. \u201cI remember the haymaking, from when I was a lad. But that was in Scotland, aye? We\u2019d seldom such glorious weather as this for it.\u201d He looked up into the blazing deep blue bowl of the August sky above. It really was perfect haying weather, hot and dry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said, sniffing appreciatively. The scent of fresh hay was everywhere\u2014and so was the hay; there were shimmering mounds of it in every shed, everyone carried bits of it on their clothes, and small trails of scattered straw lay everywhere. Now the smell of cut, dry hay was mingled with the delectable scent of the barbecue that had been simmering underground overnight, the fresh bread, and the heady tang of Mrs. Bug\u2019s cider. Marsali and Bree were bringing down jugs of it from the springhouse, where it had been cooling, along with buttermilk and beer.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019ve chosen my time well,\u201d the Major remarked, viewing all this effort with approval.</p><p>\u201cIf you came to eat, yes,\u201d I said, rather amused. \u201cIf you came to talk to Jamie, I rather think you\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, puzzled, but had no opportunity to inquire further; I had caught another glimpse of movement at the trailhead. The Major turned, seeing the direction of my glance, and frowned slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s that fellow with the brand on his face,\u201d he said, wary disapproval in his voice. \u201cI saw him down at Coopersville, but he saw me first, and steered well clear. Will ye have me drive him off, mum?\u201d He set down the bread and was already settling his sword belt on his hip, when I gripped his forearm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing, Major,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cMr. Higgins is a friend.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a flat look, then dropped his arm.</p><p>\u201cAs ye like, Mrs. Fraser, of course,\u201d he said coolly, and picking up the bread again, went off toward the tables.</p><p>Rolling my eyes in exasperation, I went to greet the newcomer. Plainly Bobby Higgins could have joined the Major on the path to the Ridge; just as plainly, he had chosen not to. He had become a little more familiar with mules, I saw; he was riding one and leading another, laden with a promising array of panniers and boxes.</p><p>\u201cHis Lordship\u2019s compliments, mum,\u201d he said, saluting me smartly as he slid off. From the corner of my eye, I saw MacDonald watching\u2014and his small start of recognition at the military gesture. So, now he knew Bobby for a soldier, and doubtless would ferret out his background in short order. I repressed a sigh; I couldn\u2019t mend matters; they\u2019d have to settle it between themselves\u2014if there was anything to settle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking well, Bobby,\u201d I said, smiling as I pushed aside my disquiet. \u201cNo difficulties with the riding, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, mum!\u201d He beamed. \u201cAnd I\u2019s not fallen out once since I left you last!\u201d \u201cFallen out\u201d meant \u201cfainted,\u201d and I congratulated him on the state of his health, looking him over as he unloaded the pack mule with deft efficiency. He did seem much better; pink and fresh-skinned as a child, bar the ugly brand on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYonder lobsterback,\u201d he said, affecting insouciance as he set down a box. \u201cHe\u2019s known to ye, is he, mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Major MacDonald,\u201d I said, carefully not looking in the Major\u2019s direction; I could feel his stare boring into my back. \u201cYes. He . . . does things for the Governor, I believe. Not regular army, I mean; he\u2019s a half-pay officer.\u201d</p><p>That bit of information seemed to ease Bobby\u2019s mind a bit. He took a breath, as though to say something, but then thought better of it. Instead, he reached into his shirt and withdrew a sealed letter, which he handed over.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you,\u201d he explained. \u201cFrom his Lordship. Is Miss Lizzie by any chance about?\u201d His eyes were already searching the flock of girls and women readying the tables.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was in the kitchen last I saw,\u201d I replied, a small uneasy feeling skittering down my backbone. \u201cShe\u2019ll be out in a minute. But . . . you do know she\u2019s betrothed, don\u2019t you, Bobby? Her fianc\u00e9 will be coming with the other men for supper.\u201d</p><p>He met my eyes and smiled with singular sweetness.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, mum, I know that well enough. On\u2019y thought as I s\u2019ould thank her for her kindness when I last was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, not trusting that smile in the slightest. Bobby was a very handsome lad, blind eye or not\u2014and he had been a soldier. \u201cWell . . . good.\u201d</p><p>Before I could say more, I caught the sound of male voices, coming through the trees. It wasn\u2019t precisely singing; sort of a rhythmic chant. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was\u2014there was a lot of Gaelic \u201cHo-ro!\u201d and the like\u2014but all of them seemed to be bellowing along in a cordial fashion.</p><p>Haymaking was a novel concept to the new tenants, who were much more accustomed to rake kelp than scythe grass. Jamie, Arch, and Roger had shepherded them through the process, though, and I had been asked to stitch no more than a handful of minor wounds, so I assumed it had been a success\u2014no hands or feet lopped off, a few shouting matches, but no fistfights, and no more than the usual amount of hay trampled or ruined.</p><p>All of them seemed in good spirits as they poured into the dooryard, bedraggled, sweat-soaked, and thirsty as sponges. Jamie was in the thick of them, laughing and staggering as someone pushed him. He caught sight of me, and a huge grin split his sun-browned face. In a stride, he had reached me and swept me into an exuberant embrace, redolent of hay, horses, and sweat.</p><p>\u201cDone, by God!\u201d he said, and kissed me soundly. \u201cChrist, I need a drink. And nay, that\u2019s no blasphemy, wee Roger,\u201d he added, with a glance behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s heartfelt gratitude and desperate need, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. First things first, though, hm?\u201d Roger had appeared behind Jamie, his voice so hoarse that it was barely audible in the general uproar. He swallowed, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Jamie shot a quick look at Roger, assessing, then shrugged and strode out into the center of the yard.</p><p>\u201cE\u00ecsd ris! E\u00ecsd ris!\u201d bellowed Kenny Lindsay, seeing him. Evan and Murdo joined him, clapping their hands and shouting \u201cHear him!\u201d loudly enough that the crowd began to subside and pay attention.</p><p>\u201cI say the prayer from my mouth,</p><p>I say the prayer from my heart,</p><p>I say the prayer to Thee Thyself,</p><p>O, Healing Hand, O Son of the God of salvation.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t raise his voice much above its normal speaking level, but everyone quieted at once, so the words rang clear.</p><p>\u201cThou Lord God of the angels,</p><p>Spread over me Thy linen robe;</p><p>Shield me from every famine,</p><p>Free me from every spectral shape.</p><p>Strengthen me in every good,</p><p>Encompass me in every strait,</p><p>Safeguard me in every ill,</p><p>And from every enmity restrain me.\u201d</p><p>There was a stirring of faint approval in the crowd; I saw a few of the fisher-folk bow their heads, though their eyes stayed fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cBe Thou between me and all things grisly,</p><p>Be Thou between me and all things mean,</p><p>Be Thou between me and all things gruesome</p><p>Coming darkly toward me.</p><p>\u201cO God of the weak,</p><p>O God of the lowly,</p><p>O God of the righteous,</p><p>O shield of homesteads:</p><p>\u201cThou art calling upon us</p><p>In the voice of glory,</p><p>With the mouth of mercy</p><p>Of Thy beloved Son.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Roger, who was nodding slightly with approval, as well. Evidently, they\u2019d agreed on it together. Sensible; it would be a prayer familiar in form to the fisher-folk, and nothing specifically Catholic about it.</p><p>Jamie spread his arms, quite unconsciously, and the breeze caught the worn damp linen of his shirt as he tilted back his head and raised his face to the sky, open with joy.</p><p>\u201cO may I find rest everlasting</p><p>In the home of Thy Trinity,</p><p>In the Paradise of the godly,</p><p>In the Sun-garden of Thy love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen!\u201d said Roger, as loudly as he could, and there were gratified murmurs of \u201camen\u201d round the yard. Then Major MacDonald raised the tankard of cider he was holding, called \u201cSl\u00e0inte!\u201d and drained it.</p><p>Festivity became general after that. I found myself sitting on a cask, Jamie on the grass at my feet, with a platter of food and a constantly refilled mug of cider.</p><p>\u201cBobby Higgins is here,\u201d I told him, catching sight of Bobby in the midst of a small group of admiring young ladies. \u201cDo you see Lizzie anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, stifling a yawn. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe asked for her particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find her. Will ye have a bit o\u2019 meat, Sassenach?\u201d He held up a large rib bone, brow cocked inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some,\u201d I assured him, and he at once tore into it, addressing himself to the vinegar-spiced barbecue as though he hadn\u2019t eaten for a week.</p><p>\u201cHas Major MacDonald spoken to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, mouth full, and swallowed. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep. There\u2019s Lizzie\u2014wi\u2019 the McGillivrays.\u201d</p><p>I felt reassured by that. The McGillivrays\u2014particularly Frau Ute\u2014would certainly discourage any inappropriate attentions to their new intended daughter-in-law. Lizzie was chatting and laughing with Robin McGillivray, who was smiling at her in fatherly fashion, while his son Manfred ate and drank with single-minded appetite. Frau Ute, I saw, was keeping a sharp and interested eye on Lizzie\u2019s father, who was sitting on the porch nearby, cozily side by side with a tall, rather plain-faced German lady.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that with Joseph Wemyss?\u201d I asked, nudging Jamie with my knee to direct his attention.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes against the sun\u2019s glare, looking, then shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken. She\u2019s German; she must ha\u2019 come with Ute McGillivray. Matchmaking, aye?\u201d He tilted up his mug and drank, sighing with bliss.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d I looked at the strange woman with interest. She certainly seemed to be getting on well with Joseph\u2014and he with her. His thin face was alight as he gestured, explaining something to her, and her neatly capped head was bent toward him, a smile on her lips.</p><p>I didn\u2019t always approve of Ute McGillivray\u2019s methods, which tended toward the juggernaut, but I had to admire the painstaking intricacy of her plans. Lizzie and Manfred would marry next spring, and I had wondered how Joseph would fare then; Lizzie was his whole life.</p><p>He might, of course, go with her when she married. She and Manfred would simply live in the McGillivrays\u2019 large house, and I imagined that they would find room for Joseph, too. Still, he would be torn, not wanting to leave us\u2014and while any able-bodied man could always be of use on a homestead, he was by no means a natural farmer, let alone a gunsmith, like Manfred and his father. If he himself were to wed, though . . .</p><p>I gave Ute McGillivray a glance, and saw her watching Mr. Wemyss and his inamorata with the contented expression of a puppet master whose puppets are dancing precisely to her tune.</p><p>Someone had left a pitcher of cider beside us. I refilled Jamie\u2019s mug, then my own. It was wonderful, a dark, cloudy amber, sweet and pungent and with the bite of a particularly subtle serpent to it. I let the cool liquid trickle down my throat and bloom inside my head like a silent flower.</p><p>There was much talk and laughter, and I noticed that while the new tenants still kept to their own family groups, there was now a little more blending, as the men who had been working side-by-side for the last two weeks maintained their cordial relations, these social courtesies fueled by cider. The new tenants mostly regarded wine as a mocker, strong drink\u2014whisky, rum, or brandy\u2014as raging, but everyone drank beer and cider. Cider was wholesome, one of the women had told me, handing a mug to her small son. I gave it half an hour, I thought, sipping slowly, before they started dropping like flies.</p> <p>Jamie made a small amused sound, and I looked down at him. He nodded at the far side of the dooryard, and I looked to see that Bobby Higgins had disentangled himself from his admirers, and by some alchemical legerdemain had managed to abstract Lizzie from the midst of the McGillivrays. They were standing in the shadow of the chestnut trees, talking.</p><p>I looked back at the McGillivrays. Manfred was leaning against the foundation of the house, head nodding over his plate. His father had curled up beside him on the ground and was snoring peacefully. The girls chatted around them, passing food to and fro over the drooping heads of their husbands, all in various stages of impending somnolence. Ute had moved to the porch, and was talking to Joseph and his companion.</p><p>I glanced back. Lizzie and Bobby were only talking, and there was a respectful distance between them. But there was something about the way he bent toward her, and the way she half-turned away from him, then back, swinging a fold of her skirt one-handed . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said. I shifted a little, getting my feet under me, but unsure whether I ought really to go and interrupt them. After all, they were in plain sight, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThree things astonish me, nay four, sayeth the prophet.\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand squeezed my thigh, and I looked down to see that he was also watching the couple under the chestnut trees, his eyes half-closed. \u201cThe way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent on the rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea\u2014and the way of a man with a maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m not imagining it,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d best do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He took a deep breath and straightened up, shaking his head vigorously to wake himself. \u201cAh. No, Sassenach. If wee Manfred willna take the trouble to guard his woman, it\u2019s no your place to do it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I quite agree. I\u2019m only thinking, if Ute should see them . . . or Joseph?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what Mr. Wemyss would do; I thought Ute would probably make a major scene.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d He blinked, swaying a little. \u201cAye, I suppose ye\u2019re right.\u201d He turned his head, searching, then spotting Ian, lifted his chin in summons.</p><p>Ian had been sprawled dreamily on the grass a few feet away, next to a pile of greasy rib bones, but now rolled over and crawled obligingly to us.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d he said. His thick brown hair had fallen half out of its binding, and several cowlicks were sticking straight up, the rest fallen disreputably over one eye.</p><p>Jamie nodded in the direction of the chestnut trees.</p><p>\u201cGo and ask wee Lizzie to mend your hand, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced blearily down at his hand; there was a fresh scratch across the back of it, though it was long since clotted. Then he looked in the direction Jamie indicated.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He remained on hands and knees, eyes narrowed thoughtfully, then slowly rose to his feet, and pulled the binding off his hair. Casually shoving it back with one hand, he strolled in the direction of the chestnut trees.</p><p>They were much too far away to hear anything, but we could see. Bobby and Lizzie parted like the waves of the Red Sea as Ian\u2019s tall, gangly form stepped purposefully between them. The three seemed to chat amiably for a moment, then Lizzie and Ian departed for the house, Lizzie giving Bobby a casual wave of the hand\u2014and a brief, backward glance. Bobby stood for a moment looking after her, rocking thoughtfully on his heels, then shook his head and made for the cider.</p><p>The cider was taking its toll. I\u2019d expected every man in the place to be laid out cold by nightfall; during haying, men commonly fell asleep in their plates from sheer exhaustion. As it was, there was still plenty of talk and laughter, but the soft twilight glow beginning to suffuse the dooryard showed an increasing number of bodies strewn in the grass.</p><p>Rollo was gnawing contentedly on Ian\u2019s discarded bones. Brianna sat a little way away; Roger lay with his head in her lap, sound asleep. The collar of his shirt was open, the ragged rope scar still vivid across his neck. Bree smiled at me, her hand gently stroking his glossy black hair, picking bits of hay out of it. Jemmy was nowhere to be seen\u2014neither was Germain, as I ascertained with a quick look around. Luckily the phosphorus was under lock and key, in the top of my highest cupboard.</p><p>Jamie laid his own head against my thigh, warm and heavy, and I put my hand on his hair, smiling back at Bree. I heard him snort faintly, and looked in the direction of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cFor such a wee small lass, yon Lizzie does cause a good deal of trouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>Bobby Higgins was standing beside one of the tables, drinking cider, and quite evidently unaware that he was being stalked by the Beardsley twins. The two of them were slinking like foxes through the wood, not quite out of sight, converging on him from opposite directions.</p><p>One\u2014Jo, probably\u2014stepped out suddenly beside Bobby, startling him into spilling his drink. He frowned, wiping at the wet splotch on his shirt, while Jo leaned close, obviously muttering menaces and warnings. Looking offended, Bobby turned away from him, only to be confronted by Kezzie on the other side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s Lizzie who\u2019s causing the trouble,\u201d I said defensively. \u201cShe only talked to him, after all.\u201d Bobby\u2019s face was growing noticeably flushed. He set down the mug he\u2019d been drinking from and drew himself up a little, one hand folding into a fist.</p><p>The Beardsleys crowded closer, with the evident intention of forcing him into the wood. Glancing warily from one twin to the other, he took a step back, putting a solid tree trunk at his back.</p><p>I glanced down; Jamie was watching through half-closed lids, with an expression of dreamy detachment. He sighed deeply, his eyes closed altogether, and he went suddenly and completely limp, the weight of him heavy against me.</p><p>The reason for this sudden absquatulation loomed up a second later: MacDonald, ruddy with food and cider, his red coat glowing like a cinder in the sunset light. He looked down at Jamie, peacefully slumbering against my leg, and shook his head. He turned slowly round, surveying the scene.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Strewth,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ye, mum, I\u2019ve seen battlefields with much less carnage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have you?\u201d His appearance had distracted me, but at the mention of \u201ccarnage,\u201d I glanced back. Bobby and the Beardsley twins had disappeared, vanished like wisps of mist in the gloaming. Well, if they were beating each other to pulp in the wood, I was sure I\u2019d hear about it before too long.</p><p>With a small shrug, MacDonald bent, took Jamie by the shoulders, and eased him off me, laying him down in the grass with surprising gentleness.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked politely, and upon my nod of assent, sat down beside me on the other side, arms companionably hooked round his knees.</p><p>He was neatly dressed, as always, wig and all, but the collar of his shirt was grimy and the skirts of his coat frayed at the hem and spattered with mud.</p><p>\u201cA great deal of travel these days, Major?\u201d I asked, making conversation. \u201cYou look rather tired, if you\u2019ll pardon my mentioning it.\u201d</p><p>I had surprised him in the middle of a yawn; he swallowed it, blinking, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cAye, mum. I\u2019ve been in the saddle for the last month, and seen a bed perhaps one night in three.\u201d</p><p>He did look tired, even in the soft sunset light; the lines of his face were cut deep with fatigue, the flesh beneath his eyes sagging and smudged. He was not a handsome man, but normally had a brash self-assurance that lent him an attractive air. Now he looked what he was: a half-pay soldier pushing fifty, lacking a regiment or regular duty, struggling for any small connections that might hold some hope of advancement.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t normally have spoken to him of his business, but sympathy moved me to ask, \u201cAre you working a lot on behalf of Governor Martin these days?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and took another gulp of cider, breathing deeply after it.</p><p>\u201cAye, mum. The Governor has been kind enough to charge me with bringing him news of conditions in the backcountry\u2014and has done me the signal favor of accepting my advice, now and then.\u201d He glanced at Jamie, who had curled himself up like a hedgehog and commenced to snore, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWith regard to my husband\u2019s appointment as Indian Agent, you mean? We do thank you, Major.\u201d</p><p>He waved a casual hand in dismissal of my thanks.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, mum; that had nothing to do wi\u2019 the Governor, save indirectly. Such appointments are the province of the Superintendent of the Southern Department. Though it is of course a matter of interest to the Governor,\u201d he added, taking another sip, \u201cto hear news of the Indians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell you all about it in the morning,\u201d I assured him, with a nod at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, mum.\u201d He hesitated for a moment. \u201cWould ye ken . . . did Mr. Fraser perhaps mention, in his conversations in the villages\u2014was there any mention of . . . burnings?\u201d</p><p>I sat up straight, the cider buzz disappearing from my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Have there been more?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and rubbed a hand tiredly down his face, scrubbing at the sprout of whiskers.</p><p>\u201cAye, two\u2014but the one was a barn-burning, down below Salem. One o\u2019 the Moravian brethren\u2019s. And from all I can learn of the matter, \u2019twas likely some of the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who\u2019ve settled in Surry County. There\u2019s a wee arsebite of a preacher who\u2019s got them riled about the Moravians\u2014Godless heathen that they are\u2014\u201d He grinned suddenly at that, but then sobered again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been trouble brewing in Surry County for months. To the point that the brethren have been petitioning the Governor to redraw the boundary lines, so as to put them all in Rowan County. The line between Surry and Rowan goes right through their land, ken? And the sheriff in Surry is . . .\u201d He twiddled a hand.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not so keen in the performance of his duty as he might be?\u201d I suggested. \u201cAt least where the Moravians are concerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the arsebite\u2019s cousin,\u201d MacDonald said, and drained his cup. \u201cYe\u2019ve had no trouble wi\u2019 your new tenants, by the way?\u201d he added, lowering it. He smiled crookedly, looking round the dooryard at the small groups of women, chattering contentedly as their men slept by their feet. \u201cIt would appear ye\u2019ve made them welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they are Presbyterians, and fairly vehement about it\u2014but they haven\u2019t tried to burn the house down yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>I took a quick glance at the porch, where Mr. Wemyss and his companion still sat, heads close in conversation. I thought Mr. Wemyss was probably the only man still conscious, bar the Major himself. The lady was plainly a German, but not, I thought, a Moravian; they very seldom married outside their community, nor did the women often travel far.</p><p>\u201cUnless you think the Presbyterians have formed a gang for the purpose of purging the countryside of Papists and Lutherans\u2014and you don\u2019t think that, do you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled briefly at that, though without much humor.</p><p>\u201cNo. But then, I was raised Presbyterian myself, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cEr . . . a drop more cider, Major?\u201d</p><p>He held out his cup without demur.</p><p>\u201cThe other burning\u2014that seems much like the others,\u201d he said, graciously choosing to overlook my remark. \u201cAn isolated homestead. A man living alone. But this one was just over the Treaty Line.\u201d</p><p>This last was said with a significant glance, and I looked involuntarily at Jamie. He\u2019d told me that the Cherokee were upset about settlers intruding into their territory.</p><p>\u201cI shall ask your husband in the morning, of course, mum,\u201d MacDonald said, correctly interpreting my glance. \u201cBut perhaps ye\u2019d ken whether he\u2019s heard any references . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeiled threats from a Snowbird chief,\u201d I confessed. \u201cHe wrote to John Stuart about them. But nothing specific. When did this latest burning happen?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNo telling. I heard of it three weeks ago, but the man who told me had heard of it a month before that\u2014and he\u2019d not seen it, only heard from someone else.\u201d</p><p>He scratched thoughtfully at his jaw.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should go and inspect the place, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d I said, not bothering to hide the skepticism in my voice. \u201cAnd you think it\u2019s Jamie\u2019s job, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna be so presumptuous as to instruct Mr. Fraser in his duties, mum,\u201d he said, with the hint of a smile. \u201cBut I will suggest to him that the situation may be of interest, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do that,\u201d I muttered. Jamie had planned another quick trip to the Snowbird villages, squeezed in between harvesting and the onset of the cold weather. The notion of marching into the village and quizzing Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning about a burned homestead seemed more than slightly risky, viewed from my perspective.</p><p>A slight chill made me shiver, and I gulped the rest of my own cider, wishing suddenly that it was hot. The sun was fully set now, and the air had grown cool, but that wasn\u2019t what was cooling my blood.</p><p>What if MacDonald\u2019s suspicions were right? If the Cherokee had been burning homesteads? And if Jamie were to show up, asking inconvenient questions . . . .</p><p>I looked at the house, standing solid and serene, its windows glowing with candlelight, a pale bulwark against the darkening woods beyond.</p><p>It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house. . . .</p><p>The fireflies were coming out, drifting like cool green sparks in the shadows, and I looked upward involuntarily, to see a spray of red and yellow ones from the chimney. Whenever I thought of that gruesome clipping\u2014and I tried not to, nor to count the days between now and January 21 of 1776\u2014I had thought of the fire as occurring by accident. Such accidents were more than common, ranging from hearth fires run amok and candlesticks tipped over, to blazes caused by the summer lightning storms. It hadn\u2019t consciously occurred to me before that it might be a deliberate act\u2014an act of murder.</p><p>I moved my foot enough to nudge Jamie. He stirred in his sleep, reached out one hand, and clasped it warmly round my ankle, then subsided with a contented groan.</p><p>\u201cStand between me and all things grisly,\u201d I said, half-under my breath.</p><p>\u201cSl\u00e0inte,\u201d said the Major, and drained his cup again.</p><p>20</p><p>DANGEROUS GIFTS</p><p>PROPELLED BY MAJOR MACDONALD\u2019S news, Jamie and Ian departed two days later for a quick visit to Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, and the Major went off on his further mysterious errands, leaving me with Bobby Higgins for assistance.</p><p>I was dying to dig into the crates Bobby had brought, but what with one thing and another\u2014the white pig\u2019s demented attempt to eat Adso, a goat with infected teats, a strange green mold that had got into the last batch of cheese, the completion of a much-needed summer kitchen, and a stern conversation with the Beardsleys regarding the treatment of guests, among other things\u2014it was more than a week before I found leisure to unpack Lord John\u2019s present and read his letter.</p><p>September 4, 1773</p><p>From Lord John Grey, Mount Josiah Plantation</p><p>To Mrs. James Fraser</p><p>My dear Madam\u2014</p><p>I trust that the Articles you requested will have arrived intact. Mr. Higgins is somewhat nervous of carrying the Oil of Vitriol, as I understand he has had some evil Experience connected with it, but we have packed the Bottle with some Care, leaving it sealed as it came from England.</p><p>After examining the exquisite Drawings you sent\u2014do I detect your daughter\u2019s elegant Hand in them?\u2014I rode to Williamsburg, in order to consult with a famous Glassmaker who abides there under the nomen (doubtless fabulous) of Blogweather. Mr. Blogweather allowed that the Pelican Retort would be simplicity itself, scarcely a fair Test of his Skill, but was enchanted by the Requirements of the distilling Apparatus, particularly the detachable Coil. He apprehended immediately the Desirability of such a Device in case of Breakage, and has made three of them.</p><p>Pray consider these my Gift\u2014a most insignificant Demonstration of my abiding Gratitude for your many Kindnesses, both toward myself and Mr. Higgins.</p><p>Your most humble and obedient servant,</p><p>John Grey</p><p>Postscriptum: I have thus far restrained my sense of vulgar Curiosity, but I do venture to hope that on some future Occasion, you may possibly gratify me by explaining the Purpose to which you intend these Articles be put.</p><p>THEY HAD PACKED WITH some care. Pried open, the crates proved to be filled with an immense quantity of straw, the bits of glassware and sealed bottles gleaming within, cradled like roc\u2019s eggs.</p><p>\u201cYou will be careful with that, won\u2019t \u2019ee, mum?\u201d Bobby inquired anxiously, as I lifted out a squat, heavy, brown-glass bottle, the cork heavily sealed with red wax. \u201cIt\u2019s turrible noxious, that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Standing on tiptoe, I boosted the bottle up onto a high shelf, safe from marauding children or cats. \u201cHave you seen it used, then, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>His lips drew in tight, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot to say used, mum. But I\u2019ve seen what it does. Was a . . . a lass, in London, what I come to know a bit, whilst we was a-waitin\u2019 the ship to carry us to America. Half her face pretty and smooth as a buttercup but t\u2019other side was so scarred you could scarce look at it. Like as it was melted in a fire, but she said \u2019twas vitriol.\u201d He glanced up at the bottle, and swallowed visibly. \u201cAnother whore\u2019d thrown it on her, she said, \u2019cause of jealousy.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again, sighing, and reached for the broom to sweep up the scattered straw.</p><p>\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t worry,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI don\u2019t propose to throw it at anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, mum!\u201d He was quite shocked. \u201cI s\u2019ould never think that!\u201d</p><p>I disregarded this reassurance, involved in delving for more treasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d I said, enchanted. I held in my hands the fruit of Mr. Blogweather\u2019s artistry: a globe of glass, the size of my head, blown to perfect symmetry and lacking even the hint of a bubble. There was a faint blue tinge to the glass, and I could see my own distorted reflection, wide-nosed and bug-eyed, like a mermaid peering out.</p><p>\u201cAye, mum,\u201d said Bobby, dutifully peering at the retort. \u201cIt\u2019s, er . . . big, in\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Just perfect!\u201d Rather than being cut off cleanly from the blower\u2019s pipe, the neck of the globe had been drawn out into a thick-walled tube about two inches long and an inch in diameter. The edges and interior surface of this had been . . . sanded? Ground? I\u2019d no idea what Mr. Blogweather had done, but the result was a silky, opaque surface that would form a lovely seal when a similarly finished piece was inserted into it.</p><p>My hands were damp with excitement and nervousness, lest I drop the precious thing. I clutched a fold of my apron round it, and turned to and fro, debating where best to put it. I hadn\u2019t expected one so large; I should need Bree or one of the men to make me a suitable support.</p><p>\u201cIt has to go over a small fire,\u201d I explained, frowning at the little brazier I used for brewing. \u201cBut the temperature is important; a charcoal bed may be too hard to keep at a steady heat.\u201d I placed the big ball in my cupboard, safely behind a row of bottles. \u201cI think it will have to be an alcohol lamp\u2014but it\u2019s bigger than I thought, I\u2019ll have to have a good-size lamp to heat it. . . .\u201d</p><p>I became aware that Bobby was not listening to my babbling, his attention having been distracted by something outside. He was frowning at something, and I came up behind him, peering through the open window to see what it was.</p><p>I should have guessed; Lizzie Wemyss was out on the grass, churning butter under the chestnut trees, and Manfred McGillivray was with her.</p><p>I glanced at the pair, engaged in cheerful conversation, then at Bobby\u2019s somber countenance. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d open the other crate for me, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d His attention was still fixed on the pair outside.</p><p>\u201cCrate,\u201d I repeated patiently. \u201cThat one.\u201d I nudged it with my toe.</p><p>\u201cCrate . . . oh! Oh, aye, mum, to be sure.\u201d Pulling his gaze from the window, he set about the task, looking glum.</p><p>I took the rest of the glassware from the open crate, shaking off the straw and putting globes, retorts, flasks, and coils carefully into a high cupboard\u2014but I kept an eye on Bobby as I did so, pondering this newly revealed situation. I hadn\u2019t thought his feelings for Lizzie were more than a passing attraction.</p><p>And perhaps it was no more than that, I reminded myself. But if it was . . . Despite myself, I glanced through the window, only to discover that the pair had become a trio.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d I exclaimed. Bobby glanced up, startled, but I was already heading for the door, hastily brushing straw from my clothes.</p><p>If Ian was back, Jamie was\u2014</p><p>He came through the front door just as I barreled into the hallway, and grabbed me round the waist, kissing me with sun-dusty enthusiasm and sandpaper whiskers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d I said, rather inanely.</p><p>\u201cI am, and there are Indians just behind me,\u201d he said, clutching my bottom with both hands and rasping his whiskers fervently against my cheek. \u201cGod, what I\u2019d give for a quarter of an hour alone wi\u2019 ye, Sassenach! My balls are burst\u2014ah. Mr. Higgins. I, um, didna see ye there.\u201d</p><p>He let go and straightened abruptly, sweeping off his hat and smacking it against his thigh in an exaggerated pantomime of casualness.</p><p>\u201cNo, zur,\u201d Bobby said morosely. \u201cMr. Ian\u2019s back, as well, is he?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound as though this was particularly good news; if Ian\u2019s arrival had distracted Lizzie from Manfred\u2014and it had\u2014it did nothing to redirect her attention to Bobby.</p><p>Lizzie had abandoned her churn to poor Manfred, who was turning the crank with an air of obvious resentment, as she went laughing off in the direction of the stable with Ian, presumably to show him the new calf that had arrived during his absence.</p><p>\u201cIndians,\u201d I said, belatedly catching what Jamie had said. \u201cWhat Indians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA half-dozen of the Cherokee,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He nodded at the trail of loose straw leading out of my surgery.</p><p>\u201cOh, that. That,\u201d I said happily, \u201cis ether. Or going to be. We\u2019re feeding the Indians, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019ll tell Mrs. Bug. But there\u2019s a young woman with them that they\u2019ve fetched along for ye to tend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He was already striding down the hall toward the kitchen, and I hurried to keep up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToothache,\u201d he said briefly, and pushed open the kitchen door. \u201cMrs. Bug! C\u00e1 bhfuil t\u00fa? Ether, Sassenach? Ye dinna mean phlogiston, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that I do,\u201d I said, trying to recall what on earth phlogiston was. \u201cI\u2019ve told you about anesthesia, though, I know\u2014that\u2019s what ether is, a sort of anesthetic; puts people to sleep so you can do surgery without hurting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra useful in case of the toothache,\u201d Jamie observed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the woman gone to? Mrs. Bug!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would be, but it will take some time to make. We\u2019ll have to make do with whisky for the moment. Mrs. Bug is in the summer kitchen, I expect; it\u2019s bread day. And speaking of alcohol\u2014\u201d He was already out the back door, and I scampered across the stoop after him. \u201cI\u2019ll need quite a bit of high-quality alcohol, for the ether. Can you bring me a barrel of the new stuff tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA barrel? Christ, Sassenach, what d\u2019ye mean to do, bathe in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as a matter of fact, yes. Or rather not me\u2014the oil of vitriol. You pour it gently into a bath of hot alcohol, and it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Fraser! I did think as how I heard someone a-callin\u2019.\u201d Mrs. Bug appeared suddenly with a basket of eggs over one arm, beaming. \u201cIt\u2019s pleased I am to see ye home again safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd glad to be so, Mrs. Bug,\u201d he assured her. \u201cCan we be feeding a half-dozen guests for supper?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide for a moment, then narrowed in calculation.</p><p>\u201cSausage,\u201d she declared. \u201cAnd neeps. Here, wee Bobby, come and make yourself useful.\u201d Handing me the eggs, she seized Bobby, who had come out of the house after us, by the sleeve and towed him off toward the turnip patch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had the feeling of having been caught in some rapidly revolving apparatus like a merry-go-round, and took hold of Jamie\u2019s arm in order to steady myself.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Bobby Higgins is in love with Lizzie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019ll do him little good if he is,\u201d Jamie replied callously. Taking my hand on his arm as invitation, he took the eggs from me and set them on the ground, then pulled me in and kissed me again, more slowly, but no less thoroughly.</p><p>He let go with a deep sigh of content, and glanced at the new summer kitchen we had erected in his absence: a small framed structure consisting of coarse-woven canvas walls and a pine-branch roof, erected round a stone hearth and chimney\u2014but with a large table inside. Enticing scents of rising dough, fresh-baked bread, oatcakes, and cinnamon rolls wafted through the air from it.</p> <p>\u201cNow, about that quarter of an hour, Sassenach . . . I believe I could manage wi\u2019 a bit less, if necessary. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d I said firmly, though I did allow my hand to fondle him for a thoughtful instant. My face was burning from contact with his whiskers. \u201cAnd when we do have time, you can tell me what on earth you\u2019ve been doing to bring this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreaming,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept havin\u2019 terrible lewd dreams about ye, all the night long,\u201d he explained, twitching his breeks into better adjustment. \u201cEvery time I rolled over, I\u2019d lie on my c*ck and wake up. It was awful.\u201d</p> <p>I burst out laughing, and he affected to look injured, though I could see reluctant amusement behind it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can laugh, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYe havena got one to trouble ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and a great relief it is, too,\u201d I assured him. \u201cEr . . . what sort of lewd dreams?\u201d</p><p>I could see a deep blue gleam of speculation at the back of his eyes as he looked at me. He extended one finger, and very delicately ran it down the side of my neck, the slope of my breast where it disappeared into my bodice, and over the thin cloth covering my nipple\u2014which promptly popped up like a puffball mushroom in response to this attention.</p><p>\u201cThe sort that make me want to take ye straight into the forest, far enough that no one will hear when I lay ye on the ground, lift your skirts, and split ye like a ripe peach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, audibly.</p> <p>At this delicate moment, whoops of greeting came from the trailhead on the other side of the house.</p><p>\u201cDuty calls,\u201d I said, a trifle breathless.</p><p>Jamie drew a deep breath of his own, squared his shoulders, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I havena died of unrequited lust yet; I suppose I shallna do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you will,\u201d I said. \u201cBesides, didn\u2019t you tell me once that abstinence makes . . . er . . . things . . . grow firmer?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a bleak look.</p><p>\u201cIf it gets any firmer, I\u2019ll faint from a lack of blood to the heid. Dinna forget the eggs, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>It was late afternoon, but plenty of light left for the job, thank goodness. My surgery was positioned to take advantage of morning light for operations, though, and was dim in the afternoons, so I set up an impromptu theater of operation in the dooryard.</p> <p>This was an advantage, insofar as everyone wished to watch; Indians always regarded medical treatment\u2014and almost anything else\u2014as a community affair. They were particularly enthusiastic about operations, as these held a high degree of entertainment value. Everyone crowded eagerly around, commenting on my preparations, arguing with each other and talking to the patient, whom I had the greatest difficulty in discouraging from talking back.</p><p>Her name was Mouse, and I could only assume that she had been given it for some metaphysical reason, as it certainly wasn\u2019t suited either to appearance or personality. She was round-faced, unusually snub-nosed for a Cherokee, and if she wasn\u2019t precisely pretty, she had a force of character that is often more attractive than simple beauty.</p><p>It was certainly working on the males present; she was the only woman in the Indian party, the others consisting of her brother, Red Clay Wilson, and four friends who had come along, either to keep the Wilsons company, offer protection on the journey\u2014or to vie for Miss Mousie\u2019s attention, which seemed to me the most likely explanation of their presence.</p><p>Despite the Wilsons\u2019 Scottish name, none of the Cherokee spoke any English beyond a few basic words\u2014these including \u201cno,\u201d \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d and \u201cwhisky!\u201d Since the Cherokee equivalent of these terms was the extent of my own vocabulary, I was taking little part in the conversation.</p><p>We were at the moment waiting for whisky, in fact, as well as translators. A settler named Wolverhampton, from some nameless hollow to the east, had inadvertently amputated one and a half toes a week before, while splitting logs. Finding this state of things inconvenient, he had proceeded to try to remove the remaining half-digit himself with a froe.</p><p>Say what you will regarding general utility; a froe is not a precision instrument. It is, however, sharp.</p><p>Mr. Wolverhampton, a burly sort with an irascible temper, lived on his own, some seven miles from his nearest neighbor. By the time he had reached this neighbor\u2014on foot, or what remained of it\u2014and the neighbor had bundled him onto a mule for transport to Fraser\u2019s Ridge, nearly twenty-four hours had passed, and the partial foot had assumed the dimensions and appearance of a mangled raccoon.</p><p>The requirements of the cleanup surgery, the multiple subsequent debridements to control the infection, and the fact that Mr. Wolverhampton refused to surrender the bottle, had quite exhausted my usual surgical supply. As I needed a keg of the raw spirit for my ether-making in any case, Jamie and Ian had gone to fetch more from the whisky spring, which was a good mile from the house. I hoped they would return while there was still enough light to see what I was doing.</p><p>I interrupted Miss Mousie\u2019s loud remonstrance with one of the gentlemen, who was evidently teasing her, and indicated by means of sign language that she should open her mouth for me. She did, but went on expostulating by means of rather explicit hand signals, which seemed to be indicating various acts she expected the gentleman in question to perform upon himself, judging from his flushed countenance, and the way his companions were falling about with hilarity.</p><p>The side of her face was puffed and obviously tender. She didn\u2019t wince or shy away, though, even when I turned her face farther toward the light for a better view.</p><p>\u201cToothache, forsooth!\u201d I said, involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cOoth?\u201d Miss Mouse said, cocking an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d I explained, pointing at her cheek. \u201cUyoi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d she agreed. There followed a voluble exposition\u2014interrupted only by my inserting my fingers into her mouth periodically\u2014which I took to be an explanation of what had happened to her.</p><p>Blunt trauma, by the look of it. One tooth, a lower canine, had been knocked completely out, and the neighboring bicuspid was so badly broken I would have to extract it. The next to that could be saved, I thought. The inside of her mouth was badly lacerated by the sharp edges, but the gum was not infected. That was heartening.</p><p>Bobby Higgins came down from the stable, drawn by the chatter, and was promptly sent back to bring me a file. Miss Mousie grinned lopsidedly at him when he brought it, and he bowed extravagantly to her, making all of them laugh.</p><p>\u201cThese folk are Cherokee, are they, mum?\u201d He smiled at Red Clay, and made a hand sign, which seemed to amuse the Indians, though they returned it. \u201cI\u2019ve not met any Cherokee before. It\u2019s mostly other tribes near his Lordship\u2019s place in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>I was pleased to see that he was familiar with Indians, and easy in his manner toward them. Hiram Crombie, who appeared at this point, was not.</p><p>He stopped dead at the edge of the clearing, seeing the assemblage. I waved cheerily at him, and\u2014with evident reluctance\u2014he advanced.</p><p>Roger had told me Duncan\u2019s description of Hiram as \u201cthat wee sour-drap.\u201d It was apt. He was small and stringy, with thin grizzled hair that he wore strained back in a plait so tight that I thought he must find it difficult to blink. His face deeply lined by the rigors of a fisherman\u2019s life, he looked about sixty, but was likely much younger\u2014and his mouth was habitually downturned, in the expression of one who has sucked not merely a lemon, but a rotten lemon.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said, with a wary eye on the Indians. \u201cI had heard he was back.\u201d He had a hatchet in his belt, and kept a tight grip on it with one hand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back directly. You\u2019ve met Mr. Higgins, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Evidently he had, and had been unfavorably impressed by the experience. His eyes fixed on Bobby\u2019s brand, he made the smallest possible nod of acknowledgment. Nothing daunted, I waved a hand round at the Indians, who were all examining Hiram with much more interest than he showed in them. \u201cMay I introduce Miss Wilson, her brother Mr. Wilson, and . . . er . . . their friends?\u201d</p><p>Hiram stiffened further, if such a thing was possible.</p><p>\u201cWilson?\u201d he said, in an unfriendly voice.</p><p>\u201cWilson,\u201d agreed Miss Mouse cheerily.</p><p>\u201cThat is my wife\u2019s family name,\u201d he said, in a tone that made it clear he considered the use of it by Indians to be grossly outrageous.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cHow nice. Do you think they might be your wife\u2019s relatives, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>His eyes bulged slightly at that, and I heard a strangled gurgle from Bobby.</p><p>\u201cWell, they plainly got the name from a Scottish father or grandfather,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cPerhaps . . .\u201d</p><p>Hiram\u2019s face was working like a nutcracker, emotions from fury to dismay passing in swift succession over it. His right hand curled up, forefinger and little finger protruding in the horns, the sign against evil.</p><p>\u201cGreat-Uncle Ephraim,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJesus save us.\u201d And without further word, he turned on his heel and tottered off.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye!\u201d called Miss Mousie in English, waving. He cast a single, haunted glance over his shoulder at her, then fled as though pursued by demons.</p><p>THE WHISKY FINALLY arrived, and, a fair amount of it passed out to patient and spectators alike, the operation at last commenced.</p><p>The file was normally used on horses\u2019 teeth, and thus a little larger than I would have liked, but worked reasonably well. Miss Mouse was inclined to be loud about the discomfort involved, but her complaints grew less with her increasing intake of whisky. By the time I had to draw her broken tooth, I thought, she wouldn\u2019t feel a thing.</p><p>Bobby, meanwhile, was entertaining Jamie and Ian with imitations of Hiram Crombie\u2019s response to the discovery that he might possibly share some family connection with the Wilsons. Ian, between bursts of laughter, translated the matter for the Indians, who all rolled on the grass in paroxysms of mirth.</p><p>\u201cDo they have an Ephraim Wilson in their family tree?\u201d I asked, taking a firm grip of Miss Mousie\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not sure of the \u2018Ephraim,\u2019 but aye, they do.\u201d Jamie grinned broadly. \u201cTheir grandsire was a Scottish wanderer. Stayed long enough to get their grandmother wi\u2019 child, then fell off a cliff and was buried by a rockslide. She marrit again, of course, but liked the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what it was made Great-Uncle Ephraim leave Scotland?\u201d Ian sat up, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe proximity of people like Hiram, I expect,\u201d I said, squinting to see what I was doing. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d I realized suddenly that everyone had quit talking and laughing, their attention focused on something across the clearing.</p><p>This something was the arrival of another Indian, carrying something in a bundle over his shoulder.</p><p>THE INDIAN WAS A gentleman named Sequoyah, somewhat older than the young Wilsons and their friends. He nodded soberly to Jamie, and swinging the bundle off his shoulder, laid it on the ground at Jamie\u2019s feet, saying something in Cherokee.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face changed, the lingering traces of amusement vanishing, replaced by interest\u2014and wariness. He knelt, and carefully turning back the ragged canvas, revealed a jumble of weathered bones, a hollow-eyed skull staring up from the midst of them.</p><p>\u201cWho in bloody hell is that?\u201d I had stopped work, and with everyone else, including Miss Mouse, stood staring down at this latest arrival.</p><p>\u201cHe says it\u2019s the auld man who owned the homestead MacDonald told of\u2014the one that burned inside the Treaty Line.\u201d Jamie reached down and picked up the skull, turning it gently in his hands.</p><p>He heard my small intake of breath, for he glanced at me, then turned the skull over, holding it for me to see. Most of the teeth were missing, and had been missing long enough that the jawbone had closed over the empty sockets. But the two molars remaining showed nothing but cracks and stains\u2014no gleam of silver filling, no empty space where such fillings might have been.</p><p>I let my breath out slowly, not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him? And why is he here?\u201d</p><p>Jamie knelt and laid the skull gently back in the canvas, then turned some of the bones over, examining them. He looked up, and with a small motion of the head, invited me to join him.</p><p>The bones showed no sign of having been burned, but several of them did show signs of having been gnawed by animals. One or two of the long bones had been cracked and split, no doubt to get at the marrow, and many of the smaller bones of hands and feet were missing. All of them had the gray, fragile look of bones that had lain outside for some time.</p><p>Ian had relayed my question to Sequoyah, who squatted down next to Jamie, explaining as he jabbed a finger here and there amongst the bones.</p><p>\u201cHe says,\u201d Ian translated, frowning, \u201cthat he knew the man a long time. They werena friends, exactly, but now and again, when he was near the man\u2019s cabin, he would stop, and the man would share his food. So he would bring things, too, when he came\u2014a hare for the pot, a bit o\u2019 salt.\u201d</p><p>One day, a few months back, he had found the old man\u2019s body in the wood, lying under a tree, some distance from his house.</p><p>\u201cNo one kilt him, he says,\u201d Ian said, frowning in concentration at the rapid stream of words. \u201cHe just . . . died. He thinks the man was hunting\u2014he had a knife on him, and his gun beside him\u2014when the spirit left him, and he just fell down.\u201d He echoed Sequoyah\u2019s shrug.</p><p>Seeing no reason to do anything with the body, Sequoyah had left it there, and left the knife with it, in case the spirit should require it, wherever it had gone; he did not know where the spirits of white men went, or whether they hunted there. He pointed\u2014there was an old knife, the blade almost rusted away, under the bones.</p><p>He had taken the gun, which seemed too good to leave, and as it was on his way, had stopped at the cabin. The old man had owned very little, and what he had was mostly worthless. Sequoyah had taken an iron pot, a kettle, and a jar of cornmeal, which he had carried back to his village.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no from Anidonau Nuya, is he?\u201d Jamie asked, then repeated the question in Cherokee. Sequoyah shook his head, the small ornaments braided into his hair making a tiny chiming sound.</p><p>He was from a village some miles west of Anidonau Nuya\u2014Standing Stone. Bird-who-sings had sent word to the nearby towns, in the wake of Jamie\u2019s visit, asking if there was anyone who knew of the old man and his fate. Hearing Sequoyah\u2019s account, Bird had sent him to collect what was left of the old man, and to bring the remains to Jamie, in proof that no one had killed him.</p><p>Ian asked a question, in which I caught the Cherokee word for \u201cfire.\u201d Sequoyah shook his head again, and replied with a stream of words.</p><p>He had not burned the cabin\u2014why should he do such a thing? He thought no one had done so. After collecting the old man\u2019s bones\u2014his face showed his distaste for the procedure\u2014he had gone to look at the cabin again. True, it was burned\u2014but it was clear to him that a tree nearby had been struck by lightning, and had set fire to a good bit of the forest near it. The cabin was only half-burned.</p><p>He rose to his feet with an air of finality.</p><p>\u201cWill he stay for supper?\u201d I asked, seeing that he seemed about to depart.</p><p>Jamie conveyed the invitation, but Sequoyah shook his head. He had done what was required of him; now he had other business. He nodded to the other Indians, then turned to go.</p><p>Something struck him, though, and he stopped, turning back.</p><p>\u201cTsisqua says,\u201d he said, in the careful way of one who has memorized a speech in an unfamiliar tongue, \u201cyou re-mem-ber de guns.\u201d He nodded then decisively, and went.</p><p>THE GRAVE WAS MARKED with a small cairn of stones and a small wooden cross made of pine twigs. Sequoyah hadn\u2019t known his acquaintance\u2019s name, and we had no idea of his age, nor yet the dates of birth and death. We hadn\u2019t known if he was Christian, either, but the cross seemed a good idea.</p><p>It was a very small burial service, consisting of myself, Jamie, Ian, Bree and Roger, Lizzie and her father, the Bugs, and Bobby Higgins\u2014who I was fairly sure was in attendance only because Lizzie was. Her father seemed to think so, too, judging from the occasional suspicious glances he cast at Bobby.</p><p>Roger read a brief psalm over the grave, then paused. He cleared his throat and said simply, \u201cLord, we commend to Thy care the soul of this our brother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEphraim,\u201d murmured Brianna, eyes cast modestly down.</p><p>A subterranean sense of laughter moved through the crowd, though no one actually laughed. Roger gave Bree a dirty look, but I saw the corner of his mouth twitching, as well.</p><p>\u201c. . . of our brother, whose name Thou knowest,\u201d Roger concluded with dignity, and closed the Book of Psalms he had borrowed from Hiram Crombie\u2014who had declined an invitation to attend the funeral.</p><p>The light had gone by the time Sequoyah had finished his revelations the night before, and I was obliged to put off Miss Mouse\u2019s dental work to the morning. Stewed to the gills, she made no objection, and was helpfully supported off to a bed on the kitchen floor by Bobby Higgins\u2014who might or might not be in love with Lizzie, but who seemed nonetheless most appreciative of Miss Mouse\u2019s charms.</p><p>Once finished with the tooth-drawing, I had suggested that she and her friends stay for a bit, but they, like Sequoyah, had business elsewhere, and with many thanks and small gifts, had departed by mid-afternoon, smelling strongly of whisky, and leaving us to dispose of the mortal remains of the late Ephraim.</p><p>Everyone went back down the hill after the service, but Jamie and I loitered behind, seeking an opportunity to be alone for a few minutes. The house had been full of Indians the night before, with much talk and storytelling by the fire, and by the time we had finally gone to bed, we had simply curled up in each other\u2019s arms and fallen asleep, barely exchanging the brief civility of a \u201cgood night.\u201d</p><p>The graveyard was sited on a small rise, some distance from the house, and was a pretty, peaceful place. Surrounded by pines whose golden needles blanketed the earth, and whose murmuring branches provided a constant soft susurrus, it seemed a comforting spot.</p><p>\u201cPoor old creature,\u201d I said, putting a final pebble on Ephraim\u2019s cairn. \u201cHow do you suppose he ended up in such a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows.\u201d Jamie shook his head. \u201cThere are always hermits, men who mislike the society of their fellows. Perhaps he was one o\u2019 those. Or perhaps some misfortune drove him into the wilderness, and he . . . stayed.\u201d He shrugged a little, and gave me a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wonder how any of us came to be where we are, Sassenach. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut after a time, there didn\u2019t seem to be any possibility of an answer, so I stopped.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, diverted.</p><p>\u201cHave ye, then?\u201d He put out a hand and tucked back a lock of windblown hair. \u201cPerhaps I shouldna ask it, then, but I will. Do ye mind, Sassenach? That ye are here, I mean. Do ye ever wish ye were\u2014back?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, not ever.\u201d</p><p>And that was true. But I woke sometimes in the dead of night, thinking, Is now the dream? Would I wake again to the thick warm smell of central heating and Frank\u2019s Old Spice? And when I fell asleep again to the scent of woodsmoke and the musk of Jamie\u2019s skin, would feel a faint, surprised regret.</p><p>If he saw the thought on my face, he gave no sign of it, but bent and kissed me gently on the forehead. He took my arm, and we walked a little way into the wood, away from the house and its clearing below.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I smell the pines,\u201d he said, taking a deep, slow breath of the pungent air. \u201cAnd I think for an instant I am in Scotland. But then I come to myself and see; there is no kindly bracken here, nor great barren mountains\u2014not the wildness that I kent, but only wilderness that I do not.\u201d</p><p>I thought I heard nostalgia in his voice, but not sorrow. He\u2019d asked, though; so would I.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you ever wish to be . . . back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, surprising me\u2014and then laughed at the look on my face. \u201cBut not enough not to wish more to be here, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at the tiny graveyard, with its small collection of cairns and crosses, with here and there a larger boulder marking a particular grave.</p><p>\u201cDid ye ken, Sassenach, that some folk believe the last person to lie in a graveyard becomes its guardian? He must stand on guard until the next person dies and comes to take his place\u2014only then can he rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose our mysterious Ephraim might be rather surprised to find himself in such a position, when here he\u2019d lain down under a tree all alone,\u201d I said, smiling a little. \u201cBut I do wonder: what is the guardian of a graveyard guarding\u2014and from whom?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . vandals, maybe; desecraters. Or charmers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmers?\u201d I was surprised at that; I\u2019d thought the word \u201ccharmer\u201d synonymous with \u201chealer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are charms that call for bones, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the ashes of a burnt body. Or soil from a grave.\u201d He spoke lightly enough, but with no sense of jesting. \u201cAye, even the dead may need defending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who better to do it than a resident ghost?\u201d I said. \u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>We climbed up through a stand of quivering aspen, whose light dappled us with green and silver, and I paused to scrape a blob of the crimson sap from a paper-white trunk. How odd, I thought, wondering why the sight of it gave me pause\u2014and then remembered, and turned sharply to look again at the graveyard.</p><p>Not a memory, but a dream\u2014or a vision. A man, battered and broken, rising to his feet amid a stand of aspen, rising for what he knew was the last time, his last fight, baring shattered teeth stained with blood that was the color of the aspens\u2019 sap. His face was painted black for death\u2014and I knew that there were silver fillings in his teeth.</p><p>But the granite boulder stood silent and peaceful, drifted all about with yellow pine needles, marking the rest of the man who had once called himself Otter-Tooth.</p><p>The moment passed, and vanished. We walked out of the aspens, and into another clearing, this one higher than the rise the graveyard stood on.</p><p>I was surprised to see that someone had been cutting timber here, and clearing the ground. A sizable stack of felled logs lay to one side, and nearby lay a tangle of uprooted stumps, though several more, still rooted in the ground, poked through the heavy growth of wood sorrel and bluet.</p><p>\u201cLook, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie turned me with a hand on my elbow.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, my.\u201d</p><p>The ground rose high enough here that we could look out over a stunning vista. The trees fell away below us, and we could see beyond our mountain, and beyond the next, and the next, into a blue distance, hazed with the breath of the mountains, clouds rising from their hollows.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like it?\u201d The note of proprietorial pride in his voice was palpable.</p><p>\u201cOf course I like it. What\u2014?\u201d I turned, gesturing at the logs, the stumps.</p><p>\u201cThe next house will stand here, Sassenach,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cThe next house? What, are we building another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I dinna ken will it be us, or maybe our children\u2014or grandchildren,\u201d he added, mouth curling a little. \u201cBut I thought, should anything happen\u2014and I dinna think anything will, mind, but if it should\u2014well, I should be happier to have made a start. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, trying to make sense of this. \u201cShould anything happen,\u201d I said slowly, and turned to look to the east, where the shape of our house was just visible among the trees, its chimney smoke a white plume among the soft green of the chestnuts and firs. \u201cShould it really . . . burn down, you mean.\u201d Just putting the idea into words made my stomach curl up into a ball.</p><p>Then I looked at him again, and saw that the notion scared him, too. But Jamie-like, he had simply set about to take what action he could, against the day of disaster.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like it?\u201d he repeated, blue eyes intent. \u201cThe site, I mean. If not, I can choose another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said, feeling tears prickle at the backs of my eyes. \u201cJust beautiful, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>HOT AFTER THE CLIMB, we sat down in the shade of a giant hemlock, to admire our future view. And, with the silence broken concerning the dire possibility of the future, found we could discuss it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the idea of us dying,\u201d I said. \u201cOr not entirely. It\u2019s that \u2018no surviving children\u2019 that gives me the whim-whams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I take your point, Sassenach. Though I\u2019m no in favor of us dying, either, and I mean to see we don\u2019t,\u201d he assured me. \u201cThink, though. It might not mean they\u2019re dead. They might only . . . go.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to accept that supposition without panic.</p><p>\u201cGo. Go back, you mean. Roger and Bree\u2014and Jemmy, I suppose. We\u2019re assuming he can\u2014can travel through the stones.\u201d</p><p>He nodded soberly, arms clasped about his knees.</p><p>\u201cAfter what he did to that opal? Aye, I think we must assume he can.\u201d I nodded, recalling what he\u2019d done to the opal: held it, complaining of it growing hot in his hand\u2014until it exploded, shattering into hundreds of needle-sharp fragments. Yes, I thought we must assume he could time-travel, too. But what if Brianna had another child? It was plain to me that she and Roger wanted another\u2014or at least that Roger did, and she was willing.</p><p>The thought of losing them was acutely painful, but I supposed the possibility had to be faced.</p><p>\u201cWhich leaves a choice, I suppose,\u201d I said, trying to be brave and objective. \u201cIf we\u2019re dead, they\u2019d go, because without us, they\u2019ve no real reason to be here. But if we\u2019re not dead\u2014will they go anyway? Will we send them away, I mean? Because of the war. It won\u2019t be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. His head was bent, stray auburn hairs lifting from his crown, from the cowlicks he had bequeathed both to Bree and to Jemmy.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he said at last, and lifted his head, looking out into the distance of land and sky. \u201cNo one does, Sassenach. We must just meet what comes as we can.\u201d</p><p>He turned and laid his hand over mine, with a smile that had as much of pain in it as joy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve ghosts enough between us, Sassenach. If the evils of the past canna hinder us\u2014neither then shall any fears of the future. We must just put things behind us and get on. Aye?\u201d</p><p>I laid a light hand on his chest, not in invitation, but only because I wanted the feel of him. His skin was cool from sweating, but he had helped dig the grave; the heat of his labor glowed in the muscle beneath.</p><p>\u201cYou were one of my ghosts,\u201d I said. \u201cFor a long time. And for a long time, I tried to put you behind me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid ye, then?\u201d His own hand came to rest lightly on my back, moving unconsciously. I knew that touch\u2014the need of touching only to reassure oneself that the other was actually there, present in flesh.</p><p>\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t live, looking back\u2014couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d My throat was thick with the memory of it.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said softly, his hand rising to touch my hair. \u201cBut ye had the bairn\u2014ye had a husband. It wasna right to turn your back on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t right to turn my back on you.\u201d I blinked, but tears were leaking from the corners of my eyes. He drew my head close, put out his tongue, and delicately licked my face, which surprised me so much that I laughed in the midst of a sob, and nearly choked.</p> <p>\u201cI do love thee, as meat loves salt,\u201d he quoted, and laughed, too, very softly. \u201cDinna weep, Sassenach. Ye\u2019re here; so am I. There\u2019s naught that matters, aside from that.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my forehead against his cheek, and put my arms around him. My hands rested flat on the planes of his back, and I stroked him from the blade of his shoulder to the tapering small of his back, lightly, always lightly, tracing the whole of him, the shape of him, and not the scars that reamed his skin.</p><p>He held me close, and sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken we\u2019ve been wed this time nearly twice as long as the last?\u201d</p><p>I drew back and frowned dubiously at him, accepting the distraction.</p> <p>\u201cWere we not married in between?\u201d</p><p>That took him by surprise; he frowned, too, and ran a finger slowly down the sunburnt bridge of his nose in thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a question for a priest, to be sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI should think we were\u2014but if so, are we not both bigamists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere, not are,\u201d I corrected, feeling slightly uneasy. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t, really. Father Anselme said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnselme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Anselme\u2014a Franciscan priest at the Abbey of St. Anne. But perhaps you wouldn\u2019t recall him; you were very ill at the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I recall him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe would come and sit wi\u2019 me at night, when I couldna sleep.\u201d He smiled, a little lopsided; that time wasn\u2019t something he wished to remember. \u201cHe liked ye a great deal, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what about you?\u201d I asked, wanting to distract him from the memory of St. Anne. \u201cDidn\u2019t you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I liked ye fine then,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI maybe like ye even more now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do you, indeed.\u201d I sat up a little straighter, preening. \u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to one side, eyes narrowing a bit in appraisal.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye fart less in your sleep,\u201d he began judiciously, then ducked, laughing, as a pinecone whizzed past his left ear. I seized a chunk of wood, but before I could bat him over the head with it, he lunged and caught me by the arms. He shoved me flat in the grass and collapsed on top of me, pinning me effortlessly.</p><p>\u201cGet off, you oaf! I do not fart in my sleep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, how would ye ken that, Sassenach? Ye sleep so sound, ye wouldna wake, even to the sound of your own snoring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you want to talk about snoring, do you? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re proud as Lucifer,\u201d he said, interrupting. He was still smiling, but the words were more serious. \u201cAnd ye\u2019re brave. Ye were always bolder than was safe; now ye\u2019re fierce as a wee badger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m arrogant and ferocious. This does not sound like much of a catalog of womanly virtues,\u201d I said, puffing a bit as I strained to wriggle out from under him.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye\u2019re kind, too,\u201d he said, considering. \u201cVerra kind. Though ye are inclined to do it on your own terms. Not that that\u2019s bad, mind,\u201d he added, neatly recapturing the arm I had extricated. He pinned my wrist over my head.</p><p>\u201cWomanly,\u201d he murmured, brows knotted in concentration. \u201cWomanly virtues . . .\u201d His free hand crept between us and fastened on my breast.</p><p>\u201cBesides that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re verra clean,\u201d he said approvingly. He let go my wrist and ruffled a hand through my hair\u2014which was indeed clean, smelling of sunflower and marigolds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any woman wash herself sae much as you do\u2014save Brianna, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re no much of a cook,\u201d he went on, squinting thoughtfully. \u201cThough ye\u2019ve never poisoned anyone, save on purpose. And I will say ye sew a neat seam\u2014though ye like it much better if it\u2019s through someone\u2019s flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me some more virtues,\u201d he suggested. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve missed one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph! Gentleness, patience . . .\u201d I floundered.</p><p>\u201cGentle? Christ.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYe\u2019re the most ruthless, bloodthirsty\u2014\u201d</p><p>I darted my head upward, and nearly succeeded in biting him in the throat. He jerked back, laughing.</p><p>\u201cNo, ye\u2019re no verra patient, either.\u201d</p><p>I gave up struggling for the moment and collapsed flat on my back, tousled hair spread out on the grass.</p><p>\u201cSo what is my most endearing trait?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYe think I\u2019m funny,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI . . . do . . . not . . .\u201d I grunted, struggling madly. He merely lay on top of me, tranquilly oblivious to my pokings and thumpings, until I exhausted myself and lay gasping underneath him.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cye like it verra much when I take ye to bed. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d I wanted to contradict him, but honesty forbade. Besides, he bloody well knew I did.</p><p>\u201cYou are squashing me,\u201d I said with dignity. \u201cKindly get off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he repeated, not moving.</p><p>\u201cYes! All right! Yes! Will you bloody get off?!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get off, but bent his head and kissed me. I was close-lipped, determined not to give in, but he was determined, too, and if one came right down to it . . . the skin of his face was warm, the plush of his beard stubble softly scratchy, and his wide sweet mouth . . . My legs were open in abandon and he was solid between them, bare chest smelling of musk and sweat and sawdust caught in the wiry auburn hair. . . . I was still hot with struggling, but the grass was damp and cool around us. . . . Well, all right; another minute, and he could have me right there, if he cared to.</p><p>He felt me yield, and sighed, letting his own body slacken; he no longer held me prisoner, but simply held me. He lifted his head then, and cupped my face with one hand.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want to know what it is, really?\u201d he asked, and I could see from the dark blue of his eyes that he meant it. I nodded, mute.</p><p>\u201cAbove all creatures on this earth,\u201d he whispered, \u201cyou are faithful.\u201d</p><p>I thought of saying something about St. Bernard dogs, but there was such tenderness in his face that I said nothing, instead merely staring up at him, blinking against the green light that filtered through the needles overhead.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said at last, with a deep sigh of my own, \u201cso are you. Quite a good thing, really. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>WE HAVE IGNITION</p><p>MRS. BUG HAD MADE chicken fricassee for supper, but that wasn\u2019t sufficient to account for the air of suppressed excitement that Bree and Roger brought with them when they came in. They were both smiling, her cheeks were flushed, and his eyes as bright as hers.</p><p>So when Roger announced that they had great news, it was perhaps only reasonable that Mrs. Bug should leap directly to the obvious conclusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wi\u2019 child again!\u201d she cried, dropping a spoon in her excitement. She clapped her hands together, inflating like a birthday balloon. \u201cOh, the joy of it! And about time, too,\u201d she added, letting go her hands to wag a finger at Roger. \u201cAnd here was me thinkin\u2019 as I should add a bit o\u2019 ginger and brimstone to your parritch, young man, so as to bring ye up to scratch! But ye kent your business weel enough in the end, I see. And you, a bhailach, what d\u2019ye think? A bonny wee brother for ye!\u201d</p><p>Jemmy, thus addressed, stared up at her, mouth open.</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d said Roger, flushing up.</p><p>\u201cOr, of course, it might be a wee sister, I suppose,\u201d Mrs. Bug admitted. \u201cBut good news, good news, either way. Here, a luaidh, have a sweetie on the strength of it, and the rest of us will drink to it!\u201d</p><p>Obviously bewildered, but strongly in favor of sweeties, Jem took the proffered molasses drop and stuck it promptly in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut he isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Bree began.</p><p>\u201cNank you, Missus Bug,\u201d Jem said hastily, putting a hand over his mouth lest his mother try to repossess this distinctly forbidden predinner treat on grounds of impoliteness.</p><p>\u201cOh, a wee sweetie will do him nay harm,\u201d Mrs. Bug assured her, picking up the fallen spoon and wiping it on her apron. \u201cCall Arch in, a muirninn, and we\u2019ll tell him your news. Blessed Bride save ye, lass, I thought ye\u2019d never get round to it! Here was all the ladies saying\u2019 as they didna ken whether ye\u2019d turned cold to your husband, or was it him maybe, lackin\u2019 the vital spark, but as it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as it is,\u201d said Roger, raising his voice in order to be heard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pregnant!\u201d said Bree, very loudly.</p><p>The succeeding silence echoed like a thunderclap.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jamie mildly. He picked up a serviette and sat down, tucking it into the neck of his shirt. \u201cWell, then. Shall we eat?\u201d He held out a hand to Jem, who scrambled up onto the bench beside him, still sucking fiercely on his molasses drop.</p><p>Mrs. Bug, momentarily turned to stone, revived with a marked \u201cHmpf!\u201d Massively affronted, she turned to the sideboard and slapped down a stack of pewter plates with a clatter.</p><p>Roger, still rather flushed, appeared to find the situation funny, judging from the twitching of his mouth. Brianna was incandescent, and breathing like a grampus.</p><p>\u201cSit down, darling,\u201d I said, in the tentative manner of one addressing a large explosive device. \u201cYou . . . um . . . had some news, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind!\u201d She stood still, glaring. \u201cNobody cares, since I\u2019m not pregnant. After all, what else could I possibly do that anybody would think was worthwhile?\u201d She shoved a violent hand through her hair, and encountering the ribbon tying it back, yanked this loose and flung it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNow, sweetheart . . .\u201d Roger began. I could have told him this was a mistake; Frasers in a fury tended to pay no attention to honeyed words, being instead inclined to go for the throat of the nearest party unwary enough to speak to them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018sweetheart\u2019 me!\u201d she snapped, turning on him. \u201cYou think so, too! You think everything I do is a waste of time if it isn\u2019t washing clothes or cooking dinner or mending your effing socks! And you blame me for not getting pregnant, too, you think it\u2019s my fault! Well, it\u2019s NOT, and you know it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t think that, I don\u2019t at all. Brianna, please. . . .\u201d He stretched out a hand to her, then thought better of the gesture and withdrew it, clearly feeling that she might take his hand off at the wrist.</p><p>\u201cLess EAT, Mummy!\u201d Jemmy piped up helpfully. A long string of molasses-tinged saliva flowed from the corner of his mouth and dripped down the front of his shirt. Seeing this, his mother turned on Mrs. Bug like a tiger.</p><p>\u201cNow see what you\u2019ve done, you interfering old busybody! That was his last clean shirt! And how dare you talk about our private lives with everybody in sight, what possible earthly business of yours is it, you beastly old gossiping\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seeing the futility of protest, Roger put his arms round her from behind, picked her up bodily off the floor, and carried her out the back door, this departure accented by incoherent protests from Bree and grunts of pain from Roger, as she kicked him repeatedly in the shins, with considerable force and accuracy.</p><p>I went to the door and closed it delicately, shutting off the sounds of further altercation in the yard.</p><p>\u201cShe gets that from you, you know,\u201d I said reproachfully, sitting down opposite Jamie. \u201cMrs. Bug, that smells wonderful. Do let\u2019s eat!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug dished the fricassee in huffy silence, but declined to join us at table, instead putting on her cloak and stamping out the front door, leaving us to deal with the clearing-up. An excellent bargain, if you asked me.</p><p>We ate in blissful peace, the quiet broken only by the clink of spoons on pewter and the occasional question from Jemmy as to why molasses was sticky, how did milk get into the cow, and when would he get his little brother?</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to say to Mrs. Bug?\u201d I asked, in the brief hiatus between queries.</p><p>\u201cWhy ought ye to say anything, Sassenach? It wasna you calling her names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But I\u2019d be willing to bet that Brianna isn\u2019t going to apologize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should she?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe was provoked, after all. And I canna think Mrs. Bug has lived sae long without being called a gossiping busybody before. She\u2019ll wear herself out, telling Arch all about it, and tomorrow it will be fine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cPerhaps so. But Bree and Roger\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, dark blue eyes crinkling into triangles.</p><p>\u201cDinna feel as though every disaster is yours to fash yourself about, mo chridhe,\u201d he said. He reached across and patted my hand. \u201cRoger Mac and the lass must work it out between them\u2014and the lad did appear to have a decent grip on the situation.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I joined him, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it will be mine to fash about, if she\u2019s broken his leg,\u201d I remarked, getting up to fetch cream for the coffee. \u201cLikely he\u2019ll come crawling back to have it mended.\u201d</p><p>At this apropos moment, a knock sounded on the back door. Wondering why Roger would knock, I opened it, and stared in astonishment at the pale face of Thomas Christie.</p><p>HE WAS NOT ONLY PALE, but sweating, and had a bloodstained cloth wrapped round one hand.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna discommode ye, mistress,\u201d he said, holding himself stiffly. \u201cI\u2019ll just . . . wait upon your convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d I said, rather shortly. \u201cCome into the surgery while there\u2019s still some light.\u201d</p><p>I took care not to catch Jamie\u2019s eye directly, but I glanced at him as I bent to push in the bench. He was leaning forward to put a saucer over my coffee, his eyes on Tom Christie with an air of thoughtful speculation that I had last seen in a bobcat watching a flight of ducks overhead. Not urgent, but definitely taking notice.</p><p>Christie was taking no notice of anything beyond his injured hand, reasonably enough. My surgery\u2019s windows were oriented to east and south, to take best advantage of morning light, but even near sunset, the room held a soft radiance\u2014the setting sun\u2019s reflection from the shimmering leaves of the chestnut grove. Everything in the room was suffused with golden light, save Tom Christie\u2019s face, which was noticeably green.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I said, shoving a stool hastily behind him. His knees buckled as he lowered himself; he landed harder than he had intended, jarring his hand, and let out a small exclamation of pain.</p><p>I put a thumb on the big vein at the wrist, to help slow the bleeding, and unwound the cloth. Given his aspect, I was expecting a severed finger or two, and was surprised to find a simple gash in the meat at the base of the thumb, angled down and running onto the wrist. It was deep enough to gape, and still bleeding freely, but no major vessels had been cut, and he had by great good fortune only nicked the thumb tendon; I could mend that with a stitch or two.</p><p>I looked up to tell him this, only to see his eyes roll back in his head.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d I shouted, dropping the hand and grabbing for his shoulders as he toppled backward.</p><p>A crash of overturned bench and the thump of running feet answered my call, and Jamie burst into the room in a heartbeat. Seeing me dragged off my feet by Christie\u2019s weight, he seized the man by the scruff of the neck and shoved him forward like a rag doll, pushing Christie\u2019s head down between his legs.</p><p>\u201cIs he desperate bad?\u201d Jamie asked, squinting at Christie\u2019s injured hand, which was resting on the floor, oozing blood. \u201cShall I lay him on the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I had a hand under Christie\u2019s jaw, feeling for his pulse. \u201cHe\u2019s not hurt badly; he\u2019s only fainted. Yes, see, he\u2019s coming round. Keep your head down for a bit, now, you\u2019ll be quite all right in a moment.\u201d I addressed this latter remark to Christie, who was breathing like a steam engine, but had steadied a little.</p><p>Jamie removed his hand from Christie\u2019s neck, and wiped it on his kilt with an expression of mild distaste. Christie had broken out in a profuse cold sweat; I could feel my own hand slimy with it, but picked up the fallen cloth and wiped my hand more tactfully with that.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to lie down?\u201d I asked, bending to look at Christie\u2019s face. He was still a ghastly color, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, mistress. I\u2019m quite all right. Only taken queer for a moment.\u201d He spoke hoarsely, but firmly enough, so I contented myself with pressing the cloth hard against the wound to stanch the dripping blood.</p><p>Jemmy was loitering in the doorway, wide-eyed, but showing no particular alarm; blood was nothing new to him.</p><p>\u201cShall I fetch ye a dram, Tom?\u201d Jamie said, eyeing the patient warily. \u201cI ken ye dinna hold wi\u2019 strong drink, but there\u2019s a time for it, surely?\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s mouth worked a little, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI . . . no. Perhaps . . . a little wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a little wine for thy stomach\u2019s sake, eh? Aye, fine. Take heart, man, I\u2019ll fetch it.\u201d Jamie clapped him encouragingly on the shoulder, and went briskly off, taking Jemmy by the hand as he went out.</p><p>Christie\u2019s mouth tightened in a grimace. I had noticed before that like some Protestants, Tom Christie regarded the Bible as being a document addressed specifically to himself and confided to his personal care for prudent distribution to the masses. Thus, he quite disliked hearing Catholics\u2014i.e., Jamie\u2014quoting casually from it. I had also noticed that Jamie was aware of this, and took every opportunity to make such quotes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, as much to distract Christie as because I wished to know.</p><p>Christie broke off his glower at the empty doorway and glanced at his left hand\u2014then hastily away, going pale again.</p><p>\u201cAn accident,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI was cutting rushes; the knife slipped.\u201d His right hand flexed slightly as he said this, and I glanced at it.</p><p>\u201cNo bloody wonder!\u201d I said. \u201cHere, keep that up in the air.\u201d I lifted the injured left hand, tightly wrapped, above his head, let go of it, and reached for the other.</p><p>He had been suffering from a condition in the right hand called Dupuytren\u2019s contracture\u2014or at least it would be called that, once Baron Dupuytren got round to describing it in another sixty or seventy years. Caused by a thickening and shortening of the fibrous sheet that kept the hand\u2019s tendons in place when the fingers flexed, the result of it was to draw the ring finger in toward the palm of the hand. In advanced cases, the little finger and sometimes the middle finger as well were involved. Tom Christie\u2019s case had advanced quite a bit since I had last had the chance of a good look at his hand.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you?\u201d I demanded rhetorically, pulling gently on the clawed fingers. The middle finger could still be halfway unfolded; the ring and little fingers could barely be lifted away from the palm. \u201cI said it would get worse. No wonder the knife slipped\u2014I\u2019m surprised you could even hold it.\u201d</p><p>A slight flush appeared under the clipped salt-and-pepper beard, and he glanced away.</p><p>\u201cI could have taken care of it easily months ago,\u201d I said, turning the hand to look critically at the angle of contracture. \u201cIt would have been a very simple matter. Now it will be rather more complicated\u2014but I can still correct it, I think.\u201d</p><p>Had he been a less stolid man, I should have described him as wriggling with embarrassment. As it was, he merely twitched slightly, the flush deepening over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I do not desire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody care what you desire,\u201d I told him, putting the clawed hand back in his lap. \u201cIf you don\u2019t allow me to operate on that hand, it will be all but useless inside six months. You can barely write with it now, am I right?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine, deep gray and startled.</p><p>\u201cI can write,\u201d he said, but I could tell that the belligerence in his voice hid a deep uneasiness. Tom Christie was an educated man, a scholar, and the Ridge\u2019s schoolteacher. It was to him that many of the Ridge people went for help in the composition of letters or legal documents. He took great pride in this; I knew the threat of loss of this ability was the best lever I had\u2014and it was no idle threat.</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d I said, and widened my eyes at him to make my meaning clear. He swallowed uneasily, but before he could reply, Jamie reappeared, holding a jug of wine.</p><p>\u201cBest listen to her,\u201d he advised Christie, setting it on the counter. \u201cI ken what it\u2019s like to try to write wi\u2019 a stiff finger, aye?\u201d He held up his own right hand and flexed it, looking rueful. \u201cIf she could mend that wi\u2019 her wee knife, I\u2019d lay my hand on the block this instant.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s problem was almost the reverse of Christie\u2019s, though the effect was quite similar. The ring finger had been smashed so badly that the joints had frozen; it could not be bent. Consequently, the two fingers on either side had limited motion, as well, though the joint capsules were intact.</p><p>\u201cThe difference being that your hand isn\u2019t getting any worse,\u201d I told Jamie. \u201cHis is.\u201d</p><p>Christie made a small movement, pushing his right hand down between his thighs, as though to hide it.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said uncomfortably. \u201cIt can bide awhile, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least long enough to let my wife mend the other,\u201d Jamie observed, pouring out a cup of wine. \u201cHere\u2014can ye hold it, Tom, or shall I\u2014?\u201d He made a questioning gesture, holding the cup as though to feed it to Christie, who snatched his right hand out of the sheltering folds of his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d he snapped, and took the wine\u2014holding the cup between thumb and forefinger with an awkwardness that made him flush even more deeply. His left hand still hung in the air above his shoulder. He looked foolish, and obviously felt it.</p><p>Jamie poured another cup and handed it to me, ignoring Christie. I would have thought it natural tact on his part, were I not aware of the complicated history between the two men. There was always a small barbed edge in any dealings between Jamie and Tom Christie, though they managed to keep an outwardly cordial face on things.</p><p>With any other man, Jamie\u2019s display of his own injured hand would have been just what it seemed\u2014reassurance, and the offering of fellowship in infirmity. With Tom Christie, it might have been consciously meant as reassurance, but there was a threat implied, as well, though perhaps Jamie couldn\u2019t help that.</p><p>The simple fact was that people came to Jamie for help more often than they did to Christie. Jamie had widespread respect and admiration, despite his crippled hand. Christie was not a personally popular man; he might well lose what social position he had, if he lost his ability to write. And\u2014as I had bluntly noted\u2014Jamie\u2019s hand would not get worse.</p><p>Christie\u2019s eyes had narrowed a little over his cup. He hadn\u2019t missed the threat, whether intended or not. He wouldn\u2019t; Tom Christie was a suspicious man by nature, and inclined to see threat where it wasn\u2019t intended.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s settled a bit by now; let me take care of it.\u201d I took hold of his left hand, gently, and unwrapped it. The bleeding had stopped. I set the hand to soak in a bowl of water boiled with garlic, added a few drops of pure ethanol for additional disinfection, and set about gathering my kit.</p><p>It was beginning to grow dark, and I lit the alcohol lamp Brianna had made for me. By its bright, steady flame, I could see that Christie\u2019s face had lost its momentary flush of anger. He wasn\u2019t as pale as he had been, but looked uneasy as a vole at a convention of badgers, his eyes following my hands as I laid out my sutures, needles, and scissors, all clean and gleaming-sharp in the light.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t leave, but stayed leaning against the counter, sipping his own cup of wine\u2014presumably, in case Christie passed out again.</p><p>A fine trembling ran through Christie\u2019s hand and arm, braced as they were on the table. He was sweating again; I could smell it, acrid and bitter. It was the scent of that, half-forgotten, but immediately familiar, that finally made me realize the difficulty: it was fear. He was afraid of blood, perhaps; afraid of pain, certainly.</p><p>I kept my eyes fixed on my work, bending my head lower to keep him from seeing anything in my face. I should have seen it sooner; I would have, I thought, had he not been a man. His paleness, the fainting . . . not due to loss of blood, but to shock at seeing blood lost.</p><p>I stitched up men and boys routinely; mountain farming was rough work, and it was a rare week when I wasn\u2019t presented with ax wounds, hoe gouges, spud slashes, hog bites, scalp lacerations sustained while falling over something, or some other minor calamity requiring stitches. By and large, all my patients behaved with complete matter-of-factness, accepting my ministrations stoically, and going right back to work. But nearly all of the men were Highlanders, I realized, and many not only Highlanders but erstwhile soldiers.</p><p>Tom Christie was a townsman, from Edinburgh\u2014he had been imprisoned in Ardsmuir as a Jacobite supporter, but had never been a fighting man. He had been a commissary officer. In fact, I realized with surprise, he had likely never even seen a real military battle, let alone engaged in the daily physical conflict with nature that Highland farming entailed.</p><p>I became aware of Jamie, still standing in the shadows, sipping wine and watching with a faintly ironic dispassion. I glanced up quickly at him; his expression didn\u2019t alter, though he met my eyes and nodded, very slightly.</p><p>Tom Christie\u2019s lip was fixed between his teeth; I could hear the faint whistle of his breath. He couldn\u2019t see Jamie, but knew he was there; the stiffness of his back said as much. He might be afraid, Tom Christie, but he had some courage to him.</p><p>It would have hurt him less, could he have relaxed the clenched muscles of arm and hand. Under the circumstances, though, I could hardly suggest as much. I could have insisted that Jamie leave, but I was nearly finished. With a sigh of mingled exasperation and puzzlement, I clipped the final knot and laid down the scissors.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d I said, swiping the last of the coneflower ointment across the wound and reaching for a clean linen bandage. \u201cKeep it clean. I\u2019ll make up some fresh ointment for you; send Malva for it. Then come back in a week and I\u2019ll take the stitches out.\u201d I hesitated, glancing at Jamie. I felt some reluctance to use his presence as blackmail, but it was for Christie\u2019s own good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your right hand, then, too, shall I?\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>He was still sweating, though the color in his face had begun to come back. He glanced at me, and then, involuntarily, at Jamie.</p><p>Jamie smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then, Tom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s naught to trouble ye. No but a wee nick. I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>The words were spoken casually, but they might as well have been written in flaming letters a foot high. I\u2019ve had worse.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face was still in shadow, but his eyes were clearly visible, slanted with his smile.</p><p>Tom Christie had not relaxed his rigid posture. He matched Jamie\u2019s stare, closing his gnarled right hand over the bandaged left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cWell.\u201d He was breathing deeply. \u201cI will, then.\u201d He rose abruptly, knocking the stool aside, and headed for the door, a little off-balance, like a man the worse for strong drink.</p><p>At the door, he paused, fumbling for the knob. Finding it, he drew himself up and turned back, looking for Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d he said, breathing so hard that he stumbled over the words, \u201cat least it will be an honorable scar. Won\u2019t it, Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>Jamie straightened up abruptly, but Christie was already out, stamping down the corridor with a step heavy enough to rattle the pewter plates on the kitchen shelf.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, ye wee pissant!\u201d he said, in a tone somewhere between anger and astonishment. His left hand clenched involuntarily into a fist, and I thought it a good thing that Christie had made such a rapid exit.</p><p>I was rather unsure as to exactly what had happened\u2014or been happening\u2014but relieved that Christie was gone. I\u2019d felt like a handful of grain, trapped between two grindstones, both of them trying to grind each other\u2019s faces, with no heed for the hapless corn in between.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Tom Christie call you Mac Dubh,\u201d I observed cautiously, turning to tidy away my surgical leavings. Christie was not, of course, a Gaelic-speaker, but I had never heard him use even the Gaelic nickname that the other Ardsmuir men still called Jamie by. Christie always called Jamie \u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d or simply \u201cFraser,\u201d in moments of what passed for cordiality.</p><p>Jamie made a derisive Scottish noise, then picked up Christie\u2019s half-full cup and thriftily drained it.</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldna\u2014frigging Sassenach.\u201d Then he caught a glimpse of my face, and gave me a lopsided smile. \u201cI didna mean you, Sassenach.\u201d</p> <p>I knew he didn\u2019t mean me; the word was spoken with a completely different\u2014and quite shocking\u2014intonation; a bitterness that reminded me that \u201cSassenach\u201d was by no means a friendly term in normal usage.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call him that?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cAnd just what did he mean by that \u2018honorable scar\u2019 crack?\u201d</p><p>He looked down, and didn\u2019t answer for a moment, though the stiffened fingers of his right hand drummed soundlessly against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cTom Christie\u2019s a solid man,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut by God, he is a stiff-necked wee son of a bitch!\u201d He looked up then, and smiled at me, a little ruefully.</p><p>\u201cEight years he lived in a cell wi\u2019 forty men who had the Gaelic\u2014and he wouldna lower himself to let a word of such a barbarous tongue pass his lips! Christ, no. He\u2019d speak in English, no matter who it was he spoke to, and if it was a man who had no English, why, then, he\u2019d just stand there, dumb as a stone, \u2019til someone came along to interpret for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d He glanced toward the window, as though to catch a glimpse of Christie, but the night had come down altogether, and the panes gave back only a dim reflection of the surgery, our own forms ghostlike in the glass.</p><p>\u201cRoger did say that Kenny Lindsay mentioned something about Mr. Christie\u2019s . . . pretensions,\u201d I said delicately.</p><p>Jamie shot me a sharp glance at that.</p><p>\u201cOh, he did, did he? So, Roger Mac had second thoughts about his wisdom in taking on Christie as a tenant, I suppose. Kenny wouldna have said, unless he was asked.\u201d</p><p>I had more or less got used to the speed of his deductions and the accuracy of his insights, and didn\u2019t question this one.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me about that,\u201d I said, coming to stand in front of him. I put my hands on his chest, looking up into his face.</p><p>He put his own hands over mine, and sighed, deep enough for me to feel the movement of his chest. Then he wrapped his arms around me, and drew me close, so my face rested against the warm fabric of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It wasna really important, ken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t want to think about Ardsmuir, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have had enough of the past.\u201d</p><p>My hands were on his back now, and I realized suddenly what Christie had likely meant. I could feel the lines of the scars through the linen, clear to my fingertips as the lines of a fishnet, laid across his skin.</p><p>\u201cHonorable scars!\u201d I said, lifting my head. \u201cWhy, that little bastard! Is that what he meant?\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled a little at my indignation.</p><p>\u201cAye, he did,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s why he called me Mac Dubh\u2014to remind me of Ardsmuir, so I\u2019d ken for sure what he meant by it. He saw me flogged there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014that\u2014\u201d I was so angry, I could barely speak. \u201cI wish I\u2019d stitched his f**king hand to his balls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you a physician, sworn to do nay harm? I\u2019m verra much shocked, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>He was laughing now, but I wasn\u2019t amused at all.</p><p>\u201cBeastly little coward! He\u2019s afraid of blood, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aye, I did. Ye canna live in a man\u2019s oxter for three years without learning a great many things ye dinna want to know about him, let alone something like that.\u201d He sobered a bit, though a hint of wryness still lurked at the corner of his mouth. \u201cWhen they brought me back from being whipped, he went white as suet, went and puked in the corner, then lay down with his face to the wall. I wasna really taking notice, but I remember thinking that was a bit raw; I was the one was a bloody mess, why was he takin\u2019 on like a lass wi\u2019 the vapors?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t you go making jokes about it! How dare he? And what does he mean, anyway\u2014I know what happened at Ardsmuir, and those bloody well . . . I mean, those certainly are honorable scars, and everyone there knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe,\u201d he said, all hint of laughter disappearing. \u201cThat time. But everyone could see when they stood me up that I\u2019d been flogged before, aye? And no man there has ever said a word to me about those scars. Not \u2019til now.\u201d</p><p>That brought me up short.</p><p>Flogging wasn\u2019t merely brutal; it was shameful\u2014meant to permanently disfigure, as well as to hurt, advertising a criminal\u2019s past as clearly as a branded cheek or cropped ear. And Jamie would, of course, prefer to have his tongue torn out by the roots, sooner than reveal to anyone the reasons for his scars, even if that meant leaving everyone with the assumption that he had been flogged for some disgraceful act.</p><p>I was so used to Jamie\u2019s always keeping his shirt on in anyone else\u2019s presence that it had never occurred to me that of course the Ardsmuir men would know about the scars on his back. And yet he hid them, and everyone pretended they did not exist\u2014save Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I said. \u201cWell . . . God damn the man, anyway. Why would he say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Jamie uttered a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cBecause he didna like me watching him sweat. He wanted a bit of his own back, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I said again, and folded my arms beneath my bosom. \u201cSince you mention it\u2014why did you do that? If you knew he couldn\u2019t stand blood and the like, I mean, why stay and watch him like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I kent he wouldna whimper or faint if I did,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe\u2019d let ye thrust red-hot needles through his eyeballs before he\u2019d squeal in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you noticed that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I did, Sassenach. What d\u2019ye think I was there for? Not that I dinna appreciate your skill, but watching ye stitch up wounds isna really good for the digestion.\u201d He cast a brief glance at the discarded cloth, splotched with blood, and grimaced. \u201cD\u2019ye think the coffee\u2019s gone cold by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heat it up.\u201d I slid the clean scissors back into their sheath, then sterilized the needle I\u2019d used, ran a fresh silk suture through it, and coiled it up in its jar of alcohol\u2014still trying to make sense of things.</p><p>I put everything back into the cupboard, then turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid of Tom Christie, are you?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He blinked, astonished, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cChrist, no. What makes ye think that, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . the way the two of you act sometimes. It\u2019s like wild sheep, butting heads to see who\u2019s stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d He waved a hand, dismissive. \u201cI\u2019ve a harder head by far than Tom, and he kens it well enough. But he\u2019s no going to give in and follow me round like a yearling lamb, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? But what do you think you\u2019re doing, then? You weren\u2019t just torturing him to prove you could, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and smiled faintly at me. \u201cA man stubborn enough to speak English to Hieland men in prison for eight years is a man stubborn enough to fight beside me for the next eight years; that\u2019s what I think. It would be good if he were sure of it, himself, though.\u201d</p><p>I drew a deep breath and sighed, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI do not understand men.\u201d</p><p>That made him chuckle, deep in his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, ye do, Sassenach. Ye only wish ye didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The surgery lay neat again, ready for whatever emergencies the morrow might bring. Jamie reached for the lamp, but I laid a hand on his arm, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me honesty,\u201d I said. \u201cBut are you quite sure you\u2019re being honest with yourself? You weren\u2019t baiting Tom Christie just because he challenges you?\u201d</p><p>He stopped, his eyes clear and unguarded, a few inches from mine. He lifted a hand and cupped the side of my face, his palm warm on my skin.</p><p>\u201cThere are only two people in this world to whom I would never lie, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYe\u2019re one of them. And I\u2019m the other.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me gently on the forehead, then leaned past me and blew out the lamp.</p><p>\u201cMind,\u201d his voice came from the darkness, and I saw his tall form silhouetted against the faint oblong of light from the doorway as he straightened up, \u201cI can be fooled. But I wouldna be doing it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>ROGER MOVED a little, and groaned.</p><p>\u201cI think ye broke my leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not,\u201d said his wife, calmer now, but still disposed to argument. \u201cBut I\u2019ll kiss it for you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d</p><p>Tremendous rustlings of the corn-shuck mattress ensued as she clambered into position to execute this treatment, ending with a nak*d Brianna straddling his chest, and leaving him with a view that caused him to wish they\u2019d taken time to light the candle.</p><p>She was in fact kissing his shins, which tickled. Given the circumstances, though, he was inclined to put up with it. He reached up with both hands. Lacking light, Braille would do.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fourteen or so,\u201d he said dreamily, \u201cone of the shops in Inverness had a most daring window display\u2014daring for the times, that is\u2014a lady mannequin wearing nothing but underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, a full-length pink girdle, garters, the lot\u2014with matching brassiere. Everyone was shocked. Committees were got up to protest, and calls were made to all the ministers in town. Next day, they took it down, but meanwhile, the entire male population of Inverness had been past that window, taking pains to look casual about it. \u2019Til this minute, I\u2019d always thought that was the most erotic thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>She suspended her operations for a moment, and he thought from the sense of movement that she was looking back over her shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cI do believe you\u2019re a pervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but one with really good night vision.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh\u2014the thing he\u2019d been striving for since he\u2019d finally got her to stop frothing at the mouth\u2014and he raised himself briefly, planting a light kiss on either side of the looming object of his affections before sinking contentedly back onto the pillow.</p><p>She kissed his knee, then put her head down, cheek against his thigh, so the mass of her hair spilled over his legs, cool and soft as a cloud of silk threads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly, after a moment.</p><p>He made a dismissive noise, and ran a soothing hand over the round of her hip.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s no matter. Too bad, though; I wanted to see their faces when they saw what ye\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>She snorted briefly, and his leg twitched at the warmth of her breath.</p><p>\u201cTheir faces were something to see, anyway.\u201d She sounded a little bleak. \u201cAnd it would have been a real anticli**x, after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re right about that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut ye\u2019ll show them tomorrow, when they\u2019re in a frame of mind to appreciate it properly.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and kissed his knee again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she said, after a moment. \u201cImplying it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye did,\u201d he said softly, still caressing. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Ye\u2019re probably right.\u201d Likely she was. He wasn\u2019t going to pretend it hadn\u2019t hurt to hear it, but he wouldn\u2019t let himself be angry; that would help neither of them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d She raised up suddenly, looming like an obelisk in silhouette against the pale rectangle of the window. Swinging one leg neatly over his supine body, she slithered down beside him. \u201cIt could be me. Or neither of us. Maybe it just isn\u2019t the right time, yet.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her and hugged her close in answer.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the cause, we\u2019ll not blame each other, aye?\u201d She made a small sound of assent and nestled closer. Well enough; there was no way to keep from blaming himself, though.</p><p>The facts were clear enough; she\u2019d got pregnant with Jemmy after one night\u2014whether with himself, or Stephen Bonnet, no one knew, but once was all it took. Whereas they\u2019d been trying for the last several months, and Jem was looking more and more like being an only child. Possibly he did lack the vital spark, as Mrs. Bug and her chums speculated.</p><p>Who\u2019s your Daddy? echoed mockingly in the back of his mind\u2014in an Irish accent.</p><p>He coughed explosively, and settled back, determined not to dwell on that little matter.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d he said, changing the subject. \u201cYe\u2019re maybe right about me acting like I\u2019d rather ye cook and clean than mess about with your wee chemistry set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you would,\u201d she said without rancor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the not cooking as it is the setting things on fire I mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll love the next project, then,\u201d she said, nuzzling his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . good,\u201d he said, though even he could hear the dubious note in his voice. \u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some dirt involved, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that burns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wood. A little. Nothing special.\u201d</p><p>She was running her fingers slowly down his chest. He caught her hand and kissed her fingertips; they were smooth, but hard, callused from the constant spinning she did to help keep them clothed.</p><p>\u201cWho can find a virtuous woman?\u201d he quoted, \u201cfor her price is far above rubies. She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to find some dye plant that gives a true purple,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cI miss the bright colors. Remember the dress I wore to the man-on-the-moon party? The black one, with the bands of Day-Glo pink and lime green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty memorable, aye.\u201d Privately, he thought the muted colors of homespun suited her much better; in skirts of rust and brown, jackets of gray and green, she looked like some exotic, lovely lichen.</p><p>Seized by the sudden desire to see her, he reached out, fumbling on the table by the bed. The little box was where she\u2019d thrown it when they came back. She\u2019d designed it to be used in the dark, after all; a turn of the lid dispensed one of the small, waxy sticks, and the tiny strip of roughened metal glued to the side was cool to his hand.</p><p>A skritch! that made his heart leap with its simple familiarity, and the tiny flame appeared with a whiff of sulfur\u2014magic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste them,\u201d she said, but smiled in spite of the protest, delighted at the sight as she\u2019d been when she first showed him what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Her hair was loose and clean, just washed; shimmering over the pale round of her shoulder, clouds of it lying soft over his chest, cinnamon and amber and roan and gold, sparked by the flame.</p><p>\u201cShe does not fear the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet,\u201d he said softly, his free hand round her, twining a lock near her face round his finger, twisting the tiny strand as he\u2019d seen her spin yarn.</p><p>The long lids of her eyes closed halfway, like a basking cat\u2019s, but the smile remained on that wide, soft mouth\u2014those lips that hurt, then healed. The light glowed in her skin, bronzed the tiny brown mole beneath her right ear. He could have watched her forever, but the match was burning low. Just before the flame touched his fingers, she leaned forward and blew it out.</p><p>And in the smoke-wisped dark, whispered in his ear, \u201cThe heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. So there.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>ENSORCELLMENT</p><p>TOM CHRISTIE didn\u2019t come back to the surgery, but he did send his daughter, Malva, to get the ointment. The girl was dark-haired, slender, and quiet, but seemed intelligent. She paid close attention as I quizzed her on the look of the wound\u2014so far, so good, a bit of redness, but no suppuration, no reddish streaks up the arm\u2014and gave her instructions on how to apply the ointment and change the dressing.</p><p>\u201cGood, then,\u201d I said, giving her the jar. \u201cIf he should begin a fever, come and fetch me. Otherwise, make him come in a week, to have the stitches taken out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d She didn\u2019t turn and go, though, but lingered, her gaze flickering over the mounds of drying herbs on the gauze racks and the implements of my surgery.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something else, dear? Or did you have a question?\u201d She\u2019d seemed to understand my instructions perfectly well\u2014but perhaps she wanted to ask something more personal. After all, she had no mother . .</p><p>\u201cWell, aye,\u201d she said, and nodded at the table. \u201cI only wondered\u2014what is it that ye write in yon black book, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis? Oh. It\u2019s my surgical notes, and recipes . . . er . . . receipts, I mean, for medicines. See?\u201d I turned the book round and opened it so that she could see the page where I had drawn a sketch of the damage to Miss Mouse\u2019s teeth.</p><p>Malva\u2019s gray eyes were bright with curiosity, and she leaned forward to read, hands carefully folded behind her back as though afraid she might touch the book by accident.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, a little amused by her caution. \u201cYou can look through it, if you like.\u201d I pushed it toward her, and she stepped back, startled. She glanced up at me, a look of doubt wrinkling her brow, but when I smiled at her, she took a tiny, excited breath, and reached out to turn a page.</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d The page she\u2019d turned to wasn\u2019t one of mine, but one of Daniel Rawlings\u2019s\u2014it showed the removal of a dead child from the uterus, via the use of assorted tools of dilatation and curettage. I glanced at the page, and hastily away. Rawlings hadn\u2019t been an artist, but he had had a brutal knack for rendering the reality of a situation.</p><p>Malva didn\u2019t seem to be distressed by the drawings, though; she was bug-eyed with interest.</p><p>I began to be interested, too, watching covertly as she turned pages at random. She naturally paid most attention to the drawings\u2014but she paused to read the descriptions and recipes, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy d\u2019ye write things down that ye\u2019ve done?\u201d she asked, glancing up with raised eyebrows. \u201cThe receipts, aye, I see ye might forget things\u2014but why d\u2019ye draw these pictures and write down the bits about how ye took off a toe wi\u2019 the frost-rot? Would ye do it differently, another time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes you might,\u201d I said, laying aside the stalk of dried rosemary I\u2019d been stripping of its needles. \u201cSurgery isn\u2019t the same each time. All bodies are a bit different, and even though you may do the same basic procedure a dozen times, there will be a dozen things that happen differently\u2014sometimes only tiny things, sometimes big ones.</p><p>\u201cBut I keep a record of what I\u2019ve done for several reasons,\u201d I added, pushing back my stool and coming round the table to stand beside her. I turned another few pages, stopping at the record I kept of old Grannie MacBeth\u2019s complaints\u2014a list so extensive that I had alphabetized it for my own convenience, beginning with Arthritis\u2014all joints, running through Dyspepsia, Earache, and Fainting, and then onward for most of two pages, terminating with Womb, prolapsed.</p><p>\u201cPartly, it\u2019s so that I\u2019ll know what\u2019s been done for a particular person, and what happened\u2014so that if they need treatment later, I can look back and have an accurate description of their earlier state. To compare, you see?\u201d</p><p>She nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see. So ye\u2019d know were they getting better or worse. What else, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the most important reason,\u201d I said slowly, seeking the right words, \u201cis so that another doctor\u2014someone who might come later\u2014so that person could read the record, and see how I\u2019d done this or that. It might show them a way to do something they hadn\u2019t done themselves\u2014or a better way.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth pursed up in interest.</p><p>\u201cOoh! Ye mean someone might learn from this\u201d\u2014she touched a finger to the page, delicately\u2014\u201chow to do what it is ye do? Without \u2019prenticing himself to a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s best if you have someone to teach you,\u201d I said, amused at her eagerness. \u201cAnd there are things you can\u2019t really learn from a book. But if there\u2019s no one to learn from\u2014\u201d I glanced out the window, at the vista of green wilderness swarming over the mountains. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d I concluded.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn?\u201d she asked, curious. \u201cFrom this book? I see there\u2019s another hand, besides yours. Whose was it?\u201d</p><p>I ought to have seen that one coming. I hadn\u2019t quite bargained on Malva Christie\u2019s quickness, though.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . I learned from a lot of books,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd from other doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther doctors,\u201d she echoed, looking at me in fascination. \u201cD\u2019ye call yourself a doctor, then? I didna ken women ever could be.\u201d</p><p>For the rather good reason that no women did call themselves physicians or surgeons now\u2014nor were accepted as such.</p><p>I coughed.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . it\u2019s a name, that\u2019s all. A good many people just say wisewoman, or conjure woman. Or ban-lichtne,\u201d I added. \u201cBut it\u2019s all the same, really. It only matters whether I know something that might help them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBan\u2014\u201d She mouthed the unfamiliar word. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Gaelic. The Highland tongue, you know? It means \u2018female healer\u2019 or something like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the Gaelic.\u201d An expression of mild derision crossed her face; I expected she had absorbed her father\u2019s attitude toward the Highlanders\u2019 ancient language. She evidently saw something in my face, though, for she instantly erased the disdain from her own features and bent over the book again. \u201cWho was it wrote these other bits, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man named Daniel Rawlings.\u201d I smoothed a creased page, with the usual sense of affection for my predecessor. \u201cHe was a doctor from Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d She looked up, surprised. \u201cThe same who\u2019s buried in the boneyard up the mountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . yes, that\u2019s him.\u201d And the story of how he came to be there was not something to be shared with Miss Christie. I glanced out of the window, estimating the light. \u201cWill your father be wanting his dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She stood up straight at that, glancing out the window, too, with a faint look of alarm. \u201cAye, he will.\u201d She cast a last look of longing toward the book, but then brushed down her skirt and set her cap straight, ready to go. \u201cI thank ye, Mrs. Fraser, for showing me your wee book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to,\u201d I assured her sincerely. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come again and look at it. In fact . . . would you\u2014\u201d I hesitated, but plunged on, encouraged by her look of bright interest. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a growth from Grannie Macbeth\u2019s ear tomorrow. Would you like to come along with me, to see how? It would be a help to me, to have another pair of hands,\u201d I added, seeing sudden doubt war with the interest in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, Mrs. Fraser\u2014I\u2019d dearly like it!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only my father\u2014\u201d She looked uneasy as she said it, but then seemed to make up her mind. \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ll come. I\u2019m sure I can talk him round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I were to send a note? Or come and speak with him?\u201d I was suddenly quite desirous that she should come with me.</p><p>She gave a small shake of the head.</p><p>\u201cNay, ma\u2019am, it\u2019ll be all right, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She dimpled at me suddenly, gray eyes sparkling. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him I\u2019ve had a keek at your black book, and it\u2019s no by way of being spells in it, at all, but only receipts for teas and purges. I\u2019ll maybe not say about the drawings, though,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cSpells?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cIs that what he thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d she assured me. \u201cHe warned me not to touch it, for fear of ensorcellment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnsorcellment,\u201d I murmured, bemused. Well, Thomas Christie was a schoolmaster, after all. In fact, he might have been right, I thought; Malva glanced back at the book as I went with her to the door, obvious fascination on her face.</p><p>23</p><p>ANESTHESIA</p><p>I CLOSED MY EYES AND, holding my hand a foot or so in front of my face, wafted it gently toward my nose, like one of the parfumeurs I\u2019d seen in Paris, testing a fragrance.</p><p>The smell hit me in the face like an ocean wave, and with approximately the same effect. My knees buckled, black lines writhed through my vision, and I ceased to make any distinction between up and down.</p><p>In what seemed an instant later, I came to, lying on the floor of the surgery with Mrs. Bug staring down at me in horror.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Claire! Are ye all right, mo gaolach? I saw ye fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I croaked, shaking my head gingerly as I got up on one elbow. \u201cPut\u2014put the cork in.\u201d I gestured clumsily at the large open flask on the table, its cork lying alongside. \u201cDon\u2019t get your face near it!\u201d</p><p>Face averted and screwed into a grimace of caution, she got the cork and inserted it, at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cPhew, what is yon stuff?\u201d she said, stepping back and making faces. She sneezed explosively into her apron. \u201cI\u2019ve never smelt anything like that\u2014and Bride kens I\u2019ve smelt a good many nasty things in this room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my dear Mrs. Bug, is ether.\u201d The swimming sensation in my head had almost disappeared, replaced by euphoria.</p><p>\u201cEther?\u201d She looked at the distilling apparatus on my counter in fascination, the alcohol bath bubbling gently away in its great glass bubble over a low flame and the oil of vitriol\u2014later to be known as sulfuric acid\u2014slicking its slow way down the slanted tubing, its malign hot scent lurking below the usual surgery smells of roots and herbs. \u201cFancy! And what\u2019s ether, then?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt puts people asleep, so they won\u2019t feel pain when you cut them,\u201d I explained, thrilled by my success. \u201cAnd I know exactly who I\u2019m going to use it on first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTOM CHRISTIE?\u201d Jamie repeated. \u201cHave ye told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Malva. She\u2019s going to work on him; soften him up a bit.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cYe could boil Tom Christie in milk for a fortnight, and he\u2019d still be hard as a grindstone. And if ye think he\u2019ll listen to his wee lass prattle about a magic liquid that will put him to sleep\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t to tell him about the ether. I\u2019ll do that,\u201d I assured him. \u201cShe\u2019s just going to pester him about his hand; convince him he needs it mended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Jamie still appeared dubious, though not, it seemed, entirely on Thomas Christie\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cThis ether ye\u2019ve made, Sassenach. Might ye not kill him with it?\u201d</p><p>I had, in fact, worried considerably about that very possibility. I\u2019d done operations frequently where ether was used, and it was on the whole a fairly safe anesthetic. But homemade ether, administered by hand . . . and people did die of anesthetic accidents, even in the most careful settings, with trained anesthetists and all sorts of resuscitating equipment to hand. And I remembered Rosamund Lindsay, whose accidental death still haunted my dreams now and then. But the possibility of having a reliable anesthetic, of being able to do surgery without pain\u2014</p> <p>\u201cI might,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but there\u2019s always some risk. Worth it, though.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave me a slightly jaundiced look.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Does Tom think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out. I\u2019ll explain it all carefully to him, and if he won\u2019t\u2014well, he won\u2019t. But I do hope he does!\u201d</p><p>The edge of Jamie\u2019s mouth curled up and he shook his head tolerantly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re like wee Jem wi\u2019 a new toy, Sassenach. Take care the wheels dinna come off.\u201d</p> <p>I might have made some indignant reply to this, but we had come in sight of the Bugs\u2019 cabin, and Arch Bug was sitting on his stoop, peacefully smoking a clay pipe. He took this from his mouth and made to stand up when he saw us, but Jamie motioned him back.</p><p>\u201cCiamar a tha thu, a charaid?\u201d</p><p>Arch replied with his customary \u201cMmp,\u201d infused with a tone of cordiality and welcome. A raised white brow in my direction, and a twiddle of the pipe stem toward the trail indicated that his wife was at our house, if that\u2019s who I was looking for.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going into the woods to forage a bit,\u201d I said, lifting my empty basket by way of evidence. \u201cMrs. Bug forgot her needlework, though\u2014may I fetch it for her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes creasing as he smiled round his pipe. He shifted his lean buttocks courteously to allow me to go past him into the cabin. Behind me, I heard a \u201cMmp?\u201d of invitation, and felt the boards of the stoop shift as Jamie sat down beside Mr. Bug.</p><p>There were no windows, and I was obliged to stand still for a moment to let my eyes adjust to the dimness. It was a small cabin, though, and it took no more than half a minute before I could make out the contents: little more than the bed frame, a blanket chest, and a table with two stools. Mrs. Bug\u2019s workbag hung from a hook on the far wall, and I crossed to get it.</p><p>On the porch behind me, I heard the murmur of male conversation, featuring the quite unusual sound of Mr. Bug\u2019s voice. He could and did talk, of course, but Mrs. Bug talked so volubly that when she was present, her spouse\u2019s contribution was generally not much more than a smile and an occasional \u201cmmp\u201d of accord or disagreement.</p><p>\u201cYon Christie,\u201d Mr. Bug was saying now, in a meditative tone of voice. \u201cD\u2019ye find him strange, a Sheaumais?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019s a Lowlander,\u201d Jamie said, with an audible shrug.</p><p>A humorous \u201cmmp\u201d from Mr. Bug indicated that this was a perfectly sufficient explanation, and was succeeded by the sucking noises of a pipe being encouraged to draw.</p><p>I opened the bag, to be sure that the knitting was inside; in fact, it was not, and I was obliged to poke round the cabin, squinting in the dimness. Oh\u2014there it was; a dark puddle of something soft in the corner, fallen from the table and knocked aside by someone\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cIs he stranger than he might be, Christie?\u201d I heard Jamie ask, his own tone casual.</p><p>I glanced through the door in time to see Arch Bug nod toward Jamie, though he didn\u2019t speak, being engaged in a fierce battle with his pipe. However, he raised his right hand and waggled it, displaying the stumps of his two missing fingers.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said finally, releasing a triumphant puff of white smoke with the word. \u201cHe wished to ask me whether it hurt a good deal, when this was done.\u201d</p><p>His face wrinkled up like a paper bag, and he wheezed a little\u2014high hilarity for Arch Bug.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? And what did ye tell him, then, Arch?\u201d Jamie asked, smiling a little.</p><p>Arch sucked meditatively on his pipe, now fully cooperative, then pursed his lips and blew a small, perfect ring of smoke.</p><p>\u201cWeeel, I said it didna hurt a bit\u2014at the time.\u201d He paused, blue eyes twinkling. \u201cOf course, that may have been because I was laid out cold as a mackerel from the shock of it. When I came round, it stung a bit.\u201d He lifted the hand, looking it over dispassionately, then glanced through the door at me. \u201cYe didna mean to use an ax on poor old Tom, did ye, ma\u2019am? He says ye\u2019re set to mend his hand next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. May I see?\u201d I stepped out on the porch, bending to him, and he let me take the hand, obligingly switching his pipe to the left.</p><p>The index and middle finger had been severed cleanly, right at the knuckle. It was a very old injury; so old that it had lost that shocking look common to recent mutilations, where the mind still sees what should be there, and tries vainly for an instant to reconcile reality with expectation. The human body is amazingly plastic, though, and will compensate for missing bits as well as it can; in the case of a maimed hand, the remnant often undergoes a subtle sort of useful deformation, to maximize what function remains.</p><p>I felt along the hand carefully, fascinated. The metacarpals of the severed digits were intact, but the surrounding tissues had shrunk and twisted, withdrawing that part of the hand slightly, so that the remaining two fingers and the thumb could make a better opposition; I\u2019d seen old Arch use that hand with perfect grace, holding a cup to drink, or wielding the handle of a spade.</p><p>The scars over the finger stumps had flattened and paled, forming a smooth, calloused surface. The remaining finger joints were knobbed with arthritis, and the hand as a whole was so twisted that it really didn\u2019t resemble a hand anymore\u2014and yet it was not at all repulsive. It felt strong and warm in mine, and in fact, was oddly attractive, in the same way that a piece of weathered driftwood is.</p><p>\u201cIt was done with an ax, you said?\u201d I asked, wondering exactly how he had managed to inflict such an injury on himself, given that he was right-handed. A slippage might have gashed an arm or leg, but to take two fingers of the same hand right off like that . . . Realization dawned and my grasp tightened involuntarily. Oh, no.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, and exhaled a plume of smoke. I looked up, straight into his bright blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Frasers,\u201d he said. He squeezed my hand gently, then withdrew his own and turned it to and fro. He glanced at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNot the Frasers of Lovat,\u201d he assured him. \u201cBobby Fraser of Glenhelm, and his nephew. Leslie, his name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, that\u2019s good,\u201d Jamie replied, one eyebrow lifted. \u201cI shouldna like to hear it was close kin of mine.\u201d</p><p>Arch chuckled, almost soundlessly. His eyes still gleamed bright in their webs of wrinkled skin, but there was something in that laugh that made me want suddenly to step back a little.</p><p>\u201cNo, ye wouldna,\u201d he agreed. \u201cNor me. But this was maybe the year ye would have been born, a Sheaumais, or a bit before. And there are no Frasers at Glenhelm now.\u201d</p><p>The hand itself had not troubled me at all, but the imagined vision of how it had got that way was making me a trifle faint. I sat down beside Jamie, not waiting for invitation.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said bluntly. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He drew on his pipe, and blew another ring. It struck the remnants of the first and both disintegrated in a haze of fragrant smoke. He frowned a little, and glanced down at the hand, now resting on his knee.</p><p>\u201cAh, well. It was my choice. We were bowmen, see,\u201d he explained to me. \u201cAll the men of my sept, we were brought up to it, early. I\u2019d my first bow at three, and could strike a grouse through the heart at forty feet by the time I was six.\u201d</p><p>He spoke with an air of simple pride, squinting a little at a small flock of doves that were foraging under the trees nearby, as though estimating how easily he could have bagged one.</p><p>\u201cI did hear my father tell of the archers,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAt Glenshiels. Many of them Grants, he said\u2014and some Campbells.\u201d He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, interested in the story, but wary.</p><p>\u201cAye, that was us.\u201d Arch puffed industriously, smoke wreathing up round his head. \u201cWe\u2019d crept down through the bracken in the night,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cand hid among the rocks above the river at Glenshiels, under the bracken and the rowans. Ye could have stood a foot away and not seen one of us, so thick as it was.</p><p>\u201cA bit cramped,\u201d he added confidentially to Jamie. \u201cYe couldna stand up to take a piss, and we\u2019d had our suppers\u2014with a bit o\u2019 beer\u2014before we came up the other side o\u2019 the mountain. All squatting like women, we were. Trying like the devil to keep our bowstrings dry in our shirts, too, what wi\u2019 the rain coming down and dripping down our necks through the fern.</p><p>\u201cBut come the dawn,\u201d he went on cheerfully, \u201cand we stood on the signal and let fly. I will say \u2019twas a bonny sight, our arrows hailing down from the hills on the poor sods camped there by the river. Aye, your faither fought there, too, a Sheaumais,\u201d he added, pointing the stem of his pipe at Jamie. \u201cHe was one o\u2019 those by the river.\u201d A spasm of silent laughter shook him.</p><p>\u201cNo love lost, then,\u201d Jamie replied, very dryly. \u201cBetween you and the Frasers.\u201d</p><p>Old Arch shook his head, not at all discomposed.</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he said. He turned his attention back to me, his manner sobering a little.</p><p>\u201cSo when the Frasers would capture a Grant alone on their land, it was their habit to give him a choice. He could lose his right eye, or the twa fingers of his right hand. Either way, he wouldna draw a bow again against them.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the maimed hand slowly to and fro against his thigh, stretching it out, as though his phantom fingers reached and yearned for the touch of singing sinew. Then he shook his head, as though dismissing the vision, and curled his hand into a fist. He turned to me.</p><p>\u201cYe werena intending to take Christie\u2019s fingers straight off, were ye, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, startled. \u201cOf course not. He doesn\u2019t think . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Arch shrugged, bushy white brows raised toward his receding hairline.</p><p>\u201cI couldna say for sure, but he seemed verra much disturbed at the thought of being cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said. I\u2019d have to speak to Tom Christie.</p><p>Jamie had stood up to take his leave, and I followed suit automatically, shaking out my skirts and trying to shake out of my head the mental image of a young man\u2019s hand, pinned to the ground, and an ax chunking down.</p><p>\u201cNo Frasers at Glenhelm, ye said?\u201d Jamie asked thoughtfully, looking down at Mr. Bug. \u201cLeslie, the nephew\u2014he would have been Bobby Fraser\u2019s heir, would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he would.\u201d Mr. Bug\u2019s pipe had gone out. He turned it over and knocked the dottle neatly out against the edge of the porch.</p><p>\u201cBoth killed together, were they? I mind my father telling of it, once. Found in a stream, their heads caved in, he said.\u201d</p><p>Arch Bug blinked up at him, eyelids lowered, lizardlike, against the sun\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cWeel, ye see, a Sheaumais,\u201d he said, \u201ca bow\u2019s like a good-wife, aye? Knows her master, and answers his touch. An ax, though\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAn ax is a whore. Any man can use one\u2014and it works as well in either hand.\u201d</p><p>He blew through the stem of the pipe to clear it of ash, wiped the bowl with his handkerchief, and tucked it carefully away\u2014left-handed. He grinned at us, the remnants of his teeth sharp-edged and yellowed with tobacco.</p><p>\u201cGo with God, Seaumais mac Brian.\u201d</p><p>LATER IN THE WEEK, I went to the Christies\u2019 cabin, to take the stitches out of Tom\u2019s left hand and explain to him about the ether. His son, Allan, was in the yard, sharpening a knife on a foot-treadled grindstone. He smiled and nodded to me, but didn\u2019t speak, unable to be heard above the rasping whine of the grindstone.</p><p>Perhaps it was that sound, I thought, a moment later, that had aroused Tom Christie\u2019s apprehensions.</p><p>\u201cI have decided that I shall leave my other hand as it is,\u201d he said stiffly, as I clipped the last stitch and pulled it free.</p><p>I set down my tweezers and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A dull red rose in his cheeks, and he stood up, lifting his chin and looking over my shoulder, so as not to meet my eye.</p><p>\u201cI have prayed about it, and I have come to the conclusion that if this infirmity be God\u2019s will, then it would be wrong to seek to change it.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed the strong urge to say \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d, but with great difficulty.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cAnd tell me, if you would, just why you think God wants you to go about with a twisted hand?\u201d</p><p>He did glance at me then, surprised and flustered.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . it is not my place to question the Lord\u2019s ways!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said mildly. \u201cI rather thought that\u2019s what you were doing last Sunday. Or wasn\u2019t it you I heard, inquiring as to what the Lord thought He was about, letting all these Catholics flourish like the green bay tree?\u201d</p><p>The dull red color darkened substantially.</p><p>\u201cI am sure you have misunderstood me, Mistress Fraser.\u201d He straightened himself still further, so that he was nearly leaning over backward. \u201cThe fact remains that I shall not require your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because I\u2019m a Catholic?\u201d I asked, settling back on the stool and folding my hands on my knee. \u201cYou think perhaps I\u2019ll take advantage of you, and baptize you into the church of Rome when you\u2019re off your guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been suitably christened!\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd I will thank you to keep your Popish notions to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an arrangement with the Pope,\u201d I said, giving him stare for stare. \u201cI issue no bulls on points of doctrine, and he doesn\u2019t do surgery. Now, about your hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lord\u2019s will\u2014\u201d he began stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWas it the Lord\u2019s will that your cow should fall into the gorge and break her leg last month?\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cBecause if it was, then you presumably ought to have left her there to die, rather than fetching my husband to help pull her out, and then allowing me to set her leg. How is she, by the way?\u201d</p><p>I could see the cow in question through the window, peacefully grazing at the edge of the yard, and evidently untroubled either by her nursing calf, or by the binding I had applied to support her cracked cannon bone.</p><p>\u201cShe is well, I thank you.\u201d He was beginning to sound a little strangled, though his shirt was loose at the collar. \u201cThat is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think the Lord regards you as less deserving of medical help than your cow? It seems unlikely to me, what with Him regarding sparrows and all that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone a sort of dusky purple round the jowls by this point, and clutched the defective hand with the sound one, as though to keep it safe from me.</p><p>\u201cI see that you have heard something of the Bible,\u201d he began, very pompous.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve read it for myself,\u201d I said. \u201cI read quite well, you know.\u201d</p><p>He brushed this remark aside, a dim light of triumph gleaming in his eye.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Then I am sure you will have read the Letter of St. Paul to Timothy, in which he says, Let a woman be silent\u2014\u201d</p><p>I had, in fact, encountered St. Paul and his opinions before, and had a few of my own.</p><p>\u201cI expect St. Paul ran into a woman who could outargue him, too,\u201d I said, not without sympathy. \u201cEasier to try to put a stopper on the entire sex than to win his point fairly. I should have expected better of you, though, Mr. Christie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s blasphemy!\u201d he gasped, clearly shocked.</p><p>\u201cIt is not,\u201d I countered, \u201cunless you\u2019re saying that St. Paul is actually God\u2014and if you are, then I rather think that\u2019s blasphemy. But let\u2019s not quibble,\u201d I said, seeing his eyes begin to bulge. \u201cLet me . . .\u201d I rose from my stool and took a step forward, bringing me within touching distance of him. He backed up so hastily that he bumped into the table and knocked it askew, sending Malva\u2019s workbasket, a pottery jug of milk, and a pewter plate cascading to the floor with a crash.</p><p>I bent swiftly and grabbed the workbasket, in time to prevent it being soaked by the flood of milk. Mr. Christie had as swiftly seized a rag from the hearth, and bent to mop up the milk. We narrowly missed bumping heads, but did collide, and I lost my balance, falling heavily against him. He caught hold of my arms by reflex, dropping the rag, then hastily let go and recoiled, leaving me swaying on my knees.</p><p>He was on his knees, as well, breathing heavily, but now a safe distance away.</p><p>\u201cThe truth of it is,\u201d I said severely, pointing a finger at him, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d I got to my feet, replaced the workbasket on the table, and shoved the rag delicately over the puddle of milk with my foot. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid that I\u2019ll hurt you\u2014but I won\u2019t,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI have a medicine called ether; it will make you go to sleep, and you won\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at that.</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019ll lose a few fingers, or what use of your hand you have.\u201d</p><p>He was still kneeling on the hearth, staring up at me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t absolutely guarantee that you won\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen\u2014but man proposes, and God disposes, doesn\u2019t He?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, very slowly, but didn\u2019t say anything. I took a deep breath, for the moment out of argument.</p><p>\u201cI think I can mend your hand,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee it. Sometimes things happen. Infections, accidents\u2014something unexpected. But . . .\u201d</p><p>I reached out a hand to him, motioning toward the crippled member. Moving like a hypnotized bird trapped in a serpent\u2019s gaze, he extended his arm and let me take it. I grasped his wrist and pulled him to his feet; he rose easily and stood before me, letting me hold his hand.</p><p>I took it in both of mine and pressed the gnarled fingers back, rubbing my thumb gently over the thickened palmar aponeurosis that was trapping the tendons. I could feel it clearly, could see in my mind exactly how to approach the problem, where to press with the scalpel, how the calloused skin would part. The length and depth of the Z-shaped incision that would free his hand and make it useful once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it before,\u201d I said softly, pressing to feel the submerged bones. \u201cI can do it again, God willing. If you\u2019ll let me?\u201d</p><p>He was only a couple of inches taller than I; I held his eyes, as well as his hand. They were a clear, sharp gray, and searched my face with something between fear and suspicion\u2014but with something else at the back of them. I became quite suddenly aware of his breathing, slow and steady, and felt the warmth of his breath on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last, hoarsely. He pulled his hand away from mine, not abruptly, but almost with reluctance, and stood cradling it in his sound one. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I said, \u201cif the weather is good. I\u2019ll need good light,\u201d I explained, seeing the startled look in his eyes. \u201cCome in the morning, but don\u2019t eat breakfast.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my kit, bobbed an awkward curtsy to him, and left, feeling rather queer.</p><p>Allan Christie waved cheerfully to me as I left, and went on with his grinding.</p><p>\u201cDO YOU THINK he\u2019ll come?\u201d Breakfast had been eaten, and no sign yet of Thomas Christie. After a night of broken sleep, in which I dreamed repeatedly of ether masks and surgical disasters, I wasn\u2019t sure whether I wanted him to come or not.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019ll come.\u201d Jamie was reading the North Carolina Gazette, four months out of date, while munching the last of Mrs. Bug\u2019s cinnamon toast. \u201cLook, they\u2019ve printed a letter from the Governor to Lord Dartmouth, saying what an unruly lot of seditious, conniving, thieving bastards we all are, and asking General Gage to send him cannon to threaten us back into good behavior. I wonder if MacDonald knows that\u2019s public knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they really?\u201d I said absently. I rose, and picked up the ether mask I had been staring at all through breakfast. \u201cWell, if he does come, I suppose I\u2019d best be ready.\u201d</p><p>I had the ether mask Bree had made for me and the dropping bottle laid out ready in my surgery, next to the array of instruments I would need for the surgery itself. Unsure, I picked up the bottle, uncorked it, and waved a hand across the neck, wafting fumes toward my nose. The result was a reassuring wave of dizziness that blurred my vision for a moment. When it cleared, I recorked the bottle and set it down, feeling somewhat more confident.</p><p>Just in time. I heard voices at the back of the house, and footsteps in the hall.</p><p>I turned expectantly, to see Mr. Christie glowering at me from the doorway, his hand curled protectively into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI have changed my mind.\u201d Christie lowered his brows still further, to emphasize his position. \u201cI have considered the matter, and prayed upon it, and I shall not allow ye to employ your foul potions upon me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stupid man,\u201d I said, thoroughly put out. I stood up and glowered back. \u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>He looked taken aback, as though a snake in the grass at his feet had dared to address him.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing whatever the matter with me,\u201d he said, quite gruff. He lifted his chin aggressively, bristling his short beard at me. \u201cWhat is the matter with you, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought it was only Highlanders who were stubborn as rocks!\u201d</p><p>He looked quite insulted at this comparison, but before he could take further issue with me, Jamie poked his head into the surgery, drawn by the sounds of altercation.</p><p>\u201cIs there some difficulty?\u201d he inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cYes! He refuses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is. She insists\u2014\u201d</p><p>The words collided, and we both broke off, glaring at each other. Jamie glanced from me to Mr. Christie, then at the apparatus on the table. He cast his eyes up to heaven, as though imploring guidance, then rubbed a finger thoughtfully beneath his nose.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cWell. D\u2019ye want your hand mended, Tom?\u201d</p><p>Christie went on looking mulish, cradling the crippled hand protectively against his chest. After a moment, though, he nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. He gave me a deeply suspicious look. \u201cBut I shall not be having any of this Popish nonsense about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopish?\u201d Jamie and I spoke at the same time, Jamie sounding merely puzzled, myself deeply exasperated.</p><p>\u201cAye, and ye need not be thinking ye can cod me into it, either, Fraser!\u201d</p><p>Jamie shot me an \u201cI told ye so, Sassenach\u201d sort of look, but squared himself to give it a try.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye always were an awkward wee bugger, Tom,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cYe must please yourself about it, to be sure\u2014but I can tell ye from experience that it does hurt a great deal.\u201d</p><p>I thought Christie paled a little.</p><p>\u201cTom. Look.\u201d Jamie nodded at the tray of instruments: two scalpels, a probe, scissors, forceps, and two suture needles, already threaded with gut and floating in a jar of alcohol. They gleamed dully in the sunlight. \u201cShe means to cut into your hand, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Christie snapped, though his eyes slid away from the sinister assemblage of sharp edges.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do. But ye\u2019ve not the slightest notion what it\u2019s like. I have. See here?\u201d He held up his right hand, the back of it toward Christie, and waggled it. In that position, with the morning sun full on it, the thin white scars that laced his fingers were stark against the deep bronze skin.</p><p>\u201cThat bloody hurt,\u201d he assured Christie. \u201cYe dinna want to do something like that, and there\u2019s a choice about it\u2014which there is.\u201d</p><p>Christie barely glanced at the hand. Of course, I thought, he would be familiar with the look of it; he\u2019d lived with Jamie for three years.</p><p>\u201cI have made my choice,\u201d Christie said with dignity. He sat down in the chair and laid his hand palm-up on the napkin. All the color had leached out of his face, and his free hand was clenched so hard that it trembled.</p><p>Jamie looked at him under heavy brows for a moment, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cAye. Wait a moment, then.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, there was no further point in argument, and I didn\u2019t bother trying. I took down the bottle of medicinal whisky I kept on the shelf and poured a healthy tot into a cup.</p><p>\u201cTake a little wine for thy stomach\u2019s sake,\u201d I said, thrusting it firmly into his upturned hand. \u201cOur mutual acquaintance, St. Paul. If it\u2019s all right to drink for the sake of a stomach, surely to goodness you can take a drop for the sake of a hand.\u201d</p><p>His mouth, grimly compressed in anticipation, opened in surprise. He glanced from the cup to me, then back. He swallowed, nodded, and raised the cup to his lips.</p><p>Before he had finished, though, Jamie came back, holding a small, battered green book, which he thrust unceremoniously into Christie\u2019s hand.</p><p>Christie looked surprised, but held the book out, squinting to see what it was. HOLY BIBLE was printed on the warped cover, King James Version.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll take help where ye can, I suppose?\u201d Jamie said a little gruffly.</p><p>Christie looked at him sharply, then nodded, a very faint smile passing through his beard like a shadow.</p><p>\u201cI thank you, sir,\u201d he said. He took his spectacles out of his coat and put them on, then opened the little book with great care and began to thumb through it, evidently looking for a suitable inspiration for undergoing surgery without anesthetic.</p><p>I gave Jamie a long look, to which he responded with the faintest of shrugs. It wasn\u2019t merely a Bible. It was the Bible that had once belonged to Alexander MacGregor.</p><p>Jamie had come by it as a very young man, when he was imprisoned in Fort William by Captain Jonathan Randall. Flogged once, and awaiting another, frightened and in pain, he had been left in solitary confinement with no company save his thoughts\u2014and this Bible, given to him by the garrison\u2019s surgeon for what comfort it might offer.</p><p>Alex MacGregor had been another young Scottish prisoner\u2014one who had died by his own hand, rather than suffer the further attentions of Captain Randall. His name was written inside the book, in a tidy, rather sprawling hand. The little Bible was no stranger to fear and suffering, and if it wasn\u2019t ether, I hoped it might still possess its own power of anodyne.</p><p>Christie had found something that suited him. He cleared his throat, straightened himself in the chair, and laid his hand on the towel, palm up, in such a forthright manner that I wondered whether he had settled on the passage in which the Maccabees willingly present their hands and tongues for amputation at the hands of the heathen king. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A peek over his shoulder indicated that he was somewhere in the Psalms, though.</p><p>\u201cAt your convenience, then, Mistress Fraser,\u201d Christie said politely.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t to be unconscious, I needed a bit of extra preparation. Manly fortitude was all very well, and so was Biblical inspiration\u2014but there are relatively few people capable of sitting motionless while having their hand sliced into, and I didn\u2019t think Thomas Christie was one of them.</p><p>I had a plentiful supply of linen strips for bandaging. I rolled back his sleeve, then used a few of the strips to bind his forearm tightly to the little table, with an additional band holding back the clawed fingers from the site of operation.</p> <p>Though Christie seemed rather shocked at the notion of drinking liquor while reading the Bible, Jamie\u2014and, just possibly, the sight of the waiting scalpels\u2014had convinced him that circumstances justified it. He had consumed a couple of ounces by the time I had him properly secured and his palm thoroughly swabbed with raw alcohol, and was looking significantly more relaxed than he had upon entering the room.</p><p>This sense of relaxation disappeared abruptly when I made the first incision.</p><p>His breath rushed out in a high-pitched gasp and he arched upward out of the chair, jerking the table across the floor with a screech. I grabbed his wrist in time to prevent his ripping the bandages away, and Jamie seized him by both shoulders, pressing him back into the chair.</p><p>\u201cNow then, now then,\u201d Jamie said, squeezing firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Tom. Aye, you\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Sweat had popped out all over Christie\u2019s face, and his eyes were huge behind the lenses of his spectacles. He gulped, swallowed, took a quick look at his hand, which was welling blood, then looked away fast, white as a sheet.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to vomit, Mr. Christie, do it there, will you?\u201d I said, shoving an empty bucket toward him with one foot. I still had one hand on his wrist, the other pressing a wad of sterilized lint hard onto the incision.</p><p>Jamie was still talking to him like one settling a panicked horse. Christie was rigid, but breathing hard, and trembling in every limb, including the one I meant to be working on.</p><p>\u201cShall I stop?\u201d I asked Jamie, giving Christie a quick appraisal. I could feel his pulse hammering in the wrist I grasped. He wasn\u2019t in shock\u2014quite\u2014but plainly wasn\u2019t feeling at all well.</p><p>Jamie shook his head, eyes on Christie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNo. Shame to waste that much whisky, aye? And he\u2019ll not want to go through the waiting again. Here, Tom, have another dram; it will do ye good.\u201d He pressed the cup to Christie\u2019s lips, and Christie gulped it without hesitation.</p><p>Jamie had let go of Christie\u2019s shoulders as he settled; now he took hold of Christie\u2019s forearm with one hand, gripping firmly. With the other, he picked up the Bible, which had fallen to the floor, and thumbed it open.</p> <p>\u201cThe right hand of the Lord is exalted,\u201d he read, squinting over Christie\u2019s shoulder at the book. \u201cThe right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. Well, that\u2019s appropriate, no?\u201d He glanced down at Christie, who had subsided, his free hand clenched in a fist against his belly.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Christie said, voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord,\u201d Jamie went on, his voice low but firm. \u201cThe Lord hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto death.\u201d</p><p>Christie seemed to find this heartening; his breathing slowed a little.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t spare time to look at him, and his arm under Jamie\u2019s grasp was hard as wood. Still, he was beginning to murmur along with Jamie, catching every few words.</p><p>\u201cOpen to me the gates of righteousness. . . I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me. . . .\u201d</p><p>I had the aponeurosis laid bare, and could clearly see the thickening. A flick of the scalpel freed the edge of it; then a ruthless slice, cutting hard down through the fibrous band of tissue . . . the scalpel struck bone, and Christie gasped.</p><p>\u201cGod is the Lord which has showed us light; bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. . . .\u201d I could hear a tinge of amusement in Jamie\u2019s voice as he read that bit, and felt the shift of his body as he glanced toward me.</p> <p>It did look rather as though I had been sacrificing something; hands don\u2019t bleed as profusely as head wounds, but there are plenty of small vessels in the palm, and I was hastily blotting away the blood with one hand as I worked with the other; discarded wads of bloodstained lint littered the table and the floor around me.</p><p>Jamie was flipping to and fro, picking out random bits of Scripture, but Christie was with him now, speaking the words along with him. I stole a hasty glance at him; his color was still bad, and his pulse thundering, but the breathing was better. He was clearly speaking from memory; the lenses of his spectacles were fogged.</p><p>I had the hindering tissue fully exposed now, and was trimming away the tiny fibers from the surface of the tendon. The clawed fingers twitched, and the exposed tendons moved suddenly, silver as darting fish. I grabbed the feebly wiggling fingers and squeezed them fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t move,\u201d I said. \u201cI need both hands; I can\u2019t hold yours.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look up, but felt him nod, and released his fingers. With the tendons gleaming softly in their beds, I removed the last bits of the aponeurosis, sprayed the wound with a mixture of alcohol and distilled water for disinfection, and set about closing the incisions.</p><p>The men\u2019s voices were no more than whispers, a low susurrus to which I had paid no attention, engrossed as I was. As I relaxed my attention and began to suture the wound, though, I became aware of them again.</p><p>\u201cThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. . . .\u201d</p><p>I looked up, wiping perspiration from my forehead with my sleeve, and saw that Thomas Christie now held the small Bible, closed and pressed against his body with his free arm. His chin jammed hard into his chest, his eyes tight closed and face contorted with pain.</p><p>Jamie still held the bound arm tight, but had his other hand on Christie\u2019s shoulder, his own head bent near Christie\u2019s; his eyes, too, were closed, as he whispered the words.</p><p>\u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. . . .\u201d</p><p>I knotted the last suture, clipped the thread, and in the same movement, cut through the linen bindings with my scissors, and let go the breath I\u2019d been holding. The men\u2019s voices stopped abruptly.</p><p>I lifted the hand, wrapped a fresh dressing tightly around it, and pressed the clawed fingers gently back, straightening them.</p><p>Christie\u2019s eyes opened, slowly. His pupils were huge and dark behind his lenses, as he blinked at his hand. I smiled at him, and patted it.</p><p>\u201cSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>TOUCH ME NOT</p><p>CHRISTIE\u2019S PULSE WAS a little rapid, but strong. I set down the wrist I had been holding, and put the back of my hand against his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit feverish,\u201d I said. \u201cHere, swallow this.\u201d I put a hand behind his back to help him sit up in bed, which alarmed him. He sat up in a flurry of bedclothes, drawing in his breath sharply as he jostled the injured hand.</p><p>I tactfully affected not to notice his discomposure, which I put down to the fact that he was clad in his shirt and I in my nightclothes. These were modest enough, to be sure, with a light shawl covering my linen night rail, but I was reasonably sure that he hadn\u2019t been anywhere near a woman in dishabille since his wife died\u2014if then.</p><p>I murmured something meaningless, holding the cup of comfrey tea for him as he drank, and then settled his pillows in comfortable but impersonal fashion.</p><p>Rather than send him back to his own cabin, I had insisted that he stay the night, so I could keep an eye on him in case of postoperative infection. Intransigent as he was by nature, I didn\u2019t by any means trust him to follow instructions and not to be slopping hogs, cutting wood, or wiping his backside with the wounded hand. I wasn\u2019t letting him out of sight until the incision had begun to granulate\u2014which it should do by the next day, if all went well.</p><p>Still shaky from the shock of surgery, he had made no demur, and Mrs. Bug and I had put him to bed in the Wemysses\u2019 room, Mr. Wemyss and Lizzie having gone to the McGillivrays\u2019.</p><p>I had no laudanum, but had slipped Christie a strong infusion of valerian and St. John\u2019s wort, and he had slept most of the afternoon. He had declined any supper, but Mrs. Bug, who approved of Mr. Christie, had been plying him through the evening with toddies, syllabubs, and other nourishing elixirs\u2014all containing a high percentage of alcohol. Consequently, he seemed rather dazed, as well as flushed, and made no protest as I picked up the bandaged hand and brought the candle close to examine it.</p><p>The hand was swollen, which was to be expected, but not excessively so. Still, the bandage was tight, and cutting uncomfortably into the flesh. I snipped it, and holding the honeyed dressing that covered the wound carefully in place, lifted the hand and sniffed at it.</p><p>I could smell honey, blood, herbs, and the faintly metallic scent of fresh-severed flesh\u2014but no sweet whiff of pus. Good. I pressed carefully near the dressing, watching for signs of sharp pain or streaks of vivid red in the skin, but bar a reasonable tenderness, I saw only a small degree of inflammation.</p><p>Still, he was feverish; it would bear watching. I took a fresh length of bandage and wound it carefully over the dressing, finishing with a neat bow at the back of the hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you never wear a proper kerch or cap?\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked up in surprise, having temporarily forgotten the man attached to the hand. I put my free hand to my head. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>I sometimes plaited my hair before bed, but hadn\u2019t tonight. I had brushed it, though, and it floated loose around my shoulders, smelling pleasantly of the hyssop and nettle-flower infusion I combed through it to keep lice at bay.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His voice rose a little. \u201cEvery woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are we back to Paul again?\u201d I murmured, returning my attention to his hand. \u201cDoes it not occur to you that that man had rather a bee in his bonnet when it came to women? Besides, I\u2019m not praying at the moment, and I want to see how this does overnight, before I risk any prophesying about it. So far, though, it seems\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair.\u201d I looked up to see him staring at me, mouth curved downward in disapproval. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d He made a vague movement round his own clipped poll. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of it,\u201d he ended, rather feebly.</p><p>I eyed him for a moment, then put down his hand and reached for the little green Bible, which was sitting on the table.</p><p>\u201cCorinthians, was it? Hmm, oh, yes, here we are.\u201d I straightened my back and read the verse: \u201cDoth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.\u201d I closed the book with a snap and set it down.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to step across the landing and explain to my husband how shameful his hair is?\u201d I asked politely. Jamie had gone to bed; a faint, rhythmic snoring was audible from our room. \u201cOr do you expect he knows that already?\u201d</p><p>Christie was already flushed from drink and fever; at this, an ugly dark red washed him from chest to hairline. His mouth moved, opening and closing soundlessly. I didn\u2019t wait for him to decide on something to say, but merely turned my attention back to his hand.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I said firmly, \u201cyou must do exercise regularly, to make sure that the muscles don\u2019t contract as they heal. It will be painful at first, but you must do it. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>I took hold of his ring finger, just below the first joint, and keeping the finger itself straight, bent the top joint a little inward.</p><p>\u201cDo you see? Here, you do it. Take hold with your other hand, and then try to bend just that one joint. Yes, that\u2019s it. Do you feel the pull, down through the palm of your hand? That\u2019s just what\u2019s wanted. Now, do it with the little finger . . . yes. Yes, that\u2019s very good!\u201d</p><p>I looked up and smiled at him. The flush had faded a little, but he still looked thoroughly nonplussed. He didn\u2019t smile back at me, but glanced hastily away, down at his hand.</p><p>\u201cRight. Now, put your hand flat on the table\u2014yes, that\u2019s the way\u2014and try to raise your fourth finger and little finger by themselves. Yes, I know it isn\u2019t easy. Keep trying, though. Are you hungry, Mr. Christie?\u201d</p><p>His stomach had given a loud growl, startling him as much as me.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I might eat,\u201d he mumbled ungraciously, scowling at his uncooperative hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch you something. Keep trying those exercises for a bit, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The house was quiet, settled for the night. Warm as it was, the shutters had been left open, and enough moonlight streamed through the windows that I didn\u2019t need to light a candle. A shadow detached itself from the darkness in my surgery, and followed me down the hallway to the kitchen\u2014Adso, leaving off his nocturnal hunt for mice, in hopes of easier prey.</p><p>\u201cHallo, cat,\u201d I said, as he slithered past my ankles into the pantry. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re having any of the ham, think again. I might go as far as a saucer of milk, though.\u201d The milk jug was white earthenware with a blue band round it, a squat, pale shape floating in the darkness. I poured out a saucer and put it down on the floor for Adso, then set about assembling a light supper\u2014aware that Scottish expectations of a light meal involved sufficient food to founder a horse.</p><p>\u201cHam, cold fried potatoes, cold fried mush, bread and butter,\u201d I chanted under my breath, shoveling it all onto a large wooden tray. \u201cRabbit dumpling, tomato pickle, a bit of raisin pie for pudding . . . what else?\u201d I glanced down toward the soft lapping noises coming from the shadows at my feet. \u201cI\u2019d give him milk, too, but he wouldn\u2019t drink it. Well, we might as well keep on as we\u2019ve started, I suppose; it will help him to sleep.\u201d I reached for the whisky decanter and put that on the tray, as well.</p><p>A faint scent of ether floated in the dark air of the hallway as I made my way back toward the stairs. I sniffed suspiciously\u2014had Adso tipped over the bottle? No, it wasn\u2019t strong enough for that, I decided, just a few wayward molecules seeping around the cork.</p><p>I was simultaneously relieved and regretful that Mr. Christie had refused to let me use the ether. Relieved, because there was no telling how it might have worked\u2014or not. Regretful, because I would have liked very much to add the gift of unconsciousness to my arsenal of skills\u2014a precious gift to bestow on future patients, and one I should very much have liked to give Mr. Christie.</p><p>Beyond the fact that the surgery had hurt him badly, it was very much more difficult to operate on a conscious person. The muscles were tensed, adrenaline was flooding through the system, heart rate was vastly speeded up, causing blood to spurt rather than flow. . . . For the dozenth time since the morning, I envisioned exactly what I had done, asking myself whether I might have done better.</p><p>To my surprise, Christie was still doing the exercises; his face was sheened with sweat and his mouth set grimly, but he was still doggedly bending the joints.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good,\u201d I said. \u201cDo stop now, though. I don\u2019t want you to start bleeding again.\u201d I picked up the napkin automatically and blotted the sweat from his temples.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else in the house?\u201d he asked, irritably jerking his head away from my ministrations. \u201cI heard you speaking to someone downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, rather embarrassed. \u201cNo, just the cat.\u201d Prompted by this introduction, Adso, who had followed me upstairs, leapt onto the bed and stood kneading the covers with his paws, big green eyes fixed on the plate of ham.</p><p>Christie turned a gaze of deep suspicion from the cat to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, he is not my familiar,\u201d I said tartly, scooping up Adso and dumping him unceremoniously on the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s a cat. Talking to him is slightly less ridiculous than talking to myself, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>An expression of surprise flitted across Christie\u2019s face\u2014perhaps surprise that I had read his mind, or simple surprise at my idiocy\u2014but the creases of suspicion round his eyes relaxed.</p><p>I cut up his food with brisk efficiency, but he insisted upon feeding himself. He ate clumsily with his left hand, eyes on his plate and brows knotted in concentration.</p><p>When he had finished, he drank off a cup of whisky as though it were water, set down the empty cup, and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cMistress Fraser,\u201d he said, speaking very precisely, \u201cI am an educated man. I do not think ye are a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t?\u201d I said, rather amused. \u201cSo you don\u2019t believe in witches? But there are witches mentioned in the Bible, you know.\u201d</p><p>He stifled a belch with his fist and regarded me fishily.</p><p>\u201cI did not say I do not believe in witches. I do. I said ye aren\u2019t one. Aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very much obliged to hear it,\u201d I said, trying not to smile. He was quite drunk; though his speech was even more precise than usual, his accent had begun to slip. Normally, he suppressed the inflections of his native Edinburgh as much as possible, but it was growing broader by the moment.</p><p>\u201cA bit more?\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for an answer, but poured a solid tot of whisky into his empty cup. The shutters were open and the room was cool, but sweat still gleamed in the creases of his neck. He was clearly in pain, and wasn\u2019t likely to sleep again without help.</p><p>He sipped it this time, watching me over the rim of the cup as I tidied up the supper leavings. In spite of whisky and a full stomach, he was increasingly restive, shifting his legs beneath the quilt and twitching his shoulders. I thought he needed the chamber pot, and was debating whether I ought to offer to help him with it, or simply leave promptly so he could manage by himself. The latter, I thought.</p><p>I was mistaken, though. Before I could excuse myself, he set down his cup on the table and sat up straight in bed.</p><p>\u201cMistress Fraser,\u201d he said, fixing me with a beady eye. \u201cI wish to apologize to ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d I said, startled.</p><p>His lips pressed tight.</p><p>\u201cFor . . . my behavior this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . . that\u2019s quite all right. I can see how the idea of being put to sleep must seem . . . quite peculiar to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean that.\u201d He glanced up sharply, then down again. \u201cI meant . . . that I . . . could not keep myself still.\u201d</p><p>I saw the deepening flush rise up his cheeks again, and had a sudden pang of surprised sympathy. He was truly embarrassed.</p><p>I set down the tray and sat down slowly on the stool beside him, wondering what I could say that might assuage his feelings\u2014and not make matters worse.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mr. Christie,\u201d I said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to hold still while having their hand taken apart. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s simply not human nature!\u201d</p><p>He shot me a quick, fierce glance.</p><p>\u201cNot even your husband?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, taken aback. Not so much by the words, as by the tone of bitterness. Roger had told me a bit of what Kenny Lindsay had said about Ardsmuir. It had been no secret that Christie had been envious of Jamie\u2019s leadership then\u2014but what had that to do with this?</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d I asked quietly. I took his injured hand, ostensibly to check the bindings\u2014in fact, merely to give me somewhere to look other than into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, aye? Your husband\u2019s hand.\u201d His beard jutted pugnaciously at me. \u201cHe said ye\u2019d mended it for him. He didna wriggle and squirm when ye did it, now, did he?\u201d</p><p>Well, no, he hadn\u2019t. Jamie had prayed, cursed, sweated, cried\u2014and screamed, once or twice. But he hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand wasn\u2019t a matter I wanted to discuss with Thomas Christie, though.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s different,\u201d I said, giving him as straight a look as I could. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe wouldna expect any man to do as well as him. Aye, I ken that.\u201d The dull red color was burning in his cheeks again, and he looked down at his bandaged hand. The fingers of his good hand were clenched in a fist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d I protested. \u201cNot at all! I\u2019ve stitched wounds and set bones for a good many men\u2014almost all the Highlanders were terribly brave about\u2014\u201d It occurred to me, that fraction of a second too late, that Christie was not a Highlander.</p><p>He made a deep growling noise in his throat.</p><p>\u201cHighlanders,\u201d he said, \u201chmp!\u201d in a tone that made it clear he would have liked to spit on the floor, had he not been in the presence of a lady.</p><p>\u201cBarbarians?\u201d I said, responding to the tone. He glanced at me, and I saw his mouth twist, as he had his own moment of belated realization. He looked away, and took a deep breath\u2014I smelled the gust of whisky as he let it out.</p><p>\u201cYour husband . . . is . . . certainly a gentleman. He comes of a noble family, if one tainted by treason.\u201d The \u201cr\u201ds of \u201ctreason\u201d rolled like thunder\u2014he really was quite drunk. \u201cBut he is also . . . also . . .\u201d He frowned, groping for a better word, then gave it up. \u201cOne of them. Surely ye ken that, and you an Englishwoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them,\u201d I repeated, mildly amused. \u201cYou mean a Highlander, or a barbarian?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look somewhere between triumph and puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cThe same thing, is it not?\u201d</p><p>I rather thought he had a point. While I had met Highlanders of wealth and education, like Colum and Dougal MacKenzie\u2014to say nothing of Jamie\u2019s grandfather, the treasonous Lord Lovat to whom Christie was referring\u2014the fact was that every single one of them had the instincts of a Viking freebooter. And to be perfectly honest, so did Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . well, they, um, do tend to be rather . . .\u201d I began feebly. I rubbed a finger under my nose. \u201cWell, they are raised to be fighting men, I suppose. Or is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, and shook his head a little, though I thought it was not in disagreement, but simply in dismay at the contemplation of Highland customs and manners.</p><p>Mr. Christie was himself well-educated, the son of a self-made Edinburgh merchant. As such, he had pretensions\u2014painful ones\u2014to being a gentleman\u2014but would obviously never make a proper barbarian. I could see why Highlanders both puzzled and annoyed him. What must it have been like, I wondered, for him to find himself imprisoned alongside a horde of uncouth\u2014by his standards\u2014violent, flamboyant, Catholic barbarians, treated\u2014or mistreated\u2014as one of them?</p><p>He had leaned back a little on his pillow, eyes closed and mouth compressed. Without opening his eyes, he asked suddenly, \u201cD\u2019ye ken that your husband bears the stripes of flogging?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply tartly that I had been married to Jamie for nearly thirty years\u2014when I realized that the question implied something about the nature of Mr. Christie\u2019s own concept of marriage that I didn\u2019t want to consider too closely.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said instead, briefly, with a quick glance toward the open door. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Christie opened his eyes, which were a little unfocused. With some effort, he brought his gaze to bear on me.</p><p>\u201cYe know why?\u201d he asked, slurring a little. \u201cWha\u2019 he did?\u201d</p><p>I felt heat rise in my cheeks, on Jamie\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cAt Ardsmuir,\u201d Christie said before I could answer, leveling a finger at me. He poked it at the air, almost in accusation. \u201cHe claimed a bit of tartan, aye? Forbidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d I said, in baffled reflex. \u201cI mean\u2014did he?\u201d</p><p>Christie shook his head slowly back and forth, looking like a large, intoxicated owl, eyes fixed now and glaring.</p><p>\u201cNot his,\u201d he said. \u201cA young lad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak further, but only a soft belch emerged from it, surprising him. He closed his mouth and blinked, then tried again.</p><p>\u201cIt was an act of extra . . . extraordinary . . . nobility and\u2014and courage.\u201d He looked at me, and shook his head slightly. \u201cIm\u2014incompre . . . hensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncomprehensible? How he did it, you mean?\u201d I knew how, all right; Jamie was so bloody-mindedly stubborn that he would see out any action he intended, no matter whether hell itself barred the way or what happened to him in the process. But surely Christie knew that about him.</p><p>\u201cNot how.\u201d Christie\u2019s head lolled a little, and he pulled it upright with an effort. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I wanted to say, Because he\u2019s an effing hero, that\u2019s why; he can\u2019t help it\u2014but that wouldn\u2019t really have been right. Besides, I didn\u2019t know why Jamie had done it; he hadn\u2019t told me, and I did wonder why not.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d do anything to protect one of his men,\u201d I said instead.</p><p>Christie\u2019s gaze was rather glassy, but still intelligent; he looked at me for a long moment, unspeaking, thoughts passing slowly behind his eyes. A floorboard in the hall creaked, and I strained my ears for Jamie\u2019s breathing. Yes, I could hear it, soft and regular; he was still asleep.</p><p>\u201cDoes he think that I am one of \u2018his men\u2019?\u201d Christie asked at last. His voice was low, but full of both incredulity and outrage. \u201cBecause I am not, I ass\u2014ashure you!\u201d</p><p>I began to think that last glass of whisky had been a grave mistake.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said with a sigh, repressing the urge to close my eyes and rub my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t. If you mean that\u201d\u2014I nodded at the little Bible\u2014\u201cI\u2019m sure it was simple kindness. He\u2019d do as much for any stranger\u2014you would yourself, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He breathed heavily for a bit, glaring, but then nodded once and lay back, as though exhausted\u2014as well he might be. All the belligerence had gone out of him as suddenly as air from a balloon, and he looked somehow smaller, and rather forlorn.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said softly. He lifted his bandaged hand a little, and let it fall.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was apologizing for his remarks about Jamie, or for what he saw as his lack of bravery in the morning. I thought it wiser not to inquire, though, and stood up, smoothing down the linen night rail over my thighs.</p><p>I pulled the quilt up a bit and tugged it straight, then blew out the candle. He was no more than a dark shape against the pillows, his breathing slow and hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYou did very well,\u201d I whispered, and patted his shoulder. \u201cGood night, Mr. Christie.\u201d</p><p>MY PERSONAL BARBARIAN was asleep, but woke, catlike, when I crawled into bed. He stretched out an arm and gathered me into himself with a sleepily interrogative \u201cmmmm?\u201d</p><p>I nestled against him, tight muscles beginning to relax automatically into his warmth.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And how\u2019s our wee Tom, then?\u201d He leaned back a little and his big hands came down on my trapezius, kneading the knots from my neck and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh. Obnoxious, prickly, censorious, and very drunk. Otherwise, fine. Oh, yes. More, please\u2014up a bit, oh, yes. Oooh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, that sounds like Tom at his best\u2014bar the drunkenness. If ye groan like that, Sassenach, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m rubbing something other than your neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not care,\u201d I said, eyes closed, the better to appreciate the exquisite sensations vibrating through my spinal column. \u201cI\u2019ve had quite enough of Tom Christie for the moment. Besides, he\u2019s likely passed out by now, with as much as he\u2019s had to drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, I tempered my vocal response, in the interests of my patient\u2019s rest.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that Bible come from?\u201d I asked, though the answer was obvious. Jenny must have sent it from Lallybroch; her last parcel had arrived a few days before, while I was visiting Salem.</p><p>Jamie answered the question I\u2019d really asked, sighing so his breath stirred my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt gave me a queer turn to see it, when I came to it among the books my sister sent. I couldna quite decide what to do with it, aye?\u201d</p> <p>Little wonder if it had given him a turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she send it, did she say?\u201d My shoulders were beginning to relax, the ache between them dulling. I felt him shrug behind me.</p><p>\u201cShe sent it with some other books; said she was turning out the attic and found a box of them, so decided to send them to me. But she did mention hearing that the village of Kildennie had decided to emigrate to North Carolina; they\u2019re all MacGregors up near there, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Jamie had once told me that his intention was one day to find the mother of Alex MacGregor, and give her his Bible, with the information that her son had been avenged. He had made inquiries after Culloden, but discovered that both of the MacGregor parents were dead. Only a sister remained alive, and she had married and left her home; no one knew quite where she was, or even whether she was still in Scotland.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Jenny\u2014or Ian, rather\u2014found the sister at last? And she lived in that village?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged again, and with a final squeeze of my shoulders, left off.</p><p>\u201cIt may be. Ye ken Jenny; she\u2019d leave it to me whether to search for the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you?\u201d I rolled over to face him. Alex MacGregor had hanged himself, rather than live as prey to Black Jack Randall. Jack Randall was dead, had died at Culloden. But Jamie\u2019s memories of Culloden were no more than fragments, driven from him by the trauma of the battle and the fever he had suffered afterward. He had waked, wounded, with Jack Randall\u2019s body lying on top of him\u2014but had no recollection of what had happened.</p><p>And yet, I supposed, Alex MacGregor had been avenged\u2014whether or not by Jamie\u2019s hand.</p><p>He thought about that for a moment, and I felt the small stirring as he tapped the two stiff fingers of his right hand against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d he said finally. \u201cHer name was Mairi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be more than, oh . . . three or four hundred women named Mairi in North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh, and we drifted off to sleep, to the accompaniment of Tom Christie\u2019s stertorous snores across the hall.</p><p>IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN minutes or hours later that I woke suddenly, listening. The room was dark, the fire cold on the hearth, and the shutters rattling faintly. I tensed a little, trying to wake enough to rise and go to my patient\u2014but then heard him, a long wheezing inspiration, followed by a rumbling snore.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that that had wakened me, I realized. It was the sudden silence beside me. Jamie was lying stiff beside me, scarcely breathing.</p><p>I put out a hand slowly, so he would not be shocked at the touch, and rested it on his leg. He hadn\u2019t had nightmares for some months, but I recognized the signs.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He drew breath a little deeper than usual, and his body seemed momentarily to draw in upon itself. I didn\u2019t move, but left my hand on his leg, feeling the muscle flex microscopically beneath my fingers, a tiny intimation of flight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t flee, though. He moved his shoulders in a brief, violent twitch, then let out his breath and settled into the mattress. He didn\u2019t speak for a bit, but his weight drew me closer, like a moon pulled near to its planet. I lay quiet, my hand on him, my hip against his\u2014flesh of his flesh.</p> <p>He stared upward, into the shadows between the beams. I could see the line of his profile, and the shine of his eyes as he blinked now and then.</p><p>\u201cIn the dark . . .\u201d he whispered at last, \u201cthere at Ardsmuir, we lay in the dark. Sometimes there was a moon, or starlight, but even then, ye couldna see anything on the floor where we lay. It was naught but black\u2014but ye could hear.\u201d</p><p>Hear the breathing of the forty men in the cell, and the shuffles and shifts of their movement. Snores, coughing, the sounds of restless sleep\u2014and the small furtive sounds from those who lay awake.</p><p>\u201cIt would be weeks, and we wouldna think of it.\u201d His voice was coming easier now. \u201cWe were always starved, cold. Worn to the bone. Ye dinna think much, then; only of how to put one foot in front of another, lift another stone. . . . Ye dinna really want to think, ken? And it\u2019s easy enough not to. For a time.\u201d</p><p>But every now and then, something would change. The fog of exhaustion would lift, suddenly, without warning.</p><p>\u201cSometimes ye kent what it was\u2014a story someone told, maybe, or a letter that came from someone\u2019s wife or sister. Sometimes it came out of nowhere; no one said a thing, but ye\u2019d wake to it, in the night, like the smell of a woman lying next to ye.\u201d</p><p>Memory, longing . . . need. They became men touched by fire\u2014roused from dull acceptance by the sudden searing recollection of loss.</p><p>\u201cEveryone would go a bit mad, for a time. There would be fights, all the time. And at night, in the dark . . .\u201d</p><p>At night, you would hear the sounds of desperation, stifled sobs or stealthy rustlings. Some men would, in the end, reach out to another\u2014sometimes to be rebuffed with shouts and blows. Sometimes not.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what he was trying to tell me, nor what it had to do with Thomas Christie. Or, perhaps, Lord John Grey.</p><p>\u201cDid any of them ever . . . touch you?\u201d I asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cNo. None of them would ever think to touch me,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cI was their chief. They loved me\u2014but they wouldna think, ever, to touch me.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep, ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you want them to?\u201d I whispered. I could feel my own pulse begin to throb in my fingertips, against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI hungered for it,\u201d he said so softly I could barely hear him, close as I was. \u201cMore than food. More than sleep\u2014though I wished most desperately for sleep, and not only for the sake of tiredness. For when I slept, sometimes I saw ye.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasna the longing for a woman\u2014though Christ knows, that was bad enough. It was only\u2014I wanted the touch of a hand. Only that.\u201d</p><p>His skin had ached with need, \u2019til he felt it must grow transparent, and the raw soreness of his heart be seen in his chest.</p><p>He made a small rueful sound, not quite a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYe ken those pictures of the Sacred Heart\u2014the same as we saw in Paris?\u201d</p><p>I knew them\u2014Renaissance paintings, and the vividness of stained glass glowing in the aisles of Notre Dame. The Man of Sorrows, his heart exposed and pierced, radiant with love.</p><p>\u201cI remembered that. And I thought to myself that whoever saw that vision of Our Lord was likely a verra lonely man himself, to have understood so well.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my hand and laid it on the small hollow in the center of his chest, very lightly. The sheet was thrown back, and his skin was cool.</p><p>He closed his eyes, sighing, and clasped my hand, hard.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of that would come to me sometimes, and I would think I kent what Jesus must feel like there\u2014so wanting, and no one to touch Him.\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>ASHES TO ASHES</p><p>JAMIE CHECKED HIS SADDLEBAGS once more, though he had done it so often of late that the exercise was little more than custom. Each time he opened the left-hand one, he still smiled, though. Brianna had remade it for him, stitching in loops of leather that presented his pistols, hilt up, ready to be seized in an emergency, and a clever arrangement of compartments that held handy his shot pouch, powder horn, a spare knife, a coil of fishing line, a roll of twine for a snare, a hussif with pins, needles, and thread, a packet of food, a bottle of beer, and a neatly rolled clean shirt.</p><p>On the outside of the bag was a small pouch that held what Bree was pleased to call a \u201cfirst-aid kit,\u201d though he was unsure what it was meant to be in aid of. It contained several gauze packets of a bitter-smelling tea, a tin of salve, and several strips of her adhesive plaster, none of which seemed likely to be of use in any imaginable misadventure, but did no harm.</p><p>He removed a cake of soap she had added, along with a few more unnecessary fripperies, and carefully hid them under a bucket, lest she be offended.</p><p>Just in time, too; he heard her voice, exhorting wee Roger about the inclusion of sufficient clean stockings in his bags. By the time they came round the corner of the hay barn, he had everything securely buckled up.</p><p>\u201cReady, then, a charaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Roger nodded, and slung the saddlebags he was carrying on his shoulder off onto the ground. He turned to Bree, who was carrying Jemmy, and kissed her briefly.</p><p>\u201cI go with you, Daddy!\u201d Jem exclaimed hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna see Indians!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, perhaps, when ye\u2019re bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk Indian! Uncle Ian tellt me! Wanna go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Bree told him firmly, but he wasn\u2019t inclined to listen, and began struggling to get down. Jamie made a small rumble in his throat, and fixed him with a quelling eye.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve heard your parents,\u201d he said. Jem glowered, and stuck out his lower lip like a shelf, but ceased his fuss.</p><p>\u201cSomeday ye must tell me how ye do that,\u201d Roger said, eyeing his offspring.</p><p>Jamie laughed, and leaned down to Jemmy. \u201cKiss Grandda goodbye, eh?\u201d</p><p>Disappointment generously abandoned, Jemmy reached up and seized him round the neck. He picked the little boy up out of Brianna\u2019s arms, hugged him, and kissed him. Jem smelled of parritch, toast, and honey, a homely warm and heavy weight in his arms.</p><p>\u201cBe good and mind your mother, aye? And when ye\u2019re a wee bit bigger, ye\u2019ll come, too. Come and say farewell to Clarence; ye can tell him the words Uncle Ian taught ye.\u201d And God willing, they\u2019d be words suitable for a three-year-old child. Ian had a most irresponsible sense of humor.</p><p>Or perhaps, he thought, grinning to himself, I\u2019m only recalling some o\u2019 the things I taught Jenny\u2019s bairns\u2014including Ian\u2014to say in French.</p><p>He\u2019d already saddled and bridled Roger\u2019s horse, and Clarence the pack mule was fully loaded. Brianna was checking the girth and stirrup leathers while Roger slung his saddlebags\u2014more to keep herself busy than because of any need. Her lower lip was caught in her teeth; she was being careful not to seem worried, but was fooling no one.</p><p>Jamie took Jem up to pat the mule\u2019s nose, in order to give the lass and her man a moment\u2019s privacy. Clarence was a good sort, and suffered Jem\u2019s enthusiastic patting and mispronounced Cherokee phrases with long-suffering tolerance, but when Jem turned in his arms toward Gideon, Jamie leaned back sharply.</p><p>\u201cNay, lad, ye dinna want to touch yon wicked bugger. He\u2019ll take your hand right off.\u201d</p><p>Gideon twitched his ears and stamped once, impatient. The big stallion was dying to get under way and have another chance at killing him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep that vicious thing?\u201d Brianna asked, seeing Gideon\u2019s long lip wrinkle back to show his yellow teeth in anticipation. She took Jemmy from him, stepping well away from Gideon.</p><p>\u201cWhat, wee Gideon? Oh, we get on. Besides, he\u2019s half my trade goods, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She gave the big chestnut a suspicious glance. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t start a war, giving the Indians something like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I dinna mean to give him to them,\u201d he assured her. \u201cNot directly, at least.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was a bad-tempered, thrawn-headed reester of a horse, with a mouth like iron and a will to match. However, these unsociable qualities seemed most appealing to the Indians, as did the stallion\u2019s massive chest, long wind, and stoutly muscled frame. When Quiet Air, the sachem in one of the villages, had offered him three deerskins for the chance to breed his spotted mare to Gideon, Jamie had realized suddenly that he had something here.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas the greatest good fortune that I never found the time to castrate him,\u201d he said, slapping Gideon familiarly on the withers and dodging by reflex as the stallion whipped his head round to snap. \u201cHe earns his keep, and more, standing at stud to the Indian ponies. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever asked him to do that he\u2019s not balked at.\u201d</p><p>The lass was pink as a Christmas rose from the morning cold; she laughed at that, though, going an even deeper color.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s castrate?\u201d Jemmy inquired.</p><p>\u201cYour mother will tell ye.\u201d He grinned at her, ruffled Jemmy\u2019s hair, and turned to Roger. \u201cReady, lad?\u201d</p><p>Roger Mac nodded and stepped up into his stirrup, swinging aboard. He had a steady old bay gelding named Agrippa, who tended to grunt and wheeze, but was sound enough for all that, and good for a rider like Roger\u2014competent enough, but with an abiding sense of inner reservation about horses.</p><p>Roger leaned down from the saddle for a last kiss from Brianna, and they were under way. Jamie\u2019d taken a private\u2014and thorough\u2014leave of Claire earlier.</p><p>She was in the window of their bedroom, watching out to wave to them as they rode past, her hairbrush in her hand. Her hair was standing out in a great curly swash round her head, and the early-morning sun caught in it like flames in a thornbush. It gave him a sudden queer feeling to see her thus so disordered, half-naked in her shift. A sense of strong desire, despite what he\u2019d done to her not an hour past. And something almost fear, as though he might never see her again.</p><p>Quite without thought, he glanced at his left hand, and saw the ghost of the scar at the base of his thumb, the \u201cC\u201d so faded that it was scarcely visible. He had not noticed it or thought of it in years, and felt suddenly as though there was not air enough to breathe.</p><p>He waved, though, and she threw him a mocking kiss, laughing. Christ, he\u2019d marked her; he could see the dark patch of the love bite he\u2019d left on her neck, and a hot flush of embarrassment rose in his face. He dug his heels into Gideon\u2019s side, causing the stallion to give a squeal of displeasure and turn round to try to bite him in the leg.</p><p>With this distraction, they were safe away. He looked back only once, at the trailhead, to see her still there, framed by light. She lifted one hand, as though in benediction, and then the trees hid her from sight.</p><p>THE WEATHER WAS FAIR, though cold for as early in the autumn as it was; the horses\u2019 breath steamed as they made their way down from the Ridge through the tiny settlement folk now called Cooperville, and along the Great Buffalo Trail to the north. He kept an eye on the sky; it was much too early for snow, but heavy rains were not uncommon. What clouds there were were mare\u2019s tails, though; no cause for worry.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak much, each man alone with his thoughts. Roger Mac was easy company, for the most part. Jamie did miss Ian, though; he would have liked to talk over the situation as it stood now with Tsisqua. Ian understood the minds of Indians better than most white men, and while Jamie understood Bird\u2019s gesture of sending the hermit\u2019s bones well enough\u2014it was meant as a proof of his continuing goodwill toward settlers, if the King should send them guns\u2014he would have valued Ian\u2019s opinion.</p><p>And while it was necessary that he introduce Roger Mac in the villages, for the sake of future relations . . . Well, he blushed at the thought of having to explain to the man about . . .</p><p>Damn Ian. The lad had simply gone in the night, a few days past, him and his dog. He\u2019d done it before, and would doubtless be back as suddenly as he\u2019d gone. Whatever darkness he\u2019d brought back from the north would now and then become too much for him, and he would vanish into the wood, coming back silent and withdrawn, but somewhat more at peace with himself.</p><p>Jamie understood it well enough; solitude was in its own way a balm for loneliness. And whatever memory the lad was fleeing\u2014or seeking\u2014in the wood . . .</p><p>\u201cHas he ever spoken to you about them?\u201d Claire had asked him, troubled. \u201cHis wife? His child?\u201d</p><p>He had not. Ian did not speak of anything about his time among the Mohawk, and the only token he had brought back from the north was an armlet, made of blue-and-white wampum shells. Jamie had caught a glimpse of it in Ian\u2019s sporran once, but not enough to tell the pattern of it.</p><p>Blessed Michael defend you, lad, he thought silently toward Ian. And may the angels mend you.</p><p>With one thing and another, he had no real conversation with Roger Mac until they\u2019d stopped for their noon meal. They ate the fresh stuff the women had sent, enjoying it. Enough for supper left; next day, it would be corn dodgers and anything that came across their path that could be easily caught and cooked. And one day more, and the Snowbird women would have them royally fed, as representatives of the King of England.</p><p>\u201cLast time, it was ducks, stuffed wi\u2019 yams and corn,\u201d he told Roger. \u201cIt\u2019s manners to eat as much as ye can, mind, no matter what\u2019s served, and ye\u2019re the guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Roger smiled faintly, then looked down at the half-eaten sausage roll in his hand. \u201cAbout that. Guests, I mean. There\u2019s a wee problem, I think\u2014with Hiram Crombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiram?\u201d Jamie was surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s to do wi\u2019 Hiram?\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s mouth twitched, unsure whether to laugh or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s only\u2014ye ken everybody\u2019s calling the bones we buried Ephraim, aye? It\u2019s all Bree\u2019s fault, but there it is.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, curious.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. Yesterday Hiram came along to me, and said he\u2019d been studying upon the matter\u2014praying and the like\u2014and had come to the conclusion that if it were true that some of the Indians were his wife\u2019s kin, then it stood to reason that some of them must be saved, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Amusement began to kindle in his own breast.</p><p>\u201cYes. And so, he says, he feels called upon to bring these hapless savages the word of Christ. For how else are they to hear it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a knuckle over his upper lip, torn now between amusement and dismay at the thought of Hiram Crombie invading the Cherokee villages, psalmbook in hand.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, but . . . do ye not believe\u2014Presbyterians, I mean\u2014that it\u2019s all predestined? That some are saved, I mean, and some damned, and not a thing to be done about it? Which is why the Papists are all bound for hell in a handbasket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . well . . .\u201d Roger hesitated, clearly not quite willing to put the matter so baldly himself. \u201cMmphm. There may be some difference of opinion among Presbyterians, I imagine. But yes, that\u2019s more or less what Hiram and his cohorts think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, then, if he thinks some o\u2019 the Indians must be saved already, why must they be preached to?\u201d</p><p>Roger rubbed a finger between his brows.</p><p>\u201cWell, d\u2019ye see, it\u2019s the same reason Presbyterians pray and go to kirk and all. Even if they\u2019re saved, they feel they want to praise God for it, and\u2014and learn to do better, so as to live as God wishes them to. In gratitude for their salvation, see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather think Hiram Crombie\u2019s God might take a dim view of the Indian way of living,\u201d Jamie said, with vivid memories of nak*d bodies in the dimness of ember glow, and the smell of furs.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Roger said, catching Claire\u2019s dry tone so exactly that Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see the difficulty,\u201d he said, and he did, though he still found it funny. \u201cSo Hiram means to go to the Cherokee villages and preach? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, swallowing a bit of sausage.</p><p>\u201cTo be more exact, he wants you to take him there. And make introduction for him. He wouldna expect ye to interpret the preaching, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God.\u201d He took a moment to contemplate this prospect, then shook his head decidedly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Roger pulled the cork from a bottle of beer, and offered it to him. \u201cI just thought I should tell ye, so ye can decide best what to say to him when he asks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra thoughtful of ye,\u201d Jamie said, and taking the bottle, drank deeply.</p><p>He lowered it, took breath\u2014and froze. He saw Roger Mac\u2019s head turn sharply and knew he had caught it, too, borne on the chilly breeze.</p><p>Roger Mac turned back to him, black brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cDo ye smell something burning?\u201d he said.</p><p>ROGER HEARD THEM first: a raucous caucus of cries and cackles, shrill as witches. Then a clappering of wings as they came in sight, and the birds flew up, mostly crows, but here and there a huge black raven.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Two bodies hung from a tree beside the house. What was left of them. He could tell that it was a man and a woman, but only by their clothes. A piece of paper was pinned to the man\u2019s leg, so crumpled and stained that he saw it only because one edge lifted in the breeze.</p><p>Jamie ripped it off, unfolded it enough to read, and threw it on the ground. Death to Regulators, it read; he saw the scrawl for an instant, before the wind blew it away.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the bairns?\u201d Jamie asked, turning sharply to him. \u201cThese folk have children. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>The ashes were cold, already scattering in the wind, but the smell of burning filled him, clogged his breathing, seared his throat so that words rasped like gravel, meaningless as the scrape of pebbles underfoot. Roger tried to speak, cleared his throat, and spat.</p><p>\u201cHiding, maybe,\u201d he rasped, and flung out an arm toward the wood.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe.\u201d Jamie stood abruptly, called into the wood, and, not waiting for an answer, set off into the trees, calling again.</p><p>Roger followed, sheering off as they reached the forest\u2019s edge, going upslope behind the house, both of them shouting words of reassurance that were swallowed up at once by the forest\u2019s silence.</p><p>Roger stumbled through the trees, sweating, panting, heedless of the pain in his throat as he shouted, barely stopping long enough to hear if anyone answered. Several times he saw movement from the corner of his eye and swung toward it, only to see nothing but the ripple of wind through a patch of drying sedges, or a dangling creeper, swaying as though someone had passed that way.</p><p>He half-imagined he was seeing Jem, playing at hide-and-seek, and the vision of a darting foot, sun gleaming off a small head, lent him strength to shout again, and yet again. At last, though, he was forced to admit that children would not have run so far, and he circled back toward the cabin, still calling intermittently, in hoarse, strangled croaks.</p><p>He came back into the dooryard to find Jamie stooping for a rock, which he threw with great force at a pair of ravens that had settled in the hanging tree, edging bright-eyed back toward its burden. The ravens squawked and flapped away\u2014but only so far as the next tree, where they sat watching.</p><p>The day was cold, but both of them were soaked with sweat, hair straggling wet on their necks. Jamie wiped his face with his sleeve, still breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cH-how many . . . children?\u201d Roger\u2019s own breath was short, his throat so raw that the words were barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThree, at least.\u201d Jamie coughed, hawked, and spat. \u201cThe eldest is twelve, maybe.\u201d He stood for a moment, looking at the bodies. Then he crossed himself and drew his dirk to cut them down.</p><p>They had nothing to dig with; the best that could be managed was a wide scrape in the leaf mold of the forest, and a thin cairn of rocks, as much to spite the ravens as for the sake of decency.</p><p>\u201cWere they Regulators?\u201d Roger asked, pausing in the midst of it to wipe his face on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cAye, but . . .\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice trailed away. \u201cIt\u2019s naught to do wi\u2019 that business.\u201d He shook his head and turned away to gather more rocks.</p><p>Roger thought it was a rock at first, half-hidden in the leaves that had drifted against the scorched cabin wall. He touched it, and it moved, bringing him to his feet with a cry that would have done credit to any of the corbies.</p><p>Jamie reached him in seconds, in time to help dig the little girl out of the leaves and cinders.</p><p>\u201cHush, a muirninn, hush,\u201d Jamie said urgently, though in fact the child was not crying. She was maybe eight, her clothes and hair burned away and her skin so blackened and cracked that she might have been made of stone indeed, save for her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, oh, God.\u201d Roger kept saying it, under his breath, long after it became clear that if it was a prayer, it was long past answering.</p><p>He was cradling her against his chest, and her eyes opened halfway, regarding him with nothing like relief or curiosity\u2014only a calm fatality.</p><p>Jamie had poured water from his canteen onto a handkerchief; he fed the tip of it between her lips to wet them, and Roger saw her throat move in reflex as she sucked.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Roger whispered to her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, a leannan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has done this, a nighean?\u201d Jamie asked, just as gently. Roger saw that she understood; the question stirred the surface of her eyes like wind on a pond\u2014but then passed over, leaving them calm again. She did not speak, no matter what questions they asked, only looked at them with incurious eyes, and went on sucking dreamily at the wet cloth.</p><p>\u201cAre ye baptized, a leannan?\u201d Jamie asked her at last, and Roger felt a deep jolt at the question. In the shock of finding her, he had not truly taken in her condition.</p><p>\u201cElle ne peut pas vivre,\u201d Jamie said softly, his eyes meeting Roger\u2019s. She cannot live.</p><p>His first instinct was a visceral denial. Of course she could live, she must. But huge patches of her skin were gone, the raw flesh crusted but still oozing. He could see the white edge of a knee bone, and literally see her heart beating, a reddish, translucent bulge that pulsed at the notch of her rib cage. She was light as a corn-dolly, and he became painfully aware that she seemed to float in his arms, like a slick of oil on water.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt, sweetheart?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d she whispered. Then she closed her eyes and would say no more, only muttering \u201cMama?\u201d now and then.</p><p>He had thought at first they would take her back to the Ridge, to Claire. But it was more than a day\u2019s ride; she wouldn\u2019t make it. Not possibly.</p><p>He swallowed, realization closing on his throat like a noose. He looked at Jamie, seeing the same sick acknowledgment in his eyes. Jamie swallowed, too.</p><p>\u201cDo ye . . . know her name?\u201d Roger could scarcely breathe, and forced the words. Jamie shook his head, then gathered himself, hunching his shoulders.</p><p>She had stopped sucking, but still murmured \u201cMama?\u201d now and then. Jamie took the handkerchief from her lips and squeezed a few drops from it onto her blackened forehead, whispering the words of baptism.</p><p>Then they looked at each other, acknowledging necessity. Jamie was pale, sweat beading on his upper lip among the bristles of red beard. He took a deep breath, steeling himself, and lifted his hands, offering.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d She was his; he could no more surrender her to another than he could have torn off an arm. He reached for the handkerchief, and Jamie put it into his hand, soot-stained, still damp.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought of such a thing, and couldn\u2019t think now. He didn\u2019t need to; without hesitation, he cradled her close and put the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, then clamped his hand tight over the cloth, feeling the small bump of her nose caught snug between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>Wind stirred in the leaves above, and a rain of gold fell on them, whispering on his skin, brushing cool past his face. She would be cold, he thought, and wished to cover her, but had no hand to spare.</p><p>His other arm was round her, hand resting on her chest; he could feel the tiny heart beneath his fingers. It jumped, beat rapidly, skipped, beat twice more . . . and stopped. It quivered for a moment; he could feel it trying to find enough strength to beat one last time, and suffered the momentary illusion that it would not only do so, but would force its way through the fragile wall of her chest and into his hand in its urge to live. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the moment passed, as did the illusion, and a great stillness came. Near at hand, a raven called.</p><p>THEY HAD ALMOST finished the burying, when the sound of hooves and jingling harness announced visitors\u2014a lot of visitors.</p><p>Roger, ready to decamp into the woods, glanced at his father-in-law, but Jamie shook his head, answering his unasked question.</p><p>\u201cNay, they\u2019d no come back. What for?\u201d His bleak gaze took in the smoking ruin of the homestead, the trampled dooryard, and the low mounds of the graves. The little girl still lay nearby, covered with Roger\u2019s cloak. He hadn\u2019t been able to bear putting her into the ground just yet; the knowledge of her alive was still too recent.</p> <p>Jamie straightened, stretching his back. Roger saw him glance to see that his rifle was to hand, leaning against a tree trunk. Then he settled himself, leaning on the scorched board he had been using as a shovel, waiting.</p><p>The first of the riders came out of the woods, his horse snorting and tossing its head at the smell of burning. The rider pulled it skillfully round and urged it closer, leaning forward to see who they were.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s you, is it, Fraser?\u201d Richard Brown\u2019s lined face looked grimly jovial. He glanced at the charred and steaming timbers, then round at his comrades. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you made your money just by selling whisky.\u201d</p><p>The men\u2014Roger counted six of them\u2014shifted in their saddles, snorting with amusement.</p><p>\u201cHave a bit o\u2019 respect for the dead, Brown.\u201d Jamie nodded at the graves, and Brown\u2019s face hardened. He glanced sharply at Jamie, then at Roger.</p> <p>\u201cJust the two of you, is it? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigging graves,\u201d Roger said. His palms were blistered; he rubbed a hand slowly on the side of his breeches. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Brown straightened abruptly in his saddle, but it was his brother Lionel who answered.</p><p>\u201cComing down from Owenawisgu,\u201d he said, jerking his head at the horses. Looking, Roger saw that there were four packhorses, laden with skins, and that several of the other horses carried bulging saddlebags. \u201cSmelled the fire and come to see.\u201d He glanced down at the graves. \u201cTige O\u2019Brian, was it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cYe kent them?\u201d</p> <p>Richard Brown shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAye. It\u2019s on the way to Owenawisgu. I\u2019ve stopped a time or two; taken supper with them.\u201d Belatedly, he removed his hat, plastering down wisps of hair over his balding crown with the flat of his hand. \u201cGod rest \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s burnt \u2019em out, if it wasn\u2019t you?\u201d one of the younger men in the party called. The man, a Brown by his narrow shoulders and lantern jaw, grinned inappropriately, evidently thinking this a jest.</p><p>The singed bit of paper had flown with the wind; it fluttered against a rock near Roger\u2019s foot. He picked it up and with a step forward, slapped it against Lionel Brown\u2019s saddle.</p><p>\u201cKnow anything about that, do you?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was pinned to O\u2019Brian\u2019s body.\u201d He sounded angry, knew it, and didn\u2019t care. His throat ached and his voice came out as a strangled rasp.</p><p>Lionel Brown glanced at the paper, brows raised, then handed it to his brother.</p><p>\u201cNo. Write it yourself, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stared up at the man, blinking against the wind.</p> <p>\u201cIndians,\u201d Lionel Brown said, nodding at the house. \u201cIndians done this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Roger could hear the undercurrents in Jamie\u2019s voice\u2014skepticism, wariness, and anger. \u201cWhich Indians? The ones from whom ye bought the hides? Told ye about it, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Nelly.\u201d Richard Brown kept his voice pitched low, but his brother flinched a little, hearing it. Brown edged his horse nearer. Jamie stood his ground, though Roger saw his hands tighten on the board.</p><p>\u201cGot the whole family, did they?\u201d he asked, glancing at the small body under its cloak.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not found the two elder children. Only the wee lassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndians,\u201d Lionel Brown repeated stubbornly, from behind his brother. \u201cThey took \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath, and coughed from the smoke.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask in the villages, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t find \u2019em,\u201d Richard Brown said. He crumpled the note, tightening his fist suddenly. \u201cIf Indians took them, they won\u2019t keep them near. They\u2019ll sell them on, into Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>There was a general mutter of agreement among the men, and Roger felt the ember that had simmered in his chest all afternoon burst into fire.</p><p>\u201cIndians didn\u2019t write that,\u201d he snapped, jerking a thumb at the note in Brown\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd if it was revenge against O\u2019Brian for being a Regulator, they wouldn\u2019t have taken the children.\u201d</p><p>Brown gave him a long look, eyes narrowed. Roger felt Jamie shift his weight slightly, preparing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Brown softly. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why Nelly figured you wrote it yourself. Say the Indians came and stole the little \u2019uns, but then you come along and decide to take what\u2019s left. So you fired the cabin, hung O\u2019Brian and his wife, pinned that note, and here you are. How say you to that bit of reasoning, Mr. MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask how ye kent they were hanged, Mr. Brown.\u201d</p><p>Brown\u2019s face tightened, and Roger felt Jamie\u2019s hand on his arm in warning, realizing only then that his fists were clenched.</p><p>\u201cThe ropes, a charaid,\u201d Jamie said, his voice very calm. The words penetrated dimly, and he looked. True, the ropes they had cut from the bodies lay by the tree where they had fallen. Jamie was still talking, his voice still calm, but Roger couldn\u2019t hear the words. The wind deafened him, and just below the whine of it he heard the intermittent soft thump of a beating heart. It might have been his own\u2014or hers.</p><p>\u201cGet off that horse,\u201d he said, or thought he had. The wind swept into his face, heavy with soot, and the words caught in his throat. The taste of ash was thick and sour in his mouth; he coughed and spat, eyes watering.</p><p>Vaguely, he became aware of a pain in his arm, and the world swam back into view. The younger men were staring at him, with expressions ranging from smirks to wariness. Richard Brown and his brother were both sedulously avoiding looking at him, focused instead on Jamie\u2014who was still gripping his arm.</p><p>With an effort, he shook off Jamie\u2019s hand, giving his father-in-law the slightest nod by way of reassurance that he wasn\u2019t about to go berserk\u2014though his heart still pounded, and the feel of the noose was so tight about his throat that he couldn\u2019t have spoken, even had he been able to form words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help.\u201d Brown nodded at the little body on the ground, and began to swing one leg over his saddle, but Jamie stopped him with a small gesture.</p><p>\u201cNay, we\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Brown stopped, awkwardly half-on, half-off. His lips thinned and he pulled himself back on, reined around and rode off with no word of farewell. The others followed, looking curiously back as they went.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna them.\u201d Jamie had taken up his rifle and held it, gazing at the wood where the last of the men had disappeared. \u201cThey ken something more about it than they\u2019ll say, though.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, wordless. He walked deliberately to the hanging tree, kicked aside the ropes, and drove his fist into the trunk, twice, three times. Stood panting, his forehead pressed against the rough bark. The pain of raw knuckles helped, a bit.</p><p>A trail of tiny ants was scurrying upward between the plates of bark, bound on some momentous business, all-absorbing. He watched them for a little, until he could swallow again. Then straightened up and went to bury her, rubbing at the bone-deep bruise on his arm.</p><p>PART FOUR</p><p>Abduction</p><p>26</p><p>AN EYE TO THE FUTURE</p><p>October 9, 1773</p><p>ROGER DROPPED HIS saddlebags on the ground beside the pit and peered in.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jem?\u201d he said.</p><p>His mud-smeared wife looked up at him and brushed a sweat-matted lock of hair out of her face.</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cHave a good trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jem?\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose at that, and she stabbed her shovel into the bottom of the pit, extending a hand for him to help her scramble out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at Marsali\u2019s. He and Germain are playing Vroom with the little cars you made them\u2014or they were when I left him there.\u201d</p><p>The knot of anxiety he had carried under his ribs for the last two weeks began slowly to relax. He nodded, a sudden spasm of the throat preventing him from speaking, then reached out and pulled her to him, crushing her against him in spite of her startled yelp and mud-stained clothes.</p><p>He held her hard, his own heart hammering loud in his ears, and wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014let go, until she wriggled out of his embrace. She kept her hands on his shoulders, but cocked her head to one side, one brow raised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I missed you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible things.\u201d The burning, the little girl\u2019s death\u2014these had become dreamlike during their travel, their horror muted to the surreal by the monotonous labor of riding, walking, the constant whine of wind and crunch of boots on gravel, sand, pine needles, mud, the engulfing blur of greens and yellows in which they lost themselves beneath an endless sky.</p><p>But now he was home, no longer adrift in the wilderness. And the memory of the girl who had left her heart in his hand was suddenly as real as she had been in the moment she died.</p><p>\u201cYou come inside.\u201d Brianna was peering closely at him, concerned. \u201cYou need something hot, Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said, but followed her without protest.</p><p>He sat at the table while she put the kettle on for tea, and told her everything that had happened, head in his hands, staring down at the battered tabletop, with its homely spills and burn scars.</p><p>\u201cI kept thinking there must be something . . . some way. But there wasn\u2019t. Even while I\u2014I put my hand over her face\u2014I was sure it wasna really happening. But at the same time\u2014\u201d He sat up, then, looking into the palms of his hands. At the same time, it had been the most vivid experience of his life. He could not bear to think of it, save in the most fleeting way, but knew he could never forget the slightest thing about it. His throat closed suddenly again.</p><p>Brianna looked searchingly into his face, saw his hand touch the ragged rope scar on his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan you breathe?\u201d she said anxiously. He shook his head, but it wasn\u2019t true, he was breathing, somehow, though it felt as though his throat had been crushed in some huge hand, larynx and windpipe mangled into a bloody mass.</p><p>He flapped a hand to indicate that he would be all right, much as he doubted it himself. She came round behind him, pulled his hand from his throat, and laid her own fingers lightly over the scar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cJust breathe. Don\u2019t think. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were cold and her hands smelled of dirt. There was water in his eyes. He blinked, wanting to see the room, the hearth and candle and dishes and loom, to convince himself of where he was. A drop of warm moisture rolled down his cheek.</p><p>He tried to tell her that it was all right, he wasn\u2019t crying, but she merely pressed closer, holding him across the chest with one arm, the other hand still cool on the painful lump in his throat. Her br**sts were soft against his back, and he could feel, rather than hear, her humming, the small tuneless noise she made when she was anxious, or concentrating very hard.</p><p>Finally, the spasm began to ease, and the feel of choking left him. His chest swelled with the unbelievable relief of a free breath, and she let go.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . is it . . . that ye\u2019re digging?\u201d he asked, with only a little effort. He looked round at her and smiled, with a lot more. \u201cA bar . . . becue pit for . . . a hippopot . . . amus?\u201d</p><p>The ghost of a smile touched her face, though her eyes were still dark with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a groundhog kiln.\u201d</p><p>He tried for a moment to compose some witty remark about it being a really large hole for killing something as small as a groundhog, but he wasn\u2019t up to it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>He took the hot mug of catnip tea she placed in his hand and held it near his face, letting the fragrant steam warm his nose and mist on the cold skin of his cheeks.</p><p>Brianna poured out a mug for herself, as well, and sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d He essayed a sip; it was still scalding. \u201cA kiln?\u201d He\u2019d told her about the O\u2019Brians; he had to, but he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Not now. She seemed to sense this, and didn\u2019t press him.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. For the water.\u201d He must have looked confused, for her smile grew more genuine. \u201cI told you there was dirt involved, didn\u2019t I? Besides, it was your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was?\u201d At this point, almost nothing would surprise him, but he had no memory of having bright ideas about water.</p><p>The problem of bringing water to the houses was one of transport. God knew there was plenty of water; it ran in creeks, fell in waterfalls, dripped from ledges, sprang from springs, seeped in boggy patches under the cliffs . . . but making it go where you wanted required some method of containment.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wemyss told Fraulein Berrisch\u2014that\u2019s his girlfriend; Frau Ute fixed them up\u2014what I was doing, and she told him that the men\u2019s choir over in Salem was working on the same problem, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe choir?\u201d He tried another cautious sip and found it drinkable. \u201cWhy would the choir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what they call them. There\u2019s the single men\u2019s choir, the single women\u2019s choir, the married choir . . . they don\u2019t just sing together, though, it\u2019s more like a social group, and each choir has particular jobs they do for the community. But anyway\u201d\u2014she flapped a hand\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re trying to bring water into the town, and having the same problem\u2014no metal for pipes.</p><p>\u201cYou remember, though\u2014you reminded me about the pottery they do in Salem. Well, they tried making water pipes out of logs, but that\u2019s really hard and time-consuming, because you have to bore the middle of the log out with an augur, and you still need metal collars to bind the logs together. And they rot, after a while. But then they had the same idea you had\u2014why not make pipes out of fired clay?\u201d</p><p>She was becoming animated, talking about it. Her nose was no longer red from cold, but her cheeks were flushed pink and her eyes bright with interest. She waved her hands when she talked\u2014she got that from her mother, he thought to himself, amused.</p><p>\u201c. . . so we parked the kids with Mama and Mrs. Bug, and Marsali and I went to Salem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsali? But she couldn\u2019t be riding, surely?\u201d Marsali was enormously pregnant, to the point that merely being around her made him slightly nervous, for fear she might go into labor at any moment.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t due for a month. Besides, we didn\u2019t ride; we took the wagon, and traded honey and cider and venison for cheese and quilts and\u2014see my new teapot?\u201d Proud, she waved at the pot, a homely squat thing with a red-brown glaze and yellow squiggly shapes painted round the middle. It was one of the uglier objects he\u2019d ever seen, and the sight of it made tears come to his eyes from the sheer joy of being home.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d she said, a small frown forming between her brows.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s great,\u201d he said hoarsely. He fumbled for a handkerchief and blew his nose to hide his emotion. \u201cLove it. You were saying . . . Marsali?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was saying about the water pipes. But\u2014there\u2019s something about Marsali, too.\u201d The frown deepened. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Fergus isn\u2019t behaving very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? What\u2019s he doing? Having a mad affair with Mrs. Crombie?\u201d</p><p>This suggestion was greeted with a withering look, but it didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone a lot, for one thing, leaving poor Marsali to mind the children and do all the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally normal, for the time,\u201d he observed. \u201cMost men do that. Your father does that. I do that; had ye not noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said, giving him a faintly evil look. \u201cBut what I mean is, most men do the heavy work, like plowing and planting, and let their wives manage the inside stuff, the cooking and the spinning and the weaving, and the laundry, and the preserving, and\u2014well, anyway, all that stuff. But Marsali\u2019s doing it all, plus the kids and the outdoor work, and working at the malting floor. And when Fergus is home, he\u2019s grumpy and he drinks too much.\u201d</p><p>This also sounded like normal behavior for the father of three small, wild children and the husband of a very pregnant wife, Roger thought, but didn\u2019t say so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d not have thought Fergus a layabout,\u201d he observed mildly. Bree shook her head, still frowning, and poured more tea into his mug.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not lazy, really. It\u2019s hard for him, with only one hand; he really can\u2019t handle some of the heavy chores\u2014but he won\u2019t help with the kids, or cook and clean while Marsali does them. Da and Ian help with the plowing, but . . . And he leaves for days on end\u2014sometimes he\u2019s picking up little jobs here and there, translating for a traveler\u2014but mostly, he\u2019s just gone. And . . .\u201d She hesitated, darting a look at him as though wondering whether to go on.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he said obligingly. The tea was working; the pain in his throat was almost gone.</p><p>She looked down at the table, drawing invisible patterns on the oak with a forefinger.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say so . . . but I think he hits her.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt a sudden weight on his heart. His first reaction was to dismiss the notion out of hand\u2014but he had seen too much, living with the Reverend. Too many families, outwardly content and respectable, where the wives poked fun at their own \u201cclumsiness,\u201d brushing away concern at black eyes, broken noses, dislocated wrists. Too many men who dealt with the pressures of providing for a family by resorting to the bottle.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, feeling suddenly exhausted. He rubbed at his forehead, where a headache was starting.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cHas she got marks?\u201d</p><p>Bree nodded unhappily, still not looking up, though her finger had stilled.</p><p>\u201cOn her arm.\u201d She wrapped a hand around her forearm, in illustration. \u201cLittle round bruises, like fingermarks. I saw when she reached up to get a bucket of honeycomb from the wagon and her sleeve fell back.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wishing there was something stronger than tea in his mug.</p><p>\u201cShall I talk to him, then, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>She did look up at him then, her eyes softening, though the look of worry remained.</p><p>\u201cYou know, most men wouldn\u2019t offer to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no my idea of fun,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut ye canna let that sort of thing go on, hoping it will cure itself. Someone has to say something.\u201d</p><p>God knew what, though\u2014or how. He was already regretting the offer, trying to think what the hell he could say. \u201cSo, Fergus, old man. Hear you\u2019re beating your wife. Be a good fellow and stop that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He drained the rest of his mug, and got up to look for the whisky.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out,\u201d Brianna said, seeing his intent. \u201cMr. Wemyss had a cold.\u201d</p><p>He put down the empty bottle with a sigh. She touched his arm delicately.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re invited up to the Big House for supper. We could go early.\u201d That was a cheering suggestion. Jamie invariably had a bottle of excellent single-malt, secreted somewhere on the premises.</p><p>\u201cAye, all right.\u201d He took her cloak from the peg and swung it round her shoulders. \u201cHey. D\u2019ye think I should mention the business about Fergus to your Da? Or best handle it myself?\u201d He had a sudden, unworthy hope that Jamie would consider it his business and take care of the matter.</p><p>That seemed to be what Brianna was afraid of; she was shaking her head, simultaneously fluffing out her half-dried hair.</p><p>\u201cNo! I think Da would break his neck. And Fergus won\u2019t be any good to Marsali if he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He accepted the inevitable, and opened the door for her. The big white house glowed on the hill above them, tranquil in the afternoon light, the big red spruce behind it a looming but benign presence; not for the first time, he felt that the tree was somehow guarding the house\u2014and in his present fragile mental state, found that notion a comfort.</p><p>They made a short detour, so that he could properly admire the new pit and be told all about the internal workings of a groundhog kiln. He failed to follow these in any detail, only grasping the notion that the point was to make the inside very hot, but he found the flow of Brianna\u2019s explanation soothing.</p><p>\u201c. . . bricks for the chimney,\u201d she was saying, pointing at the far end of the eight-foot pit, which at present resembled nothing so much as the resting place for an extremely large coffin. She\u2019d made a nice, neat job of it so far, though; the corners were squared as though done with a instrument of some sort, and the walls painstakingly smoothed. He said as much, and she beamed at him, thumbing a lock of red hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to be a lot deeper,\u201d she said, \u201cmaybe another three feet. But the dirt here is really good for digging; it\u2019s soft, but it doesn\u2019t crumble too much. I hope I can finish the hole before it starts to snow, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d She rubbed a knuckle under her nose, squinting dubiously at the hole. \u201cI really need to card and spin enough more wool to weave the fabric for winter shirts for you and Jem, but I\u2019ll have to pick and preserve for the next week or so, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dig it for you.\u201d</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and kissed him, just under the ear, and he laughed, suddenly feeling better.</p><p>\u201cNot for this winter,\u201d she said, taking him contentedly by the arm, \u201cbut eventually\u2014I\u2019m wondering if I can vent some of the heat from the kiln, and run it under the floor of the cabin. You know what a Roman hypocaust is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He turned to eye the foundation of his domicile, a simple hollow base of fieldstone on which the log walls were built. The notion of central heating in a crude mountain cabin made him want to laugh, but there was really nothing impossible about it, he supposed. \u201cYou\u2019d what? Run pipes of warm air through the foundation stones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Always assuming I can actually make good pipes, which remains to be seen. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>He glanced from the proposed project up the hill to the Big House. Even at this distance, a mound of dirt by the foundation was visible, evidence of the white sow\u2019s burrowing capabilities.</p><p>\u201cI think ye run a great danger of having that big white buggeress transfer her affections to us, if ye make a cozy warm den under our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuggeress?\u201d she said, diverted. \u201cIs that physically possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphysical description,\u201d he informed her. \u201cAnd ye saw what she tried to do to Major MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pig really doesn\u2019t like Major MacDonald,\u201d Bree said reflectively. \u201cI wonder why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your mother; she\u2019s none so fond of him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly, lips pursed, and looked thoughtfully at the Big House. A shadow passed the window of the surgery, someone moving inside. \u201cTell you what. You find Da and have a drink with him, and while you\u2019re doing that, I\u2019ll tell Mama about Marsali and Fergus. She might have a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a medical problem, exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut anesthetizing Germain would certainly be a start.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>THE MALTING-FLOOR</p><p>I COULD SMELL THE SWEET, musty scent of damp grain on the wind as I made my way up the trail. It was nothing like the heady pungency of the barm mash, the faintly coffeelike toasted smell of malting, nor yet the reek of distilling\u2014but still spoke as strongly of whisky. It was a very fragrant business, making uisgebaugh, and the reason why the whisky clearing was located nearly a mile from the Big House. As it was, I often caught a wild faint scent of spirit through my open surgery windows when the wind was right and the mash was making.</p><p>The whisky-making had its own cycle, and one that everyone on the Ridge was subconsciously attuned to, whether directly involved in it or not. Which was how I knew without asking that the barley in the malting shed had just begun its germination, and therefore, Marsali would be there, turning and spreading the grain evenly before the malting fire was lit.</p><p>The grain must be allowed to germinate, to assure a maximal sweetness\u2014but must not sprout, or the mash would have a bitter taste and be ruined. No more than twenty-four hours must pass after germination began, and I had smelled the fecund damp scent of the grain begin to rise as I foraged in the woods the afternoon before. The time was here.</p><p>It was by far the best place to have a private conversation with Marsali; the whisky clearing was the only place she was ever without a cacophonous assortment of children. I often thought that she valued the solitude of the work much more than the share of whisky Jamie gave her for minding the grain\u2014valuable though that was.</p><p>Brianna told me that Roger had gallantly offered to have a word with Fergus, but I thought that I should talk to Marsali first, just to find out what was really going on.</p><p>What ought I to say? I wondered. A straightforward \u201cIs Fergus beating you?\u201d I couldn\u2019t quite believe that, despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014an intimate knowledge of emergency rooms filled with the debris of domestic disputes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that I thought Fergus incapable of violence; he\u2019d seen\u2014and experienced\u2014any amount of it from an early age, and growing up among Highlanders in the middle of the Rising and its aftermath probably did not inculcate a young man with any deep regard for the virtues of peace. On the other hand, Jenny Murray had had a hand in his upbringing.</p><p>I tried and failed to imagine any man who had lived with Jamie\u2019s sister for more than a week ever lifting his hand to a woman. Besides, I knew by my own observations that Fergus was a very gentle father, and there was usually an easiness between him and Marsali that seemed\u2014</p><p>There was a sudden commotion overhead. Before I could so much as glance up, something huge crashed down through the branches in a shower of dust and dead pine needles. I leapt backward and swung my basket up in instinctive defense\u2014but even as I did so, I realized that I was not in fact being attacked. Germain lay flat on the path in front of me, eyes bulging as he struggled for the breath that had been knocked out of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2014?\u201d I began, rather crossly. Then I saw that he was clutching something to his chest; a late nest, filled with a clutch of four greenish eggs, which he had miraculously contrived not to break in his fall.</p><p>\u201cFor . . . Maman,\u201d he gasped, grinning up at me.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d I said. I had had enough to do with young males\u2014well, any age, really; they all did it\u2014to realize the complete futility of reproach in such situations, and since he had broken neither the eggs nor his legs, I merely took the nest and held it while he gulped for air and my heart resumed beating at its normal speed.</p><p>Recovered, he scrambled to his feet, disregarding the dirt, pitch, and broken pine needles that covered him from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cMaman\u2019s in the shed,\u201d he said, reaching for his treasure. \u201cYou come too, Grandm\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where are your sisters?\u201d I asked suspiciously. \u201cAre you meant to be watching them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNon,\u201d he said airily. \u201cThey are at home; that\u2019s where women belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? And who told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget.\u201d Thoroughly recovered, he hopped ahead of me, singing a song, the refrain of which seemed to be \u201cNa tuit, na tuit, na tuit, Germain!\u201d</p><p>Marsali was indeed at the whisky clearing; her cap, cloak, and gown hung from a branch of the yellow-leaved persimmon, and a clay firepot full of coals sat nearby, smoking in readiness.</p> <p>The malting floor had been enclosed now by proper walls, making a shed in which the damp grain could be heaped, first to germinate and then to be gently toasted by a low-burning fire under the floor. The ash and charcoal had been scraped out and oak wood for a new fire laid in the space beneath the stilted floor, but it wasn\u2019t yet lit. Even without a fire, the shed was warm; I felt it from several feet away. As the grain germinated, it gave off such heat that the shed fairly glowed with it.</p><p>A rhythmic shush and scrape came from within; Marsali was turning the grain with a wooden shovel, making sure it was evenly spread before lighting the malting fire. The door of the shed was open, but there were of course no windows; from a distance, I could see only a dim shadow moving within.</p><p>The shushing of the grain had masked our footsteps; Marsali looked up, startled, when my body blocked the light from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMother Claire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallo,\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cGermain said you were here. I thought I\u2019d just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaman! Look, look, see what I have!\u201d Germain pushed past me with single-minded eagerness, thrusting out his prize. Marsali smiled at him, and pushed a damp strand of fair hair back behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Well, that\u2019s grand, no? Let\u2019s take it out to the light, shall we, so I can have a proper look.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the shed, sighing in pleasure at the touch of the cool air. She was stripped to her shift, the muslin so wet with sweat that I could see not only the dark rounds of her areolae, but even the tiny bulge of her popped-out navel, where the cloth clung to the massive curves of her belly.</p><p>Marsali sat down with another huge sigh of relief, stretching her legs out, bare toes pointed. Her feet were somewhat swollen, and blue veins showed, distended, beneath the transparent skin of her legs.</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s good to sit! So then, a chuisle, show me what ye\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I took the opportunity to circle round behind her, as Germain displayed his prize, and covertly check for bruises or other sinister signs.</p> <p>She was thin\u2014but Marsali simply was thin, bar the bulge of her pregnancy, and always had been. Her arms were slender, but hard with muscle, as were her legs. There were smudges of tiredness beneath her eyes\u2014but she had three small children, after all, besides the discomforts of pregnancy to keep her awake. Her face was rosy and damp, thoroughly healthy-looking.</p><p>There were a couple of small bruises on her lower legs, but I dismissed those; pregnant women did bruise easily, and with all the obstructions presented by living in a log cabin and traversing wild mountains, there were few people on the Ridge\u2014male or female\u2014not sporting the odd contusion.</p><p>Or was I only seeking excuses, not wanting to admit the possibility of what Brianna had suggested?</p><p>\u201cOne for me,\u201d Germain was explaining, touching the eggs, \u201cand one for Joan, and one for F\u00e9licit\u00e9, and one for Monsieur L\u2019Oeuf.\u201d He pointed at the melonlike swell of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAh, now, what a sweet lad,\u201d Marsali said, pulling him close and kissing his smudged forehead. \u201cYe\u2019re my wee nestling, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Germain\u2019s beam of pleasure faded into a look of speculation as he came in contact with his mother\u2019s protruding belly. He patted it cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWhen the egg hatches inside, what do you do with the shell?\u201d he inquired. \u201cCan I have it?\u201d</p><p>Marsali went pink with suppressed laughter.</p> <p>\u201cPeople dinna come in shells,\u201d she said. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sure, Maman?\u201d He eyed her belly dubiously, then poked it gently. \u201cIt feels like an egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so it does, but it\u2019s not. That\u2019s only what Papa and I call a wee one before it\u2019s born. You were \u2018Monsieur L\u2019Oeuf\u2019 once, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d Germain looked thunderstruck at this revelation.</p><p>\u201cYe were. So were your sisters.\u201d</p><p>Germain frowned, shaggy blond fringe almost touching his nose.</p><p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t. They are Mademoiselles L\u2019Oeufs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, certainement,\u201d Marsali said, laughing at him. \u201cAnd perhaps this one is, too\u2014but Monsieur is easier to say. Here, look.\u201d She leaned back a little and pushed a hand firmly into the side of her mound. Then she seized Germain\u2019s hand and put it on the spot. Even from where I stood, I could see the surge of flesh as the baby kicked vigorously in response to being poked.</p><p>Germain jerked his hand away, startled, then put it back, looking fascinated, and pushed.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d he said loudly, putting his face close to his mother\u2019s belly. \u201cComment \u00e7a va in there, Monsieur L\u2019Oeuf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d his mother assured him. \u201cOr she. But babies dinna talk right at first. Ye ken that much. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 doesna say anything but \u2018Mama\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Losing interest in his impending sibling, he stooped to pick up an interesting-looking stone.</p><p>Marsali lifted her head, squinting at the sun.</p><p>\u201cYe should go home, Germain. Mirabel will be wanting milked, and I\u2019ve a bit to do here yet. Go and help Papa, aye?\u201d Mirabel was a goat, and a sufficiently new addition to the household as still to be interesting, for Germain brightened at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cOui, Maman. Au\u2019voir, Grandm\u00e8re!\u201d He took aim and flipped his rock at the shed, missing it, then turned and scampered toward the path.</p><p>\u201cGermain!\u201d Marsali called after him. \u201cNa tuit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cIt\u2019s Gaelic, is it\u2014or French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Gaelic,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cIt means \u2018Don\u2019t fall!\u2019\u201d She shook her head in mock dismay. \u201cThat laddie canna stay out of trees to save his life.\u201d Germain had left the nest with its eggs; she set it gently on the ground, and I saw then the faint yellowed ovals on the underside of her forearm\u2014faded, but just as Brianna had described them.</p><p>\u201cAnd how is Fergus?\u201d I asked, as though it had anything to do with the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s well enough,\u201d she replied, a look of wariness closing over her features.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I glanced deliberately at her arm, then into her eyes. She flushed, and turned her arm quickly, hiding the marks.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019s fine!\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s no verra good at the milking just yet, but he\u2019ll have the way of it soon enough. It\u2019s awkward wi\u2019 the one hand, to be sure, but he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the log beside her, and took hold of her wrist, turning it over.</p><p>\u201cBrianna told me,\u201d I said. \u201cDid Fergus do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed embarrassed, and pulled her wrist away, pressing the forearm against her belly to hide the marks. \u201cWell, aye. Aye, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to speak to Jamie about it?\u201d</p><p>A rich tide of color surged into her face, and she sat up in alarm.</p><p>\u201cChrist, no! Da would break Fergus\u2019s neck! And it wasna his fault, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly it was his fault,\u201d I said firmly. I had seen all too many beaten women in Boston emergency rooms, all of whom claimed that it wasn\u2019t really their husband\u2019s or boyfriend\u2019s fault. Granted, the women often did have something to do with it, but still\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t!\u201d Marsali insisted. The color had not gone from her face; if anything, it intensified. \u201cI\u2014he\u2014I mean, he grabbed my arm, aye, but \u2019twas only because I . . . er . . . well, I was tryin\u2019 to brain him wi\u2019 a stick of wood at the time.\u201d She glanced away, blushing fiercely.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I rubbed my nose, a little taken aback. \u201cI see. And why were you trying to do that? Was he . . . attacking you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, shoulders slumping a little.</p><p>\u201cOh. No. Weel, it was because Joanie spilled the milk, and he shouted at her, and she cried, and . . .\u201d She shrugged a little, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI just had a wee de\u2019il sittin\u2019 on my shoulder, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Fergus to shout at the children, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not!\u201d she said quickly. \u201cHe hardly ever . . . well, he didna used to, but with so many . . . well, I couldna blame him, this time. It took him a terrible time to milk the goat, and then to have it all spilt and wasted\u2014I would ha\u2019 shouted, too, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were fixed on the ground, avoiding mine, and she was fingering the seam of her shift, running a thumb over and over the stitching.</p><p>\u201cSmall children can certainly be trying,\u201d I agreed, with vivid memories of an incident involving a two-year-old Brianna, a phone call that had distracted me, a large bowl of spaghetti with meatballs, and Frank\u2019s open briefcase. Frank normally exhibited a saintly degree of patience with Bree\u2014if somewhat less with me\u2014but on that particular occasion his bellows of outrage had rattled the windows.</p><p>And now that I recalled the occasion, I actually had thrown a meatball at him in a fury verging on hysteria. So had Bree, though she had done it out of glee, rather than vindictiveness. Had I been standing by the stove at the time, it might easily have been the pot I threw. I rubbed a finger under my nose, not sure whether to regret the memory or to laugh at it. I never did get the stains out of the rug.</p><p>It was a shame that I couldn\u2019t share the memory with Marsali, as she was in ignorance not only of spaghetti and briefcases, but also of Frank. She was still looking down, scuffing at the dead oak leaves with a pointed toe.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas all my fault, really,\u201d she said, and bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d I squeezed her arm in reassurance. \u201cThings like that are no one\u2019s fault; accidents happen, people get upset . . . but it all comes right in the end.\u201d So it did, I thought\u2014though often not in any expected way.</p><p>She nodded, but the shadow still lay on her face, her lower lip tucked in.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s only . . .\u201d she began, then trailed off.</p><p>I sat patiently, careful not to push her. She wanted\u2014needed\u2014to talk. And I needed to hear it, before deciding what\u2014or if\u2014to tell Jamie. There was something going on between her and Fergus, that was sure.</p><p>\u201cI . . . was just thinking of it now, whilst I was shoveling. I wouldna have done it, I don\u2019t think, only it minded me so much . . . it was only I felt as though it was the same again. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as what?\u201d I asked, when it became clear that she had trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI spilt the milk,\u201d she said, all in a rush. \u201cWhen I was a wean. I was hungry, and I reached to pull the jug, and it spilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And he shouted.\u201d Her shoulders hunched a little, as though in memory of a blow.</p><p>\u201cWho shouted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, for sure. It might ha\u2019 been my father, Hugh\u2014but it might have been Simon\u2014Mam\u2019s second husband. I dinna really remember\u2014only bein\u2019 so scairt that I wet myself, and that made him angrier.\u201d Color flamed in her face, and her toes curled with shame.</p><p>\u201cMy mother cried, for it was all the food there was, a bit o\u2019 bread and milk, and now the milk was gone\u2014but he shouted that he couldna bear the noise, for Joan and I were both howling, too . . . and then he slapped my face, and Mam went for him bald-heided, and he pushed her so she fell against the hearth and smacked her face on the chimney\u2014I could see the blood running from her nose.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and brushed a knuckle under her own nose, blinking, her eyes still fixed on the leaves.</p><p>\u201cHe stamped out, then, slammin\u2019 the door, and Joanie and I rushed up to Mam, both shriekin\u2019 our heids off, for we thought she was deid . . . but she got up onto her hands and knees and told us it was all right, it would be all right\u2014and her swayin\u2019 to and fro, with her cap fallen off and strings of bloody snot dripping from her face onto the floor . . . I\u2019d forgot that. But when Fergus started shouting at poor wee Joanie . . . \u2019twas like he was Simon. Or maybe Hugh. Him, whoever he was.\u201d She closed her eyes and heaved a deep sigh, leaning forward so her arms cradled the burden of her pregnancy.</p><p>I reached out and smoothed the damp strings of hair out of her face, brushing them back from her rounded brow.</p><p>\u201cYou miss your mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said softly. For the first time, I felt some sympathy for her mother, Laoghaire, as well as for Marsali.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Marsali said simply. \u201cSomething terrible.\u201d She sighed again, closing her eyes as she leaned her cheek against my hand. I drew her head against me, holding her, and stroked her hair in silence.</p><p>It was late afternoon, and the shadows lay long, cold in the oak wood. The heat had left her now, and she shivered briefly in the cooling air, a stipple of gooseflesh coming up on her fine-boned arms.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, standing up and swinging the cloak off my shoulders. \u201cPut this on. You don\u2019t want to take a chill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s all right.\u201d She straightened up, shaking back her hair, and wiped her face with the back of a hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no but a bit more to do here, and then I\u2019ve got to be going home and making up the supper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said firmly, and tucked the cloak around her shoulders. \u201cYou rest a bit.\u201d</p><p>The air inside the tiny shed was ripe enough to make one light-headed, all by itself, thick with the fecund musk of sprouting grain and the fine sharp dust of barley hulls. The warmth was welcoming after the chill of the air outside, but within moments, my skin was damp beneath dress and shift, and I pulled the gown off over my head and hung it on a nail by the door.</p><p>No matter; she was right, there wasn\u2019t much to be done. The work would keep me warm, and then I would walk home with Marsali straightaway. I would make supper for the family, letting her rest\u2014and while I was about it, I\u2019d perhaps have a word with Fergus and discover more about what was going on.</p><p>Fergus could have been making the supper, I thought, frowning as I dug into the dim heaps of sticky grain. Not that he would think of such a thing, the little French layabout. Milking the goat was as far as he was likely to go in the direction of \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>Then I thought of Joan and F\u00e9licit\u00e9, and felt more charitable toward Fergus. Joan was three, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 one and a half\u2014and anyone alone in a house with those two had my complete sympathy, no matter what kind of work they were doing.</p><p>Joan was outwardly a sweet brown wren of a child, and by herself was even-tempered and biddable\u2014to a point. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 was the spitting image of her father, dark, fine-boned, and given to alternate bouts of languishing charm and intemperate passion. Together . . . Jamie referred to them casually as the hell-kits, and if they were at home, it was no wonder that Germain was out wandering in the woods\u2014nor that Marsali found it a relief to be out here by herself, doing heavy labor.</p><p>\u201cHeavy\u201d was the operative term, I thought, thrusting the shovel in again and heaving. Sprouting grain was damp grain, and each shovelful weighed pounds. The turned grain was patchy, splotched dark with moisture from the underlying layers. The unturned grain was paler in color, even in the failing light. Only a few mounds of pale grain remained, in the far corner.</p><p>I attacked them with a will, realizing as I did so that I was trying very hard not to think of the story Marsali had told me. I didn\u2019t want to like Laoghaire\u2014and I didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t want to feel sympathy for her, either, and that was proving harder to avoid.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been an easy life for her, apparently. Well, nor had it been for anyone else living in the Highlands then, I thought, grunting as I flung a shovelful of grain to the side. Being a mother was not that easy anywhere\u2014but it seemed she had made a good job of it.</p><p>I sneezed from the grain dust, paused to wipe my nose on my sleeve, then went back to shoveling.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she had tried to steal Jamie from me, after all, I told myself, striving for compassion and high-minded objectivity. Rather the reverse, in fact\u2014or at least she might well see it that way.</p><p>The edge of the shovel gritted hard against the floor as I scraped up the last of the grain. I sent the grain flying to the side, then used the flat of the blade to shove some of the new-turned grain into the empty corner and smooth down the highest hillocks.</p><p>I knew all the reasons why he said he\u2019d married her\u2014and I believed him. However, the fact remained that the mention of her name conjured up assorted visions\u2014starting with Jamie kissing her ardently in an alcove at Castle Leoch, and ending with him fumbling up her nightgown in the darkness of their marriage bed, hands warm and eager on her thighs\u2014that made me snort like a grampus and feel the blood throb hotly in my temples.</p><p>Perhaps, I reflected, I was not really a very high-minded sort of person. Occasionally quite low-minded and grudge-bearing, in fact.</p><p>This bout of self-criticism was cut short by the sound of voices and movement outside. I stepped to the door of the shed, squinting against the dazzle of the late afternoon sun.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see their faces, nor even tell for sure how many there might be. Some were on horseback, some on foot, black silhouettes with the sinking sun behind them. I caught a movement in the corner of my eye; Marsali was on her feet, backing toward the shed.</p><p>\u201cWho are ye, sirs?\u201d she said, chin high.</p><p>\u201cThirsty travelers, mistress,\u201d said one of the black forms, edging his horse ahead of the others. \u201cIn search of hospitality.\u201d</p><p>The words were courteous enough; the voice wasn\u2019t. I stepped out of the shed, still gripping the shovel.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d I said, making no effort to sound welcoming. \u201cStay where you are, gentlemen; we\u2019ll be pleased to bring you a drink. Marsali, will you fetch the keg?\u201d</p><p>There was a small keg of raw whisky kept nearby for just such occasions. My heartbeat was loud in my ears, and I was clutching the wooden handle of the shovel so tightly that I could feel the grain of the wood.</p><p>It was more than unusual to see so many strangers in the mountains at one time. Now and then, we would see a hunting party of Cherokee\u2014but these men were not Indians.</p><p>\u201cNo bother, mistress,\u201d said another of the men, swinging down off his horse. \u201cI\u2019ll help her fetch it. I do think we shall be needing more than one keg, though.\u201d</p><p>The voice was English, and oddly familiar. Not a cultivated accent, but with a careful diction.</p><p>\u201cWe have only one keg ready,\u201d I said, slowly moving sideways and keeping my eyes on the man who had spoken. He was short and very slender, and moved with a stiff, jerky gait, like a marionette.</p><p>He was moving toward me; so were the others. Marsali had reached the woodpile, and was fumbling behind the chunks of oak and hickory. I could hear her breath, harsh in her throat. The keg was hidden in the woodpile. There was an ax lying next to the wood, too, I knew.</p><p>\u201cMarsali,\u201d I said. \u201cStay there. I\u2019ll come and help you.\u201d</p><p>An ax was a better weapon than a shovel\u2014but two women against . . . how many men? Ten . . . a dozen . . . more? I blinked, eyes watering against the sun, and saw several more walk out of the wood. I could see these clearly; one grinned at me and I had to steel myself not to look away. His grin broadened.</p><p>The short man was coming closer, too. I glanced at him, and a brief itch of recognition tickled me. Who the hell was he? I knew him; I\u2019d seen him before\u2014and yet I hadn\u2019t any name to attach to the lantern jaws and narrow brow.</p><p>He stank of long-dried sweat, dirt ground into the skin, and the tang of dribbled urine; they all did, and the odor of them floated on the wind, feral as the stink of weasels.</p><p>He saw me recognize him; thin lips pulled in for a moment, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, and the feeling of apprehension deepened sharply as I saw the look in his small, clever eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think you have the advantage of me, sir,\u201d I said, putting as bold a face on it as I might. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer that. One side of his mouth turned up a little, but his attention was distracted by the two men who had lunged forward to take the keg as Marsali rolled it out of its hiding place. One had already seized the ax I had my eye on, and was about to stave in the top of the cask, when the thin man shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cLeave it!\u201d</p><p>The man looked up at him, mouth open in heavy incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cI said leave it!\u201d the thin man snapped, as the other glanced from the cask to the ax and back in confusion. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it with us; I\u2019ll not have you all befuddled with drink now!\u201d</p><p>Turning to me, as though continuing a conversation, he said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all there is,\u201d Marsali said, before I could answer. She was frowning at him, wary of him, but also angry. \u201cTake it, then, and ye must.\u201d</p><p>The thin man\u2019s attention shifted to her for the first time, but he gave her no more than a casual glance before turning back to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble lying to me, Mrs. Fraser. I know well enough there\u2019s more, and I\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is not. Give me that, ye great oaf!\u201d Marsali snatched the ax neatly from the man holding it, and scowled at the thin man. \u201cThis is how ye repay proper welcome, is it\u2014by thieving? Well, take what ye came for and leave, then!\u201d</p><p>I had no choice but to follow her lead, though alarm bells were ringing in my brain every time I looked at the thin little man.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cSee for yourselves.\u201d I pointed at the shed, the mash tubs and the pot still that stood nearby, unsealed and patently empty. \u201cWe\u2019re only beginning the malting. It will be weeks yet before there\u2019s a new batch of whisky.\u201d</p><p>Without the slightest change of expression, he took a quick step forward and slapped me hard across the face.</p><p>The blow wasn\u2019t hard enough to knock me down, but it snapped my head back and left my eyes watering. I was more shocked than hurt, though there was a sharp taste of blood in my mouth, and I could already feel my lip beginning to puff.</p><p>Marsali uttered a sharp cry of shock and outrage, and I heard some of the men murmur in interested surprise. They had drawn in, surrounding us.</p><p>I put the back of my hand to my bleeding mouth, noticing in a detached sort of way that it was trembling. My brain, though, had withdrawn to a safe distance and was making and discarding suppositions so quickly that they fluttered past, fast as shuffling cards.</p><p>Who were these men? How dangerous were they? What were they prepared to do? The sun was setting\u2014how long before Marsali or I was missed and someone came looking for us? Would it be Fergus, or Jamie? Even Jamie, if he came alone . . .</p><p>I had no doubt that these men were the same who had burned Tige O\u2019Brian\u2019s house, and were likely responsible for the attacks inside the Treaty Line, as well. Vicious, then\u2014but with theft as their major purpose.</p><p>There was a copper taste in my mouth; the metal tang of blood and fear. No more than a second had passed in these calculations, but as I lowered my hand, I had concluded that it would be best to give them what they wanted, and hope that they left with the whisky at once.</p><p>I had no chance to say so, though. The thin man seized my wrist and twisted viciously. I felt the bones shift and crack with a tearing pain, and sank to my knees in the leaves, unable to make more than a small, breathless sound.</p><p>Marsali made a louder sound and moved like a striking snake. She swung the ax from the shoulder with all the power of her bulk behind it, and the blade sank deep in the shoulder of the man beside her. She wrenched it free and blood sprayed warm across my face, pattering like rain upon the leaves.</p><p>She screamed, high and thin, and the man screamed, too, and then the whole clearing was in motion, men surging inward with a roar like collapsing surf. I lunged forward and seized the thin man\u2019s knees, butted my head hard upward into his crotch. He made a choking wheeze and fell on top of me, flattening me to the ground.</p><p>I squirmed out from under his knotted body, knowing only that I had to get to Marsali, get between her and the men\u2014but they were upon her. A scream cut in half by the sound of fists on flesh, and a dull boom as bodies fell hard against the wall of the malting shed.</p><p>The clay firepot was in reach. I seized it, heedless of its searing heat, and flung it straight into the group of men. It struck one hard in the back and shattered, hot coals spraying. Men yelled and jumped back, and I saw Marsali slumped against the shed, neck canted over on one shoulder and her eyes rolled back white in her head, legs splayed wide and the shift torn down from her neck, leaving her heavy br**sts bare on the bulge of her belly.</p><p>Then someone struck me in the side of the head and I flew sideways, skidding through the leaves and ending boneless, flat on the ground, unable to rise or move or think or speak.</p><p>A great calm came over me and my vision narrowed\u2014it seemed very slowly\u2014the closing of some great iris, spiraling shut. Before me, I saw the nest on the ground, inches from my nose, its interwoven sticks slender, clever, the four greenish eggs round and fragile, perfect in its cup. Then a heel smashed down on the eggs and the iris closed.</p><p>THE SMELL OF BURNING roused me. I could have been unconscious for no more than moments; the clump of dry grass near my face was barely beginning to smoke. A hot coal glowed in a nest of char, shot with sparks. Threads of incandescence shot up the withered grass blades and the clump burst into flame, just as hands seized me by arm and shoulder, dragging me up.</p><p>Still dazed, I flailed at my captor as he lifted me, but was hustled unceremoniously to one of the horses, heaved up, and flung across the saddle with a force that knocked the wind out of me. I had barely the presence of mind to grab at the stirrup leather, as someone smacked the horse\u2019s rump and we set off at a bruising trot.</p><p>Between dizziness and jostling, everything I saw was fractured, crazed like broken glass\u2014but I caught one last glimpse of Marsali, now lying limp as a rag doll among a dozen tiny fires, as the scattered coals began to catch and burn.</p><p>I made some strangled noise, trying to call to her, but it was lost in the clatter of harness and men\u2019s voices, speaking urgently, near at hand.</p><p>\u201cYou crazed, Hodge? You don\u2019t want that woman. Put her back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t.\u201d The small man\u2019s voice sounded cross, but controlled, somewhere near at hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll show us to the whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisky\u2019ll do us no good if we\u2019re dead, Hodge! That\u2019s Jamie Fraser\u2019s wife, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who she is. Get on with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2014you don\u2019t know the man, Hodge! I see him one time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me your memories. Get on, I said!\u201d</p><p>This last was punctuated by a sudden vicious thunk, and a startled sound of pain. A pistol butt, I thought. Square across the face, I added mentally, swallowing as I heard the wet, wheezing gasps of a man with a broken nose.</p><p>A hand seized me by the hair and jerked my head round painfully. The thin man\u2019s face stared down at me, eyes narrowed in calculation. He seemed only to want to assure himself that I was indeed alive, for he said nothing, and dropped my head again, indifferent as though it were a pinecone he had picked up along the way.</p><p>Someone was leading the horse I was on; there were several men on foot, as well. I heard them, calling to one another, half-running to keep up as the horses lurched up a rise, crashing and grunting like pigs through the undergrowth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t breathe, save in shallow gasps, and was being jolted unmercifully with each step\u2014but I had no attention to spare for physical discomfort. Was Marsali dead? She had looked it, surely, but I\u2019d seen no blood, and I clung to that small fact for the slim\u2014and temporary\u2014comfort that it was.</p><p>Even if she wasn\u2019t dead yet, she soon might be. Whether from injury, shock, a sudden miscarriage\u2014oh, God, oh, God, poor little Monsieur L\u2019Oeuf\u2014</p><p>My hands clenched helpless on the stirrup leathers, desperate. Who might find her\u2014and when?</p><p>It had lacked little more than an hour to suppertime when I had arrived at the malting shed. How late was it now? I caught glimpses of the ground juddering past below, but my hair had come loose and streamed across my face whenever I tried to raise my head. There was a growing chill to the air, though, and a still look to the light that told me the sun was near the horizon. Within a few minutes, the light would start to fade.</p> <p>And then what? How long before a search began? Fergus would notice Marsali\u2019s absence when she didn\u2019t appear to cook supper\u2014but would he go to look for her, with the little girls in his care? No, he\u2019d send Germain. That caused my heart to lurch and catch in my throat. For a five-year-old boy to find his mother . . .</p><p>I could still smell burning. I sniffed, once, twice, again, hoping that I was imagining it. But above the dust and sweat of horse, the tang of stirrup leather, and the whiff of crushed plants, I could distinctly smell the reek of smoke. The clearing, the shed\u2014or both\u2014were well and truly alight now. Someone would see the smoke, and come. But in time?</p><p>I shut my eyes tight, trying to stop thinking, seeking any distraction to keep from seeing in my mind\u2019s eye the scene that must be taking place behind me.</p><p>There were still voices near. The man they called Hodge again. It must be his horse I rode; he was walking near its head, on the far side of the animal. Someone else was expostulating with him, but to no more effect than the first man.</p><p>\u201cSpread them out,\u201d he was saying tersely. \u201cDivide the men in two groups\u2014you\u2019ll \u2019ave one, the rest go with me. Join again in three days\u2019 time at Brownsville.\u201d</p> <p>Bloody hell. He expected pursuit, and meant to frustrate it by splitting his group and confusing the trail. Frantically, I tried to think of something to drop; surely I had something to leave as a means of telling Jamie which way I had been taken.</p><p>But I wore nothing save shift, stays, and stockings\u2014my shoes had been lost when they dragged me to the horse. The stockings seemed the only possibility; though the garters, with extreme perversity, were for once snugly tied, and quite out of my reach at the moment.</p><p>All around me I could hear the noise of men and horses moving, calling and shoving as the main body split. Hodge chirruped to the horse, and we began to move faster.</p><p>My floating hair snagged on a twig as we brushed past a bush, held for a second, then broke free with a painful ping! as the twig snapped, ricocheting off my cheekbone and narrowly missing my eye. I said something very rude, and someone\u2014Hodge, for a guess\u2014dealt me a censorious smack across the bottom.</p><p>I said something much, much ruder, but under my breath and through clenched teeth. My sole comfort was the thought that it would be no great trick to follow a band such as this, leaving as they were a wide trail of broken branches, hoofprints, and overturned stones.</p><p>I\u2019d seen Jamie track things small and sly, as well as large and lumbering\u2014and had seen him check the bark of trees and the twigs of bushes as he went, for scratched bark and betraying tufts of . . . hair.</p> <p>No one was walking on the side of the horse where my head hung down. Hastily, I began to pluck hairs from my head. Three, four, five\u2014was that enough? I stretched out my hand and dragged it through a yaupon bush; the long, curly hairs drifted on the breeze of the horse\u2019s passing, but stayed safely tangled in the jagged foliage.</p><p>I did the same thing four times more. Surely he would see at least one of the signs, and would know which trail to follow\u2014if he didn\u2019t waste time following the other first. There was nothing I could do about that save pray\u2014and I set in to do that in good earnest, beginning first with a plea for Marsali and Monsieur le Oeuf, whose need was plainly much greater than mine.</p><p>We continued upward for quite some time; it was full dark before we reached what seemed to be the summit of a ridge, and I was nearly unconscious, my head throbbing with blood and my stays pushed so hard into my body that I felt each strip of whalebone like a brand against my skin.</p><p>I had just enough energy left to push myself backward when the horse stopped. I hit the ground and crumpled at once into a heap, where I sat light-headed and gasping, rubbing my hands, which had swollen from hanging down for so long.</p><p>The men were gathered in a small knot, occupied in low-voiced conversation, but too near for me to think of trying to creep away into the shrubbery. One man stood only a few feet away, keeping a steady eye on me.</p><p>I looked back the way we had come, half-fearing, half-hoping to see the glow of fire far below. The fire would have drawn attention from someone\u2014someone would know by now what had happened, be even now spreading the alarm, organizing pursuit. And yet . . . Marsali.</p><p>Was she already dead, and the baby with her?</p><p>I swallowed hard, straining my eyes at the dark, as much to prevent tears as in hopes of seeing anything. As it was, though, the trees grew thick around us, and I could see nothing at all, save variations on inky blackness.</p> <p>There was no light; the moon had not yet risen, and the stars were still faint\u2014but my eyes had had more than enough time to adapt, and while I was no cat to see in the dark, I could distinguish enough to make a rough count. They were arguing, glancing at me now and then. Perhaps a dozen men . . . How many had there been, originally? Twenty? Thirty?</p><p>I flexed my fingers, trembling. My wrist was badly bruised, but that wasn\u2019t what was troubling me at present.</p><p>It was clear to me\u2014and therefore presumably to them, as well\u2014that they couldn\u2019t head directly for the whisky cache, even were I able to find it at night. Whether Marsali survived to talk or not\u2014I felt my throat close at the thought\u2014Jamie would likely realize that the whisky was the intruders\u2019 goal, and have it guarded.</p><p>Had things not fallen out as they did, the men would ideally have forced me to lead them to the cache, taken the whisky, and fled, hoping to escape before the theft was discovered. Leaving me and Marsali alive to raise the alarm and describe them? I wondered. Perhaps; perhaps not.</p><p>In the panic following Marsali\u2019s attack, though, the original plan had fallen apart. Now what?</p><p>The knot of men was breaking up, though the argument continued. Footsteps approached.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, it won\u2019t do,\u201d one man was saying heatedly. From the thickened voice, I assumed it was the gentleman with the broken nose, undeterred by his injury. \u201cKill her now. Leave her here; no one\u2019ll find her before the beasts have scattered her bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? And if no one finds her, they\u2019ll think she\u2019s still with us, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Fraser catches up to us, and she\u2019s not, who shall he blame . . .\u201d</p><p>They stopped, four or five of them surrounding me. I scrambled to my feet, my hand closing by reflex around the nearest thing approaching a weapon\u2014an unfortunately small rock.</p><p>\u201cHow far are we from the whisky?\u201d Hodge demanded. He had taken off his hat, and his eyes gleamed, ratlike in the shadow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, keeping a firm grip on my nerves\u2014and the rock. My lip was still tender, puffed from the blow he had dealt me, and I had to form the words carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are.\u201d</p><p>This was true, though I could have made a reasonable guess. We had traveled for a few hours, mostly upward, and the trees nearby were fir and balsam; I could smell their resin, sharp and clean. We were on the upper slopes, and probably near a small pass that crossed the shoulder of the mountain.</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d urged one of the others. \u201cShe\u2019s no good to us, and if Fraser finds her with us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your face!\u201d Hodge rounded on the speaker with such violence that the man, much larger, stepped back involuntarily. That threat disposed of, Hodge ignored him and seized me by the arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me, woman. You\u2019ll tell me what I want to know.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother with the \u201cor else\u201d\u2014something cold passed across the top of my breast, and the hot sting of the cut followed a second later, as blood began to bloom from it.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d I said, more from surprise than pain. I jerked my arm out of his grasp. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t even know where we are, you idiot! How do you expect me to tell you where anything else is?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, startled, and brought the knife up by reflex, wary, as though he thought I might attack him. Realizing that I wasn\u2019t about to, he scowled at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I do know,\u201d I said, and was distantly pleased to hear that my voice was sharp and steady. \u201cThe whisky cache is about half a mile from the malting shed, roughly northwest. It\u2019s in a cave, well-hidden. I could take you there\u2014if we began from the spring where you took me\u2014but that\u2019s all I can tell you in the way of direction.\u201d</p><p>This was true, too. I could find it easily enough\u2014but to give directions? \u201cGo through a gap in the brush a little way, until you see the cluster of oak where Brianna shot a possum, bear left to a squarish rock with a bunch of adder\u2019s-tongue growing over it. . . .\u201d The fact that the need for my services as a guide was probably all that kept them from killing me on the spot was, of course, a secondary consideration.</p><p>It was a very shallow cut; I wasn\u2019t bleeding badly at all. My face and hands were ice-cold, though, and small flashing lights came and went at the edges of my vision. Nothing was keeping me upright save a vague conviction that if it came to that, I preferred to die on my feet.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, Hodge, you don\u2019t want nothing to do with that one\u2014nothing.\u201d A larger man had joined the small group round me. He leaned over Hodge\u2019s shoulder, looking at me, and nodded. They were all black in the shadow, but this man had a voice tinged with the lilt of Africa\u2014an ex-slave, or perhaps a slave-trader. \u201cThat woman\u2014I hear about her. She is a conjure woman. I know them. They are like serpents, conjure wives. You don\u2019t touch that one, hear me? She will curse you!\u201d</p><p>I managed to give a rather nasty-sounding laugh in answer to this, and the man closest to me took a half-step back. I was vaguely surprised; where had that come from?</p><p>But I was breathing better now, and the flashing lights were gone.</p><p>The tall man stretched his neck, seeing the dark line of blood on my shift.</p><p>\u201cYou draw her blood? Damn you, Hodge, you done it now.\u201d There was a distinct note of alarm in his voice, and he drew back a little, making some sort of sign toward me with one hand.</p><p>Without the slightest notion as to what moved me to do it, I dropped the rock, ran the fingers of my right hand across the cut, and in one swift motion, reached out and drew them down the thin man\u2019s cheek. I repeated the nasty laugh.</p><p>\u201cCurse, is it?\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s this? Touch me again, and you\u2019ll die within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>The streaks of blood showed dark on the white of his face. He was close enough that I could smell the sourness of his breath, and see the fury gather on his face.</p><p>What on earth do you think you are doing, Beauchamp? I thought, utterly surprised at myself. Hodge drew back his fist to strike me, but the large man caught him by the wrist with a cry of fear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do that! You will kill us all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll friggin\u2019 kill you right now, arsebite!\u201d</p><p>Hodge was still holding the knife in his other hand; he stabbed awkwardly at the larger man, grunting with rage. The big man gasped at the impact, but wasn\u2019t badly stricken\u2014he wrenched at the wrist he held and Hodge gave a high, squealing cry, like a rabbit seized by a fox.</p><p>Then the others were all in it, pushing and shouting, grappling for weapons. I turned and ran, but got no more than a few steps before one of them grabbed me, flinging his arms round me and jerking me hard against himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, lady,\u201d he said, panting in my ear.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t. He was no taller than I, but a good deal stronger. I lunged against his grip, but he had both arms wrapped tight around me, and squeezed tighter. I stood stiff then, heart pounding with anger and fear, not wanting to give him an excuse to maul me. He was excited; I could feel his heart pounding, too, and smell the reek of fresh sweat over the fetor of stale clothes and body.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see what was going on, but I didn\u2019t think they were fighting so much as merely shouting at each other now. My captor shifted his weight and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . where do you come from, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, quite politely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, no end startled. \u201cCome from? Er . . . ah . . . England. Oxfordshire, originally. Then Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? I\u2019m from the north myself.\u201d</p><p>I repressed the automatic urge to reply, \u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d since I wasn\u2019t, and the conversation languished.</p><p>The fight had stopped, abruptly as it had started. With a lot of token snarling and growling, the rest of them backed down in the face of Hodge\u2019s bellowed assertions that he was in command here, and they\u2019d bleedin\u2019 well do as he said or take the consequences.</p><p>\u201cHe means it, too,\u201d muttered my captor, still pressing me firmly to his filthy bosom. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to cross him, lady, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I said, though I assumed the advice was well-meant. I had been hoping the conflict would be noisy and prolonged, thus increasing the chances of Jamie catching up to us.</p><p>\u201cAnd where is this Hodge from, speaking of origins?\u201d I asked. He still seemed remarkably familiar to me; I was sure I had seen him somewhere\u2014but where?</p><p>\u201cHodgepile? Ahhh . . . England, I reckon,\u201d said the young man gripping me. He sounded surprised. \u201cDon\u2019t he sound like it?\u201d</p><p>Hodge? Hodgepile? That rang a bell, certainly, but . . .</p><p>There was a good deal of muttering and milling round, but in much too little time, we were off again. This time, thank God, I was allowed to ride astride, though my hands were tied and bound to the saddle.</p><p>We moved very slowly; there was a trail of sorts, but even with the faint light shed by a rising moon, the going was difficult. Hodgepile no longer led the horse I rode; the young man who had recaptured me held the bridle, tugging and coaxing the increasingly reluctant horse through the thickets of brush. I could glimpse him now and then, slender, with thick, wild hair that hung past his shoulders and rendered him lion-maned in silhouette.</p><p>The threat of immediate death had receded a little, but my stomach was still knotted and the muscles of my back stiff with apprehension. Hodgepile had his way for the moment, but there had been no real agreement among the men; one of those in favor of killing me and leaving my corpse for the skunks and weasels might easily decide to put a quick end to the controversy with a lunge out of the dark.</p><p>I could hear Hodgepile\u2019s voice, sharp and hectoring, somewhere up ahead. He seemed to be passing up and down the column, bullying, nagging, nipping like a sheepdog, trying to keep his flock on the move.</p><p>They were moving, though it was clear even to me that the horses were tired. The one I rode was shambling, jerking her head with irritation. God knew where the marauders had come from, or how long they had traveled before reaching the whisky clearing. The men were slowing, too, a gradual fog of fatigue settling on them as the adrenaline of flight and conflict receded. I could feel lassitude stealing upon me, too, and fought against it, struggling to stay alert.</p><p>It was still early autumn, but I was wearing only my shift and stays, and we were high enough that the air chilled rapidly after dark. I shivered constantly, and the cut on my chest burned as the tiny muscles flexed beneath the skin. It wasn\u2019t at all serious, but what if it became infected? I could only hope that I would live long enough for that to be a problem.</p><p>Hard as I tried, I could not keep from thinking of Marsali, nor keep my mind from making medical speculations, envisioning everything from concussion with intracranial swelling to burns with smoke inhalation. I could do something\u2014perhaps even an emergency C-section\u2014if I were there. No one else could.</p><p>I clenched my hands hard on the edge of the saddle, straining against the rope that bound them. I needed to be there!</p><p>But I was not, and might never be.</p><p>The quarreling and muttering had all but ceased as the darkness of the forest closed in upon us, but a lingering sense of unease lay heavy on the group. In part, I thought it was apprehension and fear of pursuit, but in much greater part, a sense of internal discord. The fight had not been settled, merely postponed to a more convenient season. A sense of simmering conflict was sharp in the air.</p><p>A conflict focused squarely on me. Unable to see clearly during the argument, I couldn\u2019t be sure which men held which opinions, but the division was clear: one party, headed by Hodgepile, was in favor of keeping me alive, at least long enough to lead them to the whisky. A second group was for cutting their losses, and my throat. And a minority opinion, voiced by the gentleman with the African speech, was for turning me loose, the sooner the better.</p><p>Obviously, it would behoove me to cultivate this gentleman, and try to turn his beliefs to my advantage. How? I\u2019d made a start by cursing Hodgepile\u2014and I was still quite startled that I\u2019d done that. I didn\u2019t think it would be advisable to start cursing them wholesale, though\u2014ruin the effect.</p><p>I shifted in the saddle, which was beginning to chafe me badly. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d had men recoil from me in fear of what they thought I was. Superstitious fear could be an effective weapon\u2014but it was a very dangerous one to use. If I truly frightened them, they\u2019d kill me without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>We had crossed into the pass. There were few trees among the boulders here, and as we emerged onto the far side of the mountain, the sky opened out before me, vast and glowing, fiery with a multitude of stars.</p><p>I must have let out a gasp at the sight, for the young man leading my horse paused, lifting his own head skyward.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said softly. He stared for a moment, then was pulled back to earth by the passage of another horse that brushed past us, its rider turning to peer closely at me as it did so.</p><p>\u201cDid you have stars like this\u2014where you came from?\u201d my escort asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, still slightly under the spell of the silent grandeur overhead. \u201cNot so bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t,\u201d he said, shaking his head, and pulled at the rein. That seemed an odd remark, but I could make nothing of it. I might have engaged him in further conversation\u2014God knew I needed all the allies I could get\u2014but there was a shout from up ahead; evidently, we were making camp.</p><p>I was untied and pulled off the horse. Hodgepile pushed his way through the scrum and grasped me by the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou try to run, woman, and you\u2019ll wish you \u2019adn\u2019t.\u201d He squeezed viciously, fingers digging into my flesh. \u201cI need you alive\u2014I don\u2019t need you \u2019ole.\u201d</p><p>Still gripping my shoulder, he lifted his knife and pressed the flat of the blade against my lips, jammed the tip of it up my nose, then leaned close enough that I felt the moist warmth of his very repugnant breath on my face.</p><p>\u201cThe one thing I won\u2019t cut off is your tongue,\u201d he whispered. The knife blade drew slowly out of my nose, down my chin, along the line of my neck, and circled round the curve of my breast. \u201cYou take my meaning, do you?\u201d</p><p>He waited until I managed a nod, then released me and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>If he meant to unnerve me, he\u2019d managed nicely. I was sweating despite the chill, and still shaking when a tall shadow loomed up beside me, took one of my hands, and pressed something into it.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Tebbe,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou remember that\u2014Tebbe. Remember I was good to you. Tell your spirits they don\u2019t hurt Tebbe, he was good to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded once more, astonished, and was left again, this time with a lump of bread in my hand. I ate it hastily, observing that while very stale, it had originally been good dark rye bread, of the sort the German women of Salem made. Had the men attacked some house near there, or merely bought the bread?</p><p>A horse\u2019s saddle had been flung down on the ground near me; a canteen hung from the pommel, and I sank down on my knees to drink from it. The bread and the water\u2014tasting of canvas and wood\u2014tasted better than anything I\u2019d eaten in a long while. I\u2019d noticed before that standing very close to death improves the appetite remarkably. Still, I did hope for something more elaborate as a last meal.</p><p>Hodgepile returned a few minutes later, with rope. He didn\u2019t bother with further threats, evidently feeling that he\u2019d made his point. He merely tied me hand and foot, and pushed me down on the ground. No one spoke to me, but someone, with a kindly impulse, threw a blanket over me.</p><p>The camp settled quickly. No fire was lit, and so no supper was cooked; the men presumably refreshed themselves in the same makeshift way I had, then scattered into the wood to seek their rest, leaving the horses tethered a little way off.</p><p>I waited until the comings and goings died down, then took the blanket in my teeth and wriggled carefully away from the spot where I had been placed, making my way inchworm fashion to another tree, a dozen yards away.</p><p>I had no thought of escape in doing this; but if one of the bandits in favor of disposing of me should think to take advantage of the darkness in order to achieve their aims, I didn\u2019t mean to be lying there like a staked goat. With luck, if anyone came skulking round the spot where I\u2019d been, I would have enough warning to scream for help.</p><p>I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that Jamie would come. My job was to survive until he did.</p><p>Panting, sweating, covered with crumbled leaves and with my stockings in rags, I curled up under a big hornbeam, and burrowed back under the blanket. Thus concealed, I had a try at undoing the knots in the rope around my wrists with my teeth. Hodgepile had tied them, though, and had done so with military thoroughness. Short of gnawing gopherlike through the ropes themselves, I was going nowhere.</p><p>Military. It was that thought that recalled suddenly to me who he was, and where I had seen him before. Arvin Hodgepile! He had been the clerk at the Crown\u2019s warehouse in Cross Creek. I had met him briefly, three years before, when Jamie and I brought the body of a murdered girl to the sergeant of the garrison there.</p><p>Sergeant Murchison was dead\u2014and I\u2019d thought Hodgepile was, as well, killed in the conflagration that had destroyed the warehouse and its contents. So, a deserter, then. Either he had had time to escape the warehouse before it went up in flames, or had simply not been there at the time. In either case, he\u2019d been clever enough to realize that he could take this opportunity to disappear from His Majesty\u2019s army, leaving his death to be assumed.</p><p>What he had been doing since then was clear, too. Wandering the countryside, stealing, robbing, and killing\u2014and collecting a number of like-minded companions along the way.</p><p>Not that they appeared to be of one mind just at present. While Hodgepile might be the self-proclaimed leader of this gang at the moment, it was plain to see that he hadn\u2019t held the position for long. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to command, didn\u2019t know how to manage men, save by threat. I\u2019d seen many military commanders in my time, good and bad, and recognized the difference.</p><p>I could hear Hodgepile even now, voice raised in distant argument with someone. I\u2019d seen his sort before, vicious men who could temporarily cow those near them by outbursts of unpredictable violence. They seldom lasted long\u2014and I doubted that Hodgepile was going to last much longer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to last any longer than it took for Jamie to find us. That thought calmed me like a slug of good whisky. Jamie would surely be looking for me by now.</p><p>I curled tighter under my blanket, shivering a little. Jamie would need light to track at night\u2014torches. That would make him and his party visible\u2014and vulnerable\u2014if they came within sight of the camp. The camp itself wouldn\u2019t be visible; there was no fire lit, and the horses and men were scattered through the wood. I knew sentries had been posted; I could hear them moving in the wood now and then, talking low-voiced.</p><p>But Jamie was no fool, I told myself, trying to drive away visions of ambush and massacre. He would know, from the freshness of the horses\u2019 dung, if he were drawing close, and certainly wouldn\u2019t be marching right up to the camp, torches blazing. If he had tracked the party this far, he would\u2014</p><p>The sound of quiet footsteps froze me. They were coming from the direction of my original resting place, and I cowered under my blanket like a field mouse with a weasel in sight.</p><p>The steps shuffled slowly to and fro, as though someone was poking his way through the dried leaves and pine needles, looking for me. I held my breath, though surely no one could hear that, with the night wind sighing through the branches overhead.</p><p>I strained my eyes at the darkness, but could make out nothing more than a faint blur moving among the tree trunks, a dozen yards away. A sudden thought struck me\u2014could it be Jamie? If he had come close enough to locate the camp, he would very likely steal in on foot, looking for me.</p><p>I drew breath at the thought, straining against my bonds. I wanted urgently to call out, but didn\u2019t dare. If it should be Jamie, calling to him would expose his presence to the bandits. If I could hear the sentries, they could certainly hear me.</p><p>But if it were not Jamie, but one of the bandits, seeking to kill me quietly . . .</p><p>I let my breath out very slowly, every muscle in my body clenched and trembling. It was cool enough, but I was bathed in sweat; I could smell my own body, the reek of fear mingling with the colder smells of earth and vegetation.</p><p>The blur had vanished, the footsteps gone, and my heart was pounding like a kettledrum. The tears I had held back for hours seeped out, hot on my face, and I wept, shaking silently.</p><p>The night was immense around me, the darkness filled with threat. Overhead, the stars hung bright and watchful in the sky, and at some point, I slept.</p><p>28</p><p>CURSES</p><p>I WOKE JUST BEFORE DAWN, in a muck sweat and with a throbbing headache. The men were already moving, grumbling about the lack of coffee or breakfast.</p><p>Hodgepile stopped beside me, looking down with narrowed eyes. He glanced toward the tree beneath which he had left me the night before and the deep furrow of disturbed leaf mold I had created in worm-crawling toward my present spot. He had very little in the way of lips, but his lower jaw compressed in displeasure.</p><p>He pulled the knife from his belt, and I felt the blood drain from my face. However, he merely knelt and cut my bonds, rather than slicing off a finger by way of expressing his emotions.</p><p>\u201cWe leave in five minutes,\u201d he said, and stalked off. I was quivering and faintly nauseated with fear, and so stiff that I could barely stand. I managed to get to my feet, though, and staggered the short distance to a small stream.</p><p>The air was damp and I was now chilly in my sweat-soaked shift, but cold water splashed on my hands and face seemed to help a little, soothing the throb behind my right eye. I had just time to make a hasty toilet, removing the rags of my stockings and running wet fingers through my hair, before Hodgepile reappeared to march me off again.</p><p>This time, I was put on a horse, but not tied, thank God. I wasn\u2019t allowed to hold the reins, though; my mount was on a leading rein, held by one of the bandits.</p><p>It was my first chance to get a good look at my captors, as they came out of the wood and shook themselves into rough order, coughing, spitting, and urinating on trees without reference to my presence. Beyond Hodgepile, I counted twelve more men\u2014a baker\u2019s dozen of villains. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was easy to pick out the man called Tebbe; his height aside, he was a mulatto. There was another man of mixed blood\u2014black and Indian, I thought\u2014but he was short and squat. Tebbe didn\u2019t glance in my direction, but went about his business with head lowered, scowling.</p><p>That was a disappointment; I didn\u2019t know what had passed among the men during the night, but evidently Tebbe\u2019s insistence that I be released was no longer so insistent. A rust-spotted kerchief bound his wrist; that might have something to do with it.</p><p>The young man who had guided my horse the night before was also easy to pick out, by way of his long, bushy hair, but he didn\u2019t come near, and avoided looking at me, too. Rather to my surprise, he was an Indian\u2014not Cherokee; perhaps a Tuscarora? I hadn\u2019t expected that from his speech, nor his curly hair. Clearly he was mixed-blood, too.</p><p>The rest of the gang were more or less white, but a motley crew, nonetheless. Three of them were no more than half-bearded boys in their mid-teens, scruffy and gangling. They did look at me, goggling drop-jawed, and nudging one another. I stared at one of them until he met my eye; he went bright scarlet beneath his sparse whiskers, and looked away.</p> <p>Fortunately, the shift I was wearing was one with sleeves; the thing covered me decently enough from drawstring neck to the hem at mid-calf, but there was no denying that I felt uncomfortably exposed. The shift was damp and clung limply to the curve of my br**sts\u2014a sensation I was uncomfortably aware of. I wished I had kept hold of the blanket.</p><p>The men swirled slowly round me, loading the horses, and I had the distinct and unpleasant sense of being the center of the mass\u2014in much the same way a bull\u2019s-eye lies at the center of a target. I could only hope that I looked aged and cronelike enough for my state of untidiness to be repellent, rather than interesting; my hair was loose, wild, and tangled as witch\u2019s moss around my shoulders, and I certainly felt as though I had been crumpled up like an old paper bag.</p><p>I held myself bolt upright in the saddle, giving an unfriendly glare to anyone who so much as glanced in my direction. One man blinked blearily at my bare leg with a faint look of speculation\u2014only to recoil noticeably when he met my eye.</p><p>That gave me a momentary feeling of grim satisfaction\u2014superseded almost immediately by shock. The horses had begun to move, and as mine obediently followed the man in front of me, two more men came into view, standing under a big oak. I knew them both.</p><p>Harley Boble was tying the strings on a packsaddle, scowling as he said something to another, larger man. Harley Boble was an erstwhile thieftaker, now evidently turned thief. A thoroughly nasty little man, he was unlikely to be well-disposed toward me, owing to an occurrence at a Gathering some time before.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t at all pleased to see him here, though I was by no means surprised to find him in such company. But it was the sight of his companion that caused my empty stomach to contract, and my skin to twitch like a horse with flies.</p><p>Mr. Lionel Brown, of Brownsville.</p><p>He looked up, caught sight of me, and turned hastily away again, shoulders hunching. He must have realized that I had seen him, though, for he turned back to face me, thin features set in a sort of weary defiance. His nose was swollen and discolored, a dark red bulb visible even in the grayish light. He stared at me for a moment, then nodded as though making some reluctant acknowledgment, and turned away again.</p><p>I risked a glance back over my shoulder as we entered the trees, but couldn\u2019t see him anymore. What was he doing here? I hadn\u2019t recognized his voice at the time, but clearly it had been he who had argued with Hodgepile about the wisdom of taking me. Little wonder! He wasn\u2019t the only one disturbed by our mutual recognition.</p><p>Lionel Brown and his brother, Richard, were traders; the founders and patriarchs of Brownsville, a tiny settlement in the hills some forty miles from the Ridge. It was one thing for freebooters like Boble or Hodgepile to roam the countryside, robbing and burning; quite another for the Browns of Brownsville to be providing a base for their depredations. The very last thing in the world Mr. Lionel Brown could wish would be for me to reach Jamie with word of what he had been up to.</p><p>And I rather thought he would take steps to prevent me doing so. The sun was coming up, beginning to warm the air, but I felt suddenly cold, as though I had been dropped in a well.</p> <p>Rays of light shone through the branches, gilding the remnants of the night mist that veiled the trees and silvering the dripping edges of their leaves. The trees were alive with birdsong, and a towhee hopped and scratched in a patch of sun, oblivious of the passing men and horses. It was too early yet for flies and mosquitoes, and the soft morning breeze caressed my face. Definitely one of those prospects where only man was vile.</p><p>The morning passed quietly enough, but I was aware of the constant state of tension among the men\u2014though no more tense than I was.</p><p>Jamie Fraser, where are you? I thought, concentrating fiercely on the forest around us. Every distant rustle or snap of twig might presage rescue, and my nerves began to be distinctly frayed in anticipation.</p><p>Where? When? How? I had neither reins nor weapons; if\u2014when\u2014an attack was made on the group, my best\u2014well, the only possible\u2014strategy was to fling myself off the horse and run. As we rode I constantly evaluated each patch of witch-hazel and stand of spruce, spotting footholds, plotting a zigzag path through saplings and boulders.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only an attack by Jamie and his men that I was preparing for; I couldn\u2019t see Lionel Brown, but I knew he was somewhere nearby. A spot between my shoulder blades clenched in a knot, anticipating a knife.</p><p>I kept an eye out for potential weapons: rocks of a useful size, branches that might be seized from the ground. If and when I ran, I meant to let no one stop me. But we pushed on, moving as quickly as the horses\u2019 footing allowed, men glancing back constantly over their shoulders, hands on their guns. As for me, I was obliged to relinquish my imaginary grasp on each possible weapon in turn as it slid past, out of sight.</p><p>To my intense disappointment, we reached the gorge near midday, without incident.</p><p>I had visited the gorge once with Jamie. The cataract fell sixty feet down a granite cliff face, sparkling with rainbows and roaring with a voice like the archangel Michael. Fronds of red chokeberry and wild indigo fringed the falls, and yellow poplars overhung the river below the cataract\u2019s pool, so thick that no more than a fugitive gleam from the water\u2019s surface showed between the banks of lush vegetation. Hodgepile, of course, had not been drawn by the scenic beauty of the spot.</p> <p>\u201cGet off.\u201d A gruff voice spoke near my elbow, and I looked down to see Tebbe. \u201cWe will swim the horses across. You come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d My heart sprang up into my throat at the sound of a thickly nasal voice. It was Lionel Brown, pushing his way past an overhanging rope of creeper, dark eyes intent on me.</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d Tebbe rounded on Brown, fist closed.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d I repeated firmly. \u201cI\u2019m going with him.\u201d I slid off the horse and promptly took shelter behind the big mulatto\u2019s menacing frame, peering out at Brown from beneath the bigger man\u2019s arm.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t under the slightest illusion about Brown\u2019s intent. He wouldn\u2019t risk assassinating me under Hodgepile\u2019s eye, but he could\u2014and would\u2014drown me easily, and claim it was an accident. The river was shallow here, but still fast; I could hear it whooshing past the rocks near shore.</p><p>Brown\u2019s eyes darted right, then left, thinking whether to try it on\u2014but Tebbe hunched his massive shoulders, and Brown gave it up as a bad job. He snorted, spat to one side, and stamped away, snapping branches.</p><p>I might never have a better chance. Not waiting for the sounds of Brown\u2019s huffy exit to subside, I slipped a hand over the big man\u2019s elbow and squeezed his arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, low-voiced. \u201cFor what you did last night. Are you badly hurt?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at me, apprehension clear in his face. My touching him plainly disconcerted him; I could feel the tension in his arm as he tried to decide whether to pull away from me or not.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI am all right.\u201d He hesitated a moment, but then smiled uncertainly.</p><p>It was obvious what Hodgepile intended; the horses were being led, one at a time, down a narrow deer trail that edged the escarpment. We were more than a mile from the cataract, but the air was still loud with its noise. The sides of the gorge plunged steeply down to the water, more than fifty feet below, and the opposite bank was equally steep and overgrown.</p><p>A thick fringe of bushes hid the edge of the bank, but I could see that the river spread out here, becoming slower as it shallowed. With no dangerous currents, the horses could be taken downstream, to come out at some random point on the opposite shore. Anyone who had succeeded in tracking us to the gorge would lose the trail here, and have no little difficulty in picking it up on the opposite side.</p><p>With an effort, I stopped myself looking back over my shoulder for signs of imminent pursuit. My heart was beating fast. If Jamie was nearby, he would wait and attack the group when they entered the water, when they were most vulnerable. Even if he were not yet near, it would be a confusing business, crossing the river. If there were ever a time to attempt an escape . . .</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go with them,\u201d I said conversationally to Tebbe. \u201cYou\u2019ll die, too.\u201d</p><p>The arm under my hand jerked convulsively. He glanced down at me, wide-eyed. The sclera of his eyes were yellow with jaundice, and the irises broken, giving him an odd, smudgy stare.</p><p>\u201cI told him the truth, you know.\u201d I lifted my chin toward Hodgepile, visible in the distance. \u201cHe\u2019ll die. So will all those with him. There\u2019s no need for you to die, though.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something under his breath, and pressed a fist against his chest. He had something on a string there, hanging beneath his shirt. I didn\u2019t know whether it might be a cross or some more pagan amulet, but he seemed to be responding well to suggestion so far.</p><p>So close to the river, the air was thick with moisture, live with the smell of green things and water.</p><p>\u201cThe water is my friend,\u201d I said, trying for an air of mystery suitable to a conjure woman. I was not a good liar, but I was lying for my life. \u201cWhen we go into the river, let go your hold. A water horse will rise up to carry me away.\u201d</p><p>His eyes couldn\u2019t get any wider. Evidently, he\u2019d heard of kelpies, or something like them. Even this far from the cataract, the roar of the water had voices in it\u2014if one chose to listen.</p><p>\u201cI am not going away with a water horse,\u201d he said with conviction. \u201cI know about them. They take you down, drown you, and eat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t eat me,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYou needn\u2019t go near it. Just stand clear, once we\u2019re in the water. Keep well away.\u201d</p><p>And if he did, I\u2019d be under the water and swimming for my life before he could say Jack Robinson. I would be willing to bet that most of Hodgepile\u2019s bandits couldn\u2019t swim; few people in the mountains could. I flexed my leg muscles, readying myself, aches and stiffness dissolved in a flood of adrenaline.</p><p>Half the men were over the edge with the horses already\u2014I could delay Tebbe, I thought, until the rest were safely in the water. Even if he wouldn\u2019t deliberately connive at my escape, if I slipped his grasp, I thought he wouldn\u2019t try to catch me.</p><p>He pulled halfheartedly at my arm, and I stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cOuch! Wait, I\u2019ve stepped on a bur.\u201d</p><p>I lifted one foot, peering at the sole. Given the dirt and resin stains adhering to it, no one could possibly have told whether I had picked up cockleburs, bramble thorns, or even a horseshoe nail.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go, woman.\u201d I didn\u2019t know whether it was my proximity, the roar of the water, or the thought of water horses that was disturbing Tebbe, but he was sweating with nerves; his odor had changed from simple musk to something sharp and pungent.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d I said, pretending to pick at my foot. \u201cNearly got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it. I will carry you.\u201d</p><p>Tebbe was breathing heavily, looking back and forth from me to the edge of the gorge, where the deer trail disappeared into the growth, as though fearing the reappearance of Hodgepile.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Hodgepile who popped out of the bushes, though. It was Lionel Brown, his face set with purpose, two younger men behind him, looking equally determined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d he said without preamble, grabbing my arm.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d By reflex, Tebbe clutched my other arm and pulled.</p><p>An undignified tug-of-war ensued, with Tebbe and Mr. Brown each jerking one of my arms. Before I could be split like a wishbone, Tebbe fortunately changed tactics. Releasing my arm, he seized me instead about the body and clutched me to himself, kicking out with one foot at Mr. Brown.</p><p>The result of this maneuver was to cause Tebbe and myself to fall backward into an untidy pile of arms and legs, while Brown also lost his balance, though I didn\u2019t realize at first that he had. All I was aware of was a loud yell and stumbling noises, followed by a crash and the rattle of dislodged stones bounding down a rocky slope.</p><p>Disengaging myself from Tebbe, I crawled out, to discover the rest of the men grouped round an ominously flattened spot in the bushes fringing the gorge. One or two were hurriedly fetching ropes and yelling contradictory orders, from which I deduced that Mr. Brown had indeed fallen into the gorge, but was not yet certifiably dead.</p><p>I rapidly reversed directions, meaning to dive headfirst into the vegetation, but came up instead against a pair of cracked boots, belonging to Hodgepile. He seized me by the hair and yanked, causing me to shriek and lash out at him in reflex. I caught him across the midriff. He oomphed and went open-mouthed, gasping for air, but didn\u2019t let go his iron grip on my hair.</p><p>Making furious faces in my direction, he let go then, and boosted me toward the edge of the gorge with a knee. One of the younger men was clinging to the bushes, feeling gingerly for footholds on the slope below, one rope tied round his waist and another slung in a coil over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFrigging mort!\u201d Hodgepile yelled, digging his fingers into my arm as he leaned through the broken bushes. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean by this, you bitch?\u201d</p><p>He capered on the edge of the gorge like Rumpelstiltskin, shaking his fist and hurling abuse impartially at his damaged business partner and at me, while the rescue operations commenced. Tebbe had withdrawn to a safe distance, where he stood looking offended.</p><p>At length, Brown was hauled up, groaning loudly, and laid out on the grass. Those men not already in the river gathered round, looking hot and flustered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to mend him, conjure woman?\u201d Tebbe asked, glancing skeptically at me. I didn\u2019t know whether he meant to cast doubt upon my abilities, or only on the wisdom of my helping Brown, but I nodded, a little uncertainly, and came forward.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d An oath was an oath, though I rather wondered if Hippocrates ever ran into this sort of situation himself. Possibly he did; the ancient Greeks were a violent lot, too.</p><p>The men gave way to me easily enough; once having got Brown out of the gorge, it was obvious that they had no notion what to do about him.</p><p>I did a hasty triage. Aside from multiple cuts, contusions, and a thick coating of dust and mud, Mr. Lionel Brown had fractured his left leg in at least two places, broken his left wrist, and probably crushed a couple of ribs. Only one of the leg fractures was compound, but it was nasty, the jagged end of the broken thighbone poking through skin and breeches, surrounded by a steadily widening patch of red.</p><p>He had unfortunately not severed his femoral artery, since if he had, he would have been dead already. Still, Mr. Brown had probably ceased to be a personal threat to me for the moment, which was all to the good.</p><p>Lacking any equipment or medication, bar several filthy neckcloths, a pine branch, and some whisky from a canteen, my ministrations were necessarily limited. I managed\u2014with no little difficulty and quite a lot of whisky\u2014to get the femur roughly straightened and splinted without having Brown die of shock, which I thought no small accomplishment under the circumstances.</p><p>It was a difficult job, though, and I was muttering to myself under my breath\u2014something I hadn\u2019t realized I was doing, until I glanced up to find Tebbe crouched on his heels on the other side of Brown\u2019s body, regarding me with interest.</p><p>\u201cOh, you curse him,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cYes, that is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Brown\u2019s eyes sprang open and bugged out. He was half off his head with pain, and thoroughly drunk by now, but not quite so drunk as to overlook this.</p><p>\u201cMake her stop,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cHere, Hodgepile\u2014make her stop! Make her take it back!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ere, what\u2019s this? What did you say, woman?\u201d Hodgepile had simmered down a bit, but his animus was instantly rekindled by this. He reached down and grabbed my wrist just as I was feeling my way over Brown\u2019s injured torso. It was the wrist he had twisted so viciously the day before, and a stab of pain shot up my forearm.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, I expect I said \u2018Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ\u2019!\u201d I snapped. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said when she cursed you! Get her away from me! Don\u2019t let her touch me!\u201d Panicked, Brown made to squirm away from me, a very bad idea for a man with freshly broken bones. He went dead-white under the smears of mud, and his eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>\u201cLook at that! He\u2019s dead!\u201d one of the onlookers exclaimed. \u201cShe\u2019s done it! She witched him!\u201d</p><p>This caused no little uproar, between the vocal approbation of Tebbe and his supporters, my own protests, and outcries of concern from Mr. Brown\u2019s friends and relations, one of whom squatted down by the body, putting an ear to the chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d this man exclaimed. \u201cUncle Lionel! You all right?\u201d</p><p>Lionel Brown groaned loudly and opened his eyes, causing further commotion. The young man who had called him Uncle drew a large knife from his belt and pointed it at me. His eyes were open so wide that the whites showed all around.</p><p>\u201cYou get back!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you touch him!\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands, palms out, in gesture of abnegation.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d There was, in fact, little more I could do for Brown. He should be kept warm, dry, and well-hydrated, but something told me that Hodgepile would not be open to any such suggestions.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. By means of furious and repeated bellows, he quelled the incipient riot, then declared that we were crossing the gorge, and right quickly, too.</p><p>\u201cPut \u2019im on a stretcher, then,\u201d he said impatiently, in reply to protests from Brown\u2019s nephew. \u201cAnd as for you\u2014\u201d He rounded on me, glaring. \u201cDid I tell you? No tricks, I said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d Brown said hoarsely from the ground. \u201cKill her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill her? Not bloody likely, oul\u2019 son.\u201d Hodgepile\u2019s eyes gleamed with malice. \u201cShe\u2019s no more risk to me alive than dead\u2014and a good bit more profit alive. But I\u2019ll keep her in line.\u201d</p><p>The knife was never far from his grasp. He had it out in an instant, and had seized my hand. Before I could so much as draw breath, I felt the blade press down, cutting partway into the base of my forefinger.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I told you, do you?\u201d He breathed it, his face was soft with anticipation. \u201cI don\u2019t need you whole.\u201d</p><p>I did remember, and my belly hollowed, my throat dried to silence. My skin burned where he cut, and pain spread in a flash through my nerves; the need to jerk away from the blade was so strong that the muscles of my arm cramped with it.</p><p>I could imagine vividly the spurting stump, the shock of broken bone, ripped flesh, the horror of irrevocable loss.</p><p>But behind Hodgepile, Tebbe had risen to his feet. His odd, smudgy stare was fixed on me, with an expression of fascinated dread. I saw his hand close in a fist, his throat move as he swallowed, and felt the saliva return to my own. If I was to keep his protection, I must keep his belief.</p><p>I fixed my eyes on Hodgepile\u2019s, and made myself lean toward him. My skin quivered and jumped, and the blood roared louder in my ears than the voice of the cataract\u2014but I opened my eyes wide. A witch\u2019s eyes\u2014or so some said.</p><p>Very, very slowly, I lifted my free hand, still wet with Brown\u2019s blood. I reached the bloody fingers toward Hodgepile\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said, my voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cDo you remember what I said?\u201d</p><p>He would have done it. I saw the decision flash in his eyes, but before he could press the knife blade down, the bushy-haired young Indian leaped forward, grabbing at his arm with a cry of horror. Distracted, Hodgepile let go his grip, and I pulled free.</p><p>In an instant, Tebbe and two more men surged forward, hands on knives and pistol grips.</p><p>Hodgepile\u2019s thin face was pinched with fury, but the moment of incipient violence had passed. He lowered his own knife, the menace receding.</p><p>I opened my mouth to say something that might help defuse the situation further, but was forestalled by a panicked cry from Brown\u2019s nephew.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her talk! She\u2019ll curse us all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bleedin\u2019 \u2019ell,\u201d said Hodgepile, fury transmuted to mere crossness.</p><p>I had used several neckcloths to bind Brown\u2019s splint. Hodgepile stooped and snatched one from the ground, wadded it into a ball, and stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he said tersely, and seizing my jaw with one hand, he forced open my mouth and crammed the wadded fabric into it. He glared at Tebbe, who had made a jerky move forward.</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t kill her. But she says not a word more. Not to \u2019im\u201d\u2014he nodded at Brown, then Tebbe\u2014\u201cnot to you. Nor me.\u201d He glanced back at me, and to my surprise, I saw a lurking uneasiness in his eyes. \u201cNot to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Tebbe looked uncertain, but Hodgepile was already tying his own neckcloth round my head, effectively gagging me.</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Hodgepile repeated, glaring round at the company. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>WE CROSSED THE river. To my surprise, Lionel Brown survived, but it was a lengthy business, and the sun was low by the time we made camp, two miles past the gorge on the farther side.</p><p>Everyone was wet, and a fire was kindled without discussion. The currents of dissension and distrust were still there, but had been damped by the river and exhaustion. Everyone was simply too tired for further strife.</p><p>They had tied my hands loosely, but left my feet unbound; I made my way to a fallen log near the fire and sank down, utterly drained. I was damp and chilled, my muscles trembling with exhaustion\u2014I had been forced to walk from the river\u2014and for the first time, I began to wonder whether Jamie would in fact find me. Ever.</p><p>Perhaps he had followed the wrong group of bandits. Perhaps he had found and attacked them\u2014and been wounded or killed in the fight. I had closed my eyes, but opened them again, seeking to avoid the visions this thought had conjured up. I still worried about Marsali\u2014but either they had found her in time or they hadn\u2019t; either way, her fate had been decided.</p><p>The fire was burning well, at least; cold, wet, and eager for hot food, the men had brought an immense pile of wood. A short, silent black man was stoking the fire, while a couple of the teenagers rifled the packs for food. A pot of water was set on the fire with a chunk of salt beef, and the lion-haired young Indian poured cornmeal into a bowl with a lump of lard.</p><p>Another bit of lard sizzled on an iron girdle, melting into grease. It smelled wonderful.</p><p>Saliva flooded my mouth, absorbed at once into the wad of fabric, and despite discomfort, the smell of food bolstered my spirits a little. My stays, loosened by the travel of the last twenty-four hours, had tightened again as the wet laces dried and shrank. My skin itched beneath the fabric, but the thin ribs of the boning did give me a sense of support, more than welcome at the moment.</p><p>Mr. Brown\u2019s two nephews\u2014Aaron and Moses, I had learned\u2014limped slowly into camp, a makeshift stretcher sagging between them. They set it gratefully down beside the fire, evoking a loud yell from the contents.</p><p>Mr. Brown had survived the river crossing, but it hadn\u2019t done him any good. Of course, I had told them he should be kept well-hydrated. The thought undid me, tired as I was, and I made a muffled snorting sound behind my gag.</p><p>One of the young lads nearby heard me, and reached tentatively for the knot of my gag, but dropped his hand at once when Hodgepile barked at him.</p><p>\u201cLeave her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014don\u2019t she need to eat, Hodge?\u201d The boy glanced uneasily at me.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Hodgepile squatted down in front of me, looking me over. \u201cLearned your lesson yet, \u2019ave you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t move. Just sat and looked at him, infusing my gaze with as much scorn as possible. The cut on my finger burned; my palms had begun to sweat\u2014but I stared. He tried to stare back, but couldn\u2019t do it\u2014his eyes kept slipping away.</p><p>That made him even angrier; a flush burned high on his bony cheeks.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me!\u201d</p><p>I blinked slowly, once, and kept looking, with what I hoped appeared to be interested dispassion. He was looking rather strained, our Mr. Hodgepile was. Dark circles under the eyes, muscle fibers bracketing his mouth like lines carved in wood. Sweat stains wet and hot beneath the armpits. Constant browbeating must take it out of one.</p><p>All at once, he stood up, grabbed me by the arm, and yanked me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you where you can\u2019t stare, bitch,\u201d he muttered, and marched me past the fire, shoving me ahead of him. A little way outside the camp, he found a tree to his liking. He untied my hands and rebound my wrists, with a loop of line wrapped round my waist and my hands fastened to it. Then he pushed me down into a seated position, fashioned a crude noose with a slipknot, and put it round my neck, tying the free end to the tree.</p><p>\u201cSo as you won\u2019t wander away,\u201d he said, pulling the rough hemp snug around my neck. \u201cShouldn\u2019t want you to get lost. Might be eaten by a bear, and then what, eh?\u201d This had quite restored his humor; he laughed immoderately, and was still chuckling when he left. He turned, though, to glance back at me. I sat upright, staring, and the humor abruptly left his face. He turned and strode off, shoulders stiff as wood.</p><p>In spite of hunger, thirst, and general discomfort, I actually felt a sense of profound, if momentary, relief. If I was not strictly speaking alone, I was at least unobserved, and even this modicum of privacy was balm.</p><p>I was a good twenty yards from the fire ring, out of sight of all the men. I sagged against the tree trunk, the muscles of face and body giving way all at once, and a shiver seized me, though it wasn\u2019t cold.</p><p>Soon. Surely Jamie would find me soon. Unless\u2014I pushed the dubious thought aside as though it were a venomous scorpion. Likewise any thought of what had happened to Marsali, or might happen if and when\u2014no, when\u2014he did find us. I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d manage, but he would. He just would.</p><p>The sun was nearly down; shadows were pooling under the trees and the light faded slowly from the air, making colors fugitive and solid objects lose their depth. There was rushing water somewhere nearby, and the calling of the occasional bird in the distant trees. These began to fall silent as the evening cooled, replaced by the rising chirp of crickets near at hand. My eye caught the flicker of movement, and I saw a rabbit, gray as the dusk, sitting up on its hind legs under a bush a few feet distant, nose twitching.</p><p>The sheer normalcy of it all made my eyes sting. I blinked away the tears, and the rabbit was gone.</p><p>The sight of it had restored my nerve a little; I essayed a few experiments, to see the limits of my present bondage. My legs were free\u2014that was good. I could rise up into a sort of ungainly squat, and duck-waddle round the tree. Even better; I would be able to relieve myself in privacy on the far side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could not, however, rise entirely to my feet, nor could I reach the knot of the line that circled the tree trunk; the rope either slid or caught on the bark, but in either case, the knot remained frustratingly on the opposite side of the trunk\u2014which had to measure nearly three feet in diameter.</p><p>I had about two feet of line between the trunk and the noose about my neck; enough to allow me to lie down, or to turn from side to side. Hodgepile was rather obviously well-acquainted with convenient methods of restraining captives; I thought of the O\u2019Brians\u2019 homestead, and the two bodies there. The two elder children missing. A small shudder passed over me again.</p><p>Where were they? Sold to one of the Indian tribes as slaves? Taken to a sailors\u2019 brothel in one of the coastal towns? Or onto a ship, to be pressed into use on the sugar plantations of the Indies?</p><p>I was under no illusions that any of these picturesquely unpleasant fates lay in store for me. I was much too old, much too obstreperous\u2014and much too notorious. No, the only value I held for Hodgepile was my knowledge of the whisky cache. Once he had got within sniffing distance of that, he would slit my throat without a moment\u2019s compunction.</p> <p>The smell of roasting meat floated through the air, flooding my mouth with fresh saliva\u2014a welcome relief, in spite of the growling of my stomach, since the gag dried my mouth unpleasantly.</p><p>A tiny jolt of panic tensed my muscles. I didn\u2019t want to think about the gag. Or the ropes around my wrists and neck. It would be too easy to succumb to the panic of confinement, and exhaust myself in futile struggle. I had to preserve my strength; I didn\u2019t know when or how I would need it, but need it I surely would. Soon, I prayed. Let it be soon.</p><p>The men had settled to their supper, the contentions of the day sunk in appetite. They were far enough away that I couldn\u2019t hear the particulars of their conversation, but only the stray word or phrase borne on the evening breeze. I turned my head to let the breeze smooth the hair from my face, and found that I could see a long, narrow swath of sky above the distant gorge, gone a deep, unearthly blue, as though the fragile layer of atmosphere that covered the earth grew thinner still, and the darkness of space beyond shone through.</p><p>The stars began to prick out, one by one, and I managed to lose myself in watching, counting them as they appeared, one by one by one . . . touching them as I might the beads of a rosary, and saying to myself such astronomical names as I knew, comforting in their sound, even though I had no idea whether such names bore any relation to the celestial bodies I saw. Alpha Centauri, Deneb, Sirius, Betelgeuse, the Pleiades, Orion . . .</p><p>I succeeded in soothing myself to the extent that I dozed off, only to rouse some time later to find it now full dark. The light of the fire sent a flickering glow through the underbrush, painting my feet, which lay in an open spot, with rosy shadows. I stirred and stretched myself as well as I could, trying to relieve the stiffness in my back, and wondered whether Hodgepile thought himself safe now, to be allowing such a large fire?</p> <p>A loud groan came to me on the wind\u2014Lionel Brown. I grimaced, but there was nothing I could do for him in my present condition.</p><p>I heard shuffling and a murmur of voices; someone was attending to him.</p><p>\u201c. . . hot as a pistol . . .\u201d one voice said, sounding only mildly concerned.</p><p>\u201c. . . fetch the woman? . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said a definite voice. Hodgepile. I sighed.</p><p>\u201c. . . water. No help for that . . .\u201d</p> <p>I was listening so intently, in hopes of hearing what was happening by the fire, that it was some time before I became aware of noises in the brush nearby. Not animals; only bears would make that much noise, and bears didn\u2019t giggle. The giggling was subdued, not only muffled but repeatedly interrupted.</p><p>There was whispering, too, though I couldn\u2019t make out most of the words. The overall atmosphere was so much one of excited juvenile conspiracy, though, that I knew it must be some of the younger members of the gang.</p><p>\u201c. . . go on, then!\u201d I caught, spoken in a vehement tone, and accompanied by a crashing noise, indicating that someone had been pushed into a tree. Another crash, indicating retaliation.</p><p>More rustling. Whisper, whisper, snigger, snort. I sat up straight, wondering what in God\u2019s name they were up to.</p><p>Then I heard, \u201cHer legs aren\u2019t tied . . .\u201d and my heart gave a small jump.</p><p>\u201cBut what if she . . .\u201d mumble, mumble.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t matter. She can\u2019t scream.\u201d</p><p>That came through very clearly, and I jerked my feet back to scramble up\u2014only to be brought up short by the noose around my neck. It felt like an iron bar across my windpipe, and I fell back, seeing blood-red blotches at the corners of my eyes.</p> <p>I shook my head and gulped air, trying to shake off the dizziness, adrenaline racing through my blood. I felt a hand on my ankle, and kicked out sharply.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said out loud, sounding surprised. He took his hand off my ankle and sat back a little. My vision was clearing; I could see him now, but the firelight was behind him; it was one of the young lads, but no more than a faceless, hunched silhouette in front of me.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, and giggled nervously, reaching out a hand toward me. I made a deep growling noise behind my gag, and he stopped, frozen in mid-reach. There was a rustling in the brush behind him.</p><p>This seemed to remind him that his friend\u2014or friends\u2014were watching, and he reached out with renewed resolution, patting me on the thigh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered, duck-walking closer on his heels, \u201cI don\u2019t mean you no harm.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, and he hesitated again\u2014but then another rustle from the bush seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he grasped me by the shoulders, trying to make me lie down. I struggled hard, kicking and kneeing at him, and he lost his grip, lost his balance, and fell on his backside.</p><p>A muffled explosion of sniggering from the bush brought him up on his feet like a jack-in-the-box. He reached down with decision, seized my ankles, and yanked, jerking me flat. Then he flung himself on top of me, pinning me with his weight.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d he said urgently into my ear. His hands were grappling for my throat, and I squirmed and thrashed under his weight, trying to buck him off. His hands closed tight on my neck, though, and I stopped, my vision going black and bloody once again.</p><p>\u201cHush, now,\u201d he said more quietly. \u201cYou just hush, ma\u2019am, all right?\u201d I was making small choking noises, which he must have taken for assent, for his grip slackened.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna hurt you, ma\u2019am, I really ain\u2019t,\u201d he whispered, trying to hold me down with one hand while fumbling about between us with the other. \u201cWould you just be still, please?\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t, and he finally put a forearm across my throat and leaned on it. Not hard enough to make me black out again, but hard enough to take some of the fight out of me. He was thin and wiry, but very strong, and by dint of simple determination, succeeded in pushing up my shift and wedging his knee between my thighs.</p><p>He was breathing nearly as hard as I was, and I could smell the goaty reek of his excitement. His hands had left my throat, and were feverishly grasping at my br**sts, in a manner that made it reasonably clear that the only other breast he\u2019d ever touched was likely his mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHush, now, don\u2019t you be scared, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s all right, I ain\u2019t . . . oh. Oh, my. I . . . uh . . . oh.\u201d His hand was poking about between my thighs, then left off momentarily as he raised himself briefly and wriggled down his breeches.</p><p>He collapsed heavily on top of me, h*ps pumping frantically as he thrust madly away\u2014making no contact save that of friction, as he very obviously had no idea of the way in which female anatomy was constructed. I lay still, astonished into immobility, then felt a warm pulse of liquid under my thighs as he lost himself in panting ecstasy.</p><p>All the wiry tension went out of him in a rush, and he subsided on my chest like a limp balloon. I could feel his young heart pounding like a steam hammer, and his temple was pressed against my cheek, damp with sweat.</p><p>I found the intimacy of this contact quite as objectionable as the softening presence wedged between my thighs, and rolled abruptly to the side, dumping him off. He came to life suddenly, and scrambled to his knees, yanking at his drooping breeches.</p><p>He swayed to and fro for a moment, then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled up close beside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I made no move, and after a moment, he reached out a tentative hand and patted me gently on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real sorry,\u201d he repeated, still whispering, and then was gone, leaving me lying on my back in a puddle, wondering whether such an incompetent assault could legitimately be termed rape.</p><p>Distant rustling in the bushes, accompanied by muffled whoops of young male delight, decided me firmly that it could. Christ, the rest of the obnoxious little beasts would be at me in no time. Panicked, I sat up, mindful of the noose.</p><p>The glow from the fire was irregular and flickering, barely enough to make out the trunks of trees and the pale layer of needles and leaf mold on the ground. Enough to see the protrusions of granite boulders through the leaf layer, and the occasional hump of a fallen twig. Not that the lack of potential weapons mattered, given that my hands were still firmly tied.</p><p>The weight of the young assailant had made things worse; the knots had pulled tighter during my struggles, and my hands throbbed with lack of circulation. My fingers were beginning to go numb at the tips. Bloody hell. Was I about to lose several fingers to gangrene, as a result of this absurdity?</p><p>For an instant, I contemplated the wisdom of behaving compliantly with the next horrible little boy, in hopes that he would remove the gag. If he would, I could at least beg him to loosen the ropes\u2014and then scream for help, in hopes that Tebbe would come and stop further assault, out of fear of my eventual supernatural revenge.</p><p>Here he came, a stealthy rustling in the bushes. I gritted my teeth on the gag and looked up, but the shadowy form in front of me wasn\u2019t one of the young boys.</p><p>The only thought that came to mind when I realized who the new visitor was was, Jamie Fraser, you bastard, where are you?</p><p>I froze, as though not moving might somehow render me invisible. The man moved in front of me, squatting down so as to look into my face.</p><p>\u201cNot laughin\u2019 so much now, are you?\u201d he said conversationally. It was Boble, the erstwhile thieftaker. \u201cYou and your husband thought it was damn funny, didn\u2019t you, what them German women did to me? And then Mr. Fraser tellin\u2019 me as they meant to make sausage meat of me, and him with a face like a Christian readin\u2019 the Bible. Thought that was funny, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>To be perfectly honest, it had been funny. He was quite correct, though; I wasn\u2019t laughing now. He drew back his arm and slapped me.</p><p>The blow made my eyes water, but the fire lit him from the side; I could still see the smile on his pudgy face. A cold qualm ran through me, making me shudder. He saw that, and the smile broadened. His canine teeth were short and blunt, so the incisors stood out by contrast, long and yellowed, rodentlike.</p><p>\u201cReckon you\u2019ll think this is even funnier,\u201d he said, rising to his feet and reaching for his flies. \u201cHope Hodge don\u2019t kill you right away, so you get to tell your husband about it. Bet you he\u2019ll enjoy the joke, man with a sense of humor like he\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s sem*n was still damp and sticky on my thighs. I jerked back by reflex, trying to scramble to my feet, but was brought up short by the noose round my neck. My vision went dark for an instant as the rope tightened on my carotids, then cleared, and I found Boble\u2019s face inches from mine, his breath hot on my skin.</p><p>He seized my chin in his hand and rubbed his face over mine, biting at my lips and rasping the stubble of his beard hard across my cheeks. Then he drew back, leaving my face wet with his saliva, pushed me flat, and climbed on top of me.</p><p>I could feel the violence in him, pulsing like an exposed heart, thin-walled and ready to burst. I knew I couldn\u2019t escape or prevent him\u2014knew he would hurt me, given the slightest excuse. The only thing to do was be still and endure him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. I heaved under him and rolled to the side, bringing up my knee as he pushed my shift aside. It hit him a glancing blow in the thigh, and he drew back his fist by reflex and punched me in the face, sharp and quick.</p><p>Red-black pain bloomed sudden from the center of my face, filled my head, and I went blind, shocked into momentary immobility. You utter fool, I thought, with total clarity. Now he\u2019ll kill you. The second blow struck my cheek and snapped my head to the side. Perhaps I moved again in blind resistance, perhaps I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Suddenly he was kneeling astride me, punching and slapping, blows dull and heavy as the thump of ocean waves on sand, too remote as yet for pain. I twisted, curling, bringing up my shoulder and trying to shield my face against the ground, and then his weight was gone.</p><p>He was standing. He was kicking me and cursing, panting and half-sobbing as his boot thudded into sides and back and thighs and buttocks. I panted in short gasps, trying to breathe. My body jerked and quivered with each blow, skidding on the leaf-strewn ground, and I clung to the sense of the ground below me, trying so hard to sink down, be swallowed by the earth.</p><p>Then it stopped. I could hear him panting, trying to speak. \u201cGoddamn . . . goddamn . . . oh, goddamn . . . frig . . . friggin\u2019 . . . bitch. . .\u201d</p><p>I lay inert, trying to disappear into the darkness that enveloped me, knowing that he was going to kick me in the head. I could feel my teeth shatter, the fragile bones of my skull splinter and collapse into the wet soft pulp of my brain, and I trembled, clenching my teeth in futile resistance against the impact. It would sound like a melon being smashed, dull, sticky-hollow. Would I hear it?</p><p>It didn\u2019t come. There was another sound, a fast, hard rustling that made no sense. A faintly meaty sound, flesh on flesh in a soft smacking rhythm, and then he gave a groan and warm gouts of fluid fell wet on my face and shoulders, splattering on bare skin where the cloth of my shift had torn away.</p><p>I was frozen. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the detached observer wondered aloud whether this was in fact the single most disgusting thing I had ever encountered. Well, no, it wasn\u2019t. Some of the things I had seen at L\u2019H\u00f4pital des Anges, to say nothing of Father Alexandre\u2019s death, or the Beardsleys\u2019 attic . . . the field hospital at Amiens . . . heavens, no, this wasn\u2019t even close.</p><p>I lay rigid, eyes shut, recalling various nasty experiences of my past and wishing I were in fact in attendance at one of those events, instead of here.</p><p>He leaned over, seized my hair, and banged my head several times against the tree, wheezing as he did so.</p><p>\u201cShow you . . .\u201d he muttered, then dropped his hand and I heard shuffling noises as he staggered away.</p><p>When I finally opened my eyes again, I was alone.</p><p>I REMAINED ALONE, a small mercy. Boble\u2019s violent attack seemed to have frightened away the boys.</p><p>I rolled onto my side and lay still, breathing. I felt very tired, and utterly forlorn.</p><p>Jamie, I thought, where are you?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t afraid of what might happen next; I couldn\u2019t see any further than the moment I was in, a single breath, a single heartbeat. I didn\u2019t think, and wouldn\u2019t feel. Not yet. I just lay still, and breathed.</p><p>Very slowly I began to notice small things. A fragment of bark caught in my hair, scratchy on my cheek. The give of the thick dead leaves beneath me, cradling my body. The sense of effort as my chest lifted. Increasing effort.</p><p>A tiny nerve began to twitch near one eye.</p><p>I realized quite suddenly that with the gag in my mouth and my nasal tissues being rapidly congested by blood and swelling, I was in some actual danger of suffocation. I twisted as far onto my side as I could get without strangling, and rubbed my face first against the ground, then\u2014with increasing desperation\u2014dug my heels into the ground and wriggled upward, scraping my face hard against the bark of the tree, trying without success to loosen or dislodge the gag.</p><p>The bark rasped lip and cheek, but the kerchief tied round my head was so tight that it cut hard into the corners of my mouth, forcing it open so that saliva leaked constantly into the wad of fabric in my mouth. I gagged at the tickle of sodden cloth in my throat, and felt vomit burn the back of my nose.</p><p>You aren\u2019t, you aren\u2019t, you aren\u2019tyouaren\u2019tyou aren\u2019t going to vomit! I dragged air bubbling through my bloody nose, tasted thick copper as it slimed down my throat, gagged harder, doubled up\u2014and saw white light at the edge of vision, as the noose went tight around my throat.</p><p>I fell back, my head hitting hard against the tree. I hardly noticed; the noose loosened again, thank God, and I managed one, two, three precious breaths of blood-clogged air.</p><p>My nose was puffed from cheekbone to cheekbone, and swelling fast. I clenched my teeth on the gag and blew outward through my nose, trying to clear it, if only for a moment. Blood tinged with bile sprayed warm across my chin and splattered on my chest\u2014and I sucked air fast, getting a bit.</p><p>Blow, inhale. Blow, inhale. Blow . . . but my nasal passages were almost swollen shut by now, and I nearly sobbed in panic and frustration, as no air came.</p><p>Christ, don\u2019t cry! You\u2019re dead if you cry, for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t cry!</p><p>Blow . . . blow . . . I snorted with the last reserve of stale air in my lungs, and got a hair of clearance, enough to fill them once more.</p><p>I held my breath, trying to stay conscious long enough to discover a way to breathe\u2014there had to be a way to breathe.</p><p>I would not let a wretch like Harley Boble kill me by simple inadvertence. That wasn\u2019t right; it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>I pressed myself, half-sitting, up against the tree to ease the strain on the noose around my neck as much as possible, and let my head fall forward, so that the blood from my nose ran down, dripping. That helped, a little. Not for long, though.</p><p>My eyelids began to feel tight; my nose was definitely broken, and the flesh all round the upper part of my face was puffing now, swelling with the blood and lymph of capillary trauma, squeezing my eyes shut, further constricting my thread of air.</p><p>I bit the gag in an agony of frustration, then, seized by desperation, began to chew at it, grinding the fabric between my teeth, trying to smash it down, compress it, shift it somehow inside my mouth. . . . I bit the inside of my cheek and felt the pain but didn\u2019t mind, it wasn\u2019t important, nothing mattered but breath, oh, God, I couldn\u2019t breathe, please help me breathe, please. . . .</p><p>I bit my tongue, gasped in pain\u2014and realized that I had succeeded in thrusting my tongue past the gag, reaching the tip of it to the corner of my mouth. By poking as hard as I could with my tongue tip, I had made a tiny channel of air. No more than a wisp of oxygen could ooze through it\u2014but it was air, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>I had my head canted painfully to one side, forehead pressed against the tree, but was afraid to move at all, for fear of losing my slender lifeline of air, if the gag should shift when I moved my head. I sat still, hands clenched, drawing long, gurgling, horribly shallow breaths, and wondering how long I could stay this way; the muscles of my neck were already quivering from strain.</p><p>My hands were throbbing again\u2014they hadn\u2019t ever stopped, I supposed, but I hadn\u2019t had attention to spare for them. Now I did, and momentarily welcomed the shooting pains that outlined each nail with liquid fire, for distraction from the deadly stiffness spreading down my neck and through my shoulder.</p><p>The muscles of my neck jumped and spasmed; I gasped, lost my air, and arched my body bowlike, fingers dug into the binding ropes as I fought to get it back.</p><p>A hand came down on my arm. I hadn\u2019t heard him approach. I turned blindly, butting at him with my head. I didn\u2019t care who he was or what he wanted, provided he would remove the gag. Rape seemed a perfectly reasonable exchange for survival, at least at the moment.</p><p>I made desperate noises, whimpering, snorting, and spewing gouts of blood and snot as I shook my head violently, trying to indicate that I was choking\u2014given the level of sexual incompetence so far demonstrated, he might not even realize that I couldn\u2019t breathe, and simply proceed about his business, unaware that simple rape was becoming necrophilia.</p><p>He was fumbling round my head. Thank God, thank God! I held myself still with superhuman effort, head swimming as little bursts of fire went off inside my eyeballs. Then the strip of fabric came away and I thrust the wad of cloth out of my mouth by reflex, instantly gagged, and threw up, whooping air and retching simultaneously.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t eaten; no more than a thread of bile seared my throat and ran down my chin. I choked and swallowed and breathed, sucking air in huge, greedy, lung-bursting gulps.</p><p>He was saying something, whispering urgently. I didn\u2019t care, couldn\u2019t listen. All I heard was the grateful wheeze of my own breathing, and the thump of my heart. Finally slowing from its frantic race to keep oxygen moving round my starved tissues, it pounded hard enough to shake my body.</p><p>Then a word or two got through to me, and I lifted my head, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhad?\u201d I said thickly. I coughed, shaking my head to try to clear it. It hurt very much. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He was visible only as a ragged, lion-haired silhouette, bony-shouldered in the faint glow from the fire.</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d he whispered, leaning close, \u201cdoes the name \u2018Ringo Starr\u2019 mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>I WAS BY THIS TIME well beyond shock. I merely wiped my split lip gingerly on my shoulder, and said, very calmly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He had been holding his breath; I realized it only when I heard the sigh as he released it, and saw his shoulders slump.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, half under his breath. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>He lunged forward suddenly and caught me against him in a hard embrace. I recoiled, choking as the noose round my neck tightened once again, but he didn\u2019t notice, absorbed in his own emotion.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, and buried his face in my shoulder, nearly sobbing. \u201cOh, God. I knew, I knew you hadda be, I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t believe it, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever find another one, not ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKk,\u201d I said. I arched my back, urgently.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014oh, shit!\u201d He let go and grabbed for the rope around my neck. He scrabbled hold of it and yanked the noose over my head, nearly tearing my ear off in the process, but I didn\u2019t mind. \u201cShit, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I croaked. \u201cUn . . . tie me.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed, wiping his nose on his sleeve, and glanced back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe next guy who comes along\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next guy?\u201d I screamed, as well as I could scream in a strangled whisper. \u201cWhat do you mean, the next\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know. . . .\u201d It seemed suddenly to dawn on him that I might have objections to waiting tamely like a trussed turkey for the next would-be r**ist in the lineup. \u201cEr . . . I mean . . . well, never mind. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well who I am,\u201d I croaked furiously, shoving him with my bound hands. \u201cI\u2019m Claire Fraser. Who in bloody hell are you, what are you doing here, and if you want one more word out of me, you\u2019ll bloody well untie me this minute!\u201d</p><p>He turned again to glance apprehensively over his shoulder, and it occurred to me vaguely that he was afraid of his so-called comrades. So was I. I could see his profile in silhouette; it was indeed the bushy-haired young Indian, the one I had thought might be a Tuscaroran. Indian . . . some connection clicked into place, deep in the tangled synapses.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d I said, and dabbed at a trickle of blood that ran from the raw corner of my mouth. \u201cOtter-Toof. Tooth. You\u2019re one of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d His head swung back to face me, eyes so wide the whites showed briefly. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what in hell was his real name? Robert . . . Robert th-something . . .\u201d I was trembling with fury, terror, shock, and exhaustion, groping through the muddled remnants of what used to be my mind. Wreck though I might be, I remembered Otter-Tooth, all right. I had a sudden vivid memory of being alone in the dark, on a night like this, wet with rain and all alone, a long-buried skull cupped in my hands.</p><p>\u201cSpringer,\u201d he said, and gripped my arm eagerly. \u201cSpringer\u2014was that it? Robert Springer?\u201d</p><p>I had just enough presence of mind to clamp my jaw, thrust out my chin, and hold up my bound hands in front of him. Not another word until he cut me loose.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered again, and with another hasty glance behind him, fumbled for his knife. He wasn\u2019t skillful with it. If I had needed any evidence that he wasn\u2019t a real Indian of the time . . . but he got my hands free without cutting me, and I doubled up with a groan, hands tucked under my armpits as the blood surged into them. They felt like balloons filled and stretched to the point of bursting.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he demanded, paying no attention to my distress. \u201cWhen did you come? Where did you find Bob? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1946,\u201d I said, squeezing my arms down tight on my throbbing hands. \u201cThe first time. 1968, the second. As for Mr. Springer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second\u2014did you say the second time?\u201d His voice rose in astonishment. He choked it off, looking guiltily back, but the sounds of the men dicing and arguing round the fire were more than loud enough to drown out a simple exclamation.</p><p>\u201cSecond time,\u201d he repeated more softly. \u201cSo you did it? You went back?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pressing my lips together and rocking back and forth a little. I thought my fingernails would pop off with each heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I asked, though I was fairly sure that I already knew.</p><p>\u201c1968,\u201d he said, confirming it.</p><p>\u201cWhat year did you turn up in?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean\u2014how long have you been here? Er . . . now, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d He sat back on his heels, running a hand back through his long, tangled hair. \u201cI been here six years, as near as I can tell. But you said\u2014second time. If you made it home, why in hell\u2019d you come back? Oh\u2014wait. You didn\u2019t make it home, you went to another time, but not the one you came from? Where\u2019d you start from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland, 1946. And no, I made it home,\u201d I said, not wanting to go into details. \u201cMy husband was here, though. I came back on purpose, to be with him.\u201d A decision whose wisdom seemed presently in severe doubt.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of my husband,\u201d I added, beginning to feel as though I might possess a few shreds of sanity after all, \u201cI was not joking. He\u2019s coming. You don\u2019t want him to find you keeping me captive, I assure you. But if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He disregarded this, leaning eagerly toward me.</p><p>\u201cBut that means you know how it works! You can steer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I said, impatient. \u201cI take it that you and your companions didn\u2019t know how to steer, as you put it?\u201d I massaged one hand with the other, gritting my teeth against the throb of blood. I could feel the furrows the rope had left in my flesh.</p><p>\u201cWe thought we did.\u201d Bitterness tinged his voice. \u201cSinging stones. Gemstones. That\u2019s what we used. Raymond said . . . It didn\u2019t work, though. Or maybe . . . maybe it did.\u201d He was making deductions; I could hear the excitement rising again in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou met Bob Springer\u2014Otter-Tooth, I mean. So he did make it! And if he made it, maybe the others did, too. See, I thought they were all dead. I thought\u2014thought I was alone.\u201d There was a catch in his voice, and despite the urgency of the situation and my annoyance at him, I felt a pang of sympathy. I knew very well what it felt like to be alone in that way, marooned in time.</p><p>In a way, I hated to disillusion him, but there was no point in keeping the truth from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOtter-Tooth is dead, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly stopped moving and sat very still. The faint glow of firelight through the trees outlined him; I could see his face. A few long hairs lifted in the breeze. They were the only thing that moved.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he said at last, in a small, choked voice.</p><p>\u201cKilled by the Iroquois,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Mohawk.\u201d My mind was beginning, very slowly, to work again. Six years ago, this man\u2014whoever he was\u2014had come. 1767, that would be. And yet Otter-Tooth, the man who had once been Robert Springer, had died more than a generation earlier. They\u2019d started out together, but ended in different times.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said, though the obvious distress in his voice was mingled with something like awe. \u201cThat would have been a real bummer, especially for Bob. He, like, idolized those guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I expect he was most put out about it,\u201d I replied, rather dryly. My eyelids felt thick and heavy. It was an effort to force them open, but I could still see. I glanced at the fire glow, but couldn\u2019t see anything beyond the faint movement of shadows in the distance. If there actually was a lineup of men waiting for my services, at least they were tactfully keeping out of sight. I doubted it, and gave silent thanks that I wasn\u2019t twenty years younger\u2014there might have been.</p><p>\u201cI met some Iroquois\u2014Christ, I went looking for \u2019em, if you can believe that! That was the whole point, see, to find the Iroquois tribes and get them to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what you had in mind,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cLook, this is not really the time or place for a long discussion. I think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose Iroquois are some nasty tumblers, I tell you, man,\u201d he said, jabbing me in the chest with a finger for emphasis. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what they do to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. So is my husband.\u201d I gave him a glare, which\u2014judging from the way he flinched\u2014was probably rendered highly effective by the state of my face. I hoped so; it hurt a lot to do it.</p><p>\u201cNow, what you want to do,\u201d I said, mustering as much authority into my voice as I could, \u201cis to go back to the fire, wait for a bit, then leave casually, sneak round, and get two horses. I hear a stream down there\u2014\u201d I waved briefly to the right. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there. Once we\u2019re safely away, I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>In fact, I probably couldn\u2019t tell him anything very helpful, but he didn\u2019t know that. I heard him swallow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d he said uncertainly, glancing round again. \u201cHodge, he\u2019s kind of gnarly. He shot one guy, a few days ago. Didn\u2019t even say anything, just walked up to him, pulled his gun, and boom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know, man. Just . . . boom, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I assured him, holding on to temper and sanity by a thread. \u201cLook, let\u2019s not trouble with the horses, then. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d I lurched awkwardly onto one knee, hoping that I would be able to rise in a few moments, let alone walk. The big muscles in my thighs were knotted hard in the spots where Boble had kicked me; trying to stand made the muscles jump and quiver in spasms that effectively hamstrung me.</p><p>\u201cShit, not now!\u201d In his agitation, the young man seized my arm and jerked me down beside him. I hit the ground hard on one hip and let out a cry of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou all right there, Donner?\u201d The voice came out of the darkness somewhere behind me. It was casual\u2014obviously one of the men had merely stepped out of camp to relieve himself\u2014but the effect on the young Indian was galvanizing. He flung himself full-length upon me, banging my head on the ground and knocking all the breath out of me.</p><p>\u201cFine . . . really . . . great,\u201d he called to his companion, gasping in an exaggerated manner, evidently trying to sound like a man in the throes of half-completed lust. He sounded like someone dying of asthma, but I wasn\u2019t complaining. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019d been knocked on the head a few times, and generally saw nothing but blackness as a result. This time I honestly did see colored stars, and lay limp and bemused, feeling as though I sat tranquilly some distance above my battered body. Then Donner laid a hand on my breast and I came instantly back to earth.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me this instant!\u201d I hissed. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, nothing, nothing, sorry,\u201d he assured me hastily. He removed the hand, but didn\u2019t get off me. He squirmed a bit, and I realized that he was aroused by the contact, whether intended or not.</p> <p>\u201cGet off!\u201d I said, in a furious whisper.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t mean anything, I mean I wouldn\u2019t hurt you or nothing. It\u2019s just I haven\u2019t had a woman in\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a handful of his hair, lifted my head, and bit his ear, hard. He shrieked and rolled off me.</p><p>The other man had gone back toward the fire. At this, though, he turned and called back, \u201cChrist, Donner, is she that good? I\u2019ll have to give her a try!\u201d This got a laugh from the men by the fire, but luckily it died away and they returned to their own concerns. I returned to mine, which was escape.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Donner whined in an undertone, holding his ear. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do anything! Christ, you got nice tits, but you\u2019re like old enough to be my mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I said, pushing myself to a sitting position. The effort made my head spin; tiny colored lights flickered like Christmas-tree bulbs at the edge of my vision. In spite of this, some part of my mind was actively working again.</p><p>He was at least partly right. We couldn\u2019t leave immediately. After drawing so much attention to himself, the others would be expecting him to come back within a few minutes; if he didn\u2019t, they\u2019d start looking for him\u2014and we needed more than a few minutes\u2019 start.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go now,\u201d he whispered, rubbing his ear reproachfully. \u201cThey\u2019ll notice. Wait \u2019til they go to sleep. I\u2019ll come get you then.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. I was in mortal danger every moment that I spent within reach of Hodgepile and his feral gang. If I had needed any convincing, the encounters of the last two hours had demonstrated that. This Donner needed to go back to the fire and show himself\u2014but I could steal away. Was it worth the risk that someone would come and find me gone, before I had got beyond pursuit? It would be more certain to wait until they slept. But did I dare wait that long?</p><p>And then there was Donner himself. If he wanted to talk to me, I certainly wanted to talk to him. The chance of stumbling on another time-traveler . . .</p><p>Donner read my hesitation, but misunderstood it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going without me!\u201d He grabbed my wrist in sudden alarm, and before I could jerk away, had whipped a bit of the cut line around it. I fought and pulled away, hissing to try to make him understand, but he was panicked at the thought that I might slip away without him, and wouldn\u2019t listen. Hampered by my injuries, and unwilling to make enough noise to draw attention, I could only delay but not prevent his determined efforts to tie me up again.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He was sweating; a drop fell warm on my face as he leaned over me to check the bindings. At least he hadn\u2019t put the noose round my neck again, instead tethering me to the tree with a rope around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI shoulda known what you are,\u201d he murmured, intent on his job. \u201cEven before you said \u2018Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean by that?\u201d I snapped, squirming away from his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t bloody do that\u2014I\u2019ll suffocate!\u201d He was trying to put the cloth strip back in my mouth, but seemed to pick up the note of panic in my voice, because he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cWell. I guess\u2014\u201d Once again, he looked back over his shoulder, but then made up his mind and dropped the gag on the ground. \u201cOkay. But you be quiet, all right? What I meant\u2014you don\u2019t act afraid of men. Most of the women from now do. You oughta act more afraid.\u201d</p><p>And with that parting shot, he rose and brushed dead leaves from his clothes before heading back to the fire.</p><p>THERE COMES A POINT when the body has simply had enough. It snatches at sleep, no matter what menace the future may hold. I\u2019d seen that happen: the Jacobite soldiers who slept in the ditches where they fell, the British pilots who slept in their planes while mechanics fueled them, only to leap to full alert again in time to take off. For that matter, women in long labor routinely sleep between contractions.</p><p>In the same manner, I slept.</p><p>That kind of sleep is neither deep nor peaceful, though. I came out of it with a hand across my mouth.</p><p>The fourth man was neither incompetent nor brutal. He was large and soft-bodied, and he had loved his dead wife. I knew that, because he wept into my hair, and called me by her name at the end. It was Martha.</p><p>I CAME OUT of sleep again sometime later. Instantly, fully conscious, heart pounding. But it wasn\u2019t my heart\u2014it was a drum.</p><p>Sounds of startlement came from the direction of the fire, men rousing in alarm from sleep.</p><p>\u201cIndians!\u201d someone shouted, and the light broke and flared, as someone kicked at the fire to scatter it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an Indian drum. I sat up, listening hard. It was a drum with a sound like a beating heart, slow and rhythmic, then trip-hammer fast, like the frantic surge of a hunted beast.</p><p>I could have told them that Indians never used drums as weapons; Celts did. It was the sound of a bodhran.</p><p>What next? I thought, a trifle hysterically, bagpipes?</p><p>It was Roger, certainly; only he could make a drum talk like that. It was Roger, and Jamie was nearby. I scrambled to my feet, wanting, needing urgently to move. I jerked at the rope around my waist in a frenzy of impatience, but I was going nowhere.</p><p>Another drum began, slower, less skilled, but equally menacing. The sound seemed to move\u2014it was moving. Fading, coming back full force. A third drum began, and now the thumping seemed to come from everywhere, fast, slow, mocking.</p><p>Someone fired a gun into the forest, panicked.</p><p>\u201cHold, there!\u201d Hodgepile\u2019s voice came, loud and furious, but to no avail; there was a popcorn rattle of gunfire, nearly drowned by the sound of the drums. I heard a snick near my head, and a cluster of needles brushed past me as it fell. It dawned on me that standing upright while guns were blindly fired all round me was a dangerous strategy, and I promptly fell flat, burrowing into the dead needles, trying to keep the trunk of the tree betwixt me and the main body of men.</p><p>The drums were weaving, now closer, now farther, the sound unnerving even to one who knew what it was. They were circling the camp, or so it seemed. Should I call out, if they came near enough?</p><p>I was saved from the agony of decision; the men were making so much noise round the campfire that I couldn\u2019t have been heard if I\u2019d screamed myself hoarse. They were calling out in alarm, shouting questions, bellowing orders\u2014which apparently went ignored, judging from the ongoing sounds of confusion.</p><p>Someone blundered through the brush nearby, running from the drums. One, two more\u2014the sound of gasping breath and crunching footsteps. Donner? The thought came to me suddenly and I sat up, then fell flat again as another shot whistled past overhead.</p><p>The drums stopped abruptly. Chaos reigned around the fire, though I could hear Hodgepile trying to get his men in order, yelling and threatening, nasal voice raised above the rest. Then the drums began again\u2014much closer.</p><p>They were drawing in, drawing together, somewhere out in the forest on my left, and the mocking tip-tap-tip-tap beating had changed. They were thundering now. No skill, just menace. Coming closer.</p><p>Guns fired wildly, close enough for me to see the muzzle flash and smell the smoke, thick and hot on the air. The faggots of the fire had been scattered, but still burned, making a muted glow through the trees.</p><p>\u201cThere they are! I see \u2019em!\u201d someone yelled from the fire, and there was another burst of musket-fire, toward the drums.</p><p>Then the most unearthly howl rose out of the dark to my right. I\u2019d heard Scots scream going into battle before, but that particular Highland shriek made the hairs on my body prickle from tailbone to nape. Jamie. Despite my fears, I sat bolt upright and peered round my sheltering tree, in time to see demons boil out of the wood.</p><p>I knew them\u2014knew I knew them\u2014but cowered back at sight of them, blackened with soot and shrieking with the madness of hell, firelight red on the blades of knives and axes.</p><p>The drums had stopped abruptly, with the first scream, and now another set of howls broke out to the left, the drummers racing in to the kill. I pressed myself flat back against the tree, heart chokingly huge in my throat, petrified for fear the blades would strike at any random movement in the shadows.</p><p>Someone crashed toward me, blundering in the dark\u2014Donner? I croaked his name, hoping to attract his attention, and the slight form turned toward me, hesitated, then spotted me and lunged.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Donner, but Hodgepile. He seized my arm, dragging me up, even as he slashed at the rope that bound me to the tree. He was panting hard with exertion, or fear.</p><p>I realized at once what he was about; he knew his chances of escape were slight\u2014having me to hostage was his only hope. But I was damned if I\u2019d be his hostage. No more.</p><p>I kicked at him, hard, and caught him on the side of the knee. It didn\u2019t knock him over, but distracted him for a second. I charged him, head down, butted him square in the chest, and sent him flying.</p><p>The impact hurt badly, and I staggered, eyes watering from the pain. He was up, and at me again. I kicked, missed, fell heavily on my backside.</p><p>\u201cCome on, damn you!\u201d he hissed, jerking hard at my bound hands. I ducked my head, pulled back, and yanked him down with me. I rolled and scrabbled in the leaf mold, trying as hard as I could to wrap my legs around him, meaning to get a grip on his ribs and crush the life out of the filthy little worm, but he squirmed free and rolled atop me, punching at my head, trying to subdue me.</p><p>He struck me in one ear and I flinched, eyes shutting in reflex. Then the weight of him was suddenly gone, and I opened my eyes to see Jamie holding Hodgepile several inches off the ground. Hodgepile\u2019s spindly legs churned madly in a futile effort at escape, and I felt an insane desire to laugh.</p><p>In fact, I must actually have laughed, for Jamie\u2019s head jerked round to look at me; I caught a glimpse of the whites of his eyes before he turned his attention to Hodgepile again. He was silhouetted against a faint glow from the embers; I saw him in profile for a second, then his body flexed with effort as he bent his head.</p><p>He held Hodgepile close against his chest, one arm bent. I blinked; my eyes were swollen half-shut, and I wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing. Then I heard a small grunt of effort, and a strangled shriek from Hodgepile, and saw Jamie\u2019s bent elbow go sharply down.</p><p>The dark curve of Hodgepile\u2019s head moved back\u2014and back. I glimpsed the marionette-sharp nose and angled jaw\u2014angled impossibly high, the heel of Jamie\u2019s hand wedged hard beneath it. There was a muffled pop! that I felt in the pit of my stomach as Hodgepile\u2019s neckbones parted, and the marionette went limp.</p><p>Jamie flung the puppet body down, reached for me, and pulled me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou are alive, you are whole, mo nighean donn?\u201d he said urgently in Gaelic. He was groping, hands flying over me, trying at the same time to hold me upright\u2014my knees seemed suddenly to have turned to water\u2014and to locate the rope that bound my hands.</p><p>I was crying and laughing, snuffing tears and blood, bumping at him with my bound hands, trying awkwardly to thrust them at him so that he could cut the rope.</p><p>He quit grappling, and clutched me so hard against him that I yelped in pain as my face was pressed against his plaid.</p><p>He was saying something else, urgently, but I couldn\u2019t manage to translate it. Energy pulsed through him, hot and violent, like the current in a live wire, and I vaguely realized that he was still almost berserk; he had no English.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I gasped, and he let me go. The light flared up in the clearing beyond the trees; someone had collected the scattered embers, and thrown more kindling on them. His face was black, his eyes picked out blue in a sudden blaze as he turned his head and the light struck his face.</p><p>There was still some struggle going on; no screaming now, but I could hear the grunt and thud of bodies locked in combat. Jamie raised my hands, drew his dirk, and sawed through the rope; my hands dropped like lead weights. He stared at me for an instant, as though trying to find words, then shook his head, cupped a hand for an instant to my face, and disappeared, back in the direction of the fight.</p><p>I sank down on the ground, dazed. Hodgepile\u2019s body lay nearby, limbs askew. I glanced at it, the picture clear in my mind of a necklace Bree had had as a child, made of linked plastic beads that came apart when you pulled them. Pop-It pearls, they were called. I wished vaguely that I didn\u2019t remember that.</p><p>The face was lantern-jawed and hollow-cheeked; he looked surprised, eyes wide open to the flickering light. Something seemed oddly wrong, though, and I squinted, trying to make it out. Then I realized that his head was on backward.</p><p>It may have been seconds or minutes that I sat there staring at him, arms round my knees and my mind a total blank. Then the sound of soft footsteps made me look up.</p><p>Arch Bug came out of the dark, tall and thin and black against the flicker of a growing fire. I saw that he had an ax gripped hard in his left hand; it too was black, and the smell of blood came strong and rich as he leaned near.</p><p>\u201cThere are some left still alive,\u201d he said, and I felt something cold and hard touch my hand. \u201cWill ye have your vengeance now upon them, a bana-mhaighistear?\u201d</p><p>I looked down and found that he was offering me a dirk, hilt-first. I had stood up, but couldn\u2019t remember rising.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak, and couldn\u2019t move\u2014and yet my fingers curled without my willing them to, my hand rising up to take the knife as I watched it, faintly curious. Then Jamie\u2019s hand came down upon the dirk, snatching it away, and I saw as from a great distance that the light fell on his hand, gleaming wet with blood smeared past the wrist. Random drops shone red, dark jewels glowing, caught in the curly hairs of his arm.</p><p>\u201cThere is an oath upon her,\u201d he said to Arch, and I realized dimly that he was still speaking in Gaelic, though I understood him clearly. \u201cShe may not kill, save it is for mercy or her life. It is myself who kills for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d said a tall figure behind him, softly. Ian.</p><p>Arch nodded understanding, though his face was still in darkness. Someone else was there beside him\u2014Fergus. I knew him at once, but it took a moment\u2019s struggle for me to put a name to the streaked pale face and wiry figure.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d he said, and his voice was thin with shock. \u201cMilady.\u201d</p><p>Then Jamie looked at me, and his own face changed, awareness coming back into his eyes. I saw his nostrils flare, as he caught the scent of sweat and sem*n on my clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhich of them?\u201d he said. \u201cHow many?\u201d He spoke in English now, and his voice was remarkably matter-of-fact, as it might be if he were inquiring as to the number of guests expected for dinner, and I found the simple tone of it steadying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2014it was dark.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, squeezed my arm hard, and turned.</p><p>\u201cKill them all,\u201d he said to Fergus, his voice still calm. Fergus\u2019s eyes were huge and dark, sunk into his head, burning. He merely nodded, and took hold of the hatchet in his belt. The front of his shirt was splashed, and the end of his hook looked dark and sticky.</p><p>In a distant sort of way, I thought I should say something. But I didn\u2019t. I stood up straight with the tree against my back and said nothing at all.</p><p>Jamie glanced at the dirk he held as though to ensure that it was in good order\u2014it was not; he wiped the blade on his thigh, ignoring the drying blood that gummed the wooden hilt\u2014and went back to the clearing.</p><p>I stood quite still. There were more sounds, but I paid no more heed to them than to the rush of wind through the needles overhead; it was a balsam tree, and the breath of it was clean and fresh, falling over me in a wash of fragrant resins, powerful enough to taste on my palate, though little penetrated the clotted membranes of my nose. Beneath the gentle veil of the tree\u2019s perfume, I tasted blood, and sodden rags, and the stink of my own weary skin.</p><p>Dawn had broken. Birds sang in the distant wood, and light lay soft as wood ash on the ground.</p><p>I stood quite still, and thought of nothing but how pleasant it would be to stand neck-deep in hot water, to scrub the skin quite away from my flesh, and let the blood run red and clean down my legs, billowing out in soft clouds that would hide me.</p><p>29</p><p>PERFECTLY FINE</p><p>THEY\u2019D RIDDEN AWAY then. Left them, without burial or word of consecration. In a way, that was more shocking than the killing. Roger had gone with the Reverend to more than one deathbed or scene of accident, helped comfort the bereaved, stood by as the spirit fled and the old man said the words of grace. It was what you did when someone died; turned toward God and at least acknowledged the fact.</p><p>And yet . . . how could you stand over the body of a man you\u2019d killed, and look God in the face?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t sit. The tiredness filled him like wet sand, but he couldn\u2019t sit.</p><p>He stood, picked up the poker, but stood with it in hand, staring at the banked fire on his hearth. It was perfect, satin-black embers crusted with ash, the red heat smothered just beneath. To touch it would break the embers, make the flame leap up\u2014only to die at once, without fuel. A waste of wood, to throw more on, so late at night.</p><p>He put the poker down, wandered from one wall to another, an exhausted bee in a bottle, still buzzing, though his wings hung tattered and forlorn.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t troubled Fraser. But then, Fraser had ceased even to think of the bandits, directly they were dead; all his thought had been for Claire, and that was surely understandable.</p><p>He\u2019d led her through the morning light in that clearing, a blood-soaked Adam, a battered Eve, looking upon the knowledge of good and evil. And then he had wrapped her in his plaid, picked her up, and walked away to his horse.</p><p>The men had followed, silent, leading the bandits\u2019 horses behind their own. An hour later, with the sun warm on their backs, Fraser had turned his horse\u2019s head downhill, and led them to a stream. He had dismounted, helped Claire down, then vanished with her through the trees.</p><p>The men had exchanged puzzled looks, though no one spoke. Then old Arch Bug had swung down from his mule, saying matter-of-factly, \u201cWell, she\u2019ll want to wash then, no?\u201d</p><p>A sigh of comprehension went over the group, and the tension lessened at once, dissolving into the small homely businesses of dismounting, hobbling, girth-checking, spitting, having a piss. Slowly, they sought each other, looking for something to say, searching for relief in commonplace.</p><p>He caught Ian\u2019s eye, but they were yet too stiff with each other for this; Ian turned, clapped a hand round Fergus\u2019s shoulder, and hugged him, then pushed him away with a small rude joke about his stink. The Frenchman gave him a tiny smile and lifted the darkened hook in salute.</p><p>Kenny Lindsay and old Arch Bug were sharing out tobacco, stuffing their pipes in apparent tranquillity. Tom Christie wandered over to them, pale as a ghost, but pipe in hand. Not for the first time, Roger realized the valuable social aspects of smoking.</p><p>Arch had seen him, though, standing aimless near his horse, and come to talk to him, the old man\u2019s voice calm and steadying. He had no real idea what Arch said, let alone what he replied; the simple act of conversation seemed to let him breathe again and still the tremors that ran over him like breaking waves.</p><p>Suddenly, the old man broke off what he was saying, and nodded over Roger\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGo on, lad. He needs ye.\u201d</p><p>Roger had turned to see Jamie standing at the far side of the clearing, half-turned away and leaning on a tree, his head bowed in thought. Had he made some sign to Arch? Then Jamie glanced round, and met Roger\u2019s eye. Yes, he wanted him, and Roger found himself standing beside Fraser, with no clear memory of having crossed the ground between them.</p><p>Jamie reached out and squeezed his hand, hard, and he held on, squeezing back.</p><p>\u201cA word, a cliamhuinn,\u201d Jamie said, and let go. \u201cI wouldna speak so now, but there may be no good time later, and there\u2019s little time to bide.\u201d He sounded calm, too, but not like Arch. There were broken things in his voice; Roger felt the hairy bite of the rope, hearing it, and cleared his own throat.</p><p>\u201cSay, then.\u201d</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath, and shrugged a bit, as though his shirt were too tight.</p><p>\u201cThe bairn. It\u2019s no right to ask ye, but I must. Would ye feel the same for him, and ye kent for sure he wasna your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger simply blinked, making no sense whatever of this. \u201cBai\u2014ye mean Jem?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, eyes intent on Roger\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWell, I . . . I dinna ken, quite,\u201d Roger said, baffled as to what this was about. Why? And why now, of all times?</p><p>\u201cThink.\u201d</p><p>He was thinking, wondering what the hell? Evidently this thought showed, for Fraser ducked his head in acknowledgment of the need to explain himself further.</p><p>\u201cI ken . . . it\u2019s no likely, aye? But it\u2019s possible. She might be wi\u2019 child by the night\u2019s work, d\u2019ye see?\u201d</p><p>He did see, with a blow like a fist under the breastbone. Before he could get breath to speak, Fraser went on.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a day or two, perhaps, when I might\u2014\u201d He glanced away, and a dull flush showed through the streaks of soot with which he had painted his face. \u201cThere could be doubt, aye? As there is for you. But . . .\u201d He swallowed, that \u201cbut\u201d hanging eloquent.</p><p>Jamie glanced away, involuntarily, and Roger\u2019s eyes followed the direction of his gaze. Beyond a screen of bush and red-tinged creeper, there was an eddy pool, and Claire knelt on the far side, nak*d, studying her reflection. The blood thundered in Roger\u2019s ears, and he jerked his eyes away, but the image was seared on his mind.</p><p>She did not look human, was the first thing he thought. Her body mottled black with bruises, her face unrecognizable, she looked like something strange and primal, an exotic creature of the forest pool. Beyond appearance, though, it was her attitude that struck him. She was remote, somehow, and still, in the way that a tree is still, even as the air stirs its leaves.</p><p>He glanced back, unable not to. She bent over the water, studying her face. Her hair hung wet and tangled down her back, and she skimmed it back with the palm of a hand, holding it out of the way as she surveyed her battered features with dispassionate intentness.</p><p>She prodded gently here and there, opening and closing her jaw as her fingertips explored the contours of her face. Testing, he supposed, for loose teeth and broken bones. She closed her eyes and traced the lines of brow and nose, jaw and lip, hand as sure and delicate as a painter\u2019s. Then she seized the end of her nose with determination and pulled hard.</p><p>Roger cringed in reflex, as blood and tears poured down her face, but she made no sound. His stomach was already knotted into a small, painful ball; it rose up into his throat, pressing against the rope scar.</p><p>She sat back on her heels, breathing deeply, eyes closed, hands cupped over the center of her face.</p><p>He became suddenly aware that she was nak*d, and he was still staring. He jerked away, blood hot in his face, and glanced surreptitiously toward Jamie in hopes that Fraser had not noticed. He hadn\u2019t\u2014he was no longer there.</p><p>Roger looked wildly round, but spotted him almost at once. His relief at not being caught staring was superseded at once by a jolt of adrenaline, when he saw what Fraser was doing.</p><p>He was standing beside a body on the ground.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s gaze flicked briefly round, taking note of his men, and Roger could almost feel the effort with which Jamie suppressed his own feelings. Then Fraser\u2019s bright blue eyes fastened on the man at his feet, and Roger saw him breathe in, very slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lionel Brown.</p><p>Quite without meaning to, Roger had found himself striding across the clearing. He took up his place at Jamie\u2019s right without conscious thought, his attention similarly fixed on the man on the ground.</p><p>Brown\u2019s eyes were shut, but he wasn\u2019t asleep. His face was bruised and swollen, as well as patched with fever, but the expression of barely suppressed panic was plain on his battered features. Fully justified, too, so far as Roger could see.</p><p>The sole survivor of the night\u2019s work, Brown was still alive only because Arch Bug had stopped young Ian Murray inches away from smashing his skull with a tomahawk. Not from any hesitation about killing an injured man, from cold pragmatism.</p> <p>\u201cYour uncle will have questions,\u201d Arch had said, narrowed eyes on Brown. \u201cLet this one live long enough to answer them.\u201d</p><p>Ian had said nothing, but pulled his arm from Arch Bug\u2019s grasp and turned on his heel, disappearing into the shadows of the forest like smoke.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face was much less expressive than his captive\u2019s, Roger thought. He himself could tell nothing of Fraser\u2019s thoughts from his expression\u2014but scarcely needed to. The man was still as stone, but seemed nonetheless to throb with something slow and inexorable. Merely to stand near him was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cHow say you, O, friend?\u201d Fraser said at last, turning to Arch, who stood on the far side of the pallet, white-haired and blood-streaked. \u201cCan he be traveling further, or will the journey kill him?\u201d</p><p>Bug leaned forward, peering dispassionately at the supine Brown.</p> <p>\u201cI say he will live. His face is red, not white, and he is awake. You wish to take him with us, or ask your questions now?\u201d</p><p>For a brief instant the mask lifted, and Roger, who had been watching Jamie\u2019s face, saw in his eyes precisely what he wished to do. Had Lionel Brown seen it, too, he would have leaped off his pallet and run, broken leg or no. But his eyes stayed stubbornly shut, and as Jamie and old Arch were speaking in Gaelic, Brown remained in ignorance.</p><p>Without answering Arch\u2019s question, Jamie knelt and put his hand on Brown\u2019s chest. Roger could see the pulse hammering in Brown\u2019s neck and the man\u2019s breathing, quick and shallow. Still, he kept his lids squeezed tight shut, though the eyeballs rolled to and fro, frantic beneath them.</p><p>Jamie stayed motionless for what seemed a long time\u2014and must have been an eternity to Brown. Then he made a small sound that might have been either a contemptuous laugh or a snort of disgust, and rose.</p><p>\u201cWe take him. See that he lives, then,\u201d he said in English. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Brown had continued to play possum through the journey to the Ridge, in spite of the bloodthirsty speculations various of the party had made within his hearing on the way. Roger had helped to unstrap him from the travois at journey\u2019s end. His garments and wrappings were soaked with sweat, the smell of fear a palpable miasma round him.</p> <p>Claire had made a movement toward the injured man, frowning, but Jamie had stopped her with a hand on her arm. Roger hadn\u2019t heard what he murmured to her, but she nodded and went with him into the Big House. A moment later, Mrs. Bug had appeared, uncharacteristically silent, and taken charge of Lionel Brown.</p><p>Murdina Bug was not like Jamie, nor old Arch; her thoughts were plain to see in the bloodless seam of her mouth and the thunderous brow. But Lionel Brown took water from her hand and, open-eyed, watched her as though she were the light of his salvation. She would, Roger thought, have been pleased to kill Brown like one of the cockroaches she ruthlessly exterminated from her kitchen. But Jamie wished him kept alive, so alive he would stay.</p><p>For now.</p><p>A sound at the door jerked Roger\u2019s attention back to the present. Brianna!</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, though, when he opened the door; only the rattle of wind-tossed twigs and acorn caps. He looked down the dark path, hoping to see her, but there was no sign of her yet. Of course, he told himself, Claire would likely need her.</p><p>So do I.</p><p>He squashed the thought, but stayed at the door, looking out, wind whining in his ears. She\u2019d gone up to the Big House at once, the moment he came to tell her that her mother was safe. He hadn\u2019t said much more, but she had seen something of how matters stood\u2014there was blood on his clothes\u2014and had barely paused to assure herself that none of it was his before rushing out.</p><p>He closed the door carefully, looking to see that the draft hadn\u2019t wakened Jemmy. He had an immense urge to pick the boy up, and in spite of long-ingrained parental wariness about disturbing a sleeping child, scooped Jem out of his trundle; he had to.</p> <p>Jem was heavy in his arms, and groggy. He stirred, lifted his head, and blinked, blue eyes glassy with sleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Roger whispered, patting his back. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Jem sighed like a punctured tire and dropped his head on Roger\u2019s shoulder with the force of a spent cannonball. He seemed to inflate again for a moment, but then put his thumb in his mouth and subsided into that peculiarly boneless state common to sleeping children. His flesh seemed to melt comfortably into Roger\u2019s own, his trust so complete that it was not necessary even to maintain the boundaries of his body\u2014Daddy would do that.</p><p>Roger closed his eyes against starting tears, and pressed his mouth against the soft warmth of Jemmy\u2019s hair.</p><p>The firelight made black and red shadows on the insides of his lids; by looking at them, he could keep the tears at bay. It didn\u2019t matter what he saw there. He had a small collection of grisly moments, vivid from the dawn, but he could look at those unmoved\u2014for now. It was the sleeping trust in his arms that moved him, and the echo of his own whispered words.</p><p>Was it even a memory? Perhaps it was no more than a wish\u2014that he had once been roused from sleep, only to sleep again in strong arms, hearing, \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He took deep breaths, slowing to the rhythm of Jem\u2019s breathing, calming himself. It seemed important not to weep, even though there was no one to see or care.</p><p>Jamie had looked at him, as they moved from Brown\u2019s pallet, the question clear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna think I mind only for myself, I hope?\u201d he had said, low-voiced. His eyes had turned toward the gap in the brush where Claire had gone, half-squinting as though he could not bear to look, but couldn\u2019t keep his eyes away.</p><p>\u201cFor her,\u201d he said, so low that Roger scarcely heard. \u201cWould she rather . . . have the doubt, d\u2019ye think? If it came to that.\u201d</p><p>Roger took a deep breath of his son\u2019s hair, and hoped to God he\u2019d said the right thing, there among the trees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cBut for you\u2014if there\u2019s room for doubt\u2014I say, take it.\u201d</p><p>If Jamie were disposed to follow that advice, Bree should be home soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M FINE,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cPerfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>Bree narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cSure you are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been run over by a locomotive. Two locomotives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and touched my split lip gingerly. \u201cWell. Yes. Other than that, though . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? Sit down, Mama, I\u2019ll make you some tea, then maybe a little supper.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t hungry, didn\u2019t want tea, and particularly didn\u2019t want to sit down\u2014not after a long day on horseback. Brianna was already taking down the teapot from its shelf above the sideboard, though, and I couldn\u2019t find the proper words to stop her. All of a sudden, I seemed to have no words at all. I turned toward Jamie, helpless.</p><p>He somehow divined my feeling, though he couldn\u2019t have read much of anything on my face, given its current state. He stepped forward, though, and took the teapot from her, murmuring something too low for me to catch. She frowned at him, glanced at me, then back, still frowning. Then her face changed a little, and she came toward me, looking searchingly into my face.</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cShampoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said, and my shoulders sagged in grateful relief. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I did sit down then, after all, and let her sponge my hands and feet, and wash my hair in a basin of warm water drawn from the cauldron in the hearth. She did it quietly, humming under her breath, and I began to relax under the soothing scrub of her long, strong fingers.</p><p>I\u2019d slept\u2014from sheer exhaustion\u2014part of the way, leaning on Jamie\u2019s chest. There\u2019s no way of achieving real rest on horseback, though, and I found myself now close to nodding off, noticing only in a dreamy, detached sort of way that the water in the basin had turned a grubby, cloudy red, full of grit and leaf fragments.</p><p>I\u2019d changed to a clean shift; the feel of the worn linen on my skin was sheer luxury, cool and smooth.</p><p>Bree was humming softly, under her breath. What was it . . . \u201cMr. Tambourine Man,\u201d I thought. One of those sweetly silly songs of the sixt\u2014</p><p>1968.</p><p>I gasped, and Bree\u2019s hands gripped my head, steadying me.</p><p>\u201cMama? Are you all right? Did I touch something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, looking down into the swirls of dirt and blood. I took a deep breath, heart pounding. \u201cPerfectly fine. Just\u2014began to doze off, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, but took her hands away and went to fetch a pitcher of water for rinsing, leaving me gripping the edge of the table and trying not to shudder.</p><p>You don\u2019t act afraid of men. You oughta act more afraid. That particularly ironic echo came to me clearly, along with the outline of the young man\u2019s head, leonine hair seen silhouetted by the firelight. I couldn\u2019t recall his face clearly\u2014but surely I would have noticed that hair?</p><p>Jamie had taken my arm, afterward, and led me out from under my sheltering tree, into the clearing. The fire had been scattered during the fight; there were blackened rocks and patches of singed and flattened grass here and there\u2014among the bodies. He had led me slowly from one to another. At the last, he had paused, and said quietly, \u201cYe see that they are dead?\u201d</p><p>I did, and knew why he had shown me\u2014so I need not fear their return, or their vengeance. But I had not thought to count them. Or to look closely at their faces. Even had I been sure how many there were . . . another shiver struck me, and Bree wrapped a warm towel around my shoulders, murmuring words I didn\u2019t hear for the questions clamoring in my head.</p><p>Was Donner among the dead? Or had he heeded me, when I\u2019d told him that if he were wise, he\u2019d run? He hadn\u2019t struck me as a wise young man.</p><p>He had struck me as a coward, though.</p><p>Warm water sluiced around my ears, drowning out the sound of Jamie\u2019s and Brianna\u2019s voices overhead; I caught only a word or two, but when I sat back up, with water dripping down my neck, clutching a towel to my hair, Bree was reluctantly moving toward her cloak, hung on the peg by the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right, Mama?\u201d The worried frown was back between her brows, but this time I could muster a few words of reassurance.</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling; that was wonderful,\u201d I said, with complete sincerity. \u201cAll I want just now is sleep,\u201d I added with somewhat less.</p><p>I was still terribly tired, but now completely wakeful. What I did want was . . . well, I didn\u2019t know quite what I did want, but a general absence of solicitous company was on the list. Besides, I\u2019d caught a glimpse of Roger earlier, bloodstained, white, and swaying with weariness; I wasn\u2019t the only victim of the recent unpleasantness.</p><p>\u201cGo home, lass,\u201d Jamie said softly. He swung the cloak from its peg and over her shoulders, patting her gently. \u201cFeed your man. Take him to bed, and say a prayer for him. I\u2019ll mind your mother, aye?\u201d</p><p>Bree\u2019s gaze swung between us, blue and troubled, but I put on what I hoped was a reassuring expression\u2014it hurt to do it, rather\u2014and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, she hugged me tight, kissed my forehead very gently, and left.</p><p>Jamie shut the door and stood with his back against it, hands behind him. I was used to the impassive facade he normally used to shield his thoughts when troubled or angry; he wasn\u2019t using it, and the expression on his face troubled me no end.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I said, as reassuringly as I could. \u201cI\u2019m not traumatized, or anything of that sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mustn\u2019t?\u201d he asked guardedly. \u201cWell . . . perhaps I wouldna, if I kent what ye meant by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I blotted my damp face gingerly, and patted at my neck with the towel. \u201cWell. It means . . . very much injured\u2014or dreadfully shocked. It\u2019s Greek, I think\u2014the root word, I mean, \u2018trauma.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? And you\u2019re not . . . shocked. Ye say.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, as he examined me with the sort of critical attention usually employed when contemplating the purchase of expensive bloodstock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, backing away a little. \u201cJust\u2014I\u2019m all right. Only a bit . . . shaken.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward me, and I backed up abruptly, aware belatedly that I was clutching the towel to my bosom as though it were a shield. I forced myself to lower it, and felt blood prickle unpleasantly in patches over face and neck.</p><p>He stood very still, regarding me with that same narrow look. Then his gaze dropped to the floor between us. He stood as though deep in thought, and then his big hands flexed. Once, twice. Very slowly. And I heard\u2014heard clearly\u2014the sound of Arvin Hodgepile\u2019s vertebrae parting one from another.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head jerked up, startled, and I realized that I was standing on the other side of the chair from him, the towel wadded and pressed against my mouth. My elbows moved like rusty hinges, stiff and slow, but I got the towel down. My lips were nearly as stiff, but I spoke, too.</p><p>\u201cI am a little shaken, yes,\u201d I said very clearly. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>The troubled scrutiny in his eyes wavered suddenly, like the glass of a window struck by a stone, in the split second before it shatters, and he shut his eyes. He swallowed once, and opened them again.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said very softly, and the smashed and splintered fragments showed clear, sharp and jagged in his eyes. \u201cI have been raped. And ye say I must not worry for ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God damn it!\u201d I flung the towel on the floor, and immediately wished I had it back again. I felt nak*d, standing in my shift, and hated the crawling of my skin with a sudden passion that made me slap my thigh to kill it.</p><p>\u201cDamn, damn, damn it! I don\u2019t want you to have to think of that again. I don\u2019t!\u201d And yet I had known from the first that this would happen.</p><p>I took hold of the chairback with both hands and held tight, and tried to force my own gaze into his, wanting so badly to throw myself upon those glittering shards, to shield him from them.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, steadying my voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014I don\u2019t want to make you recall things better left forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth actually twitched at that.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, in something like wonder. \u201cYe think I\u2019d forgot any of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I said, surrendering. I looked at him through swimming eyes. \u201cBut\u2014oh, Jamie, I so wanted you to forget!\u201d</p><p>He put out a hand, very delicately, and touched the tip of his index finger to the tip of mine, where I clutched the chair.</p><p>\u201cDinna mind it,\u201d he said softly, and withdrew the finger. \u201cIt\u2019s no matter now. Will ye rest a bit, Sassenach? Or eat, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want . . . no.\u201d In fact, I couldn\u2019t decide what I wanted to do. I didn\u2019t want to do anything at all. Other than unzip my skin, climb out, and run\u2014and that didn\u2019t seem feasible. I took a few deep breaths, hoping to settle myself and go back to that nice sense of utter exhaustion.</p><p>Should I ask him about Donner? But what was there to ask? \u201cDid you happen to kill a man with long, tangled hair?\u201d They\u2019d all looked like that, to some extent. Donner had been\u2014or possibly still was\u2014an Indian, but no one would have noticed that in the dark, in the heat of fighting.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014how is Roger?\u201d I asked, for lack of anything better to say. \u201cAnd Ian? Fergus?\u201d</p><p>He looked a little startled, as though he had forgotten their existence.</p><p>\u201cThem? The lads are well enough. No one took any hurt in the fight. We had luck.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then took a careful step toward me, watching my face. I didn\u2019t scream or bolt, and he took another, coming close enough that I could feel the warmth of his body. Not startled this time, and chilly in my damp shift, I relaxed a little, swaying toward him, and saw the tension in his own shoulders let go slightly, seeing it.</p><p>He touched my face, very gently. The blood throbbed just below the surface, tender, and I had to brace myself not to flinch away from his touch. He saw it, and drew back his hand a little, so that it hovered just above my skin\u2014I could feel the heat of his palm.</p><p>\u201cWill it heal?\u201d he asked, fingertips moving over the split in my left brow, then down the minefield of my cheek to the scrape on my jaw where Harley Boble\u2019s boot had just missed making a solid connection that would have broken my neck.</p><p>\u201cOf course it will. You know that; you\u2019ve seen worse on battlefields.\u201d I would have smiled in reassurance, but didn\u2019t want to open the deep split in my lip again, and so made a sort of pouting goldfish mouth, which took him by surprise and made him smile.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know.\u201d He ducked his head a little, shy. \u201cIt\u2019s only . . .\u201d His hand still hovered near my face, an expression of troubled anxiety on his own. \u201cOh, God, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOh, Christ, your lovely face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not bear to look at it?\u201d I asked, turning my own eyes away and feeling a sharp little pang at the thought, but trying to convince myself that it didn\u2019t matter. It would heal, after all.</p><p>His fingers touched my chin, gently but firmly, and drew it up, so that I faced him again. His mouth tightened a little as his gaze moved slowly over my battered face, taking inventory. His eyes were soft and dark in the candlelight, the corners tight with pain.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI cannot bear it. The sight of ye tears my heart. And it fills me with such rage I think I must kill someone or burst. But by the God who made ye, Sassenach, I\u2019ll not lie with ye and be unable to look ye in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie with me?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cWhat . . . you mean now?\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped from my chin, but he looked steadily at me, not blinking.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . aye. I do.\u201d</p><p>Had my jaw not been so swollen, my mouth would have dropped open in pure astonishment.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated. He dropped his gaze then, and made the odd shrugging motion that he made when embarrassed or discomposed. \u201cI\u2014well\u2014it seems . . . necessary.\u201d</p><p>I had a thoroughly unsuitable urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNecessary? Do you think it\u2019s like being thrown by a horse? I ought to get straight back on?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up and he shot me an angry glance.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, between clenched teeth. He swallowed hard and visibly, obviously reining in strong feelings. \u201cAre ye\u2014are ye badly damaged, then?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him as best I could, through my swollen lids.</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke of some\u2014oh,\u201d I said, it finally dawning on me what he meant. I felt heat rise in my face, and my bruises throbbed.</p><p>I took a deep breath, to be sure of being able to speak steadily.</p><p>\u201cI have been beaten to a bloody pulp, Jamie, and abused in several nasty ways. But only one . . . there was only the one who actually . . . He\u2014he wasn\u2019t . . . rough.\u201d I swallowed, but the hard knot in my throat didn\u2019t budge perceptibly. Tears made the candlelight blur so that I couldn\u2019t see his face, and I looked away, blinking.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said, my voice sounding rather louder than I intended. \u201cI\u2019m not . . . damaged.\u201d</p><p>He said something in Gaelic under his breath, short and explosive, and shoved himself away from the table. His stool fell over with a loud crash, and he kicked it. Then he kicked it again, and again, and stamped on it with such violence that bits of wood flew across the kitchen and struck the pie safe with little pinging sounds.</p><p>I sat completely still, too shocked and numb to feel distress. Should I not have told him? I wondered vaguely. But he knew, surely. He had asked, when he found me. \u201cHow many?\u201d he had demanded. And then had said, \u201cKill them all.\u201d</p><p>But then . . . to know something was one thing, and to be told the details another. I did know that, and watched with a dim sense of guilty sorrow as he kicked away the splinters of the stool and flung himself at the window. It was shuttered, but he stood, hands braced on the sill and his back turned to me, shoulders heaving. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was crying.</p><p>The wind was rising; there was a squall coming in from the west. The shutters rattled, and the night-smoored fire spouted puffs of soot as the wind came down the chimney. Then the gust passed, and there was no sound but the small sudden crack! of an ember in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said at last, in a small voice.</p><p>Jamie swiveled on his heel at once and glared at me. He wasn\u2019t crying, but he had been; his cheeks were wet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare be sorry!\u201d he roared. \u201cI willna have it, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d He took a giant step toward the table and crashed his fist down on it, hard enough to make the saltcellar jump and fall over. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry!\u201d</p><p>I had closed my eyes in reflex, but forced myself to open them again.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I felt terribly, terribly tired again, and very much like crying myself. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a charged silence. I could hear chestnuts falling in the grove behind the house, dislodged by the wind. One, and then another, and another, a rain of muffled tiny thumps. Then Jamie drew a deep, shuddering breath, and wiped a sleeve across his face.</p><p>I put my elbows on the table and leaned my head on my hands; it seemed much too heavy to hold up anymore.</p><p>\u201cNecessary,\u201d I said, more or less calmly to the tabletop. \u201cWhat did you mean, necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it not occur to you that ye might be with child?\u201d He\u2019d got himself back under control, and said this as calmly as he might have asked whether I planned to serve bacon with the breakfast porridge.</p><p>Startled, I looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d But my hands had gone by reflex to my belly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I repeated more strongly. \u201cI can\u2019t be.\u201d I could, though\u2014just possibly. The chance was a remote one, but it existed. I normally used some form of contraception, just to be certain\u2014but obviously . . .</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>He merely stared at me, eyebrows raised. I wouldn\u2019t; not so soon. So soon\u2014soon enough that if it were so, and if there were more than one man . . . there would be doubt. The benefit of the doubt; that\u2019s what he offered me\u2014and himself.</p><p>A deep shudder started in the depths of my womb and spread instantly through my body, making goose bumps break out on my skin, despite the warmth of the room.</p><p>\u201cMartha,\u201d the man had whispered, the weight of him pressing me into the leaves.</p><p>\u201cBloody, bloody hell,\u201d I said very quietly. I spread my hands out flat on the table, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cMartha.\u201d And the stale smell of him, the meaty press of damp bare thighs, rasping with hair\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d My legs and buttocks pressed together so tightly in revulsion that I rose an inch or two on the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2014\u201d Jamie began stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I repeated, just as stubbornly. \u201cBut even if\u2014you can\u2019t, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, and I caught the flicker of fear in his eyes. That, I realized with a jolt, was exactly what he was afraid of. Or one of the things.</p><p>\u201cI mean we can\u2019t,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m almost sure that I\u2019m not pregnant\u2014but I\u2019m not at all sure that I haven\u2019t been exposed to some disgusting disease.\u201d That was something else I hadn\u2019t thought of until now, and the goose bumps were back in full force. Pregnancy was unlikely; gonorrhea or syphilis weren\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2014we can\u2019t. Not until I\u2019ve had a course of penicillin.\u201d</p><p>I was rising from the bench even as I spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhere are ye going?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cThe surgery!\u201d</p><p>The hallway was dark, and the fire out in my surgery, but that didn\u2019t stop me. I flung open the door of the cupboard, and began groping hastily about. A light fell over my shoulder, illuminating the shimmering row of bottles. Jamie had lit a taper and come after me.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of God are ye doing, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenicillin,\u201d I said, seizing one of the bottles and the leather pouch in which I kept my snake-fang syringes.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, bloody now! Light the candle, will you?\u201d</p><p>He did, and the light wavered and grew into a globe of warm yellow, gleaming off the leather tubes of my homemade syringes. I had a good bit of penicillin mixture to hand, luckily. The liquid in the bottle was pink; many of the Penicillium colonies from this batch had been grown in stale wine.</p><p>\u201cAre ye sure it will work?\u201d Jamie asked quietly, from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, tight-lipped. \u201cBut it\u2019s what I have.\u201d The thought of spirochetes, multiplying silently in my bloodstream, second by second, was making my hand shake. I choked down the fear that the penicillin might be defective. It had worked miracles on gross superficial infections. There was no reason why\u2014</p><p>\u201cLet me do it, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie took the syringe from my hand; my fingers were slippery and fumbling. His were steady, his face calm in candlelight as he filled the syringe.</p><p>\u201cDo me first, then,\u201d he said, handing it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014you? But you don\u2019t need to\u2014I mean\u2014you hate injections,\u201d I ended feebly.</p><p>He snorted briefly and lowered his brows at me.</p><p>\u201cListen, Sassenach. If I mean to fight my own fears, and yours\u2014and I do\u2014then I shallna boggle at pinpricks, aye? Do it!\u201d He turned his side to me and bent over, one elbow braced on the counter, and hitched up the side of his kilt, baring one muscular buttock.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. I might have argued further with him, but a glance at him, standing there bare-arsed and stubborn as Black Mountain, decided me of the futility of that. He\u2019d made up his mind, and we were both going to live with the consequences.</p><p>Feeling suddenly and oddly calm, I lifted the syringe, squeezing gently to remove any air bubbles.</p><p>\u201cShift your weight, then,\u201d I said, nudging him rudely. \u201cRelax this side; I don\u2019t want to break the needle.\u201d</p><p>He drew in his breath with a hiss; the needle was thick, and there was enough alcohol from the wine to make it sting badly, as I discovered when I took my own injection a minute later.</p><p>\u201cOuch! Ow! Oh, Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d I exclaimed, gritting my teeth as I withdrew the needle from my thigh. \u201cChrist, that hurts!\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave me a lopsided smile, still rubbing his backside.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. The rest of it won\u2019t be worse than this, I expect.\u201d</p><p>The rest of it. I felt suddenly hollow, and light-headed with it, as though I hadn\u2019t eaten for a week.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re sure?\u201d I asked, putting down the syringe.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He took a deep breath then, and looked at me, his face uncertain in the wavering candlelight. \u201cBut I mean to try. I must.\u201d</p><p>I smoothed the linen night rail down over my punctured thigh, looking at him as I did it. He\u2019d dropped all his masks long since; the doubt, the anger, and the fear were all there, etched plain in the desperate lines of his face. For once, I thought, my own countenance was less easy to read, masked behind its bruises. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something soft brushed past my leg with a small mirp! and I looked down to see that Adso had brought me a dead vole, no doubt by way of sympathy. I started to smile, felt my lip tingle, and then looked up at Jamie and let it split as I did smile, the taste of blood warm silver on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . you\u2019ve come whenever I\u2019ve needed you; I rather think you\u2019ll do it this time, too.\u201d</p><p>He looked completely blank for an instant, not grasping the feeble joke. Then it struck him, and blood rushed to his face. His lip twitched, and twitched again, unable to decide between shock and laughter.</p><p>I thought he turned his back then to hide his face, but in fact, he had only turned to search the cupboard. He found what he was looking for, and turned round again with a bottle of my best muscat wine in his hand, shining dark. He held it to his body with his elbow, and took down another.</p> <p>\u201cAye, I will,\u201d he said, reaching out his free hand to me. \u201cBut if ye think either one of us is going to do this sober, Sassenach, ye\u2019re verra much mistaken.\u201d</p><p>A GUST OF WIND from the open door roused Roger from uneasy sleep. He had fallen asleep on the settle, his legs trailing on the floor, Jemmy snuggled warmly heavy on his chest.</p><p>He looked up, blinking and disoriented, as Brianna stooped to take the little boy from his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs it raining out?\u201d he said, catching a whiff of damp and ozone from her cloak. He sat up and rubbed a hand over his face to rouse himself, feeling the scruff of a four-day beard.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s going to.\u201d She laid Jemmy back in his trundle, covered him, and hung up the cloak before coming to Roger. She smelled of the night, and her hand was cold on his flushed cheek. He put his arms round her waist and leaned his head against her, sighing.</p> <p>He would have been happy to stay that way forever\u2014or at least the next hour or two. She stroked his head gently for a moment, though, then moved away, stooping to light the candle from the hearth.</p><p>\u201cYou must be starved. Shall I fix you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean . . . yes. Please.\u201d As the last remnants of grogginess fell away, he realized that he was, in fact, starving. After their stop at the stream in the morning, they hadn\u2019t stopped again, Jamie anxious to get home. He couldn\u2019t recall when he\u2019d last eaten, but hadn\u2019t felt any sense of hunger at all until this minute.</p><p>He fell on the bread and butter and jam she brought him, ravenous. He ate single-mindedly, and it was several minutes before he thought to ask, swallowing a final thick, buttery, sweet bite, \u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, with an excellent imitation of Claire with her stiffest English upper lip. \u201cPerfectly fine.\u201d She grimaced at him, and he laughed, though quietly, with an automatic glance at the trundle.</p><p>\u201cIs she, then?\u201d</p> <p>Bree raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted, sobering. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to tell you if she\u2019s not. She\u2019ll not want ye worrying.\u201d</p><p>She made a rather rude glottal noise in response to this notion, and turned her back on him, lifting the long veil of hair off her neck.</p><p>\u201cWill you do my laces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like your father when ye make that noise\u2014only higher-pitched. Have ye been practicing?\u201d He stood up and pulled the laces loose. Undid her stays as well, then on impulse, slid his hands inside the opened gown, resting them on the warm swell of her hips.</p><p>\u201cEvery day. Have you?\u201d She leaned back against him, and his hands came up, cupping her br**sts by reflex.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d It was Claire\u2019s suggestion\u2014that he try to sing, pitching his voice both higher and lower than normal, in hopes of loosening his vocal cords, perhaps restoring a bit of his original resonance.</p> <p>\u201cCoward,\u201d she said, but her voice was nearly as soft as the hair that brushed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am,\u201d he said as softly. It did hurt, but it wasn\u2019t the physical pain that he minded. It was feeling the echo of his old voice in his bones\u2014the ease and power of it\u2014and then hearing the uncouth noises that emerged with such difficulty now from his throat\u2014croaks and grunts and squeals. Like a pig choking to death on a crow, he thought disparagingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them that are cowards,\u201d Bree said, still speaking softly, but with steel in her voice. She tensed a little in his arms. \u201cHer face\u2014her poor face! How could they? How could anybody do something like that?\u201d</p><p>He had a sudden vision of Claire, nak*d by the pool, silent as the rocks, her br**sts streaked with the blood from her newly set nose. He drew back, nearly jerking his hands away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brianna said, startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He pulled his hands out of her gown and stepped back. \u201cI\u2014er, is there maybe a bit of milk?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him oddly, but went out to the lean-to at the back and brought in a jug of milk. He drank it thirstily, aware of her eyes on him, watchful as a cat\u2019s, as she undressed and changed into her night rail.</p><p>She sat down on the bed and began to brush out her hair, preparing to plait it for sleep. On impulse, he reached out and took the brush from her. Without speaking, he ran one hand through the thickness of her hair, lifting it, smoothing it back from her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispered, and felt tears come to his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d She lifted her hands to his shoulders and brought him slowly down to his knees before her. She looked searchingly into his eyes\u2014he did his best to look back. She smiled a little, then, and reached to untie the thong that held his own hair back.</p><p>It fell around his shoulders in a dusty black tangle, smelling of burned things, stale sweat, and horses. He protested when she took up her hairbrush, but she ignored him, and made him bend his head over her lap, while she picked pine straw and sandburs from his head, slowly working out the snarls. His head bent lower, and lower still, and he found himself at last with his forehead pressed into her lap, breathing in the close scent of her.</p><p>He was reminded of medieval paintings, sinners kneeling, heads bowed in confession and remorse. Presbyterians did not confess on their knees\u2014Catholics still did, he thought. In darkness, like this\u2014in anonymity.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve not asked me what happened,\u201d he whispered at last, to the shadows of her thighs. \u201cDid your father tell ye?\u201d</p><p>He heard her draw breath, but her voice was calm when she replied.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She said no more, and the room was quiet, save for the sound of the brush through his hair, and the rising rush of the wind outside.</p><p>How would it be for Jamie? Roger wondered suddenly. Would he really do it? Try to . . . He shied away from the thought, unable to contemplate it. Seeing instead a picture of Claire, coming out of the dawn, her face a swollen mask. Still herself, but remote as a distant planet on an orbit departing for the outer reaches of deep space\u2014when might it come in sight again? Stooping to touch the dead, at Jamie\u2019s urging, to see for herself the price of her honor.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the possibility of a child, he thought suddenly. It was fear\u2014but not of that. It was Jamie\u2019s fear that he would lose her\u2014that she would go, swing out into a dark and solitary space without him, unless he could somehow bind her to him, keep her with him. But, Christ, what a risk to take\u2014with a woman so shocked and brutalized, how could he risk it?</p><p>How could he not?</p><p>Brianna laid down the brush, though she kept a hand gently on his head, stroking it. He knew that fear too well himself\u2014remembered the gulf that once had lain between them, and the courage it had taken to leap over it. For both of them.</p><p>He was some kind of a coward, maybe\u2014but not that kind.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said, and felt the lump in his throat, the scar of the rope. She heard the need in his voice and looked at him as he raised his head, hand lifting toward his face, and he seized it hard, pressing the palm of it against his cheek, rubbing against it.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Her voice was soft, not to wake the bairn, but full of urgency.</p><p>\u201cBrianna, will ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will. What is it?\u201d Her body was against him, wanting to tend him, and he desired the comfort of her so badly that he would have lain down there on the rug before the fire and buried his head between her br**sts\u2014but not yet.</p><p>\u201cOnly\u2014listen to what I must say. And then\u2014please God\u2014tell me I have done right.\u201d Tell me that you love me, still, he meant, but could not say it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes were dark and soft, bottomless with forgiveness not yet earned. And somewhere beyond them, he saw another pair of eyes, staring up at him in drunken bewilderment, changing abruptly into fear as he raised his arm for the killing blow.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said softly. \u201cPut out the candle, aye?\u201d</p><p>NOT THE KITCHEN, still strewn with emotional wreckage. Not the surgery, with all its sharp-edged memories. Jamie hesitated, but then nodded toward the stair, raising one eyebrow. I nodded, and followed him up to our bedroom.</p><p>It seemed both familiar and strange, as places do when one is away for a time. Perhaps it was only my injured nose that made it smell strange, too; perhaps I only imagined that I could smell it\u2014cold and somehow stale, though everything was swept and dusted. Jamie poked up the fire and light sprang up, wavering in bright swaths over the wooden walls, the scents of smoke and hot resin helping to fill the sense of emptiness in the room.</p><p>Neither of us glanced toward the bed. He lit the candlestick on the washstand, then set our two stools near the window, and opened the shutters to the restless night. He\u2019d brought two pewter cups; he filled these and set them on the broad sill, along with the bottles.</p><p>I stood just inside the doorway, watching his preparations, feeling thoroughly peculiar.</p><p>I was suffering the oddest contradiction of feelings. On the one hand, I felt as though he were a complete stranger. I could not even imagine, let alone recall, a sense of ease in touching him. His body was no longer the comfortable extension of my own, but something foreign, unapproachable.</p><p>At the same time, alarming surges of lust ripped through me without warning. It had been happening all day. This was nothing like the slow burn of accustomed desire, nor yet the instant spark of passion. Not even that cyclic and mindless womb-yearning sense of a need to mate that belonged entirely to the body. This was frightening.</p><p>He stooped to put another stick on the fire, and I nearly staggered, as all the blood left my head. The light shone on the hair of his arms, the dark hollows of his face\u2014</p><p>It was the sheer impersonal sense of a voracious appetite\u2014something that possessed me, but was not part of me\u2014that terrified me. It was fear of it that made me avoid his touch, more than the feeling of estrangement.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d He had caught sight of my face, and stepped toward me, frowning. I held up a hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, feeling breathless. I sat down hastily, my knees weak, and picked up one of the cups he had just filled. \u201cUm . . . cheers.\u201d</p><p>Both his brows went up, but he moved to take his own seat opposite me.</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d he said quietly, and touched his cup to mine, the wine heavy and sweet-smelling in my hand.</p><p>My fingers were cold; so were my toes, and the tip of my nose. That changed, too, without warning. Another minute, and I might be suffused with heat, sweating and flushed. But for the moment, I was cold, and shivered in the rainy breeze from the window.</p><p>The wine\u2019s aroma was strong enough to make an impact, even on my damaged membranes, and the sweetness was a comfort to nerves and stomach alike. I drank the first cup quickly, and poured another, urgently wanting a small layer of oblivion between reality and myself.</p><p>Jamie drank more slowly, but refilled his own cup when I did. The cedar blanket chest, warmed by the fire, was beginning to spread its own familiar fragrance through the room. He glanced at me now and then, but said nothing. The silence between us was not awkward, precisely, but it was charged.</p><p>I should say something, I thought. But what? I sipped the second cup, racking my brain.</p><p>At last, I reached out slowly and touched his nose, where the thin line of the long-healed break pressed white against the skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d I said, \u201cyou\u2019ve never told me how you came to break your nose. Who set it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, that? No one.\u201d He smiled, touching his nose a little self-consciously. \u201c\u2019Twas only luck that the break was a clean one, for I didna pay it the slightest heed at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. You said\u2014\u201d I broke off, suddenly recalling what he had said. When I had found him again, in his printer\u2019s shop in Edinburgh, I\u2019d asked him when he\u2019d broken it. He\u2019d answered, \u201cAbout three minutes after I last saw ye, Sassenach.\u201d On the eve of Culloden, then\u2014on that rocky Scottish hill, below the ring of standing stones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said a little weakly. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want to think about that, do you?\u201d</p><p>He seized my free hand, hard, and looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cYou may have it,\u201d he said. His voice was very low, but he met my eyes straight on. \u201cAll of it. Anything that was ever done to me. If ye wish it, if it helps ye, I will live it through again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Jamie,\u201d I said softly. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t need to know; all I need is to know that you did live through it. That you\u2019re all right. But . . .\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWill I tell you?\u201d What was done to me, I meant, and he knew it. He did glance away then, though he held my hand in both of his, cradling it and rubbing his palm gently over my bruised knuckles.</p><p>\u201cMust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Sometime. But not now\u2014not unless you . . . you need to hear.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cFirst.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, very slightly, but still didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>I took my hand away, and swallowed the rest of the wine in my cup, rough and warm and musky with the tang of grape skins. I had stopped going hot and cold by turns; now I was only warm throughout, and grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cYour nose,\u201d I said, and poured another cup. \u201cTell me, then. Please.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. There were two English soldiers, come scouting up the hill. I think they didna expect to find anyone\u2014neither had his musket loaded, or I should ha\u2019 died there.\u201d</p><p>He spoke quite casually. A small shiver went over me, but not from cold.</p><p>\u201cThey saw me, ken, and then one of them saw you, up above. He shouted, and made to go after ye, so I threw myself on him. I didna care at all what happened, so long as ye were safe away, so I went for him bald-heided; plunged my dirk into his side. But his bullet box swung into my way and the knife stuck in it, and\u2014\u201d He smiled, lopsided. \u201cAnd while I was trying to get it free and keep from bein\u2019 killed, his friend came up and swung the stock of his musket into my face.\u201d</p><p>His free hand had curled up as he spoke, grasping the hilt of a remembered dirk.</p><p>I flinched, knowing now exactly what that had felt like. Just hearing about it made my own nose throb. I sniffed, dabbed cautiously at it with the back of my hand, and poured more wine.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the musket from him and clubbed them both to death with it.\u201d</p><p>He spoke quietly, almost colorlessly, but there was an odd resonance to his voice that made my stomach shift uneasily. It was too fresh, that sight of the blood drops gleaming by dawn light in the hairs of his arm. Too fresh, that undertone of\u2014what was it? satisfaction?\u2014in his voice.</p><p>I was suddenly too restless to sit still. A moment before I had been so exhausted that my bones were melting; now I had to move. I stood up, leaning out over the sill. The storm was coming; the wind was freshening, blowing back my new-washed hair, and lightning flickered in the distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, sounding worried. \u201cI shouldna have told ye. Are ye bothered by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBothered? No, not by that.\u201d</p><p>I spoke a little tersely. Why had I asked him about his nose, of all things? Why now, when I had been content to live in ignorance for the last several years?</p><p>\u201cWhat bothers ye, then?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>What was bothering me was that the wine had been doing its job of anesthetizing me nicely; now I had ruined it. All the images of the night before were back inside my head, thrown into vivid Technicolor by that simple statement, that oh-so-matter-of-fact, \u201cI took the musket from him and clubbed them both to death with it.\u201d And its unspoken echo, It is myself who kills for her.</p><p>I wanted to throw up. Instead, I gulped more wine, not even tasting it, swallowing it down as fast as I could. I dimly heard Jamie ask again what bothered me, and swung round to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat bothers me\u2014bothers! What a stupid word! What drives me absolutely mad is that I might have been anyone, anything\u2014a convenient warm spot with spongy bits to squeeze\u2014God, I was no more than a hole to them!\u201d</p><p>I struck the sill with my fist, then, angered by the impotent little thump of it, picked up my cup, turned round, and hurled it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that way with Black Jack Randall, was it?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHe knew you, didn\u2019t he? He saw you when he used you; it wouldn\u2019t have been the same if you were anyone\u2014he wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, ye think that was better?\u201d he blurted, and stared at me, eyes wide.</p><p>I stopped, panting for breath and feeling dizzy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I dropped onto the stool and closed my eyes, feeling the room go round and round me, colored lights like a carousel behind my eyes. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t. I think Jack Randall was a bloody sociopathic, grade-A pervert, and these\u2014these\u201d\u2014I flipped a hand, unable to think of a suitable word\u2014\u201cthey were just . . . men.\u201d</p><p>I spoke the last word with a sense of loathing evident even to me.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Jamie said, his voice sounding odd.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d I said. I opened my eyes and looked at him. My eyes felt hot, and I thought they must glow red, like a possum\u2019s in torchlight.</p><p>\u201cI have lived through a f**king world war,\u201d I said, my voice low and venomous. \u201cI have lost a child. I have lost two husbands. I have starved with an army, been beaten and wounded, been patronized, betrayed, imprisoned, and attacked. And I have f**king survived!\u201d My voice was rising, but I was helpless to stop it. \u201cAnd now should I be shattered because some wretched, pathetic excuses for men stuck their nasty little appendages between my legs and wiggled them?!\u201d I stood up, seized the edge of the washstand and heaved it over, sending everything flying with a crash\u2014basin, ewer, and lighted candlestick, which promptly went out.</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t,\u201d I said quite calmly.</p><p>\u201cNasty little appendages?\u201d he said, looking rather stunned.</p><p>\u201cNot yours,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean yours. I\u2019m rather fond of yours.\u201d Then I sat down and burst into tears.</p><p>His arms came round me, slowly and gently. I didn\u2019t startle or jerk away, and he pressed my head against him, smoothing my damp, tangled hair, his fingers catching in the mass of it.</p><p>\u201cChrist, ye are a brave wee thing,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d I said, eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I grabbed his hand and brought it to my lips, closing my eyes as I did so.</p><p>I brushed my battered mouth across his knuckles, blind. They were swollen, as bruised as mine; I touched my tongue to his flesh, tasted soap and dust and the silver taste of scrapes and gashes\u2014marks left by bones and broken teeth. Pressed my fingers to the veins beneath the skin of wrist and arm, softly resilient, and the solid lines of the bones beneath. I felt the tributaries of his veins, wished to enter into his bloodstream, travel there, dissolved and bodiless, to take refuge in the thick-walled chambers of his heart. But I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I ran my hand up his sleeve, exploring, clinging, relearning his body. I touched the hair in his oxter and stroked it, surprised at the soft, silky feel of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever touched you there before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna believe ye have,\u201d he said, with a hint of nervous laughter in his voice. \u201cI would ha\u2019 remembered. Oh!\u201d A stipple of gooseflesh burst out over the soft skin there, and I pressed my forehead to his chest.</p><p>\u201cThe worst of it is,\u201d I said, into his shirt, \u201cthat I knew them. Each one of them. And I\u2019ll remember them. And feel guilty that they\u2019re dead, because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, but very firmly. \u201cThey are dead because of me, Sassenach. And because of their own wickedness. If there is guilt, let it rest upon them. Or on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on you alone,\u201d I said, my eyes still closed. It was dark in there, and soothing. I could hear my voice, distant but clear, and wondered dimly where the words were coming from. \u201cYou\u2019re blood of my blood, bone of my bone. You said so. What you do rests on me, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen may your vow redeem me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He lifted me to my feet and gathered me to him, like a tailor gathering up a length of fragile, heavy silk\u2014slowly, long-fingered, fold upon fold. He carried me then across the room, and laid me gently on the bed, in the light from the flickering fire.</p><p>HE\u2019D MEANT TO be gentle. Very gentle. Had planned it with care, worrying each step of the long way home. She was broken; he must go canny, take his time. Be careful in gluing back her shattered bits.</p><p>And then he came to her and discovered that she wished no part of gentleness, of courting. She wished directness. Brevity and violence. If she was broken, she would slash him with her jagged edges, reckless as a drunkard with a shattered bottle.</p><p>For a moment, two moments, he struggled, trying to hold her close and kiss her tenderly. She squirmed like an eel in his arms, then rolled over him, wriggling and biting.</p><p>He\u2019d thought to ease her\u2014both of them\u2014with the wine. He\u2019d known she lost all sense of restraint when in drink; he simply hadn\u2019t realized what she was restraining, he thought grimly, trying to seize her without hurting.</p><p>He, of all people, should have known. Not fear or grief or pain\u2014but rage.</p><p>She raked his back; he felt the scrape of broken nails, and thought dimly that was good\u2014she\u2019d fought. That was the last of his thought; his own fury took him then, rage and a lust that came on him like black thunder on a mountain, a cloud that hid all from him and him from all, so that kind familiarity was lost and he was alone, strange in darkness.</p><p>It might be her neck he grasped, or anyone\u2019s. The feel of small bones came to him, knobbled in the dark, and the screams of rabbits, killed in his hand. He rose up in a whirlwind, choked with dirt and the scourings of blood.</p><p>Wrath boiled and curdled in his balls, and he rode to her spurs. Let his lightning blaze and sear all trace of the intruder from her womb, and if it burnt them both to bone and ash\u2014then let it be.</p><p>WHEN SENSE CAME back to him, he lay with his weight full on her, crushing her into the bed. Breath sobbed in his lungs; his hands clenched her arms so hard he felt the bones like sticks about to snap within his grasp.</p><p>He had lost himself. Was not sure where his body ended. His mind flailed for a moment, panicked lest it have been unseated altogether\u2014no. He felt a drop of cold, sudden on his shoulder, and the scattered parts of him drew at once together like shattered bits of quicksilver, to leave him quaking and appalled.</p><p>He was still joined to her. He wanted to bolt like a startled quail, but managed to move slowly, loosening his fingers one by one from their death grip on her arms, lifting his body gently away, though the effort of it seemed immense, as though his weight were that of moons and planets. He half-expected to see her crushed and flattened, lifeless on the sheet. But the springy arch of her ribs rose and fell and rose again, roundly reassuring.</p><p>Another drop struck him in the back of his neck, and he hunched his shoulders in surprise. Caught by his movement, she looked up, and he met her eyes with shock. She shared it; the shock of strangers meeting one another nak*d. Her eyes flicked away from his, up toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThe roof\u2019s leaking,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s a wet patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He had not even realized that it was raining. The room was dark with rainlight, though, and the roof thrummed overhead. The sound of it seemed inside his blood, like the beat of the bodhrana inside the night, like the beat of his heart in the forest.</p><p>He shuddered, and for lack of any other notion, kissed her forehead. Her arms came up sudden as a snare and held him fiercely, pulling him down onto her again and he seized her, too, crushing her to him hard enough to feel the breath go out of her, unable to let go. He thought vaguely of Brianna\u2019s talk of giant orbs that whirled through space, the thing called gravity\u2014and what was grave about it? He saw that well enough just now: a force so great as to balance some body unthinkably immense in thin air, unsupported\u2014or send two such bodies crashing into each other, in an explosion of destruction and the smoke of stars.</p><p>He\u2019d bruised her; there were dark red marks on her arms where his fingers had been. They would be black within the day. The marks of other men bloomed black and purple, blue and yellow, clouded petals trapped beneath the whiteness of her skin.</p><p>His thighs and buttocks were strained with effort, and a cramp took him hard, making him groan and twist to ease it. His skin was wet; so was hers, and they slid apart with slow reluctance.</p><p>Eyes puffed and bruised, clouded like wild honey, inches from his own.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d he replied with complete honesty. He was hoarse, as though he had been screaming\u2014God, perhaps he had been. Her mouth had bled again; there was a red smear on her chin, and the taste of metal from it in his own mouth.</p><p>He cleared his throat, wanting to look away from her eyes, but unable to do it. He rubbed a thumb over the smear of blood, clumsily erasing it.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d he asked, and the words were like a rasp in his throat. \u201cHow do ye feel?\u201d</p><p>She had drawn back a little at his touch, but her eyes were still fixed on his. He had the feeling that she was looking far beyond him, through him\u2014but then the focus of her gaze came back, and she looked directly at him, for the first time since he had brought her home.</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d she whispered, and closed her eyes. She took one huge breath and her body relaxed all at once, going limp and heavy like a dying hare.</p><p>He held her, both arms wrapped around her as though to save her from drowning, but felt her sink away all the same. He wished to call out to her not to go, not to leave him alone. She vanished into the depths of sleep, and he yearned after her, wishing her healed, fearing her flight, and bent his head, burying his face in her hair and her scent.</p><p>The wind banged the open shutters as it passed, and in the dark outside, one owl hooted and another answered, hiding from the rain.</p><p>Then he cried, soundless, muscles strained to aching that he might not shake with it, that she might not wake to know it. He wept to emptiness and ragged breath, the pillow wet beneath his face. Then lay exhausted beyond the thought of tiredness, too far from sleep even to recall what it was like. His only comfort was the small, so fragile weight that lay warm upon his heart, breathing.</p><p>Then her hands rose and rested on him, the tears cool on his face, congealing, the white of her clean as the silent snow that covers char and blood and breathes peace upon the world.</p><p>30</p><p>THE CAPTIVE</p><p>IT WAS A STILL, WARM morning; the last of the Indian summer. A woodpecker hammered in the wood nearby, and some insect was making a noise like rasping metal in the tall grass beyond the house. I came downstairs slowly, feeling mildly disembodied\u2014and wishing I were, since the body I had hurt almost everywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mrs. Bug hadn\u2019t come this morning; perhaps she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Or perhaps she wasn\u2019t sure yet how to deal with seeing me, or what to say to me when she did. My mouth tightened a little, something I realized only because the partially healed split in my lip stung when I did it.</p><p>I very consciously relaxed my face and went about getting down the coffee things from the kitchen shelf. There was a trail of tiny black ants running along the edge of the shelf, and a swarm of them over the small tin box in which I kept lump sugar. I flicked them off with a few stern swipes of my apron, and made a mental note to see about finding some avens root for repellant.</p><p>That resolve, small as it was, made me feel better and steadier at once. Ever since Hodgepile and his men had turned up at the malting shed, I had been completely at the mercy of someone else, prevented from any sort of independent action. For the first time in days\u2014it seemed much longer\u2014I was able to decide what I was going to do. It seemed a precious liberty.</p><p>Very well, I thought. What would I do, then? I would . . . drink some coffee. Eat a bit of toast? No. I felt gingerly with my tongue; several teeth on one side were loose, and my jaw muscles so sore that serious chewing was out of the question. Just coffee, then, and while I drank it, I would decide upon the shape of my day.</p> <p>Feeling pleased with this plan, I put back the plain wooden cup, and instead ceremoniously set out my sole china cup and saucer, a delicate bit of porcelain Jocasta had given me, hand-painted with violets.</p><p>Jamie had poked up the fire earlier and the kettle was boiling; I dipped out enough water to warm the pot, swished it round, and opened the back door in order to toss it out. Fortunately, I looked first.</p><p>Ian was sitting cross-legged on the back porch, a small whetstone in one hand, knife in the other.</p><p>\u201cGood morn to ye, Auntie,\u201d he said cheerfully, and drew the knife across the stone, making the thin, monotonous rasping noise I had heard earlier. \u201cFeeling better, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, fine,\u201d I assured him. He raised one eyebrow dubiously, looking me over.</p> <p>\u201cWell, better than ye look, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that good,\u201d I said tartly, and he laughed. He put down the knife and stone and got to his feet. He was much taller than I; nearly Jamie\u2019s height, though thinner. He\u2019d inherited his father\u2019s whipcord leanness, as well as the elder Ian\u2019s sense of humor\u2014and his toughness.</p><p>He took me by the shoulders and turned me into the sunlight, pursing his lips a little as he inspected me at close range. I blinked up at him, imagining what I must look like. I hadn\u2019t had the nerve to look into a mirror yet, but I knew the bruising must be going from blacks and reds to a colorful assortment of blues, greens, and yellows. Add in assorted knobbly swellings, flecks of crusty black for the split lip and the scabby bits, and I was undoubtedly quite the picture of health.</p><p>Ian\u2019s soft hazel eyes peered intently into my face with no apparent surprise or distress, though. At last he let go, and patted my shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll do, Auntie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. And with no warning at all, tears welled up and overflowed. I knew exactly what he\u2019d meant, and why he\u2019d said it\u2014and it was true.</p> <p>I felt as though my center had turned unexpectedly to liquid and was gushing out, not from grief, but from relief. I was still me. Fragile, battered, sore, and wary\u2014but myself. Only when I recognized that, did I realize how much I had feared that I might not be\u2014that I might emerge from shock and find myself irrevocably altered, some vital part forever missing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I assured Ian, hastily wiping my eyes with the edge of my apron. \u201cJust a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d he said, and took the pot from me, tossing the water into the grass by the path. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange, aye? Coming back.\u201d</p><p>I took the coffeepot from him, squeezing his hand hard as I did so. He had come back twice from captivity: rescued from Geillis Duncan\u2019s strange compound on Jamaica, only to choose later exile with the Mohawk. He had come to manhood on that journey, and I did wonder what parts of himself might have been left behind on the way.</p><p>\u201cDo you want breakfast, Ian?\u201d I asked, sniffing and dabbing gingerly at my swollen nose.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cCome and sit yourself down, Auntie\u2014I\u2019ll fetch it.\u201d</p><p>I followed him inside, filled the coffeepot and set it to brew, then sat at the table, the sun on my back through the open door, and watched as Ian rummaged the pantry. My mind felt soggy and incapable of thought, but a sense of peace crept over me, gentle as the wavering light through the chestnut trees. Even the small throbbings here and there seemed pleasant, a sense of healing being quietly accomplished.</p><p>Ian spread an armload of random foodstuffs on the table and sat down across from me.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Auntie?\u201d he asked again, raising one of his father\u2019s feathery eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s rather like sitting on a soap bubble, though. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d I glanced at him as I poured the coffee, but he looked down at the chunk of bread he was buttering. I thought a slight smile touched his lips, but couldn\u2019t tell for sure.</p><p>\u201cSomething like,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>The heat of the coffee warmed my hands through the china, and soothed the raw membranes of my nose and palate. I felt as though I had been screaming for hours, but didn\u2019t recall actually doing any such thing. Had I, with Jamie the night before?</p><p>I didn\u2019t quite want to think about the night before; it was part of the soap-bubble feeling. Jamie had been gone when I woke, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was glad or sorry about that.</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t talk, but ate his way in a businesslike manner through half a loaf with butter and honey, three raisin muffins, two thick slices of ham, and a jug of milk. Jamie had done the milking, I saw; he always used the blue jug, while Mr. Wemyss used the white one. I wondered vaguely where Mr. Wemyss was\u2014I hadn\u2019t seen him, and the house felt empty\u2014but didn\u2019t really care. It occurred to me that perhaps Jamie had told both Mr. Wemyss and Mrs. Bug to stay away for a bit, feeling that I might need a little time alone.</p><p>\u201cMore coffee, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>At my nod, Ian rose from the table, reached down the decanter from the shelf, and poured a large slug of whisky into my cup before refilling it.</p><p>\u201cMam always said it\u2019s good for what ails ye,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is right. Do you want some?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed at the aromatic fumes, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think not, Auntie. I must have a clear head this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d The porridge in the pot wasn\u2019t nine days old\u2014quite\u2014but it had been there for three or four. Of course; no one had been here to eat it. I eyed the cementlike glob adhering to my spoon critically, then decided that it was still soft enough to eat, and doused it with honey.</p><p>Ian was dealing with a mouthful of the same substance, and took a moment to clear it from his palate before replying.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie means to ask his questions,\u201d he answered, giving me a cautious glance as he reached for the bread.</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d I said, rather blankly, but before I could inquire what he meant by that, the sound of footsteps on the path announced the arrival of Fergus.</p><p>He looked as though he had been sleeping in the woods\u2014well, of course, I thought, he had been. Or rather, not sleeping; the men had barely stopped to rest in their pursuit of Hodgepile\u2019s gang. Fergus had shaved, but his normally fastidious grooming was sadly lacking, and his handsome face was gaunt, the deep eyes shadowed.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d he murmured, and unexpectedly bent to kiss my cheek, hand on my shoulder. \u201cComment \u00e7a va?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTres bien, merci,\u201d I replied, smiling gingerly. \u201cHow are Marsali and the children? And our hero, Germain?\u201d I had asked Jamie about Marsali on the way back, and had been assured that she was all right. Germain, monkey that he was, had gone straight up a tree when he heard Hodgepile\u2019s men approaching. He had seen everything from his perch, and as soon as the men departed, had scrambled down, dragged his semiconscious mother away from the fire, and run for help.</p><p>\u201cAh, Germain,\u201d Fergus said, a faint smile momentarily lifting the shadows of fatigue. \u201cNous p\u2019tit guerrier. He says Grandp\u00e8re has promised him a pistol of his own, to shoot bad people with.\u201d</p><p>Grandp\u00e8re undoubtedly meant it, I reflected. Germain couldn\u2019t manage a musket, being somewhat shorter than the gun itself\u2014but a pistol would do. In my present state of mind, the fact that Germain was only six didn\u2019t seem particularly important.</p><p>\u201cHave you had breakfast, Fergus?\u201d I pushed the pot toward him.</p><p>\u201cNon. Merci.\u201d He helped himself to cold biscuit, ham, and coffee, though I noticed that he ate without much appetite.</p><p>We all sat quietly, sipping coffee and listening to the birds. Carolina wrens had built a late nest under the eaves of the house and the parent birds swooped in and out, just above our heads. I could hear the high-pitched cheeping of the nestlings begging, and saw a scatter of twigs and a bit of empty eggshell on the floorboards of the porch. They were nearly ready to fledge; just in time, before the real cold weather came.</p><p>The sight of the brown-speckled eggshell reminded me of Monsieur le Oeuf. Yes, that\u2019s what I would do, I decided, with a small sense of relief at having something firm in mind. I would go and see Marsali later. And perhaps Mrs. Bug, as well.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Mrs. Bug this morning?\u201d I asked, turning to Ian. His cabin\u2014little more than a brush-roofed lean-to\u2014lay just beyond the Bugs\u2019; he would have passed them on his way to the house.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, looking a little surprised. \u201cShe was sweeping out as I went by. Offered me breakfast, but I said I\u2019d eat here. I kent Uncle Jamie had a ham, aye?\u201d He grinned, lifting his fourth ham biscuit in illustration.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s all right? I thought she might be ill; she usually comes quite early.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, and took an enormous bite of the biscuit.</p><p>\u201cAye, I expect she\u2019s busy, minding the ciomach.\u201d</p><p>My fragile sense of well-being cracked like the wrens\u2019 eggs. A ciomach was a captive. In my soggy-minded euphoria, I had somehow managed to forget Lionel Brown\u2019s existence.</p><p>Ian\u2019s remark that Jamie meant to ask questions this morning dropped suddenly into context\u2014as did Fergus\u2019s presence. And the knife Ian had been sharpening.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jamie?\u201d I asked, rather faintly. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Ian said, looking surprised. He swallowed, and gestured toward the door with his chin. \u201cHe\u2019s just out in the woodshed, makin\u2019 new shingles. He says the roof\u2019s sprung a leak.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had he said this than the sound of hammering came from the roof, far above. Of course, I thought. First things first. But then, I supposed Lionel Brown wasn\u2019t going anywhere, after all.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps . . . I should go and see Mr. Brown,\u201d I said, swallowing.</p><p>Ian and Fergus exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cNo, Auntie, ye shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ian said quite calmly, but with an air of authority I wasn\u2019t accustomed to seeing in him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d I stared at him, but he merely went on eating, though a trifle more slowly.</p><p>\u201cMilord says you should not,\u201d Fergus amplified, drizzling a spoonful of honey into his coffee.</p><p>\u201cHe says what?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>Neither of them would look at me, but they seemed to draw together, emanating a reluctant sort of stubborn resistance. Either one would do anything I asked, I knew\u2014except defy Jamie. If Jamie thought I ought not to see Mr. Brown, I wasn\u2019t going to do it with the assistance of either Ian or Fergus.</p><p>I dropped the spoon back into my bowl of porridge, uneaten lumps still adhering to it.</p><p>\u201cDid he happen to mention why he thinks I ought not to visit Mr. Brown?\u201d I asked calmly, under the circumstances.</p><p>Both men looked surprised, then exchanged another look, this one longer.</p><p>\u201cNo, milady,\u201d Fergus said, his voice carefully neutral.</p><p>There was a brief silence, during which both of them seemed to be considering. Then Fergus glanced at Ian, deferring to him with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWell, d\u2019ye see, Auntie,\u201d Ian said carefully, \u201cwe do mean to question the fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will have answers,\u201d Fergus said, eyes on the spoon with which he was stirring his coffee.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Uncle Jamie is satisfied that he has told us what he can . . .\u201d</p><p>Ian had laid his newly sharpened knife on the table beside his plate. He picked it up, and thoughtfully drew it down the length of a cold sausage, which promptly split open, with an aromatic burst of sage and garlic. He looked up then, and met my eyes directly. And I realized that while I might still be me\u2014Ian was no longer the boy he used to be. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill him, then?\u201d I said, my lips feeling numb in spite of the hot coffee.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Fergus said very softly. \u201cI expect that we shall.\u201d He met my eyes now, too. There was a bleak, grim look about him, and his deep-set eyes were hard as stone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014it\u2014I mean . . . it wasn\u2019t him,\u201d I said. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been. He\u2019d already broken his leg when\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t seem to have enough air to finish my sentences. \u201cAnd Marsali. It wasn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think he . . .\u201d</p><p>Something behind Ian\u2019s eyes changed, as he grasped my meaning. His lips pressed tight for a moment, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs well for him, then,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cAs well,\u201d Fergus echoed, \u201cbut I think it will not matter in the end. We killed the others\u2014why should he live?\u201d He pushed back from the table, leaving his coffee undrunk. \u201cI think I will go, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? I\u2019ll come too, then.\u201d Ian shoved his plate away, nodding to me. \u201cWill ye tell Uncle Jamie we\u2019ve gone ahead, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>I nodded numbly, and watched them go, vanishing one after the other under the big chestnut tree that overhung the trail leading to the Bugs\u2019 cabin. Mechanically, I got up and began slowly to clear away the remains of the makeshift breakfast.</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t sure whether I minded a lot about Mr. Brown or not. On the one hand, I did disapprove on principle of torture and cold-blooded murder. On the other . . . while it was true enough that Brown had not personally violated or injured me, and he had tried to make Hodgepile release me\u2014he\u2019d been all in favor of killing me, later. And I hadn\u2019t the slightest doubt that he would have drowned me in the gorge, had Tebbe not intervened.</p><p>No, I thought, carefully rinsing my cup and drying it on my apron, perhaps I didn\u2019t really mind terribly about Mr. Brown.</p><p>Still, I felt uneasy and upset. What I did mind about, I realized, were Ian and Fergus. And Jamie. The fact was, killing someone in the heat of battle is a quite different thing from executing a man, and I knew that. Did they?</p><p>Well, Jamie did.</p><p>\u201cAnd may your vow redeem me.\u201d He had whispered that to me, the night before. It was just about the last thing I recalled him saying, in fact. Well, all right; but I would greatly prefer that he didn\u2019t feel in need of redemption to start with. And as for Ian and Fergus . . .</p><p>Fergus had fought in the Battle of Prestonpans, at the age of ten. I still remembered the face of the small French orphan, soot-smeared and dazed with shock and exhaustion, looking down at me from his perch atop a captured cannon. \u201cI killed an English soldier, madame,\u201d he\u2019d said to me. \u201cHe fell down and I stuck him with my knife.\u201d</p><p>And Ian, a fifteen-year-old, weeping in remorse because he thought he had accidentally killed an intruder to Jamie\u2019s Edinburgh print shop. God knew what he had done, since; he wasn\u2019t talking. I had a sudden vision of Fergus\u2019s hook, dark with blood, and Ian, silhouetted in the dark. \u201cAnd I,\u201d he\u2019d said, echoing Jamie. \u201cIt is myself who kills for her.\u201d</p><p>It was 1773. And on the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five . . . the shot heard round the world was already being loaded. The room was warm, but I shuddered convulsively. What in the name of God did I think I could shield them from? Any of them.</p><p>A sudden roar from the roof above startled me out of my thoughts.</p><p>I walked out into the dooryard and looked up, shading my eyes against the morning sun. Jamie was sitting astride the rooftree, rocking to and fro over one hand, which he held curled into his belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on up there?\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a splinter,\u201d came the terse answer, obviously spoken through clenched teeth.</p><p>I wanted to laugh, if only as small escape from tension, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWell, come down, then. I\u2019ll pull it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no finished!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d I said, suddenly impatient with him. \u201cCome down this minute. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>A bag of nails hit the grass with a sudden clank, followed instantly by the hammer.</p><p>First things first, then.</p><p>TECHNICALLY, I SUPPOSED, it was a splinter. It was a two-inch sliver of cedarwood, and he\u2019d driven it completely under the nail of his middle finger, nearly to the first joint.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he agreed, looking a little pale. \u201cYe might say that.\u201d</p><p>The protruding stub was too short to grip with my fingers. I hauled him into the surgery and jerked the sliver out with forceps, before one could say Jack Robinson. Jamie was saying a good deal more than Jack Robinson\u2014mostly in French, which is an excellent language for swearing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose that nail,\u201d I observed, submerging the offended digit in a small bowl of alcohol and water. Blood bloomed from it like ink from a squid.</p><p>\u201cTo hell wi\u2019 the nail,\u201d he said, gritting his teeth. \u201cCut the whole bloody finger off and ha\u2019 done with it! Merde d\u2019chevre!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Chinese used to\u2014well, no, I suppose they still do, come to think of it\u2014shove splinters of bamboo under people\u2019s fingernails to make them talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist! Tu me casses les couilles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously a very effective technique,\u201d I said, lifting his hand out of the bowl and wrapping the finger tightly in a strip of linen. \u201cWere you trying it out, before using it on Lionel Brown?\u201d I tried to speak lightly, keeping my eyes on his hand. I felt his own gaze fix on me, and he snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of saints and archangels was wee Ian telling ye, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you meant to question the man\u2014and get answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and I shall,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus and Ian seemed to think that\u2014you might be moved to use any means necessary,\u201d I said with some delicacy. \u201cThey\u2019re more than willing to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they are.\u201d The first agony had abated somewhat. He breathed more deeply, and color was beginning to come back into his face. \u201cFergus has a right. It was his wife attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan seemed . . .\u201d I hesitated, searching for the right word. Ian had seemed so calm as to be terrifying. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call Roger to help with the\u2014the questioning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d One corner of his mouth tucked in. \u201cRoger Mac\u2019s a good fighter, but no the sort to scare a man, save he\u2019s truly roused. He\u2019s no deceit in him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereas you, Ian, and Fergus . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWily as snakes, the lot of us. Ye\u2019ve only to look at Roger Mac to see how safe their time must be, him and the lass. A bit of a comfort, that,\u201d he added, the tuck growing deeper. \u201cTo ken things will get better, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I could see that he was trying to change the subject, which was not a good sign. I made a small snorting noise, but it hurt my nose.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not truly roused, is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>He made a much more successful snorting noise, but didn\u2019t reply. He tilted his head to one side, watching as I laid out a square of gauze and began to rub dried leaves of comfrey into it. I didn\u2019t know how to say what was troubling me, but he plainly saw that something was.</p><p>\u201cWill you kill him?\u201d I asked baldly, keeping my eyes on the jar of honey. It was made of brown glass, and the light glowed through it as though it were a huge ball of clear amber.</p><p>Jamie sat still, watching me. I could feel his speculative gaze, though I didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he said.</p><p>My hands had started to tremble, and I pressed them on the surface of the table to still them.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I kill him, I shall do it properly.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know what constituted a proper killing, in his opinion, but he told me anyway.</p><p>\u201cIf he dies at my hand, it will be in the open, before witnesses who ken the truth of the matter, and him standing upright. I willna have it said that I killed a helpless man, whatever his crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I swallowed, feeling mildly ill, and took a pinch of powdered bloodroot to add to the salve I was making. It had a faint, astringent smell, which seemed to help. \u201cBut\u2014you might let him live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I suppose I might ransom him to his brother\u2014depending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know, you sound quite like your uncle Colum. He would have thought it through like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d The corner of his mouth turned up slightly. \u201cShall I take that as compliment, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you might as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said thoughtfully. The stiff fingers tapped on the tabletop, and he winced slightly as the movement jarred the injured one. \u201cColum had a castle. And armed clansmen at his beck. I should have some difficulty in defending this house against a raid, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you mean by \u2018depending\u2019?\u201d I felt quite uneasy at this; the thought of armed raiders attacking the house had not occurred to me\u2014and I saw that Jamie\u2019s forethought in storing Mr. Brown off our premises had perhaps not been entirely for the purpose of sparing my sensibilities.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things.\u201d</p><p>I mixed a bit of honey with my powdered herbs, then scooped a small dollop of purified bear grease into the mortar.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d I said, eyes on my mixing, \u201cthat there\u2019s no point in turning Lionel Brown over to the\u2014the authorities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich authorities did ye have in mind, Sassenach?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>A good question. This part of the backcountry had not yet formed nor joined a county, though a movement was afoot to that purpose. Were Jamie to deliver Mr. Brown to the sheriff of the nearest county for trial . . . well, no, perhaps not a good idea. Brownsville lay just within the borders of the nearest county, and the current sheriff was in fact named Brown.</p><p>I bit my lip, considering. In times of stress, I tended still to respond as what I was\u2014a civilized Englishwoman, accustomed to rely on the sureties of government and law. Well, all right, Jamie had a point; the twentieth century had its own dangers, but some things had improved. This was nearly 1774, though, and the colonial government was already showing cracks and fault lines, signs of the collapse to come.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we could take him to Cross Creek.\u201d Farquard Campbell was a justice of the peace there\u2014and a friend to Jamie\u2019s aunt, Jocasta Cameron. \u201cOr to New Bern.\u201d Governor Martin and the bulk of the Royal Council were in New Bern\u2014three hundred miles away. \u201cMaybe Hillsborough?\u201d That was the center of the Circuit Court.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p><p>This noise denoted a marked disinclination to lose several weeks\u2019 work in order to haul Mr. Brown before any of these seats of justice, let alone entrust a matter of importance to the highly unreliable\u2014and frequently corrupt\u2014judicial system. I looked up and met his eye, humorous but bleak. If I responded as what I was, so did Jamie.</p><p>And Jamie was a Highland laird, accustomed to follow his own laws, and fight his own battles.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said quite gently. \u201cWhat of the others?\u201d</p><p>The others. I stopped moving, paralyzed by the sudden memory: a large band of black figures, coming out of the wood with the sun behind them. But that group had split in two, intending to meet again in Brownsville, in three days\u2019 time\u2014today, in fact.</p><p>For the moment, presumably no one from Brownsville yet knew what had happened\u2014that Hodgepile and his men were dead, or that Lionel Brown was now a captive on the Ridge. Given the speed with which news spread in the mountains, though, it would be public knowledge within a week.</p><p>In the aftermath of shock, I had somehow overlooked the fact that there were still a number of bandits at large\u2014and while I didn\u2019t know who they were, they knew both who I was and where I was. Would they realize that I could not identify them? Or be willing to take that risk?</p><p>Obviously, Jamie was not willing to take the risk of leaving the Ridge to escort Lionel Brown anywhere, whether or not he decided to let the man live.</p><p>The thought of the others had brought something important back to me, though. It might not be the best time to mention it, but then again, there wasn\u2019t going to be a good one.</p><p>I took a deep breath, squaring myself for it.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d</p><p>The tone of my voice jerked him immediately from whatever he\u2019d been thinking; he looked sharply at me, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>He paled a little, but reached out at once, grasping my hand. He took a deep breath of his own, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, realizing that he thought I meant that I had suddenly arrived at a point where I needed to tell him the grisly details of my experiences. \u201cNot\u2014not that. Not exactly.\u201d I squeezed his hand, though, and held on, while I told him about Donner.</p><p>\u201cAnother,\u201d he said. He sounded slightly stunned. \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother,\u201d I confirmed. \u201cThe thing is . . . I, um, I don\u2019t remember seeing him . . . seeing him dead.\u201d The eerie sense of that dawn returned to me. I had very sharp, distinct memories\u2014but they were disjointed, so fractured as to bear no relation to the whole. An ear. I remembered an ear, thick and cup-shaped as a woodland fungus. It was shaded in the most exquisite tones of purple, brown, and indigo, shadowed in the carved whorls of the inner parts, nearly translucent at the rim; perfect in the light of a sunbeam that cut through the fronds of a hemlock to touch it.</p><p>I recalled that ear so perfectly that I could almost reach into my memory and touch it myself\u2014but I had no idea whose ear it had been. Was the hair that lay behind it brown, black, reddish, straight, wavy, gray? And the face . . . I didn\u2019t know. If I had looked, I hadn\u2019t seen.</p><p>He shot me a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye think he\u2019s maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d I swallowed the taste of dust, pine needles, and blood, and breathed the comforting fresh scent of buttermilk. \u201cI warned him, you see. I told him you were coming, and that he didn\u2019t want you to find him with me. When you attacked the camp\u2014he might have run. He struck me as a coward, certainly. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cCan you . . . recall, do you think?\u201d I asked hesitantly. \u201cWhen you showed me the dead. Did you look at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI wasna looking at anything save you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had been on our linked hands. He raised them now, and looked at my face, troubled and searching. I lifted his hand and laid my cheek against his knuckles, closing my eyes for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said. \u201cThe thing is\u2014\u201d I said, and stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he did run\u2014where do you suppose he\u2019d go?\u201d</p><p>He closed his own eyes and drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cTo Brownsville,\u201d he said, in resignation. \u201cAnd if he did, Richard Brown kens already what\u2019s become of Hodgepile and his men\u2014and likely thinks his brother is dead, as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I swallowed, and changed the subject slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell Ian I wasn\u2019t to be allowed to see Mr. Brown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didna say that. But I think it best if ye dinna see him, that much is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ye\u2019ve an oath upon you,\u201d he said, sounding mildly surprised that I didn\u2019t understand immediately. \u201cCan ye see a man injured, and leave him to suffer?\u201d</p> <p>The ointment was ready. I unwrapped his finger, which had stopped bleeding, and tamped as much of the salve under the damaged nail as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said, eyes on my work. \u201cBut why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf ye mend him, care for him\u2014and then I decide he must die?\u201d His eyes rested on me, questioning. \u201cHow would that be for ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be a bit awkward,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself. I wrapped a thin strip of linen around the nail and tied it neatly. \u201cStill, though . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe wish to care for him? Why?\u201d He sounded curious, but not angry. \u201cIs your oath so strong, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I put both hands on the table to brace myself; my knees seemed suddenly weak.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m glad they\u2019re dead,\u201d I whispered, looking down. My hands were raw, and I fumbled while I worked because my fingers were still swollen; there were deep purple marks still sunk in the skin of my wrists. \u201cAnd I am very much\u2014\u201d What? Afraid; afraid of the men, afraid of myself. Thrilled, in a horrible sort of way. \u201cAshamed,\u201d I said. \u201cTerribly ashamed.\u201d I glanced up at him. \u201cI hate it.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand to me, waiting. He knew better than to touch me; I couldn\u2019t have borne being touched just then. I didn\u2019t take it, not at once, though I longed to. I looked away, speaking rapidly to Adso, who had materialized on the countertop and was regarding me with a bottomless green gaze.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2014I keep thinking . . . if I were to see him, help him\u2014Christ, I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t at all! But if I could\u2014perhaps that would . . . help somehow.\u201d I looked up then, feeling haunted. \u201cMake . . . amends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being glad they are dead\u2014and for wanting him dead, too?\u201d Jamie suggested gently.</p><p>I nodded, feeling as though a small, heavy weight had lifted with the speaking of the words. I didn\u2019t remember taking his hand, but it was tight on mine. Blood from his finger was seeping through the fresh bandage, but he paid no attention.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to kill him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me for a long moment before replying.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cBut for now, his life is surety for yours. For all of us, perhaps. And so he lives. For now. But I will ask questions\u2014and I shall have answers.\u201d</p> <p>I SAT IN MY SURGERY for some time after he left. Emerging slowly from shock, I had felt safe, surrounded by home and friends, by Jamie. Now I must come to grips with the fact that nothing was safe\u2014not I, not home nor friends\u2014and certainly not Jamie.</p><p>\u201cBut then, you never are, are you, you bloody Scot?\u201d I said aloud, and laughed, weakly.</p><p>Feeble as it was, it made me feel better. I rose with sudden decision and began to tidy my cupboards, lining up bottles in order of size, sweeping out bits of scattered herbs, throwing away solutions gone stale or suspect.</p><p>I had meant to go and visit Marsali, but Fergus had told me during breakfast that Jamie had sent her with the children and Lizzie to stay with the McGillivrays, where she would be cared for, and safe. If there was safety in numbers, the McGillivrays\u2019 house was certainly the place for it.</p><p>Located near Woolam\u2019s Creek, the McGillivrays\u2019 home place adjoined Ronnie Sinclair\u2019s cooper\u2019s shop, and enclosed a seething mass of cordial humanity, including not only Robin and Ute McGillivray, their son, Manfred, and their daughter Senga, but also Ronnie, who boarded with them. The usual mob scene was augmented intermittently by Senga McGillivray\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Heinrich Strasse, and his German relatives from Salem, and by Inga and Hilda, their husbands and children, and their husbands\u2019 relatives.</p><p>Add in the men who congregated daily in Ronnie\u2019s shop, a convenient stopping place on the road to and from Woolam\u2019s Mill, and likely no one would even notice Marsali and her family, in the midst of that mob. Surely no one would seek to harm her there. But for me to go and see her . . .</p><p>Highland tact and delicacy were one thing. Highland hospitality and curiosity were another. If I stayed peacefully at home, I would likely be left in peace\u2014at least for a while. If I were to set foot near the McGillivrays\u2019 . . . I blenched at the thought, and hastily decided that perhaps I would visit Marsali tomorrow. Or the next day. Jamie had assured me she was all right, only shocked and bruised.</p><p>The house stood around me in peace. No modern background of furnace, fans, plumbing, refrigerators. No whoosh of pilot lights or hum of compressors. Just the occasional creak of beam or floorboard, and the odd muffled scrape of a wood wasp building its nest up under the eaves.</p><p>I looked round the ordered world of my surgery\u2014ranks of shining jars and bottles, linen screens laden with drying arrowroot and masses of lavender, bunches of nettle and yarrow and rosemary hanging overhead. The bottle of ether, sunlight glowing on it. Adso curled on the countertop, tail neatly tucked around his feet, eyes half-closed in purring contemplation.</p><p>Home. A small shiver ran down my spine. I wanted nothing more than to be alone, safe and alone, in my own home.</p><p>Safe. I had a day, perhaps two, in which home would still be safe. And then . . .</p><p>I realized that I had been standing still for some moments, staring blankly into a box of yellow nightshade berries, round and shiny as marbles. Very poisonous, and a slow and painful death. My eyes rose to the ether\u2014quick and merciful. If Jamie did decide to kill Lionel Brown . . . But no. In the open, he\u2019d said, standing on his feet before witnesses. Slowly, I closed the box and put it back on the shelf.</p><p>What then?</p><p>THERE WERE ALWAYS chores that could be done\u2014but nothing pressing, with no one clamoring to be fed, clothed, or cared for. Feeling quite odd, I wandered round the house for a bit, and finally went into Jamie\u2019s study, where I poked among the books on the shelf there, settling at last on Henry Fielding\u2019s Tom Jones.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think how long it had been since I had read a novel. And in the daytime! Feeling pleasantly wicked, I sat by the open window in my surgery and resolutely entered a world far from my own.</p><p>I lost track of time, moving only to brush away roving insects that came through the window, or to absently scratch Adso\u2019s head when he nudged against me. Occasional thoughts of Jamie and Lionel Brown drifted through the back of my mind, but I shooed them away like the leafhoppers and midges who landed on my page, drifting in through the window. Whatever was happening in the Bugs\u2019 cabin had happened, or would happen\u2014I simply couldn\u2019t think about it. As I read, the soap bubble formed around me once more, filled with perfect stillness.</p><p>The sun was halfway down the sky before faint pangs of hunger began to stir. It was as I looked up, rubbing my forehead and wondering vaguely whether there was any ham left, that I saw a man standing in the doorway to the surgery.</p><p>I shrieked, and leaped to my feet, sending Henry Fielding flying.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, mistress!\u201d Thomas Christie blurted, looking nearly as startled as I felt. \u201cI didna realize that you\u2019d not heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014I\u2014was reading.\u201d I gestured foolishly toward the book on the floor. My heart was pounding, and blood surged to and fro in my body, seemingly at random, so that my face flushed, my ears throbbed, and my hands tingled, all out of control.</p><p>He stooped and picked the book up, smoothing its cover with the careful attitude of one who values books, though the volume itself was battered, its cover scarred with rings where wet glasses or bottles had been set down upon it. Jamie had got it from the owner of an ordinary in Cross Creek, in partial trade for a load of firewood; some customer had left it, months before.</p><p>\u201cIs there no one here to care for you?\u201d he asked, frowning as he looked around. \u201cShall I go and fetch my daughter to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean\u2014I don\u2019t need anyone. I\u2019m quite all right. What about you?\u201d I asked quickly, forestalling any further expressions of concern on his part. He glanced at my face, then hastily away. Eyes fixed carefully in the vicinity of my collarbone, he laid the book on the table and held out his right hand, wrapped in a cloth.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, mistress. I wouldna intrude, save . . .\u201d</p><p>I was already unwrapping the hand. He\u2019d ripped the incision in his right hand\u2014probably, I realized with a small tightening of the belly, in the course of the fight with the bandits. The wound was no great matter, but there were bits of dirt and debris in the wound, and the edges were red and gaping, raw surfaces clouded with a film of pus.</p><p>\u201cYou should have come at once,\u201d I said, though with no tone of rebuke. I knew perfectly well why he hadn\u2019t\u2014and in fact, I should have been in no state to deal with him, if he had.</p><p>He shrugged slightly, but didn\u2019t bother replying. I sat him down and went to fetch things. Luckily, there was some of the antiseptic salve left that I\u2019d made for Jamie\u2019s splinter. That, a quick alcohol wash, clean bandage . . .</p><p>He was turning the pages of Tom Jones slowly, lips pursed in concentration. Evidently Henry Fielding would do as anesthetic for the job at hand; I shouldn\u2019t need to fetch a Bible.</p><p>\u201cDo you read novels?\u201d I asked, meaning no rudeness, but merely surprised that he might countenance anything so frivolous.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes. I\u2014yes.\u201d He took a very deep breath as I submerged his hand in the bowl, but it contained only water, soaproot, and a very small amount of alcohol, and he let the breath go with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cHave you read Tom Jones before?\u201d I asked, making conversation to relax him.</p><p>\u201cNot precisely, though I know the story. My wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly. He\u2019d never mentioned his wife before; I supposed that it was sheer relief at not experiencing agony yet that had made him talkative. He seemed to realize that he must complete the sentence, though, and went on, reluctantly. \u201cMy wife . . . read novels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d I murmured, setting about the job of debridement. \u201cDid she like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that she must have.\u201d</p><p>There was something odd in his voice that made me glance up from the job at hand. He caught the glance and looked away, flushing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014did not approve of reading novels. Then.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, holding his hand steady. Then he blurted, \u201cI burnt her books.\u201d</p><p>That sounded rather more like the response I would have expected of him.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been pleased about that,\u201d I said mildly, and he shot me a startled glance, as though the question of his wife\u2019s reaction was so irrelevant as to be unworthy of remark.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . what caused you to alter your opinion?\u201d I asked, concentrating on the bits of debris I was picking out of the wound with my forceps. Splinters and shreds of bark. What had he been doing? Wielding a club of some kind, I thought\u2014a tree branch? I breathed deeply, concentrating on the job to avoid thinking of the bodies in the clearing.</p><p>He moved his legs restively; I was hurting him a bit now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014it\u2014in Ardsmuir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You read it in prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We had no books there.\u201d He took a long breath, glanced at me, then away, and fixed his eyes on the corner of the room, where an enterprising spider had taken advantage of Mrs. Bug\u2019s temporary absence to set up web-keeping.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I have never actually read it. Mr. Fraser, though, was accustomed to recount the story to the other prisoners. He has a fine memory,\u201d he added, rather grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stitch it; it will be better if the wound\u2019s left to heal by itself. I\u2019m afraid the scar won\u2019t be as neat,\u201d I added regretfully, \u201cbut I think it will heal up all right.\u201d</p><p>I spread salve thickly over the injury, and pulled the edges of the wound together as tightly as I could, without cutting off the circulation. Bree had been experimenting with adhesive bandages, and had produced something quite useful in the way of small butterfly shapes, made of starched linen and pine tar.</p><p>\u201cSo you liked Tom Jones, did you?\u201d I said, returning to the subject. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d find him an admirable character. Not much of a moral example, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cBut I saw that fiction\u201d\u2014he pronounced the word gingerly, as though it were something dangerous\u2014\u201cis perhaps not, as I had thought, merely an inducement to idleness and wicked fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said, amused, but trying not to smile because of my lip. \u201cWhat are its redeeming characteristics, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d His brows drew together in thought \u201cI found it most remarkable. That what is essentially nothing save a confection of lies should somewise still contrive to exert a beneficial effect. For it did,\u201d he concluded, sounding still rather surprised.</p><p>\u201cReally? How was that?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, considering.</p><p>\u201cIt was distraction, to be sure. In such conditions, distraction is not evil,\u201d he assured me. \u201cWhile it is of course more desirable to escape into prayer . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut beyond that consideration . . . it drew the men together. You would not think that such men\u2014Highlanders, crofters\u2014that they would find themselves in particular sympathy with . . . such situations, such persons.\u201d He waved his free hand at the book, indicating such persons as Squire Allworthy and Lady Bellaston, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cBut they would talk it over for hours\u2014whilst we labored the next day, they would wonder why Ensign Northerton had done as he had with regard to Miss Western, and argue whether they themselves would or would not have behaved so.\u201d His face lightened a little, recalling something. \u201cAnd invariably, a man would shake his head and say, \u2018At least I\u2019ve never been treated in that manner!\u2019 He might be starved, cold, covered in sores, permanently separated from his family and customary circumstances\u2014and yet he could take comfort in never having suffered such vicissitudes as had befallen these imaginary beings!\u201d</p><p>He actually smiled, shaking his head at the thought, and I thought the smile much improved him.</p><p>I\u2019d finished the job, and laid his hand on the table.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He looked startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that that injury was perhaps the result of b-battle done on my behalf,\u201d I said. I touched his hand lightly. \u201cI, er . . . well.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looked thoroughly taken aback at this, and quite embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI . . . erm . . . hmm!\u201d He pushed back the stool and rose, looking flustered.</p><p>I rose, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to have fresh salve put on every day,\u201d I said, resuming a businesslike tone. \u201cI\u2019ll make up some more; you can come, or send Malva to fetch it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but said nothing, having evidently exhausted his supply of sociability for the day. I saw his eye linger on the cover of the book, though, and on impulse offered it to him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to borrow it? You should really read it for yourself; I\u2019m sure Jamie can\u2019t have recalled all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d He looked startled, and pursed his lips, frowning, as though suspecting it was a trap of some sort. When I insisted, though, he took the book, picking it up with an expression of guarded avidity that made me wonder how long it had been since he had had any book other than the Bible to read.</p><p>He nodded thanks to me, and donned his hat, turning to go. Upon a moment\u2019s impulse, I asked, \u201cDid you ever have the chance to apologize to your wife?\u201d</p><p>That was a mistake. His face tightened into coldness and his eyes went flat as a snake\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly. I thought for a moment that he would put the book down and refuse to take it. But instead, he tightened his lips, tucked the volume more securely under his arm, and left, without further farewell.</p><p>31</p><p>AND SO TO BED</p><p>NO ONE ELSE CAME. By the time night fell, I was beginning to feel rather edgy, starting at noises, searching the deepening shadows under the chestnut trees for lurking men\u2014or worse. I thought I should cook something; surely Jamie and Ian intended coming home for supper? Or perhaps I should go down to the cabin, join Roger and Bree.</p><p>But I flinched from the notion of being exposed to any kind of solicitude, no matter how well meant, and while I hadn\u2019t yet got up the nerve to look in a mirror, was reasonably sure that the sight of me would frighten Jemmy\u2014or at least lead to a lot of questions. I didn\u2019t want to have to try to explain to him what had happened to me. I was fairly sure that Jamie had told Brianna to stay away for a bit, and that was good. I really was in no shape to pretend to be all right. Not quite yet.</p><p>Dithering round the kitchen, I picked things up and put them down pointlessly. I opened the drawers of the sideboard and closed them\u2014then opened the second one again, the one where Jamie kept his pistols.</p><p>Most of the pistols were gone. Only the gilt-trimmed one that didn\u2019t shoot straight was left, with a few loads and a tiny powder horn, the sort made for fancy dueling pistols.</p><p>Hands shaking only a little, I loaded it, and poured a bit of powder into the firing pan.</p><p>When the back door opened, quite some time later, I was sitting at the table, a copy of Don Quixote lying in front of me, pointing the pistol with both hands at the door.</p><p>Ian froze momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d never hit anyone wi\u2019 that gun at this distance, Auntie,\u201d he said mildly, coming in.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t know that, would they?\u201d I set the pistol down, gingerly. My palms were damp, and my fingers ached.</p><p>He nodded, taking the point, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jamie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWashing. Are ye well, Auntie?\u201d His soft hazel eyes took a casual but careful estimation of my state.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll do.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cAnd . . . Mr. Brown? Did he\u2014tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>Ian made a derogatory noise.</p><p>\u201cPissed himself when Uncle Jamie took the dirk from his belt to clean his fingernails. We didna touch him, Auntie, dinna fash yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jamie came in then, clean-shaven, his skin cold and fresh from the well water, hair damp at his temples. Despite that, he looked tired to death, the lines of his face cut deep and his eyes shadowed. The shadows lifted a bit, though, when he saw me and the pistol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, a nighean,\u201d he said softly, touching my shoulder as he sat down beside me. \u201cI\u2019ve men set to watch the house\u2014just in case. Though I dinna expect any trouble for some days yet.\u201d</p><p>My breath went out in a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, surprised.</p><p>\u201cI thought ye\u2019d know. Surely ye wouldna think I\u2019d leave ye unprotected, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, momentarily unable to speak. Had I been in any condition to think logically, of course I wouldn\u2019t. As it was, I had spent most of the afternoon in a state of quiet\u2014and unnecessary\u2014terror, imagining, remembering. . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass,\u201d he said softly, and put a large, cold hand on mine. \u201cI shouldna have left ye alone. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but put my other hand over his, pressing tight.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right. I couldn\u2019t have borne any company, beyond Sancho Panza.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Don Quixote, then at me, brows raised. The book was in Spanish, which I didn\u2019t happen to speak.</p><p>\u201cWell, some of it was close to French, and I did know the story,\u201d I said. I took a deep breath, taking what comfort I could in the warmth of the fire, the flicker of the candle, and the proximity of the two of them, large, solid, pragmatic, and\u2014outwardly, at least\u2014imperturbable.</p><p>\u201cIs there any food, Auntie?\u201d Ian inquired, getting up to look. Lacking any appetite myself, and too jittery to focus on anything, I hadn\u2019t eaten dinner nor made anything for supper\u2014but there was always food in that house, and without any particular fuss, Jamie and Ian had equipped themselves in short order with the remains of a cold partridge pie, several hard-cooked eggs, a dish of piccalilli, and half a loaf of bread, which they sliced up and toasted over the fire on a fork, buttering the slices and cramming them into me in a manner brooking no argument.</p><p>Hot, buttered toast is immensely comforting, even nibbled tentatively with a sore jaw. With food in my stomach, I began to feel much calmer, and capable of inquiring what they had learned from Lionel Brown.</p><p>\u201cHe put it all on Hodgepile,\u201d Jamie told me, loading piccalilli onto a slice of pie. \u201cHe would, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t meet Arvin Hodgepile,\u201d I said, with a small shiver. \u201cEr . . . to talk to, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a sharp look, but didn\u2019t address that matter any further, instead leaving it to Ian to explain Lionel Brown\u2019s version of events.</p><p>It had started with him and his brother, Richard, establishing their Committee of Safety. This, he had insisted, was intended as public service, pure and simple. Jamie snorted at that, but didn\u2019t interrupt.</p><p>Most of the male inhabitants of Brownsville had joined the committee\u2014most of the homesteaders and small farmers nearby had not. Still, so far, so good. The committee had dealt with a number of small matters, meting out justice in cases of assault, theft, and the like, and if they had appropriated the odd hog or deer carcass by way of payment for their trouble, there hadn\u2019t been too much complaint.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of feeling still, about the Regulation,\u201d Ian explained, frowning as he sliced another piece of bread. \u201cThe Browns didna join the Regulation; they\u2019d no need to, as their cousin was sheriff, and half the courthouse ring are Browns, or marrit to Browns.\u201d Corruption, in other words, had been on their side.</p><p>Regulator sentiment still ran high in the backcountry, even though the main leaders of the movement, such as Hermon Husband and James Hunter, had left the colony. In the aftermath of Alamance, most Regulators had grown more cautious of expressing themselves\u2014but several Regulator families who lived near Brownsville had become vocal in their criticism of the Browns\u2019 influence on local politics and business.</p><p>\u201cTige O\u2019Brian was one of those?\u201d I asked, feeling the buttered toast coalesce into a small, hard lump in my stomach. Jamie had told me what had happened to the O\u2019Brians\u2014and I\u2019d seen Roger\u2019s face when he\u2019d come back.</p><p>Jamie nodded, not looking up from his pie.</p><p>\u201cEnter Arvin Hodgepile,\u201d he said, and took a ferocious bite. Hodgepile, having neatly escaped the constraints of the British army by pretending to die in the warehouse fire at Cross Creek, had set about making a living in various unsavory ways. And, water having a strong tendency to seek its own level, had ended up with a small gang of like-minded thugs.</p><p>This gang had begun simply enough, by robbing anyone they came across, holding up taverns, and the like. This sort of behavior tends to attract attention, though, and with various constables, sheriffs, Committees of Safety, and the like on their trail, the gang had retired from the piedmont where they began, and moved up into the mountains, where they could find isolated settlements and homesteads. They had also begun killing their victims, to avoid the nuisance of identification and pursuit.</p><p>\u201cOr most of them,\u201d Ian murmured. He regarded the half-eaten egg in his hand for a moment, then put it down.</p><p>In his career with the army in Cross Creek, Hodgepile had made various contacts with a number of river traders and coastal smugglers. Some dealt in furs, others in anything that would bring a profit.</p><p>\u201cAnd it occurred to them,\u201d Jamie said, drawing a deep breath, \u201cthat girls and women and young boys are more profitable than almost anything\u2014save whisky, maybe.\u201d The corner of his mouth twitched, but it wasn\u2019t a smile.</p><p>\u201cOur Mr. Brown insists he\u2019d nothing to do wi\u2019 this,\u201d Ian added, a cynical note in his voice. \u201cNor had his brother or their committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did the Browns get involved with Hodgepile\u2019s gang?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd what did they do with the people they kidnapped?\u201d</p><p>The answer to the first question was that it had been the happy outcome of a botched robbery.</p><p>\u201cYe recall Aaron Beardsley\u2019s auld place, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, wrinkling my nose in reflex at the memory of that wretched sty, then emitting a small cry and clapping both hands over my abused appendage.</p><p>Jamie glanced at me, and put another bit of bread on his toasting fork.</p><p>\u201cWell, so,\u201d he went on, ignoring my protest that I was full, \u201cthe Browns took it over, of course, when they adopted the wee lass. They cleaned it out, stocked it fresh, and went on using it as a trading post.\u201d</p><p>The Cherokee and Catawba had been accustomed to come to the place\u2014horrid as it was\u2014when Aaron Beardsley had operated as an Indian trader, and had continued to do business with the new management\u2014a very beneficial and profitable arrangement all round.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what Hodgepile saw,\u201d Ian put in. The Hodgepile gang, with their usual straightforward methods of doing business, had walked in, shot the couple in charge, and begun systematically looting the place. The couple\u2019s eleven-year-old daughter, who had fortunately been in the barn when the gang arrived, had slipped out, mounted a mule, and ridden hell-for-leather for Brownsville and help. By good fortune, she had encountered the Committee of Safety, returning from some errand, and brought them back in time to confront the robbers.</p><p>There then ensued what in later years would be called a Mexican standoff. The Browns had the house surrounded. Hodgepile, however, had Alicia Beardsley Brown\u2014the two-year-old girl who legally owned the trading post, and who had been adopted by the Browns upon the death of her putative father.</p><p>Hodgepile had enough food and ammunition inside the trading post to withstand a siege of weeks; the Browns were disinclined to set fire to their valuable property in order to drive him out, or to risk the girl\u2019s life by storming the place. After a day or two during which desultory shots were exchanged, and the members of the committee became increasingly edgy at having to camp in the woods surrounding the trading post, a flag of truce had been waved from the upper window, and Richard Brown had gone inside to parley with Hodgepile.</p><p>The result being a wary sort of merger. Hodgepile\u2019s gang would continue their operations, steering clear of any settlement under the Browns\u2019 protection, but would bring the proceeds of their robberies to the trading post, where they could be disposed of inconspicuously at a good profit, with Hodgepile\u2019s gang taking a generous cut.</p><p>\u201cThe proceeds,\u201d I said, accepting a fresh slice of buttered toast from Jamie. \u201cThat\u2014you do mean captives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d His lips pressed tight as he poured a mug of cider and handed it to me. \u201cAnd depending upon where they were. When they took captives in the mountains, some of them were sold to the Indians, through the trading post. Those they took from the piedmont, they sold to river pirates, or took to the coast to sell on to the Indies\u2014that would be the best price, aye? A fourteen-year-old lad would bring a hundred pound, at least.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My lips felt numb, and not only from the cider.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I said, appalled. \u201cHow many?\u201d Children, young men, young women, wrenched from their homes and sold cold-bloodedly into slavery. No one to follow. Even if they were somehow to escape eventually, there would be no place\u2014no one\u2014to return to.</p><p>Jamie sighed. He looked unutterably tired.</p><p>\u201cBrown doesna ken,\u201d Ian said quietly. \u201cHe says . . . He says he\u2019d nothing to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike bloody hell he hadn\u2019t,\u201d I said, a flash of fury momentarily eclipsing horror. \u201cHe was with Hodgepile when they came here. He knew they meant to take the whisky. And he must have been with them before, when they\u2014did other things.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe claims he tried to stop them from taking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cAnd then he tried to make them kill me, to stop me telling you he\u2019d been there. And then he bloody meant to drown me himself! I don\u2019t suppose he told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Ian exchanged a brief look with Jamie, and I saw some unspoken agreement pass between them. It occurred to me that I might possibly just have sealed Lionel Brown\u2019s fate. If so, I was not sure I felt guilty about it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2014what do you mean to do with him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps I will hang him,\u201d Jamie replied, after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cBut I\u2019ve more questions I want answered. And I must think about how best to manage the matter. Dinna bother about it, Sassenach; ye\u2019ll not see him again.\u201d</p><p>With that, he stood and stretched, muscles cracking, then shifted his shoulders, settling himself with a sigh. He gave me a hand and helped me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cGo up to bed, Sassenach, and I\u2019ll be up directly. I must just have a wee word with Ian first.\u201d</p><p>HOT BUTTERED TOAST, cider, and conversation had made me feel momentarily better. I found myself so tired, though, that I could barely drag myself up the stairs, and was obliged to sit on the bed, swaying blearily, in hopes of getting up the strength to take off my clothes. It was a few moments before I noticed that Jamie was hovering in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cErm . . . ?\u201d I said vaguely.</p> <p>\u201cI didna ken, did ye want me to stay with ye tonight?\u201d he asked diffidently. \u201cIf ye\u2019d rest better alone, I could take Joseph\u2019s bed. Or if ye\u2019d like, I could sleep beside ye, on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said blankly, trying to weigh these alternatives. \u201cNo. Stay. Sleep with me, I mean.\u201d From the bottom of a well of fatigue, I summoned something like a smile. \u201cYou can warm the bed, at least.\u201d</p><p>A most peculiar expression flitted across his face at that, and I blinked, not sure I\u2019d seen it. I had, though; his face was caught between embarrassment and dismayed amusement\u2014with somewhere behind all that the sort of look he might have worn if going to the stake: heroically resigned.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth have you been doing?\u201d I asked, sufficiently surprised as to be shaken out of my torpor.</p><p>Embarrassment was getting the upper hand; the tips of his ears were going red, and a flush was visible in his cheeks, even by the dim light of the taper I\u2019d set on the table.</p><p>\u201cI wasna going to tell ye,\u201d he muttered, avoiding my gaze. \u201cI swore wee Ian and Roger Mac to silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ve been silent as the grave,\u201d I assured him. Though this statement did perhaps explain the occasional odd look on Roger\u2019s face, of late. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, scraping the edge of his boot across the floor.</p> <p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s Tsisqua, d\u2019ye see? He meant it as hospitality, the first time, but then when Ian told him . . . well, it wasna the best thing to have said, under the circumstances, only . . . And then the next time we came, and there they were again, only a different pair, and when I tried to make them leave, they said Bird said to say that it was honor to my vow, for what good was a vow that cost nothing to keep? And I will be damned if I ken does he mean that, or is he only thinking that either I\u2019ll crack and he\u2019ll have the upper hand of me for good, or that I\u2019ll get him the guns he wants to put an end to it one way or the other\u2014or is he only having a joke at my expense? Even Ian says he canna tell which it is, and if he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He stole a quick glance at me, then looked away again.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . nak*d women,\u201d he blurted, and went red as a piece of new flannel.</p><p>I stared at him for a moment. My ears still buzzed slightly, but there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with my hearing. I pointed a finger at him\u2014carefully, because all my fingers were swollen and bruised.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said, in measured tones, \u201ccome here right now. Sit down right there\u201d\u2014I pointed at the bed beside me\u2014\u201cand tell me in words of one syllable exactly what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>He did, with the result that five minutes later I was lying flat on the bed, wheezing with laughter, moaning with the pain to my cracked ribs, and with helpless tears running down my temples and into my ears.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, oh, God, oh, God,\u201d I gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it, I really can\u2019t. Help me sit up.\u201d I extended a hand, yelped with pain as his fingers closed on my lacerated wrist, but got upright at last, bent over with a pillow clutched to my middle, and clutched it tighter each time a gust of recurrent laughter struck me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad ye think it\u2019s sae funny, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said very dryly. He\u2019d recovered himself to some extent, though his face was still flushed. \u201cYe\u2019re sure ye\u2019re no hysterical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d I sniffed, dabbing at my eyes with a damp linen hankie, then snorted with uncontainable mirth. \u201cOh! Ow, God, that hurts.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he poured a cup of water from the flask on the bedside table, and held it for me to drink. It was cool, but flat and rather stale; I thought perhaps it had been standing since before . . .</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, waving the cup away and dabbing moisture very carefully from my lips. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I breathed shallowly, feeling my heart begin to slow down. \u201cWell. So. At least now I know why you\u2019ve been coming back from the Cherokee villages in such a state of\u2014of\u2014\u201d I felt an unhinged giggle rising, and bent over, moaning as I stifled it. \u201cOh, Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ. And here I thought it was thoughts of me, driving you mad with lust.\u201d</p><p>He snorted then himself, though mildly. He put down the cup, rose, and turned back the coverlet. Then he looked at me, and his eyes were clear, unguarded.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said, quite gently, \u201cit was you. It\u2019s always been you, and it always will be. Get into bed, and put the candle out. As soon as I\u2019ve fastened the shutters, smoored the hearth, and barred the door, I\u2019ll come and keep ye warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKILL ME.\u201d Randall\u2019s eyes were fever-bright. \u201cKill me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart\u2019s desire.\u201d</p><p>He jerked awake, hearing the words echo in his head, seeing the eyes, seeing the rain-matted hair, Randall\u2019s face, wet as that of a drowned man.</p><p>He rubbed a hand hard over his own face, surprised to feel his skin dry, his beard no more than a shadow. The sense of wet, the itching scurf of a month\u2019s whiskers, was still so strong that he got up, moving quietly by instinct, and went to the window, where moonlight shone through the cracks in the shutter. He poured a little water into the basin, moved the bowl into a shaft of light, and looked in, to rid himself of that lingering sense of being someone else, somewhere else.</p><p>The face in the water was no more than a featureless oval, but smooth-shaven, and the hair lay loose on his shoulders, not bound up for battle. And yet it seemed the face of a stranger.</p><p>Unsettled, he left the water in the bowl, and after a moment, padded softly back to the bed.</p><p>She was asleep. He had not even thought of her when he woke, but now the sight of her steadied him. That face he knew, even battered and swollen as it was.</p><p>He set his hand on the bedstead, comforted by the solid wood. Sometimes when he woke, the dream stayed with him, and he felt the real world ghostly, faint around him. Sometimes he feared he was a ghost.</p><p>But the sheets were cool on his skin, and Claire\u2019s warmth a reassurance. He reached for her, and she rolled over, curled herself backward into his arms with a small moan of content, her bum roundly solid against him.</p><p>She fell asleep again at once; she hadn\u2019t really waked. He had an urge to rouse her, make her talk to him\u2014only to be quite sure she could see him, hear him. He only held her tight, though, and over her curly head he watched the door, as though it might open and Jack Randall stand there, soaked and streaming.</p><p>Kill me, he\u2019d said. My heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>His heart beat slow, echoing in the ear he pressed against the pillow. Some nights, he would fall asleep listening to it, comforted by the fleshy, monotonous thump. Other times, like now, he would hear instead the mortal silence in between the beats\u2014that silence that patiently awaits all men.</p><p>He had drawn the quilts up, but now put them back, so that Claire was covered but his own back lay bare, open to the chill of the room, that he might not slip warmly into sleep and risk returning to the dream. Let sleep struggle for him in the cold, and at last pull him off the precipice of consciousness, down to the deeps of black oblivion.</p><p>For he did not wish to know what Randall had meant by what he said.</p><p>32</p><p>HANGING\u2019S TOO GOOD</p><p>IN THE MORNING, Mrs. Bug was back in the kitchen, and the air was warm and fragrant with the smells of cooking. She seemed quite as usual, and beyond a brief glance at my face and a \u201ctsk!\u201d, not inclined to fuss. Either she had more sensitivity than I\u2019d thought, or Jamie had had a word.</p><p>\u201cHere, a muirninn, have it while it\u2019s hot.\u201d Mrs. Bug slid a heap of turkey hash from the platter onto my plate, and deftly topped it with a fried egg.</p><p>I nodded thanks and picked up my fork, with a certain lack of enthusiasm. My jaw was still so sore that eating was a slow and painful business.</p><p>The egg went down all right, but the smell of burned onion seemed very strong, oily in my nostrils. I separated a small bite of potato and mashed it against the roof of my mouth, squashing it with my tongue in lieu of chewing it, then washing it down with a sip of coffee.</p><p>More in hopes of distracting myself than because I truly wanted to know, I asked, \u201cAnd how is Mr. Brown this morning?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened, and she smacked down a spatula of fried potatoes as though they were Brown\u2019s brains.</p><p>\u201cNowhere near sae badly off as he ought to be,\u201d she said. \u201cHanging\u2019s too good for him, and him nay more than a wretched dungheap, crawling wi\u2019 maggots.\u201d</p><p>I spit out the bit of potato I\u2019d been mangling, and took another hasty gulp of coffee. It hit bottom and started back up. I pushed back the bench and ran for the door, reaching it just in time to throw up into the blackberry bush, retching coffee, bile, and fried egg.</p><p>I was dimly aware of Mrs. Bug, hovering anxiously in the doorway, and waved her away with one hand. She hesitated for a moment, but then went in again, as I stood up and started toward the well.</p><p>The entire inside of my head tasted of coffee and bile, and the back of my nose stung terribly. I felt as though my nose were bleeding again, but when I touched it gingerly, discovered that it wasn\u2019t. Careful swilling with water cleansed my mouth, and did a bit to remedy the nasty taste\u2014but nothing to drown the panic that had come in the wake of the nausea.</p><p>I had the sudden, distinct, and thoroughly bizarre impression that my skin was missing. My legs felt shaky, and I sat down on the stump where we split kindling, heedless of splinters.</p><p>I can\u2019t, I thought. I simply can\u2019t.</p><p>I sat on the chopping block, lacking the will to rise. I could feel my womb, very distinctly. A small, round weight at the base of my abdomen, feeling slightly swollen, very tender.</p><p>Nothing, I thought, with what determination I could muster. Entirely normal. It always feels that way, at a particular point of my cycle. And after what we had done, Jamie and I . . . well, no bloody wonder if I were still conscious of my interior workings. Granted, we hadn\u2019t, the night before; I\u2019d wanted nothing but to be held. On the other hand, I\u2019d nearly ruptured myself, laughing. A small laugh escaped me now, remembering Jamie\u2019s confession. It hurt, and I clutched my ribs, but felt a little better.</p><p>\u201cWell, bloody hell anyway,\u201d I said aloud, and got up. \u201cI\u2019ve things to do.\u201d</p><p>Propelled by this bold statement, I fetched my basket and foraging knife, told Mrs. Bug I was off, and set out toward the Christies\u2019.</p><p>I\u2019d check Tom\u2019s hand, then invite Malva to come out with me in search of ginseng root, and any other useful things we might come across. She was an apt pupil, observant and quick, with a good memory for plants. And I\u2019d meant to teach her how to prepare penicillin colonies. Picking through a collection of damp, moldy garbage would be soothing. I ignored a slight tendency of my gorge to rise at the thought, and lifted my battered face to the morning sun.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t going to worry about what Jamie meant to do with Lionel Brown, either.</p><p>33</p><p>IN WHICH MRS. BUG</p><p>TAKES A HAND</p><p>BY THE NEXT MORNING, I had recovered quite a bit. My stomach had settled, and I felt much more resilient, emotionally; a good thing, as whatever warnings Jamie had given Mrs. Bug about fussing over me had plainly worn off.</p><p>Everything hurt less, and my hands had nearly returned to normal, but I was still desperately tired, and it was in fact rather comforting to put my feet up on the settle and be brought cups of coffee\u2014the tea was running very low, and no chance of more likely for several years\u2014and dishes of rice pudding with raisins in.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye\u2019re quite sure as your face will go back to lookin\u2019 like a face, are ye?\u201d Mrs. Bug handed me a fresh muffin, dripping with butter and honey, and peered dubiously at me, lips pursed.</p><p>I was tempted to ask her what the thing on the front of my head looked like now, but was fairly sure I didn\u2019t want to hear the answer. Instead, I contented myself with a brief \u201cYes\u201d and a request for more coffee.</p><p>\u201cI kent a wumman up in Kirkcaldy once, as was kicked in the face by a cow,\u201d she said, still eyeing me critically as she dished up the coffee. \u201cLost her front teeth, puir creature, and ever after, her nose pointed off to the side, like that.\u201d She pushed her own small round nose sharply to the side with an index finger in illustration, simultaneously tucking her upper lip under the lower one to simulate toothlessness.</p><p>I touched the bridge of my own nose carefully, but it was reassuringly straight, if still puffy.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there was WIlliam McCrea of Balgownie, him who fought at Sheriffsmuir with my Arch. Got in the way of an English pike, and cleaved off half his jaw, and the best part of his nose! Arch said ye could see straight into his gullet and his brain-box both\u2014but he lived. On parritch, mostly,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a very good idea,\u201d I said, putting down the nibbled muffin. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll go and get some.\u201d</p><p>Carrying my cup, I escaped as quickly as I could down the hall to my surgery, followed by shouted reminiscences of Dominic Mulroney, an Irishman who\u2019d walked face-first into a church door in Edinburgh and him sober as a sheep at the time. . . .</p><p>I shut the door of the surgery behind me, opened the window, and tossed the remains of the coffee out, then took down the bottle from the shelf and filled my cup to the brim.</p><p>I had intended to ask Mrs. Bug about Lionel Brown\u2019s state of health, but . . . perhaps that could wait. I found that my hands were trembling again, and had to press them flat on the table for a moment to steady them before I could pick up the cup.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and a swallow of whisky. Another. Yes, that was better.</p><p>Small waves of pointless panic tended still to seize me unawares. I hadn\u2019t had one this morning, and had rather hoped they\u2019d gone away. Not quite yet, apparently.</p><p>I sipped whisky, dabbed cold sweat from my temples, and looked round for something useful to do. Malva and I had started some fresh penicillin the day before, and had made up fresh tinctures of boneset and troutlilly, and some fresh gentian salve, as well. I ended up thumbing slowly through my big black casebook, sipping whisky and dwelling on pages recounting various horrible complications of childbirth.</p><p>I realized what I was doing, but didn\u2019t seem able to stop doing it. I was not pregnant. I was sure of it. And yet my womb felt tender, inflamed, and my whole being disturbed.</p><p>Oh, there was a jolly one; one of Daniel Rawlings\u2019s entries, describing a slave woman of middle age, suffering from a recto-vag**al fistula that caused her to leak a constant small stream of fecal matter through the vag**a.</p><p>Such fistulas were caused by battering during childbirth, and were more common in very young girls, where the strain of prolonged labor often caused such tears\u2014or in older women, where the tissues had grown less elastic. Of course, in older women, the damage was quite likely to be accompanied by complete perineal collapse, allowing uterus, urethra\u2014and possibly the anus for good measure\u2014to sag through the pelvic floor.</p><p>\u201cHow extremely fortunate that I am not pregnant,\u201d I said aloud, closing the book firmly. Perhaps I\u2019d have another go at Don Quixote.</p><p>On the whole, it was a considerable relief when Malva Christie came and tapped on the door, just before noon.</p><p>She gave my face a quick glance, but as she had the day before, merely accepted my appearance without comment.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your father\u2019s hand?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, ma\u2019am,\u201d she replied quickly. \u201cI looked just as ye said, but no red streaks, no pus, and just that tiny bit of redness near where the skin is cut. I made him wiggle his fingers like ye said,\u201d she added, a dimple showing briefly in her cheek. \u201cHe didna want to, and carried on like I was poking thorns into him\u2014but he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well done!\u201d I said, and patted her on the shoulder, which made her pinken with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI think that deserves a biscuit with honey,\u201d I added, having noted the delectable aroma of baking that had been wafting down the hall from the kitchen for the last hour. \u201cCome along.\u201d</p><p>As we entered the hallway and turned toward the kitchen, though, I heard an odd sort of noise from behind us. A peculiar kind of thumping or dragging outside, as though some large animal was lumbering across the hollow boards of the front stoop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Malva said, looking over her shoulder in alarm.</p><p>A loud groan answered her, and a thud! that shook the front door as something fell against it.</p><p>\u201cMary, Joseph, and Bride!\u201d Mrs. Bug had popped out of the kitchen, crossing herself. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>My heart had begun to race at the noises, and my mouth went dry. Something large and dark blocked the line of light beneath the door, and stertorous breathing was clearly audible, interspersed with groans.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, it\u2019s sick or injured,\u201d I said. \u201cStand back.\u201d I wiped my hands on my apron, swallowed, walked forward, and pulled open the door.</p><p>For a moment, I didn\u2019t recognize him; he was no more than a heap of flesh, wild hair, and disheveled garments smeared with dirt. But then he struggled up onto one knee and raised his head, panting, showing me a dead-white face, marked with bruises and glossy with sweat.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brown?\u201d I said, incredulous.</p><p>His eyes were glazed; I wasn\u2019t sure that he saw me at all, but clearly he recognized my voice, for he lunged forward, nearly knocking me over. I stepped smartly back, but he caught me by the foot and held on, crying, \u201cMercy! Mistress, have mercy on me, I pray you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of\u2014let go. Let go, I say!\u201d I shook my foot, trying to dislodge him, but he clung like a limpet, and went on shouting, \u201cMercy!\u201d in a sort of hoarse, desperate chant.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut your noise, man,\u201d Mrs. Bug said crossly. Recovered from the shock of his entrance, she appeared not at all discomposed by his appearance, though substantially annoyed by it.</p><p>Lionel Brown did not shut up, but went on imploring me for mercy, despite my attempts to placate him. These were interrupted by Mrs. Bug leaning past me, a large meat-mallet in her hand, and dotting Mr. Brown smartly on the head with it. His eyes rolled back in his head and he dropped on his face without another word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that sorry, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d Mrs. Bug said, apologetic. \u201cI canna think how he got out, let alone came all this way!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d got out, either, but it was quite clear how he\u2019d come\u2014he\u2019d crawled, dragging his broken leg. His hands and legs were scratched and bloody, his breeches in tatters, and the whole of him covered with smears of mud, stuck full of grass and leaves.</p><p>I leaned down and plucked an elm leaf from his hair, trying to think what on earth to do with him. The obvious, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get him into the surgery,\u201d I said, sighing as I bent to get him under the arms.</p><p>\u201cYe canna be doing that, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d Mrs. Bug was scandalized. \u201cHimself was verra fierce about it; ye mustna be troubled by this scoundrel, he said, nor even catch sight of the man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a bit late not to catch sight of him,\u201d I said, tugging at the inert body. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let him lie on the porch, can we? Help me!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug appeared to see no good reason why Mr. Brown ought not to continue lying on the porch, but when Malva\u2014who had been pressed flat against the wall, wide-eyed, during the uproar\u2014came to help, Mrs. Bug gave in with a sigh, laying down her weapon and lending a hand.</p><p>He had recovered consciousness by the time we got him man-handled onto the surgery table, and was moaning, \u201cDon\u2019t let him kill me . . . please don\u2019t let him kill me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be quiet?\u201d I said, thoroughly irritated. \u201cLet me look at your leg.\u201d</p><p>No one had improved on my original rough splinting job, and his journey from the Bugs\u2019 cabin hadn\u2019t done it any good; blood was seeping through the bandages. I was frankly amazed that he had made it, considering his other injuries. His flesh was clammy and his breath shallow, but he wasn\u2019t badly fevered.</p><p>\u201cWill you bring me some hot water, please, Mrs. Bug?\u201d I asked, gingerly prodding the fractured limb. \u201cAnd perhaps a little whisky? He\u2019ll need something for shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not,\u201d Mrs. Bug said, giving the patient a look of intense dislike. \u201cWe should just be saving Mr. Fraser the trouble of dealing wi\u2019 the gobshite, if he hasna got the courtesy to die by himself.\u201d She was still holding her mallet, and raised it in a threatening manner, causing Mr. Brown to cower and cry out, as the movement hurt his broken wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch the water,\u201d Malva said, and disappeared.</p><p>Ignoring my attempts to deal with his injuries, Mr. Brown seized my wrist with his one good hand, his grip surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him kill me,\u201d he said hoarsely, fixing me with bloodshot eyes. \u201cPlease, I beg you!\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. I hadn\u2019t exactly forgotten Mr. Brown\u2019s existence, but I had more or less suppressed the knowledge of it over the last day or so. I had been only too glad not to think of him.</p><p>He saw my hesitation, and licked his lips, trying again.</p><p>\u201cSave me, Mrs. Fraser\u2014I implore you! You are the only one he will listen to!\u201d</p><p>With some difficulty, I detached his hand from my wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhy, exactly, do you think anyone wants to kill you?\u201d I asked carefully.</p><p>Brown didn\u2019t laugh, but his mouth twisted bitterly at that.</p><p>\u201cHe says that he will. I don\u2019t doubt him.\u201d He seemed a little calmer now, and took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cPlease, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said more softly. \u201cI beg you\u2014save me.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at Mrs. Bug, and read the truth in her folded arms and tight lips. She knew.</p><p>At this point, Malva hurried in, a beaker of hot water in one hand, the whisky jug in the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . in the cupboard,\u201d I said, trying to focus my mind. \u201cDo you know what comfrey looks like\u2014boneset?\u201d I had hold of Brown\u2019s wrist, automatically checking his pulse. It was galloping.</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am. Shall I put some to steep, then?\u201d She had set down the jug and beaker and was already hunting through the cupboard.</p><p>I met Brown\u2019s eyes, trying for dispassion.</p><p>\u201cYou would have killed me, if you could,\u201d I said very quietly. My own pulse was going nearly as fast as his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, but his eyes slid away from mine. Only a fraction, but away. \u201cNo, I never would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told H-Hodgepile to kill me.\u201d My voice shook on the name and a flush of anger burgeoned suddenly inside me. \u201cYou know you did!\u201d</p><p>His left wrist was likely broken, and no one had set it; the flesh was puffy, dark with bruising. Even so, he pressed his free hand over mine, urgent with the need to convince me. The smell of him was rank, hot, and feral, like\u2014</p><p>I ripped my hand free, revulsion crawling over my skin like a swarm of centipedes. I rubbed my palm hard on my apron, trying not to throw up.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been him. I knew that much. Of all the men, it couldn\u2019t have been him; he had broken his leg in the afternoon. There was no way in which he could have been that heavy, inexorable presence in the night, shoving, stinking. And yet I felt he was, and swallowed bile, my head going suddenly light.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser? Mrs. Fraser!\u201d Malva and Mrs. Bug both spoke together, and before I knew quite what was happening, Mrs. Bug had eased me onto a stool, holding me upright, and Malva was pressing a cup of whisky urgently against my mouth.</p><p>I drank, eyes closed, trying to lose myself momentarily in the clean, pungent scent and the searing taste of it.</p><p>I remembered Jamie\u2019s fury, the night he had brought me home. Had Brown been in the room with us then, there was no doubt he would have killed the man. Would he do so now, in colder blood? I didn\u2019t know. Brown clearly thought so.</p><p>I could hear Brown crying, a low, hopeless sound. I swallowed the last of the whisky, pushed the cup away, and sat up, opening my eyes. To my vague surprise, I was crying, too.</p><p>I stood up, and wiped my face on my apron. It smelled comfortingly of butter and cinnamon and fresh applesauce, and the scent of it calmed my nausea.</p><p>\u201cThe tea\u2019s ready, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d Malva whispered, touching my sleeve. Her eyes were fixed on Brown, huddled miserably on the table. \u201cWill ye drink it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cGive it to him. Then fetch me some bandages\u2014and go home.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what Jamie meant to do; I had no idea what I might do, when I discovered his intent. I didn\u2019t know what to think, or how to feel. The only thing I did know for certain was that I had an injured man before me. For the moment, that would have to be enough.</p><p>FOR A LITTLE WHILE, I managed to forget who he was. Forbidding him to speak, I gritted my teeth and became absorbed in the tasks before me. He sniveled, but kept still. I cleaned, bandaged, tidied, administering impersonal comfort. But as the tasks ended, I was still left with the man, and was conscious of increasing distaste each time I touched him.</p><p>At last, I was finished, and went to wash, meticulously wiping my hands with a cloth soaked in turpentine and alcohol, cleaning under each fingernail despite the soreness. I was, I realized, behaving as though he harbored some vile contagion. But I couldn\u2019t stop myself.</p><p>Lionel Brown watched me apprehensively.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d This was more or less true. It hadn\u2019t been a process of conscious decision, though my course of action\u2014or lack of it\u2014had been determined. Jamie\u2014damn him\u2014had been right. I saw no reason to tell Lionel Brown that, though. Not yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was opening his mouth, no doubt to plead with me further, but I stopped him with a sharp gesture.</p><p>\u201cThere was a man with you named Donner. What do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d expected, it wasn\u2019t that. His mouth hung open a little.</p><p>\u201cDonner?\u201d he repeated, looking uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t dare to tell me you don\u2019t remember him,\u201d I said, my agitation making me sound fierce.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d he assured me hastily. \u201cI recall him fine\u2014just fine! What\u201d\u2014his tongue touched the raw corner of his mouth\u2014\u201cwhat d\u2019ye want to know about him?\u201d</p><p>The main thing I wanted to know was whether he was dead or not, but Brown almost certainly didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with his full name,\u201d I proposed, sitting down gingerly beside him, \u201cand go from there.\u201d</p><p>In the event, Brown knew little more for sure about Donner than his name\u2014which, he said, was Wendigo.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said incredulously, but Brown appeared to find nothing odd in it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said it was,\u201d he said, sounding hurt that I should doubt him. \u201cIndian, in\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was. It was, to be precise, the name of a monster from the mythology of some northern tribe\u2014I couldn\u2019t recall which. Brianna\u2019s high-school class had once done a unit of Native American myths, with each child undertaking to explain and illustrate a particular story. Bree had done the Wendigo.</p><p>I recalled it only because of the accompanying picture she had drawn, which had stuck with me for some time. Done in a reverse technique, the basic drawing done in white crayon, showing through an overlay of charcoal. Trees, lashing to and fro in a swirl of snow and wind, leaf-stripped and needle-flying, the spaces between them part of the night. The picture had a sense of urgency about it, wildness and movement. It took several moments of looking at it before one glimpsed the face amid the branches. I had actually yelped and dropped the paper when I saw it\u2014much to Bree\u2019s gratification.</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d I said, firmly suppressing the memory of the Wendigo\u2019s face. \u201cWhere did he come from? Did he live in Brownsville?\u201d</p><p>He had stayed in Brownsville, but only for a few weeks. Hodgepile had brought him from somewhere, along with his other men. Brown had taken no notice of him; he caused no trouble.</p> <p>\u201cHe stayed with the widow Baudry,\u201d Brown said, sounding suddenly hopeful. \u201cMight be he told her something of himself. I could find out for you. When I go home.\u201d He gave me a look of what I assumed he meant to be doglike trust, but which looked more like a dying newt.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said, giving him a look of extreme skepticism. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, trying to look pitiful.</p><p>\u201cCould I maybe have some water, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t suppose I could let him die of thirst, but I had had quite enough of ministering to the man personally. I wanted him out of my surgery and out of my sight, as soon as possible. I nodded brusquely and stepped into the hall, calling for Mrs. Bug to bring some water.</p><p>The afternoon was warm, and I was feeling unpleasantly prickly after working on Lionel Brown. Without warning, a flush of heat rose suddenly upward through my chest and neck and flowed like hot wax over my face, so that sweat popped out behind my ears. Murmuring an excuse, I left the patient to Mrs. Bug, and hurried out into the welcome air.</p><p>There was a well outside; no more than a shallow pit, neatly edged with stones. A big gourd dipper was wedged between two of the stones; I pulled it out and, kneeling, scooped up enough water to drink and to splash over my steaming face.</p><p>Hot flushes in themselves were not really unpleasant\u2014rather interesting, in fact, in the same way that pregnancy was; that odd feeling as one\u2019s body did something quite unexpected, and not within one\u2019s conscious control. I wondered briefly whether men felt that way about erections.</p> <p>At the moment, a hot flush seemed quite welcome. Surely, I told myself, I couldn\u2019t be experiencing hot flushes if I were pregnant. Or could I? I had the uneasy knowledge that the hormonal surges of early pregnancy were quite as capable of causing all kinds of peculiar thermal phenomena as were those of the menopause. I was certainly having the sorts of emotional conniptions that went with being pregnant\u2014or menopausal\u2014or from being raped\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Beauchamp,\u201d I said out loud. \u201cYou know quite well you\u2019re not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Hearing it gave me an odd feeling\u2014nine parts relief, one part regret. Well, perhaps nine thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine parts relief, to one of regret\u2014but it was still there.</p><p>The flood of sweat that sometimes followed in the wake of a hot flush, though, was something I could do without. The roots of my hair were soaked, and while the cool water on my face was lovely, waves of heat were still blooming over me, spreading like a clinging veil over chest and face and neck and scalp. Seized by impulse, I tipped half a dipperful of water down the inside of my bodice, exhaling in relief as the wetness soaked the cloth, trickling between my br**sts and down over my belly, tickling cool between my legs and dripping to the ground.</p><p>I looked a mess, but Mrs. Bug wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014and the devil with what bloody Lionel Brown thought. Dabbing at my temples with the end of my apron, I made my way back to the house.</p><p>The door stood ajar, as I\u2019d left it. I pushed it open, and the strong pure light of the afternoon shone past me, illuminating Mrs. Bug in the act of pressing a pillow over Lionel Brown\u2019s face with all her strength.</p><p>I stood blinking for a moment, so surprised that I simply couldn\u2019t translate the sight into realization. Then I darted forward with an incoherent cry and grabbed her arm.</p><p>She was terribly strong, and so focused on what she was doing that she didn\u2019t budge, veins standing out in her forehead and her face nearly purple with effort. I jerked hard on her arm, failed to dislodge her grip, and in desperation shoved her as hard as I could.</p><p>She staggered, off-balance, and I snatched the edge of the pillow, yanking it sideways, off Brown\u2019s face. She lunged back, intent on completing the job, blunt hands shoving down into the mass of the pillow and disappearing to the wrists.</p><p>I drew back a step and flung myself at her bodily. We went over with a crash, hitting the table, upsetting the bench, and ending in a tangle on the floor amid a litter of broken earthenware and the scents of mint tea and a spilled chamber pot.</p><p>I rolled, gasped for breath, pain from my cracked ribs paralyzing me for a moment. Then I gritted my teeth, pushing her away and trying to extricate myself from a snarl of skirts\u2014and stumbled to my feet.</p><p>His hand hung limp, trailing from the table, and I grabbed his jaw, pulling back his head, and pressed my mouth fervently to his. I blew what little breath I had into him, gasped, and blew again, all the time feeling frantically for some trace of a pulse in his neck.</p><p>He was warm, the bones of his jaw, his shoulder felt normal\u2014but his flesh had a terrible slackness, the lips under mine flattening obscenely as I pressed and blew, blood from my split lip splattering everywhere, falling somehow away, so that I was forced to suck frantically to keep them sealed, breathing in hard through the corners of my mouth, fighting my ribs for enough air to blow again.</p><p>I felt someone behind me\u2014Mrs. Bug\u2014and kicked out at her. She made an effort to seize my shoulder, but I wrenched aside and her fingers slipped off. I turned round fast and hit her, as hard as I could, in the stomach, and she fell down on the floor with a loud whoof! No time to spare for her; I whirled and flung myself once more on Brown.</p><p>The chest under my hand rose reassuringly as I blew\u2014but fell abruptly as I stopped. I drew back and pounded hard with both fists, smacking the hard springiness of the sternum with enough force to bruise my own hands further\u2014and Brown\u2019s flesh, had he been capable of bruising any longer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. I blew and thumped and blew, until bloody sweat ran down my body in streams and my thighs were slick with it and my ears rang and black spots swam before my eyes with hyperventilating. Finally, I stopped. I stood panting in deep, wheezing gasps, wet hair hanging in my face, my hands throbbing in time to my pounding heart.</p><p>The bloody man was dead.</p><p>I rubbed my hands on my apron, then used it to wipe my face. My mouth was swollen and tasted of blood; I spat on the floor. I felt quite calm; the air had that peculiar sense of stillness that often accompanies a quiet death. A Carolina wren called in the wood nearby, \u201cTeakettle, teakettle, teakettle!\u201d</p><p>I heard a small rustling noise and turned round. Mrs. Bug had righted the bench and sat down on it. She sat hunched forward, hands folded together in her lap, a small frown on her wrinkled round face as she stared intently at the body on the table. Brown\u2019s hand hung limp, fingers slightly cupped, holding shadows.</p><p>The sheet was stained over his body; that was the source of the chamber pot smell. So, he\u2019d been dead before I began my resuscitation efforts.</p><p>Another wave of heat bloomed upward, coating my skin like hot wax. I could smell my own sweat. I closed my eyes briefly, then opened them, and turned back to Mrs. Bug.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth,\u201d I asked conversationally, \u201cdid you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHE\u2019S DONE WHAT?\u201d Jamie stared at me uncomprehendingly, then at Mrs. Bug, who sat at the kitchen table, head bowed, her hands clasped together in front of her.</p><p>Not waiting for me to repeat what I\u2019d said, he strode down the hall to the surgery. I heard his footsteps come to a sudden stop. There was an instant\u2019s silence, and then a heartfelt Gaelic oath. Mrs. Bug\u2019s plump shoulders rose around her ears.</p><p>The footsteps came back, more slowly. He came in, and walked to the table where she sat.</p><p>\u201cO, woman, how have you dared to lay hands upon a man who was mine?\u201d he asked very softly, in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir,\u201d she whispered. She was afraid to look up; she cowered under her cap, her face almost invisible. \u201cI\u2014I didna mean to. Truly, sir!\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cShe smothered him,\u201d I repeated. \u201cWith a pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ye do not do such a thing without meaning it,\u201d he said, with an edge in his voice that could have sharpened knives. \u201cWhat were ye about, a boireannach, to do it?\u201d</p><p>The round shoulders began to quiver with fright.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, oh, sir! I ken \u2019twas wrong\u2014only . . . only it was the wicked tongue of him. All the time I had care of him, he\u2019d cower and tremble, aye, when you or the young one came to speak to him, even Arch\u2014but me\u2014\u201d She swallowed, the flesh of her face seeming suddenly loose. \u201cI\u2019m no but a woman, he could speak his mind to me, and he did. Threatening, sir, and cursing most awfully. He said\u2014he said as how his brother would come, him and his men, to free him, and would slaughter us all in our blood and burn the houses over our heids.\u201d Her jowls trembled as she spoke, but she found the courage to look up and meet Jamie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI kent ye\u2019d never let that happen, sir, and did my best to pay him no mind. And when he did get under my skin enough, I told him he\u2019d be deid long before his brother heard where he was. But then the wicked wee cur escaped\u2014and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve no idea how \u2019twas done, for I\u2019d have sworn he was in no condition even to rise from the bed, let alone come so far, but he did, and threw himself upon your wife\u2019s mercy, and she took him up\u2014I would have dragged his evil carcass away myself, but she wouldna have it\u2014\u201d Here she darted a briefly resentful glance at me, but returned an imploring gaze to Jamie almost at once.</p><p>\u201cAnd she took him to mend, sweet gracious lady that she is, sir\u2014and I could see it in her face, that having tended him so, it was coming to her that she couldna bear to see him killed. And he saw it, too, the gobshite, and when she went out, he jeered at me, saying now he was safe, he\u2019d fooled her into tending him and she\u2019d never let him be killed, and directly he was free of the place, he\u2019d have a score of men down upon us like vengeance itself, and then . . .\u201d She closed her eyes, swaying briefly, and pressed a hand to her chest.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, sir,\u201d she said very simply. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had been attending to her, a look like thunder on his brow. At this point, he glanced sharply at me\u2014and evidently saw corroborative evidence upon my own battered features. His lips pressed tight together.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d he said to Mrs. Bug. \u201cTell your husband what you have done, and send him to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel then, and headed for his study. Not looking at me, Mrs. Bug rose awkwardly to her feet and went out, walking like a blind woman.</p><p>\u201cYOU WERE RIGHT. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I stood stiffly in the door of the study, hand on the jamb.</p><p>Jamie was sitting with his elbows on his desk, head resting on his hands, but looked up at this, blinking.</p><p>\u201cDid I not forbid ye to be sorry, Sassenach?\u201d he said, and gave me a lopsided smile. Then his eyes traveled over me, and a look of concern came over his face.</p><p>\u201cChrist, ye look like ye\u2019re going to fall down, Claire,\u201d he said, getting up hastily. \u201cCome and sit.\u201d</p><p>He put me in his chair, and hovered over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call Mrs. Bug to bring ye something,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as I\u2019ve sent her away . . . shall I bring ye a cup of tea, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been feeling like crying, but laughed instead, blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got any. We haven\u2019t had for months. I\u2019m all right. Just rather\u2014rather shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose so. Ye\u2019re bleeding a bit.\u201d He pulled a crumpled handkerchief from his pocket and, bending over, dabbed my mouth, his brows drawn together in an anxious frown.</p><p>I sat still and let him, fighting a sudden wave of exhaustion. All at once, I wanted nothing save to lie down, go to sleep, and never wake up again. And if I did wake up, I wanted the dead man in my surgery to be gone. I also wanted the house not to be burned over our heads.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t time, I thought suddenly, and found that thought\u2014idiotic as it was\u2014obscurely comforting.</p><p>\u201cWill it make things harder for you?\u201d I asked, struggling to fight off the weariness and think sensibly. \u201cWith Richard Brown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think. I could wish we were in Scotland,\u201d he said a little ruefully. \u201cI\u2019d ken better what Brown might do, were he a Scotsman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Say you were dealing with your uncle Colum, for instance,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWhat would he do, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to kill me and get his brother back,\u201d he replied promptly. \u201cIf he kent I had him. And if your Donner did go back to Brownsville\u2014Richard knows by now.\u201d</p><p>He was entirely right, and the knowledge made small fingers of apprehension creep briskly up my back.</p><p>The worry evidently showed on my face, for he smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lindsay brothers left for Brownsville the morning after we came back. Kenny\u2019s keeping an eye on the town, and Evan and Murdo are waiting at points along the road, with fresh horses. If Richard Brown and his bloody Committee of Safety should come this way, we\u2019ll hear of it in good time.\u201d</p><p>That was reassuring, and I sat up a little straighter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. But\u2014even if Donner did go back, he wouldn\u2019t know that you had Lionel Brown captive; you might have killed him d-during the fight.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a narrow blue glance at me, but merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cI could wish I had,\u201d he said with a slight grimace. \u201cIt would have saved trouble. But then\u2014I\u2019d not have found out what they were doing, and I did need to know that. If Donner\u2019s gone back, though, he\u2019ll ha\u2019 told Richard Brown what happened, and led them back to claim the bodies. He\u2019ll see his brother\u2019s no among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereupon he\u2019ll draw the logical conclusion and come here looking for him.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the back door opening at this point made me jump, heart pounding, but it was succeeded by the soft shuffle of moccasined feet in the hall, announcing Young Ian, who peered inquiringly into the study.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just met Mrs. Bug, hurrying off to her house,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cShe wouldna stop and speak to me, and she looked verra queer indeed. What\u2019s amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d I said, and laughed, causing him to glance sharply at me.</p><p>Jamie sighed.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said, pushing a stool toward Ian with one foot. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell ye.\u201d</p><p>Ian listened with great attention, though his mouth fell open a little when Jamie reached the point about Mrs. Bug putting the pillow over Brown\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIs he still there?\u201d he asked, at the end of the tale. He hunched a little, looking suspiciously back over his shoulder, as though expecting Brown to come through the surgery door at any moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hardly think he\u2019s going anywhere under his own steam,\u201d I observed tartly.</p><p>Ian nodded, but got up to look anyway. He came back in a moment, looking thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no marks on him,\u201d he said to Jamie, sitting down.</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cAye, and he\u2019s freshly bandaged. Your auntie had just tended him.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged nods, both obviously thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYe canna tell by looking that he\u2019s been killed, Auntie,\u201d Ian explained, seeing that I was not yet on their wavelength. \u201cHe might have died of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say that he did. If he hadn\u2019t tried to terrorize Mrs. Bug . . .\u201d I rubbed a hand\u2014gently\u2014over my forehead, where a headache was beginning to throb.</p><p>\u201cHow do ye feel\u2014\u201d Ian began, in a worried tone, but I had quite suddenly had more than enough of people asking me how I felt.</p><p>\u201cI scarcely know,\u201d I said abruptly, dropping my hand. I looked down at my fists, curled in my lap.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he wasn\u2019t a wicked man, I don\u2019t think,\u201d I said. There was a splotch of blood on my apron. I didn\u2019t know whether it was his or mine. \u201cJust . . . terribly weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter off dead then,\u201d said Jamie matter-of-factly, and without any particular malice. Ian nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell, so.\u201d Jamie returned to the point of the discussion. \u201cI was just saying to your auntie, if Brown were a Scot, I should better know how to deal with him\u2014but then it struck me, that while he isna Scottish, he is by way of doing business in a Scottish manner. Him and his committee. They\u2019re like a Watch.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, sketchy brows raised.</p><p>\u201cSo they are.\u201d He looked interested. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one, but Mam told me\u2014about the one that arrested you, Uncle Jamie, and how she and Auntie Claire went after them.\u201d He grinned at me, his gaunt face suddenly transforming to show a hint of the boy he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was younger then,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd braver.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a small noise in his throat that might have been amusement.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re no verra thrifty about it,\u201d he said. \u201cKilling and burning, I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to ongoing extortion.\u201d I was beginning to see where he was going with this. Ian had been born after Culloden; he\u2019d never seen a Watch, one of those organized bands of armed men that rode the country, charging fees from the Highland chiefs to protect tenants, land, and cattle\u2014and if the black rent they charged was not paid, promptly seizing goods and cattle themselves. I had. And in all truth, I\u2019d heard of them burning and killing now and then, too\u2014though generally only to create an example and improve cooperation.</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cWell, Brown\u2019s no Scot, as I said. But business is business, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A contemplative look had come over his face, and he leaned back a little, hands linked over one knee. \u201cHow fast can ye get to Anidonau Nuya, Ian?\u201d</p><p>AFTER IAN LEFT, we stayed in the study. The situation in my surgery would have to be dealt with, but I was not quite ready yet to go and face it. Beyond a minor remark to the effect that it was a pity he had not yet had time to build an icehouse, Jamie made no reference to it, either.</p><p>\u201cPoor old Mrs. Bug,\u201d I said, beginning to get a grip. \u201cI\u2019d no idea he\u2019d been playing on her that way. He must have thought she was a soft touch.\u201d I laughed weakly. \u201cThat was a mistake. She\u2019s terribly strong. I was amazed.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have been; I\u2019d seen Mrs. Bug walk for a mile with a full-grown goat across her shoulders\u2014but somehow one never translates the strength required for daily farm life into a capacity for homicidal fury.</p><p>\u201cSo was I,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cNot that she was strong enough to do it, but that she dared take matters into her own hands. Why did she no tell Arch, if not myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s what she said\u2014she thought it wasn\u2019t her place to say anything; you\u2019d given her the job of looking after him, and she\u2019d move heaven and earth to do anything you asked. I daresay she thought she was coping well enough, but when he showed up that way, she . . . just snapped. It does happen; I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d he muttered. A small frown had formed, deepening the crease between his brows, and I wondered what violent incidents he might be recalling. \u201cBut I shouldna have thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Arch Bug came in so quietly that I didn\u2019t hear him; I only realized that he was there when I saw Jamie look up, stiffening. I whirled about, and saw the ax in Arch\u2019s hand. I opened my mouth to speak, but he strode toward Jamie, taking no notice of his surroundings. Clearly, for him, there was no one in the room save Jamie.</p><p>He reached the desk and laid the ax upon it, almost gently.</p><p>\u201cMy life for hers, O, chieftain,\u201d he said quietly in Gaelic. He stepped back then, and knelt, head bowed. He had braided his soft white hair in a narrow plait and bound it up, so that the back of his neck was left bare. It was walnut-brown and deeply seamed from weather, but still thick and muscular above the white band of his collar.</p><p>A tiny noise from the door made me turn from the scene, riveting as it was. Mrs. Bug was there, clinging to the jamb for support, and in obvious need of it. Her cap was askew, and sweaty strands of iron-gray hair stuck to a face the color of cream gone bad.</p><p>Her eyes flickered to me when I moved, but then shot back to fix again upon her kneeling husband\u2014and on Jamie, who was now standing, looking from Arch to his wife, then back again. He rubbed a finger slowly up and down the bridge of his nose, eyeing Arch.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI\u2019m to take your head, am I? Here in my own room and have your wife mop up the blood, or shall I do it in the dooryard, and nail ye up by the hair over my lintel as a warning to Richard Brown? Get up, ye auld fraudster.\u201d</p><p>Everything in the room was frozen for an instant\u2014long enough for me to notice the tiny black mole in the exact middle of Arch\u2019s neck\u2014and then the old man rose, very slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt is your right,\u201d he said, in Gaelic. \u201cI am your tacksman, a ceann-cinnidh, I swear by my iron; it is your right.\u201d He stood very straight, but his eyes were hooded, fixed on the desk where his ax lay, the sharpened edge a silver line against the dull gray metal of the head.</p><p>Jamie drew breath to reply, but then stopped, eyeing the old man narrowly. Something changed in him, some awareness taking hold.</p><p>\u201cA ceann-cinnidh?\u201d he said, and Arch Bug nodded, silent.</p><p>The air of the room had thickened in a heartbeat, and the hairs prickled on the back of my own neck.</p><p>\u201cA ceann-cinnidh,\u201d Arch had said. O, chieftain. One word, and we stood in Scotland. It was easy to see the difference in attitude between Jamie\u2019s new tenants and his Ardsmuir men\u2014the difference of a loyalty of agreement and one of acknowledgment. This was different still: an older allegiance, which had ruled the Highlands for a thousand years. The oath of blood and iron.</p><p>I saw Jamie weigh the present and the past and realize where Arch Bug stood between them. I saw it in his face, exasperation changing to realization\u2014and saw his shoulders drop a little, in acceptance.</p><p>\u201cBy your word, then, it is my right,\u201d he said softly, also in Gaelic. He drew himself up, picked up the ax, and held it out, handle first. \u201cAnd by that right, I give you back your woman\u2019s life\u2014and your own.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug let out a small sobbing breath. Arch didn\u2019t look round at her, but reached out and took the ax, with a grave inclination of the head. He turned then, and walked out without a further word\u2014though I saw the fingers of his maimed hand brush his wife\u2019s sleeve, very softly, in passing.</p><p>Mrs. Bug straightened herself, hastily tucking up the straggling bits of hair with trembling fingers. Jamie didn\u2019t look at her, but sat down again, and took up his quill and a sheet of paper, though I thought he had no intention of writing anything. Not wanting to embarrass her, I affected great interest in the bookshelf, picking up Jamie\u2019s little cherrywood snake as though to examine it more closely.</p><p>Cap on straight now, she came into the room, and bobbed a curtsy in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWill I fetch ye a bit to eat, sir? There\u2019s bannocks made fresh.\u201d She spoke with great dignity, head upright. He raised his own head from his paper, and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI should like that,\u201d he said. \u201cGun robh math agaibh, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>She nodded smartly and turned on her heel. At the door, though, she paused, looking back. Jamie raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cI was there, ken,\u201d she said, fixing him with a direct look. \u201cWhen the Sassenachs killed your grandsire, there on Tower Hill. There was a lot of blood.\u201d She pursed her lips, examining him through narrowed, reddened eyes, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a credit to him,\u201d she said, and was gone in a whisk of petticoats and apron strings.</p><p>Jamie looked at me in surprise, and I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a compliment, you know,\u201d I said, and his shoulders began to shake in silent laughter.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said at last, and swiped a knuckle beneath his nose. \u201cD\u2019ye ken, Sassenach\u2014sometimes I mourn the auld bastard?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSometime I must ask Mrs. Bug if it\u2019s true what he said, at the last. What they say he said, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave the headsman his fee, and told him to do a good job\u2014\u2018For I shall be very angry indeed if ye don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it certainly sounds like something he would say,\u201d I said, smiling a little. \u201cWhat do you suppose the Bugs were doing in London?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again, and turned his face to me, lifting his chin so the sun from the window glimmered like water along his jaw and cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cGod knows. D\u2019ye think she\u2019s right, Sassenach? About me being like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to look at,\u201d I said, smiling a little. The late Simon, Lord Lovat, had been short and squat, though powerfully built despite his age. He had also borne a strong resemblance to a malevolent\u2014but very clever\u2014toad.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie agreed. \u201cThank God. But otherwise?\u201d The light of humor was still in his eyes, but he was serious; he truly wanted to know.</p><p>I studied him thoughtfully. There was no trace of the Old Fox in his bold, clean-cut features\u2014those had come mostly from his mother\u2019s MacKenzie side\u2014nor yet in the broad-shouldered height of him, but somewhere behind those slanted dark blue eyes, I now and then sensed a faint echo of Lord Lovat\u2019s deep-set gaze, glittering with interest and sardonic humor.</p><p>\u201cYou have something of him,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMore than a little, sometimes. You haven\u2019t the overweening ambition, but . . .\u201d I squinted a bit, considering. \u201cI was going to say that you aren\u2019t as ruthless as him,\u201d I went on slowly, \u201cbut you are, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAm I, then?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem either surprised or put out to hear this.</p><p>\u201cYou can be,\u201d I said, and felt somewhere in the marrow of my bones the popping sound of Arvin Hodgepile\u2019s neck breaking. It was a warm afternoon, but gooseflesh rippled suddenly up my arms, and then was gone.</p><p>\u201cHave I the devious nature, d\u2019ye think?\u201d he asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, quite,\u201d I said with some dubiousness. \u201cYou\u2019re not a proper twister like he was\u2014but that may be only because you\u2019ve a sense of honor that he lacked. You don\u2019t use people like he did.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at that, but with less real humor than he\u2019d shown before.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only I try not to let it show.\u201d</p><p>He sat for a moment, his gaze fixed on the little cherrywood snake that I held, but I didn\u2019t think he was looking at it. At last, he shook his head and looked up at me, the corner of his mouth tucking wryly in.</p><p>\u201cIf there is a heaven, and my grandsire\u2019s in it\u2014and I take leave to doubt that last\u2014he\u2019s laughing his wicked auld head off now. Or he would be, if it weren\u2019t tucked underneath his arm.\u201d</p><p>34</p> <p>THE EXHIBITS IN THE CASE</p><p>AND SO IT WAS that several days later, we rode into Brownsville. Jamie, in full Highland regalia, with Hector Cameron\u2019s gold-knurled dirk at his waist and a hawk\u2019s feather in his bonnet. On Gideon, who had his ears laid back and blood in his eye, as usual.</p><p>By his side, Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, peace chief of the Snowbird Cherokee. Bird, Ian told me, was from the Long Hair clan, and looked it. His hair was not only long and glossily anointed with bear fat, but most resplendently dressed, with a high tail twisted up from the crown of his head and dropping down his back, ending in a dozen tiny braids decorated\u2014like the rest of his costume\u2014with wampum shell beads, glass beads, small brass bells, parakeet feathers, and a Chinese yen; God knew where he\u2019d got that. Slung by his saddle, his newest and most prized possession\u2014Jamie\u2019s rifle.</p><p>By Jamie\u2019s other side, me\u2014Exhibit A. On my mule Clarence, dressed and cloaked in indigo wool\u2014which played up the paleness of my skin and beautifully highlighted the yellow and green of the healing bruises on my face\u2014with my necklace of freshwater pearls about my neck for moral support.</p><p>Ian rode behind us with the two braves Bird had brought as retinue, looking more like an Indian than a Scot, with the semicircles of tattooed dots that swooped across his tanned cheekbones, and his own long brown hair greased back from his face and tied in a knot, a single turkey quill thrust through it. At least he hadn\u2019t plucked his scalp in the Mohawk fashion; he looked sufficiently menacing without that.</p><p>And on a travois behind Ian\u2019s horse rode Exhibit B\u2014the corpse of Lionel Brown. We\u2019d put him in the springhouse to keep cool with the butter and eggs, and Bree and Malva had done their best, packing the body with moss to absorb liquids, adding as many strongly aromatic herbs as they could find, then wrapping the unsavory package in a deer\u2019s hide, bound with rawhide strips in the Indian fashion. Despite this attention, none of the horses was enthusiastic about being anywhere near it, but Ian\u2019s mount was grimly acquiescent, merely snorting loudly every few minutes and shaking his head so his harness rattled, a lugubrious counterpoint to the soft thump of hooves.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t talk much.</p><p>Visitors to any mountain settlement were cause for public notice and comment. Our little entourage brought folk popping out of their houses like winkles on pins, mouths agape. By the time we reached Richard Brown\u2019s house, which doubled as the local tavern, we had a small band of followers, mostly men and boys.</p><p>The sound of our arrival brought a woman\u2014Mrs. Brown, I recognized her\u2014out onto the crudely built stoop. Her hand flew to her mouth, and she rushed back into the house.</p><p>We waited in silence. It was a cool, bright autumn day, and the breeze stirred the hair on my neck; I\u2019d worn it pulled back, at Jamie\u2019s request, and wore no cap. My face was exposed, the truth written on it.</p><p>Did they know? Feeling strangely remote, as though I watched from somewhere outside my own body, I looked from face to face among the crowd.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t know. Jamie had assured me of it; I knew it, myself. Unless Donner had escaped, and come to tell them all that had happened during that final night. But he hadn\u2019t. If he had, Richard Brown would have come to us.</p><p>All they knew was what showed on my face. And that was too much.</p><p>Clarence felt the hysteria that quivered under my skin like a pool of mercury; he stamped, once, and shook his head as though wanting to dislodge flies in his ears.</p> <p>The door opened, and Richard Brown came out. There were several men behind him, all armed.</p><p>Brown was pale, unkempt, with a sprouting beard and greasy hair. His eyes were red and bleared, and a miasma of beer seemed to surround him. He\u2019d been drinking heavily, and was plainly trying to pull himself together enough to deal with whatever threat we represented.</p><p>\u201cFraser,\u201d he said, and stopped, blinking.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brown.\u201d Jamie nudged Gideon closer, so he was at eye level with the men on the porch, no more than six feet from Richard Brown.</p><p>\u201cTen days past,\u201d Jamie said levelly, \u201ca band of men came upon my land. They stole my property, assaulted my daughter who is with child, burnt my malting shed, destroyed my grain, and abducted and abused my wife.\u201d</p><p>Half the men had been staring at me already; now all of them were. I heard the small, metallic click of a pistol being cocked. I kept my face immobile, my hands steady on the reins, my eyes fixed on Richard Brown\u2019s face.</p><p>Brown\u2019s mouth began to work, but before he could speak, Jamie raised a hand, commanding silence.</p><p>\u201cI followed them, with my men, and killed them,\u201d he said, in the same level tone. \u201cI found your brother with them. I took him captive, but did not slay him.\u201d</p><p>There was a general intake of breath, and uneasy murmurs from the crowd behind us. Richard Brown\u2019s eyes darted to the bundle on the travois, and his face went white under the scabby beard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d he croaked. \u201cNelly?\u201d</p><p>This was my cue. I took a deep breath and nudged Clarence forward.</p><p>\u201cYour brother suffered an accident before my husband found us,\u201d I said. My voice was hoarse, but clear enough. I forced more air into it, to be heard by everyone. \u201cHe was badly injured in a fall. We tended his injuries. But he died.\u201d</p><p>Jamie let a moment of stunned silence pass, before continuing.</p><p>\u201cWe have brought him to you, so that you may bury him.\u201d He made a small gesture, and Ian, who had dismounted, cut the ropes that held the travois. He and the two Cherokee pulled it to the porch and left it lying in the rutted road, returning silently to their horses.</p><p>Jamie inclined his head sharply, and swung Gideon\u2019s head around. Bird followed him, pleasantly impassive as the Buddha. I didn\u2019t know whether he understood enough English to have followed Jamie\u2019s speech, but it didn\u2019t matter. He understood his role, and had carried it out perfectly.</p><p>The Browns might have had a profitable sideline in murder, theft, and slavery, but their chief income lay in trade with the Indians. By his presence at Jamie\u2019s side, Bird gave clear warning that the Cherokee regarded their relationship with the King of England and his agent as more important than trade with the Browns. Harm Jamie or his property again, and that profitable connection would be broken.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know everything Ian had said to Bird, when asking him to come\u2014but I thought it quite likely that there was also an unspoken agreement that no formal inquiry would be made on behalf of the Crown into the fate of any captives who might have passed into Indian hands.</p><p>This was, after all, a matter of business.</p><p>I kicked Clarence in the ribs and wheeled into place behind Bird, keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the Chinese yen that glinted in the middle of his back, dangling from his hair on a scarlet thread. I had an almost uncontrollable urge to look back, and clenched my hands on the reins, digging my fingernails into my palms.</p><p>Was Donner dead, after all? He wasn\u2019t among the men with Richard Brown; I\u2019d looked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether I wanted him to be dead. The desire to find out more about him was strong\u2014but the desire to be done with the matter, to leave that night on the mountainside behind once and for all, all witnesses safely consigned to the silence of the grave\u2014that was stronger.</p><p>I heard Ian and the two Cherokee come into line behind us, and within moments, we were out of sight of Brownsville, though the scent of beer and chimney smoke lingered in my nostrils. I pushed Clarence up beside Jamie; Bird had fallen back to ride with his men and Ian; they were laughing at something.</p><p>\u201cWill this be the end of it?\u201d I asked. My voice felt thin in the cold air, and I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard me. But he did. He shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cThere is never an end to such things,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut we are alive. And that is good.\u201d</p><p>PART FIVE</p><p>Great Unexpectations</p><p>35</p><p>Laminaria</p><p>SAFELY RETURNED from Brownsville, I took firm steps to resume normal life. And among these was a visit to Marsali, who had returned from her refuge with the McGillivrays. I\u2019d seen Fergus, who had assured me that she was well recovered from her injuries and feeling well\u2014but I needed to see for myself.</p><p>The homestead was in good order, I saw, but showing certain signs of dilapidation; a few shingles had blown off the roof, one corner of the stoop was sagging, and the oiled parchment over the single window had split partway up, the flaw hastily mended with rag stuffed through the hole. Small things, but things that should be dealt with before the snow came\u2014and it was coming; I could feel the touch of it in the air, the brilliant blue sky of late autumn fading into the hazy gray of oncoming winter.</p><p>No one rushed out to meet me, but I knew they were home; there was a cloud of smoke and sparks from the chimney, and I thought tartly that at least Fergus seemed able to provide enough wood for the hearth. I called out a cheery \u201challooo!\u201d and pushed open the door.</p><p>I had the feeling at once. I didn\u2019t trust most of my feelings at the moment, but that one went bone-deep. It\u2019s the feeling you have, as a doctor, when you walk into an examination room and know that something\u2019s very wrong. Before you ask the first question, before you\u2019ve taken the first vital sign. It doesn\u2019t happen often, and you\u2019d rather it never did\u2014but there it is. You know, and there\u2019s no way round it.</p><p>It was the children that told me, as much as anything else. Marsali sat by the window, sewing, the two girls playing quietly close by her feet. Germain\u2014uncharacteristically indoors\u2014sat swinging his legs at the table, frowning at a ragged but treasured picture book Jamie had brought him from Cross Creek. They knew, too.</p><p>Marsali looked up when I came in, and I saw her face tighten in shock at sight of mine\u2014though it was much better than it had been.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said briskly, stopping her exclamation. \u201cOnly bruises. How are you, though?\u201d</p><p>I set down my bag and cupped my hands round her face, turning it gently to the light. One cheek and ear were badly bruised, and there was a fading knot on her forehead\u2014but she wasn\u2019t cut, and her eyes looked back at me, clear and healthy. A good color to her skin, no jaundice, no faint scent of kidney dysfunction.</p><p>She\u2019s all right. It\u2019s the baby, I thought, and dropped my hands to her middle without asking. My heart felt cold as I cupped the bulge and lifted gently. I nearly bit my tongue in surprise when a small knee shifted in answer to my touch.</p><p>I was terribly heartened at that; I had thought the child might be dead. A quick glance at Marsali\u2019s face muted my relief. She was strained between hope and fear, hoping that I would tell her that what she knew to be true wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHas the baby moved very much, these last few days?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice calm as I went about fetching out my stethoscope. I\u2019d had it made by a pewtersmith in Wilmington\u2014a small bell with a flat end piece; primitive, but effective.</p><p>\u201cNot so much as he did,\u201d Marsali answered, leaning back to let me listen to her stomach. \u201cBut they don\u2019t, do they, when they\u2019re nearly ready to come? Joanie lay like the de\u2014like a millstone, all the night before the waters broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, often they do do that,\u201d I agreed, ignoring what she\u2019d nearly said. \u201cResting up, I suppose.\u201d She smiled in response, but the smile vanished like a snowflake on a griddle as I leaned close and put my ear to the flattened end of the flared metal tube, the wide, bell-shaped opening over her stomach.</p><p>It took some time to pick up the heartbeat, and when I did, it was unusually slow. It was also skipping beats; the hair on my arms rippled with gooseflesh when I heard it.</p><p>I went on with the examination, asking questions, making small jokes, pausing to answer questions from the other children, who were crowding round, stepping on each other\u2019s feet and getting in the way\u2014and all the time, my mind was racing, envisioning possibilities, all bad.</p><p>The child was moving\u2014but wrong. Heartbeat was there\u2014but wrong. Everything about that belly felt wrong to me. What was it, though? Umbilical cord around the neck was thoroughly possible, and quite dangerous.</p><p>I pushed the smock further back, trying for a better listen, and saw the heavy bruising\u2014ugly splotches of healing green and yellow, a few still with deep red-black centers that bloomed like deadly roses over the curve of her belly. My teeth sank into my lip at sight of them; they\u2019d kicked her, the bastards. A wonder she hadn\u2019t miscarried on the spot.</p><p>Anger swelled suddenly under my breastbone, a huge, solid thing, pushing hard enough to burst it.</p><p>Was she bleeding at all? No. No pain, bar tenderness from the bruises. No cramping. No contractions. Her blood pressure seemed normal, so far as I could tell.</p><p>A cord accident was still possible\u2014likely, even. But it could be a partially detached placenta, bleeding into the uterus. A ruptured uterus? Or something rarer\u2014a dead twin, an abnormal growth . . . The only thing I knew for sure was that the child needed to be delivered into the air-breathing world, and as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fergus?\u201d I said, still speaking calmly.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d she said, matching my tone of absolute calm. \u201cHe\u2019s no been home since the day before yesterday. Dinna put that in your mouth, a chuisle.\u201d She lifted a hand toward F\u00e9licit\u00e9, who was gnawing a candle stub, but couldn\u2019t reach her.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he? Well, we\u2019ll find him.\u201d I removed the candle stub; F\u00e9licit\u00e9 made no protest, aware that something was going on, but not knowing what. In search of reassurance, she seized her mother\u2019s leg and began determinedly trying to climb up into Marsali\u2019s nonexistent lap.</p><p>\u201cNo, b\u00e9b\u00e9,\u201d Germain said, and clasped his sister round the waist, dragging her backward. \u201cYou come with me, a piuthar. Want milkie?\u201d he added, coaxing. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the springhoose, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant Mama!\u201d F\u00e9licit\u00e9 windmilled arms and legs, trying to escape, but Germain hoisted her fat little body into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou wee lassies come with me,\u201d he said firmly, and trundled awkwardly out the door, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 grunting and squirming in his grasp, Joanie scampering at his heels\u2014pausing at the door to look back at Marsali, her big brown eyes wide and scared.</p><p>\u201cGo on then, a muirninn,\u201d Marsali called, smiling. \u201cTake them to see Mrs. Bug. It will be all right.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sweet lad, Germain,\u201d Marsali murmured, folding her hands across her belly as the smile faded.</p><p>\u201cVery sweet,\u201d I agreed. \u201cMarsali\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMight this one live, d\u2019ye think?\u201d She passed a hand gently over her belly, looking down.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t at all sure, but the child was alive for the moment. I hesitated, turning over possibilities in my mind. Anything I did would entail hideous risk\u2014to her, the child, or both.</p><p>Why had I not come sooner? I berated myself for taking Jamie\u2019s and then Fergus\u2019s word that she was all right, but there was no time for self-reproach\u2014and it might not have mattered, either.</p><p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to go to the Big House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course.\u201d She rose carefully, holding to my arm. She looked around the cabin, as though memorizing all its homely details, then gave me a sharp, clear glance. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk on the way.\u201d</p><p>THERE WERE OPTIONS, most of them horrifying to contemplate. If there was danger of a placental abruption, I could do an emergency cesarean and possibly save the child\u2014but Marsali would die. To deliver the child slowly, via induction of labor, was to risk the child, but was much safer for Marsali. Of course\u2014and I kept this thought to myself\u2014induction of labor raised the risk of hemorrhage. If that happened . . .</p><p>I could perhaps stop the bleeding and save Marsali\u2014but would be unable to help the infant, who would likely also be in distress. There was the ether . . . a tempting thought, but I reluctantly put it aside. It was ether\u2014but I\u2019d not used it, had no clear idea of its concentration or effectiveness, nor did I have anything like an anesthetist\u2019s training that would allow me to calculate its effects in such a dicey situation as dangerous childbirth. For a minor operation, I could go slowly, judge the patient\u2019s respiration, and simply back off if things seemed to be going wrong. If I were in the middle of a cesarean section and things went pear-shaped, there was no way out.</p><p>Marsali seemed preternaturally calm, as though she were listening to what was going on inside rather than to my explanations and speculations. As we came near the Big House, though, we met Young Ian, coming down the hillside with a clutch of dead rabbits, dangling by their ears, and she sharpened to attention.</p><p>\u201cHo, cousin! How is it, then?\u201d he asked cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI need Fergus, Ian,\u201d she said without preliminary. \u201cCan ye find him?\u201d</p><p>The smile faded from his face as he took in Marsali\u2019s paleness, and my support of her.</p><p>\u201cChrist, the bairn\u2019s coming? But why\u2014\u201d He glanced up the pathway behind us, clearly wondering why we had left Marsali\u2019s cabin.</p><p>\u201cGo and find Fergus, Ian,\u201d I cut in. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He swallowed, suddenly looking quite young. \u201cOh. Aye. I will. Directly!\u201d He began to bound off, then whirled back and thrust the rabbits into my hand. Then he leapt off the path and tore down the hillside, rocketing between trees and vaulting fallen logs. Rollo, not wishing to be left out of anything, flashed past in a gray blur and hurtled down the hillside after his master like a falling rock.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, patting Marsali\u2019s arm. \u201cThey\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d she said, looking after them. \u201cIf they shouldna find him in time, though . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I SENT LIZZIE to find Brianna and Malva Christie\u2014I thought I might well need more hands\u2014and sent Marsali to the kitchen to rest with Mrs. Bug, while I readied the surgery. Fresh bedding and pillows, spread on my examination table. A bed would be better, but I needed to have my equipment to hand.</p><p>And the equipment itself: the surgical instruments, carefully hidden beneath a clean towel; the ether mask, lined with fresh thick gauze; the dropping bottle\u2014could I trust Malva to administer the ether, if I had to perform emergency surgery? I thought perhaps I could; the girl was very young, and quite untrained, but she had a remarkable coolness about her, and I knew she wasn\u2019t squeamish. I filled the dropping bottle, averting my face from the sweet, thick scent that drifted from the liquid, and put a small twist of cotton in the spout, to keep the ether from evaporating and gassing us all\u2014or catching fire. I glanced hastily at the hearth, but the fire was out.</p><p>What if labor was prolonged and then things went wrong\u2014if I had to do this at night, by candlelight? I couldn\u2019t; ether was hideously inflammable. I shoved away the mental picture of myself performing an emergency cesarean section in the pitch-dark, by feel.</p><p>\u201cIf you have a moment to spare, this would be a bloody good time to have a look-in,\u201d I muttered, addressing this remark collectively to Saints Bride, Raymond, and Margaret of Antioch, all presumably patrons of childbirth and expectant mothers, plus any guardian angels\u2014mine, Marsali\u2019s, or the child\u2019s\u2014who might be hovering about in the offing.</p><p>Evidently, someone was listening. When I got Marsali boosted up onto the table, I was terribly relieved to find that the cervix had begun to dilate\u2014but there was no sign of bleeding. It didn\u2019t remove the risk of hemorrhage, by any means, but it did mean the probability was much lower.</p><p>Her blood pressure seemed all right, so far as I could tell by looking at her, and the baby\u2019s heartbeat had steadied, though the baby had stopped moving, refusing to respond to pokes and shoves.</p><p>\u201cSound asleep, I expect,\u201d I said, smiling at Marsali. \u201cResting up.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a tiny smile in return, and turned onto her side, grunting like a hog.</p><p>\u201cI could use a bit of a rest, myself, after that walk.\u201d She sighed, settling her head into the pillow. Adso, seconding this motion, leapt up onto the table, and curled himself into her br**sts, rubbing his face affectionately against her.</p><p>I would have slung him out, but Marsali seemed to find some comfort in his presence, scratching his ears until he curled up under her chin, purring madly. Well, I\u2019d delivered children in much less sanitary surroundings, cat notwithstanding, and this was likely to be a slow process; Adso would have decamped long before his presence became a hindrance.</p><p>I was feeling a bit more reassured, but not to the point of confidence. That subtle feeling of wrongness was still there. On the way, I\u2019d considered the various options available to me; given the slight dilatation of the cervix and the now-steady heartbeat, I thought we might try the most conservative method of inducing labor, so as not to put undue stress upon mother or child. If emergency intervened . . . well, we\u2019d deal with that when and if we had to.</p><p>I only hoped the contents of the jar were usable; I\u2019d never had occasion to open it before. Laminaria, said the label, written in Daniel Rawlings\u2019s flowing script. It was a small jar of dark green glass, corked tight, and very light. When I opened it, a faint whiff of iodine floated out, but no scent of decay, thank goodness.</p><p>Laminaria is seaweed. Dried, it\u2019s no more than paper-thin slips of brownish-green. Unlike many dried seaweeds, though, Laminaria doesn\u2019t crumble easily. And it has a most astonishing capacity to absorb water.</p><p>Inserted into the opening of the cervix, it absorbs moisture from the mucous membranes\u2014and swells, slowly forcing the cervix further open as it does so, thus eventually causing labor to start. I\u2019d seen Laminaria used, even in my own time, though in modern times it was most frequently employed to assist in expelling a dead child from the uterus. I shoved that thought well to the back of my mind, and selected a good piece.</p><p>It was a simple thing to do, and once done, nothing to do but wait. And hope. The surgery was very peaceful, full of light and the sounds of barn swallows rustling under the eaves.</p><p>\u201cI hope Ian finds Fergus,\u201d Marsali said after a period of silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d I replied, distracted by an attempt to light my small brazier using flint and steel. I should have told Lizzie to have Brianna bring matches. \u201cYou said Fergus hadn\u2019t been home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice sounded muffled, and I looked up to see her head bent over Adso, face hidden in his fur. \u201cI\u2019ve scarce seen him at all, since . . . since the men came to the malting floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to this. I hadn\u2019t realized that Fergus had made himself scarce\u2014though knowing what I did of eighteenth-century men, I supposed I could see why.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ashamed, the wee French gomerel,\u201d Marsali said matter-of-factly, confirming my supposition. She turned her face, one blue eye visible above the curve of Adso\u2019s head. \u201cThinks it was his fault, aye? That I was there, I mean. Thinks if he was better able to provide, I shouldna have had to go and tend the malting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d I said, shaking my head, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cAye, men. Not that he\u2019d say what the trouble is, o\u2019 course. Much better go off and brood about it, and leave me to hame wi\u2019 three wild bairns!\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, they do that, men,\u201d said Mrs. Bug tolerantly, coming in with a lighted taper. \u201cNo sense at all to them, but they mean weel. I heard ye clickin\u2019 away with that steel like a deathwatch, Mrs. Claire; why would ye no just come and fetch a bit o\u2019 fire like a sensible person?\u201d She touched the taper to the kindling in my brazier, which promptly popped into flame.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d I said mildly, adding sticks to the infant flame. \u201cI have hopes of eventually learning to light a fire in less than a quarter of an hour.\u201d</p><p>Marsali and Mrs. Bug snorted in simultaneous derision.</p><p>\u201cBless ye, lamb, a quarter-hour\u2019s no time at all! Why, often I\u2019ve spent an hour and more, trying to catch a spark in damp tinder\u2014in Scotland, \u2019specially, since nothing\u2019s ever dry in the winter there. Whyever d\u2019ye think folk go to such trouble, a-smooring the fire?\u201d</p><p>This caused a spirited discussion of the best way in which to smoor a fire for the night, including an argument over the proper blessing to be said while doing so, and this lasted long enough for me to have coaxed the brazier into a decent glow and set a small kettle in it for tea-making. Raspberry-leaf tea would encourage contractions.</p><p>Mention of Scotland seemed to have reminded Marsali of something, for she raised herself on one elbow.</p><p>\u201cMother Claire\u2014d\u2019ye think Da would mind, if I was to borrow a sheet of paper and some ink? I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it would be as well if I wrote to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be an excellent idea.\u201d I went to fetch paper and ink, heart beating a little faster. Marsali was entirely calm; I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d seen it before, though; I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was fatalism, religious faith, or something purely physical\u2014but women giving birth seemed very often to lose any sense of fear or misgiving, turning inward upon themselves and exhibiting an absorption that amounted to indifference\u2014simply because they had no attention to spare for anything beyond the universe bounded by their bellies.</p><p>As it was, my lingering sense of dread was muted, and two or three hours passed in quiet peace. Marsali wrote to Laoghaire, but also brief notes to each of her children. \u201cJust in case,\u201d she said laconically, handing the folded notes to me to put away. I noticed that she didn\u2019t write to Fergus\u2014but her eyes darted toward the door every time there was a sound.</p><p>Lizzie returned to report that Brianna was nowhere to be found, but Malva Christie turned up, looking excited, and was promptly put to work, reading aloud from Tobias Smollett\u2019s The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle.</p><p>Jamie came in, covered with road dust, and kissed me on the lips and Marsali on the forehead. He took in the unorthodox situation, and gave me the ghost of a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then, a muirninn?\u201d he asked Marsali.</p><p>She made a small face and put her tongue out, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Fergus anywhere, have you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have,\u201d he said, looking slightly surprised. \u201cD\u2019ye want him?\u201d This question was addressed to both Marsali and myself.</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoolam\u2019s Mill. He\u2019s been interpreting for a French traveler, an artist come in search of birds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBirds, is it?\u201d The notion seemed to affront Mrs. Bug, who put down her knitting and sat up straight. \u201cOur Fergus speaks bird-tongue, does he? Well, ye just go and fetch the mannie this minute. Yon Frenchman can mind his own birds!\u201d</p><p>Looking rather taken aback at this vehemence, Jamie allowed me to usher him out into the hallway and as far as the front door. Safely out of earshot, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to do wi\u2019 the lass?\u201d he demanded, low-voiced, and darted a glance back toward the surgery, where Malva\u2019s clear, high voice had taken up her reading again.</p><p>I told him, as well as I could.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be nothing; I hope so. But\u2014she wants Fergus. She says he\u2019s been keeping away, feeling guilty for what happened at the malting floor.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, aye, he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would? Why, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d I demanded in exasperation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault!\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look suggesting that I had missed something patently obvious to the meanest intelligence.</p> <p>\u201cYe think that makes a difference? And if the lass should die\u2014or mischief come to the child? Ye think he\u2019d not blame himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cBut rather obviously he does. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I stopped short, because in fact he did. He\u2019d told me so, very clearly, the night he brought me back.</p><p>He saw the memory cross my face, and the hint of a smile, wry and painful, showed in his eyes. He reached out and traced the line of my eyebrow, where a healing gash had split through it.</p><p>\u201cYe think I dinna feel that?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>I shook my head, not in negation, but in helplessness.</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s wife is his to protect,\u201d he said simply, and turned away. \u201cI\u2019ll go fetch Fergus.\u201d</p> <p>THE LAMINARIA HAD BEEN accomplishing its slow, patient work, and Marsali was beginning to have occasional contractions, though we had not really got down to it, yet. The light was beginning to fade when Jamie arrived with Fergus\u2014and Ian, met on the way.</p><p>Fergus was unshaven, covered with dust, and plainly hadn\u2019t bathed in days, but Marsali\u2019s face lighted like the sun when she saw him. I didn\u2019t know what Jamie had told him; he looked grim and worried\u2014but at sight of Marsali, he went to her like an arrow to its target, gathering her to him with such fervor that Malva dropped her book on the floor, staring in astonishment.</p><p>I relaxed a little, for the first time since I had entered Marsali\u2019s house that morning.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, and took a deep breath. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll have a little food, shall we?\u201d</p><p>I left Fergus and Marsali alone, while the rest of us ate, and returned to the surgery to find them with heads close together, talking quietly. I hated to disturb them, but it was necessary.</p><p>On the one hand, the cervix had dilated very appreciably, and there was no sign of abnormal bleeding, which was a tremendous relief. On the other . . . the baby\u2019s heartbeat was skipping again. Almost certainly a cord problem, I thought.</p><p>I was very conscious of Marsali\u2019s eyes, fixed on my face as I listened through my stethoscope, and I exerted every ounce of will in order to let nothing show.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing very well,\u201d I assured her, smoothing tumbled hair off her forehead and smiling into her eyes. \u201cI think perhaps it\u2019s time to help things along a little.\u201d</p> <p>There were assorted herbs that could assist labor, but most of them were not things I\u2019d use, were there any danger of hemorrhage. At this point, though, I was uneasy enough to want to get things moving as quickly as possible. Raspberry-leaf tea might be a help without being so strong as to induce major or abrupt contractions. Ought I add blue cohosh? I wondered.</p><p>\u201cThe babe needs to come quickly,\u201d Marsali told Fergus, with every appearance of calm. Obviously, I hadn\u2019t been as successful in hiding my concern as I\u2019d thought.</p><p>She had her rosary with her, and now wound it round her hand, the cross dangling. \u201cHelp me, mon cher.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the hand with the rosary, and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cOui, cherie.\u201d He crossed himself then, and set to work.</p><p>Fergus had spent the first ten years of his life in the brothel where he\u2019d been born. Consequently, he knew a great deal more about women\u2014in some ways\u2014than any other man I\u2019d ever met. Even so, I was astonished to see him reach for the strings at the neck of Marsali\u2019s shift, and draw it down, exposing her br**sts.</p><p>Marsali didn\u2019t seem at all surprised, merely lying back and turning slightly toward him, the hump of her belly nudging him as she did so.</p><p>He knelt on a stool beside the bed, and placing a hand tenderly but absently on the bulge, bent his head toward Marsali\u2019s breast, lips slightly pursed. Then he appeared to notice me gaping at him, and glanced up over her belly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cYou have not\u2014well, I suppose you would perhaps not have seen this, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d I was torn between fascination and a feeling that I should avert my eyes. \u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the birth pangs are slow to start, suckling the woman\u2019s br**sts encourages the womb to move, thus to hasten the child,\u201d he explained, and brushed a thumb unconsciously over one dark-brown nipple, so that it rose, round and hard as a spring cherry. \u201cIn the brothel, if one of les filles had a difficulty, sometimes another would do such service for her. I have done it for ma douce before\u2014when F\u00e9licit\u00e9 came. It helps; you will see.\u201d</p><p>And without more ado, he cupped the breast in both hands and took the nipple into his mouth, sucking gently, but with great concentration, his eyes closed.</p><p>Marsali sighed, and her body seemed to relax in the flowing way that a pregnant woman\u2019s does, as though she were suddenly boneless as a stranded jellyfish.</p><p>I was more than disconcerted, but I couldn\u2019t leave, in case anything drastic should happen.</p><p>I hesitated for a moment, then pulled out a stool and sat down on it, trying to be inconspicuous. In fact, though, neither of them appeared to be at all concerned with my presence\u2014if they were even aware of me anymore. I did, however, turn away a little, so as not to stare.</p><p>I was both astonished and interested by Fergus\u2019s technique. He was entirely right; suckling by an infant does cause the uterus to contract. The midwives I had known at L\u2019H\u00f4pital des Anges in Paris had told me that, too; a newly delivered woman should be handed the child at once to nurse, so that the bleeding would slow. None of them had happened to mention use of the technique as a means of inducing labor, though.</p><p>\u201cIn the brothel, if one of les filles had a difficulty, sometimes another would do such service for her,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>His mother had been one of les filles, though he had never known her. I could imagine a Parisian prostitute, dark-haired, likely young, groaning in labor\u2014and a friend kneeling to suckle her tenderly, cupping tender, swollen br**sts and whispering encouragement, as the boisterous noises of satisfied customers echoed through the floors and walls.</p><p>Had she died, his mother? In childbirth with him or a subsequent child? Throttled by a drunken client, beaten by the madame\u2019s enforcer? Or was it only that she hadn\u2019t wanted him, hadn\u2019t wished to be responsible for a bastard child, and thus she had left him to the pity of the other women, one of the nameless sons of the street, a child of no one?</p><p>Marsali shifted on the bed, and I glanced to see that she was all right. She was. She had only moved in order to put her arms about Fergus\u2019s shoulders, bending her head to his. She had left off her cap; her yellow hair was loose, bright against the sleek darkness of his.</p><p>\u201cFergus . . . I think I\u2019m maybe going to die,\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible above the wind in the trees.</p><p>He released her nipple, but moved his lips delicately over the surface of her breast, murmuring. \u201cYou always think you will die, p\u2019tite puce, all women think it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s because a good many of them do, too,\u201d she said a little sharply, and opened her eyes. He smiled, eyes still closed, the tip of his tongue flicking gently against her nipple.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he said softly, but with great assurance. He passed his hand over her stomach, first gently, then with more strength. I could see the mound firm itself, suddenly drawing up round and solid. Marsali drew a deep, sudden breath, and Fergus pressed the heel of his hand against the base of the mound, hard against her pubic bone, holding it there until the contraction relaxed.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, sounding breathless.</p><p>\u201cTu . . . non,\u201d he whispered, still more softly. \u201cNot you. I will not let you go.\u201d</p><p>I curled my hands in the stuff of my skirt. That looked like a nice, solid contraction. Nothing horrible seemed to be happening as a result.</p><p>Fergus resumed his work, pausing now and then to murmur something ridiculous to Marsali in French. I got up and sidled cautiously round toward the foot of the bed table. No, nothing untoward. I cast a quick look at the counter, to be sure all was in readiness, and it was.</p><p>Perhaps it would be all right. There was a streak of blood on the sheet\u2014but it was only a bit of bloody show, quite normal. There was still the child\u2019s worrying heartbeat, the possibility of a cord accident\u2014but I could do nothing about that now. Marsali had made her decision, and it was the right one.</p><p>Fergus had resumed his suckling. I stepped quietly out into the hall, and swung the door half-closed, to give them privacy. If she did hemorrhage, I could be with her in a second.</p><p>I still had the jar of raspberry leaves in my hand. I supposed I might as well go ahead and make the tea\u2014if only to make myself feel useful!</p><p>Not finding his wife at home, old Arch Bug had come up to the house with the children. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 and Joan were sound asleep on the settle, and Arch was smoking his pipe by the hearth, blowing smoke rings for a rapt Germain. Meanwhile Jamie, Ian, and Malva Christie seemed to be engaged in an amiable literary argument regarding the merits of Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett, and . . .</p><p>\u201cOvid?\u201d I said, catching the tail end of one remark. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as you are secure you will count many friends,\u201d Jamie quoted. \u201cIf your life becomes clouded you will be alone. D\u2019ye not think that\u2019s the case for poor Tom Jones and wee Perry Pickle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely true friends wouldnae abandon a man, only because he\u2019s in some difficulty!\u201d Malva objected. \u201cWhat sort of friend is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather the common sort, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I said. \u201cLuckily, there are a few of the other kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, there are,\u201d Jamie agreed. He smiled at Malva. \u201cHighlanders make the truest friends\u2014if only because they make the worst enemies.\u201d</p><p>She was slightly pink in the face, but realized that she was being teased.</p><p>\u201cHmp,\u201d she said, and lifted her nose in order to look down it. \u201cMy faither says Highlanders are such fierce fighters because there\u2019s sae little of any value in the Highlands, and the worst battles are always fought for the lowest stakes.\u201d</p><p>Everyone dissolved in laughter at that, and Jamie rose to come to me, leaving Ian and Malva to resume their wrangle.</p><p>\u201cHow is it wi\u2019 the lass?\u201d he asked quietly, dipping up hot water from the kettle for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said. \u201cFergus is . . . er . . . helping her.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows went up.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked. \u201cI didna ken there was much a man had to do wi\u2019 that business, once he\u2019s got it properly begun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI certainly was!\u201d</p><p>He looked intrigued by this, but was prevented from asking further questions by Mrs. Bug\u2019s demand that everyone leave off talking about wretched folk who get up to no good in the pages of books, and come sit down to eat.</p><p>I sat down to supper, too, but couldn\u2019t really eat, distracted as I was by concern for Marsali. The raspberry-leaf tea had finished steeping as we ate; I poured it out and took it to the surgery\u2014rapping cautiously on the door before entering.</p><p>Fergus was flushed and breathless, but bright-eyed. He could not be persuaded to come and eat, insisting that he would stay with Marsali. His efforts were showing fruit; she was having regular contractions now, though still fairly far apart.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fast, once the waters break,\u201d Marsali told me. She was a little flushed, too, with a look of inward listening. \u201cIt always is.\u201d</p><p>I checked the heartbeat again\u2014no great change; still bumpy, but not weakening\u2014and excused myself. Jamie was in his study, across the hall. I went in and sat with him, so as to be handy when needed.</p><p>He was writing his usual evening note to his sister, pausing now and then to rub the cramp from his right hand before resuming. Upstairs, Mrs. Bug was putting the children to bed. I could hear F\u00e9licit\u00e9 whining, and Germain attempting to sing to her.</p><p>Across the hall, small shufflings and murmurings, the shifting of weight and the creak of the table. And in the depths of my inner ear, echoing my own pulse, the soft, rapid beat of a baby\u2019s heart.</p><p>It could so easily end badly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye doing, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re staring fit to see through the wall, and it doesna seem that ye like what ye\u2019re looking at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I dropped my gaze, and realized that I had been pleating and repleating the fabric of my skirt between my fingers; there was a large wrinkled patch in the fawn-colored homespun. \u201cReliving my failures, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, then rose and came behind me, putting his hands on the base of my neck, kneading my shoulders with a strong, warm touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat failures?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I closed my eyes and let my head nod forward, trying not to groan with the sensations of pain from knotted muscles and the simultaneous exquisite relief.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, and sighed. \u201cPatients I couldn\u2019t save. Mistakes. Disasters. Accidents. Stillbirths.\u201d</p><p>That last word hung in the air, and his hands paused in their work for a moment, then resumed more strongly.</p><p>\u201cThere are times, surely, when there\u2019s nothing ye could do? You or anyone. Some things are beyond the power of anyone to make right, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never believe that, when it\u2019s you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>He paused in his kneading, and I looked up over my shoulder at him. He opened his mouth to contradict me, then realized that he couldn\u2019t. He shook his head, sighed, and resumed.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I suppose it\u2019s true enough,\u201d he said, with extreme wryness.</p><p>\u201cThat what the Greeks called hubris, do you think?\u201d</p><p>He gave a small snort, which might have been amusement.</p><p>\u201cI do. And ye ken where that leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a lonely rock under a burning sun, with a vulture gnawing on your liver,\u201d I said, and laughed.</p><p>So did Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, a lonely rock under a burning sun is a verra good place to have company, I should think. And I dinna mean the vulture, either.\u201d</p><p>His hands gave a final squeeze to my shoulders, but he didn\u2019t take them away. I leaned my head back against him, eyes closed, taking comfort in his company.</p><p>In the momentary silence, we could hear small sounds across the hall, from the surgery. A muffled grunt from Marsali as a contraction came on, a soft French question from Fergus.</p><p>I felt that we really ought not to be listening\u2014but neither of us could think of anything to say, to cover the sounds of their private conversation.</p><p>A murmur from Marsali, a pause, then Fergus said something hesitant.</p><p>\u201cAye, like we did before F\u00e9licit\u00e9,\u201d came Marsali\u2019s voice, muffled, but quite clear.</p><p>\u201cOui, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut something against the door, then,\u201d she said, sounding impatient.</p><p>We heard footsteps, and the door to the surgery swung open. Fergus stood there, dark hair disheveled, shirt half-buttoned, and his handsome face deeply flushed under the shadow of beard stubble. He saw us, and the most extraordinary look flitted across his face. Pride, embarrassment, and something indefinably . . . French. He gave Jamie a lopsided smile and a one-shouldered shrug of supreme Gallic insouciance\u2014then firmly shut the door. We heard the grating sounds of a small table being moved, and a small thump as it was shoved against the door.</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged looks of bafflement.</p><p>Giggles came from behind the closed door, accompanied by a massive creaking and rustling.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no going to\u2014\u201d Jamie began, and stopped abruptly, looking incredulous. \u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>Evidently so, judging from the faint rhythmic creaks that began to be heard from the surgery.</p><p>I felt a slight warmth wash through me, along with a mild sense of shock\u2014and a slightly stronger urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . er . . . I have heard that . . . um . . . it does sometimes seem to bring on labor. If a child was overdue, the ma\u00eetresses sage femme in Paris would sometimes tell women to get their husbands drunk and . . . er-hmm.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave the surgery door a look of disbelief, mingled with grudging respect.</p><p>\u201cAnd him with not even a dram taken. Well, if that\u2019s what he\u2019s up to, the wee bugger\u2019s got balls, I\u2019ll say that for him.\u201d</p><p>Ian, coming down the hall in time to hear this exchange, stopped dead. He listened for a moment to the noises proceeding from the surgery, looked from Jamie and me to the surgery door, back, then shook his head and turned around, going back to the kitchen.</p><p>Jamie reached out and gently closed the study door.</p><p>Without comment, he sat down again, picked up his pen, and began scratching doggedly away. I went over to the small bookshelf, and stood there staring at the collection of battered spines, taking nothing in.</p><p>Old wives\u2019 tales were sometimes nothing more than old wives\u2019 tales. Sometimes they weren\u2019t.</p><p>I was seldom troubled by personal recollections while dealing with patients; I had neither time nor attention to spare. At the moment, though, I had much too much of both. And a very vivid memory indeed of the night before Bree\u2019s birth.</p><p>People often say that women forget what childbirth is like, because if they remembered, no one would ever do it more than once. Personally, I had no trouble at all remembering.</p><p>The sense of massive inertia, particularly. That endless time toward the end, when it seems that it never will end, that one is mired in some prehistoric tar pit, every small move a struggle doomed to futility. Every square centimeter of skin stretched as thin as one\u2019s temper.</p><p>You don\u2019t forget. You simply get to the point where you don\u2019t care what birth will feel like; anything is better than being pregnant for an instant longer.</p><p>I\u2019d reached that point roughly two weeks before my due date. The date came\u2014and passed. A week later, I was in a state of chronic hysteria, if one could be simultaneously hysterical and torpid.</p><p>Frank was physically more comfortable than I was, but in terms of nerves, there wasn\u2019t much to choose between us. Both of us were terrified\u2014not merely of the birth, but of what might come after. Frank being Frank, he reacted to terror by becoming very quiet, withdrawing into himself, to a place where he could control what was happening, by refusing to let anything in.</p><p>But I was in no mood to respect anyone\u2019s barriers, and broke down in tears of sheer despair, after being informed by a cheerful obstetrician that I was not dilated at all, and \u201cit might be several days\u2014maybe another week.\u201d</p><p>Trying to calm me, Frank had resorted to rubbing my feet. Then my back, my neck, my shoulders\u2014anything I would let him touch. And gradually, I had exhausted myself and lain quiet, letting him touch me. And . . . and we were both terrified, and terribly in need of reassurance, and neither of us had any words with which to give it.</p><p>And he made love to me, slowly and gently, and we fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms\u2014and woke up in a state of panic several hours later when my water broke.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d I suppose Jamie had called my name more than once; I had been so lost in memory that I had forgotten entirely where I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I swung round, heart pounding. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d He studied me for a moment, brow creased, then got up and came to stand by me.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2014I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I saw that,\u201d he said dryly. He hesitated, then\u2014as a particularly loud moan came through the door\u2014touched my elbow.</p><p>\u201cAre ye afraid?\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat ye might be wi\u2019 child yourself, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and heard the note of desolation in my voice as clearly as he did. \u201cI know I\u2019m not.\u201d I looked up at him; his face was blurred by a haze of unshed tears. \u201cI\u2019m sad that I\u2019m not\u2014that I never will be again.\u201d</p><p>I blinked hard, and saw the same emotions on his face that I felt\u2014relief and regret, mingled in such proportion that it was impossible to say which was foremost. He put his arms round me and I rested my forehead on his chest, thinking what comfort it was to know that I had company on this rock, as well.</p><p>We stood quietly for some time, just breathing. Then there came a sudden change in the surreptitious noises in the surgery. There was a small cry of surprise, a louder exclamation in French, and then the sound of feet landing heavily on the floor, together with the unmistakable splash of amniotic fluid.</p><p>THINGS DID MOVE quickly. Within an hour, I saw the crowning of a black-fuzzed skull.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got lots of hair,\u201d I reported, easing the perineum with oil. \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t push too hard! Not yet.\u201d I spanned the curve of the emerging skull with my hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got a really big head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna ever have guessed that,\u201d said Marsali, red-faced and panting. \u201cThank ye for telling me.\u201d</p><p>I barely had time to laugh, before the head eased neatly out into my hands, facedown. The cord was round the neck, but not tightly, thank God! I got a finger under it and eased it free, and didn\u2019t have to say, \u201cPush!\u201d before Marsali took a breath that went to China and shot the infant into my middle like a cannonball.</p><p>It was like being suddenly handed a greased pig, and I fumbled madly, trying to get the little creature turned upright and see whether he\u2014or she\u2014was breathing.</p><p>Meanwhile, there were shrieks of excitement from Malva and Mrs. Bug, and heavy footsteps hastening down the hall from the kitchen.</p><p>I found the baby\u2019s face, hastily cleared the nostrils and mouth, blew a short puff of air into the mouth, snapped a finger against the sole of one foot. The foot jerked back in reflex, and the mouth opened wide in a lusty howl.</p><p>\u201cBon soir, Monsieur L\u2019Oeuf,\u201d I said, checking hastily to be sure that it was indeed Monsieur.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur?\u201d Fergus\u2019s face split in an ears-wide grin.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur,\u201d I confirmed, and hastily wrapping the baby in a flannel, thrust him into his father\u2019s arms while I turned my attention to tying and cutting the cord, then tending to his mother.</p><p>His mother, thank God, was doing well. Exhausted and sweat-drenched, but likewise grinning. So was everyone else in the room. The floor was puddled, the bedding soaked, and the atmosphere thick with the fecund scents of birth, but no one seemed to notice in the general excitement.</p><p>I kneaded Marsali\u2019s belly to encourage the uterus to contract, while Mrs. Bug brought her an enormous mug of beer to drink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right?\u201d she said, emerging after thirstily engulfing this. \u201cTruly all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s got two arms, two legs, and a head,\u201d I said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t time to count the fingers and toes.\u201d</p><p>Fergus laid the baby on the table beside Marsali.</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself, ma cher,\u201d he said. He folded back the blanket. And blinked, then leaned closer, frowning.</p><p>Ian and Jamie stopped talking, seeing him.</p><p>\u201cIs there something amiss, then?\u201d Ian asked, coming over.</p><p>Sudden silence struck the room. Malva glanced from one face to another, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cMaman?\u201d</p><p>Germain stood in the doorway, swaying sleepily.</p><p>\u201cIs he here? C\u2019est Monsieur?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for answer or permission, he staggered forward and leaned on the bloodstained bedding, mouth a little open as he stared at his newborn brother.</p><p>\u201cHe looks funny,\u201d he said, and frowned a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>Fergus had been standing stock-still, as had we all. At this, he looked down at Germain, then glanced back at the baby, then again to his firstborn son.</p><p>\u201cIl est un nain,\u201d he said, almost casually. He squeezed Germain\u2019s shoulder, hard enough to elicit a yelp of startlement from the boy, then turned suddenly on his heel and went out. I heard the opening of the front door, and a cold draft swept down the hall and through the room.</p><p>Il est un nain. He is a dwarf.</p><p>Fergus hadn\u2019t closed the door, and the wind blew out the candles, leaving us in semidarkness, lit only by the glow of the brazier.</p><p>36</p><p>WINTER WOLVES</p><p>LITTLE HENRI-CHRISTIAN appeared to be perfectly healthy; he was simply a dwarf. He was slightly jaundiced, though, with a faint gold cast to his skin that gave his round cheeks a delicate glow, like the petals of a daffodil. With a slick of black hair across the top of his head, he might have been a Chinese baby\u2014bar the huge, round blue eyes.</p><p>In a way, I supposed I should feel grateful to him. Nothing less than the birth of a dwarf could have deflected the attention of the Ridge from me and the events of the past month. As it was, people no longer stared at my healing face or stumbled awkwardly to find something to say to me. They had quite a lot to say\u2014to me, to each other, and not infrequently, to Marsali, if neither Bree nor I was in time to stop them.</p><p>I supposed they must be saying the same things to Fergus\u2014if they saw him. He had come back, three days following the baby\u2019s birth, silent and dark-faced. He had stayed long enough to assent to Marsali\u2019s choice of name, and to have a brief, private conversation with her. Then he had left again.</p><p>If she knew where he was, she wasn\u2019t saying. For the time being, she and the children remained at the Big House with us. She smiled and paid attention to the other children, as mothers must, though she seemed always to be listening for something that wasn\u2019t there. Fergus\u2019s footsteps? I wondered.</p><p>One good thing: she kept Henri-Christian always close to her, carrying him in a sling, or sitting by her feet in his basket of woven rushes. I\u2019d seen parents who had given birth to children with defects; often, their response was to withdraw, unable to deal with the situation. Marsali dealt with it in the other way, becoming fiercely protective of him.</p><p>Visitors came, ostensibly to speak to Jamie about something or to get a bit of a tonic or a salve from me\u2014but really in hopes of catching a glimpse of Henri-Christian. It was no surprise, therefore, that Marsali tensed, clutching Henri-Christian to her bosom, when the back door opened and a shadow fell across the threshold.</p><p>She relaxed a little, though, seeing that the visitor was Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cHello, coz,\u201d he said, smiling at her. \u201cAre ye well, then, and the bairn, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra well,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cCome to visit your new cousin, have ye?\u201d I could see that she eyed him narrowly.</p><p>\u201cI have, aye, and brought him a wee present, too.\u201d He lifted one big hand, and touched his shirt, which bulged a little with whatever was inside it. \u201cYe\u2019re well, too, I hope, Auntie Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallo, Ian,\u201d I said, getting to my feet and putting aside the shirt I\u2019d been hemming. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Do you want some beer?\u201d I was grateful to see him; I\u2019d been keeping Marsali company while she sewed\u2014or rather, standing guard over her to repel the less-welcome sort of visitor, while Mrs. Bug was tending to the chickens. But I had a decoction of stinging-nettle brewing in the surgery, and needed to check on it. Ian could be trusted to take care of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaving them with refreshment, I escaped to my surgery and spent a pleasant quarter of an hour alone with the herbs, decanting infusions and separating a heap of rosemary to dry, surrounded by pungent scent and the peacefulness of plants. Such solitude was hard to come by these days, with children popping up underfoot like mushrooms. Marsali was anxious to go back to her own home, I knew\u2014but I was loath to let her go without Fergus there to provide some help.</p><p>\u201cBloody man,\u201d I muttered under my breath. \u201cSelfish little beast.\u201d</p><p>Evidently, I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so. As I came back down the hall, reeking of rosemary and ginseng root, I overheard Marsali expressing a similar opinion to Ian.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken he\u2019s taken back, who wouldna be?\u201d she was saying, her voice full of hurt. \u201cBut why must he run awa, and leave us alone? Did ye speak to him, Ian? Did he say anything?\u201d</p> <p>So that was it. Ian had been gone on one of his mysterious journeys; he must have encountered Fergus somewhere, and told Marsali about it.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, after a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d I hung back, not wanting to interrupt them, but I could see his face, the ferocity of his tattoos at odds with the sympathy that clouded his eyes. He leaned across the table, holding out his arms. \u201cCan I hold him, coz? Please?\u201d</p><p>Marsali\u2019s back stiffened with surprise, but she handed over the baby, who squirmed and kicked a little in his wrappings, but quickly settled against Ian\u2019s shoulder, making little smacking noises. Ian bent his head, smiling, and brushed his lips across Henri-Christian\u2019s big round head.</p><p>He said something soft to the baby, in what I thought was Mohawk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that ye said?\u201d Marsali asked, curious.</p> <p>\u201cA sort of blessing, ye\u2019d call it.\u201d He patted Henri-Christian\u2019s back, very softly. \u201cYe call upon the wind to welcome him, the sky to give him shelter, and the water and the earth to yield him food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Marsali\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice, Ian.\u201d But then she squared her shoulders, unwilling to be distracted. \u201cYe spoke wi\u2019 Fergus, ye said.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, eyes closed. His cheek rested lightly on the baby\u2019s head. He didn\u2019t speak for a moment, but I saw his throat move, the big Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI had a child, cousin,\u201d he whispered, so softly that I barely heard him.</p><p>Marsali heard him. She froze, the needle she had picked up glinting in her hand. Then, moving very slowly, put it down again.</p><p>\u201cDid ye, then?\u201d she said just as softly. And rising, went round the table in a quiet rustle of skirts to sit beside him on the bench, close enough that he could feel her there, and laid a small hand against his elbow.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes, but drew breath, and with the baby nestled against his heart, began to talk, in a voice hardly louder than the crackle of the fire.</p><p>HE WOKE OUT OF SLEEP, knowing that something was deeply wrong. He rolled toward the back of the bed platform, where his weapons lay at hand, but before he could seize knife or spear, he heard again the sound that must have wakened him. It came from behind him; no more than a slight catch of breath, but he heard both pain and fear in it.</p><p>The fire burned very low; he saw no more than the dark top of Wako\u2019teqehsnonhsa\u2019s head, a red glow outlining it, and the double mound of shoulder and hip beneath the furs. She didn\u2019t move or make the sound again, but something in those still dark curves cleft through his heart like a tomahawk striking home.</p><p>He gripped her shoulder fiercely, willing her to be all right. Her bones were small and hard through her flesh. He could find no proper words; all the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka had fled out of his head, and so he spoke in the first words that came to him.</p><p>\u201cLass\u2014love\u2014are ye all right, then? Blessed Michael defend us, are ye well?\u201d</p><p>She knew he was there, but didn\u2019t turn to him. Something\u2014a strange ripple, like a stone thrown in water\u2014went through her, and the breath caught in her throat again, a small dry sound.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait, but scrambled nak*d from the furs, calling for help. People came tumbling out into the dim light of the longhouse, bulky shapes hurrying toward him in a fog of questions. He couldn\u2019t speak; didn\u2019t need to. Within moments, Tewaktenyonh was there, her strong old face set in grim calm, and the women of the longhouse rushed past him, pushing him aside as they carried Emily away, wrapped in a deer\u2019s hide.</p><p>He followed them outside, but they ignored him, disappearing into the women\u2019s house at the end of the village. Two or three men came out, looked after them, then shrugged, turned, and went back inside. It was cold, and very late, and plainly women\u2019s business.</p> <p>He went inside himself, after a few moments, but only long enough to pull on a few clothes. He couldn\u2019t stay in the longhouse, not with the bed empty of her and smelling of blood. There was blood on his skin as well, but he didn\u2019t pause to wash.</p><p>Outside, the stars had faded, but the sky was still black. It was bone-cold, and very still.</p><p>The hide that hung over the door of his longhouse moved, and Rollo slipped through, gray as a ghost. The big dog extended his paws and stretched, groaning with the stiffness of the hour and the cold. Then he shook his heavy ruff, snorted out a puff of white breath, and ambled slowly to his master\u2019s side. He sat down heavily, with a resigned sigh, and leaned against Ian\u2019s leg.</p><p>Ian stood a moment longer, looking toward the house where his Emily was. His face was hot, fevered with urgency. He burned harsh and bright, like a coal, but he could feel the heat seeping out of him into the cold sky, and his heart turning slowly black. Finally, he slapped his palm against his thigh and turned away into the forest, walking fast, the dog padding big and soundless by his side.</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace . . .\u201d He paid no attention to where he was going, praying under his breath, but aloud, for the comfort of his own voice in the silent dark.</p><p>Ought he to be praying to one of the Mohawk spirits, he wondered? Would they be angry that he spoke to his old God, to God\u2019s mother? Might they take revenge for such a slight, on his wife and child?</p><p>The child is dead already. He had no notion where that knowledge came from, but he knew it was so, as surely as if someone had spoken the words to him aloud. The knowledge was dispassionate, not yet food for grief; only a fact he knew to be true\u2014and was appalled to know it.</p><p>On he went into the woods, walking, then running, slowing only when he must, to draw breath. The air was knife-cold and still, smelling of rot and turpentine, but the trees whispered just a little as he passed. Emily could hear them talk; she knew their secret voices.</p><p>\u201cAye, and what good is that?\u201d he muttered, face turned up to the starless void between the branches. \u201cYe dinna say anything worth knowing. Ye dinna ken how it is with her now, do ye?\u201d</p><p>He could hear the dog\u2019s feet now and then, rustling among the dead leaves just behind him, thudding softly on patches of bare ground. He stumbled now and then, feet lost in the darkness, fell once bruisingly, stumbled to his feet, and ran clumsily on. He had stopped praying; his mind wouldn\u2019t form words any longer, couldn\u2019t choose among the fractured syllables of his different tongues, and his breath burned thick in his throat as he ran.</p><p>He felt her body against him in the cold, her full br**sts in his hands, her small round buttocks thrusting back, heavy and eager as he rammed her, oh, God, he knew he ought not, he knew! And yet he\u2019d done it, night after night, mad for the slippery tight clutch of her, long past the day when he knew he should stop, selfish, mindless, mad and wicked with lust. . . .</p><p>He ran, and her trees murmured condemnation above him as he went.</p><p>He had to stop, sobbing for breath. The sky had turned from black to the color that comes before the light. The dog nosed at him, whining softly in his throat, amber eyes gone blank and dark in the no-light of the hour.</p><p>Sweat poured down his body under the leather shirt, soaked the draggled breechclout between his legs. His privates were chilled, shriveled against his body, and he could smell himself, a rank, bitter scent of fear and loss.</p><p>Rollo\u2019s ears pricked, and the dog whined again, moving a step away, back, away again, tail twitching nervously. Come, he was saying, as clearly as words. Come now!</p><p>For himself, Ian could have lain down on the frozen leaves, buried his face in the earth, and stayed. But habit pulled at him; he was accustomed to heed the dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he muttered, dragging a sleeve across his wet face. \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d</p><p>Rollo growled, deep in his throat. He was standing rigid, the hackles slowly rising on his neck. Ian saw it, and some distant tremor of alarm made itself felt through the fog of exhausted despair. His hand went to his belt, found emptiness there, and slapped at it, unbelieving. Christ, he had not so much as a skinning knife!</p><p>Rollo growled again, louder. A warning, meant to be heard. Ian turned, looking, but saw only the dark trunks of cedar and pine, the ground beneath them a mass of shadows, the air between them filled with mist.</p><p>A French trader who had come to their fire had called such a time, such a light, l\u2019heure du loup\u2014the hour of the wolf. And for good reason: it was a hunting time, when the night grows dim, and the faint breeze that comes before the light begins to rise, carrying the scent of prey.</p><p>His hand went to the other side of his belt, where the pouch of taseng should hang: bear grease steeped with mint leaves, to hide a man\u2019s scent while hunting\u2014or hunted. But that side too was empty, and he felt his heart beat quick and hard, as the cold wind dried the sweat from his body.</p><p>Rollo\u2019s teeth were bared, the growl a continuous rolling thunder. Ian stooped and seized a fallen pine branch from the ground. It was a good length, though flimsier than he would have liked, and unwieldy, clawed with long twigs.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he whispered to the dog. He had no notion where he was, or where the village lay, but Rollo did. The dog backed slowly, eyes still fixed on the gray shadows\u2014did they move, those shadows?</p><p>He was walking faster now, still backward, feeling the slope of the ground through the soles of his moccasins, sensing Rollo\u2019s presence from the rustle of the dog\u2019s feet, the faint whine that came now and then behind him. There. Yes, a shadow had moved! A gray shape, far away and seen too briefly to recognize, but there all the same\u2014and recognizable by its presence alone.</p><p>If there was one, there were more. They did not hunt alone. They weren\u2019t near yet, though; he turned, beginning almost to run. Not in panic now, despite the fear in the pit of his stomach. A quick, steady lope, the hill-walker\u2019s gait that his uncle had shown him, that would devour the steep, endless miles of the Scottish mountains, steady effort without exhaustion. He must save strength to fight.</p><p>He observed that thought with a wry twist of the mouth, snapping off the brittle pine twigs from his club as he went. A moment ago, he had wanted to die, and perhaps he would again, if Emily\u2014 But not now. If Emily . . . and besides, there was the dog. Rollo wouldn\u2019t leave him; they must defend each other.</p><p>There was water near; he heard it gurgling under the wind. But carried on the wind came another sound, a long, unearthly howl that brought the sweat out cold on his face again. Another answered it, to the west. Still far away, but they were hunting now, calling to one another. Her blood was on him.</p><p>He turned, seeking the water. It was a small creek, no more than a few feet across. He splashed into it without hesitation, splintering the skin of ice that clung to the banks, feeling the cold bite into his legs and feet as it soaked his leggings and filled his moccasins. He stopped for a split second, pulling off the moccasins, lest they be carried away in the current; Emily had made them for him, of moose hide.</p><p>Rollo had crossed the stream in two gigantic bounds, and paused on the opposite bank to shake a freezing spray of water from his coat before going on. He held to the bank, though; Ian stayed in the water, splashing shin-deep, staying as long as might be managed. Wolves hunted by wind as much as by ground scent, but no need to make it easy for them.</p><p>He had thrust the wet moccasins down the neck of his shirt, and icy trickles ran down chest and belly, soaking his breechclout. His feet were numb; he couldn\u2019t feel the rounded stones of the streambed, but now and then his foot slid on one, slippery with algae, and he lurched and stumbled to keep his balance.</p><p>He could hear the wolves more clearly; that was good, though\u2014the wind had changed, was toward him now, carrying their voices. Or was it only that they were closer now?</p><p>Closer. Rollo was wild, darting to and fro on the far bank, whining and growling, urging him on with brief yips. A deer\u2019s path came down to the stream on that side; he stumbled out of the water onto it, panting and shaking. It took several tries to get the moccasins on again. The soaked leather was stiff, and his hands and feet refused to work. He had to put down his club and use both hands.</p><p>He had just managed the second one when Rollo suddenly charged down the bank, roaring a challenge. He whirled on the frozen mud, catching up his club, in time to see a gray shape, nearly Rollo\u2019s size, on the far side of the water, its pale eyes startlingly near.</p><p>He screeched and flung the club in reflex. It sailed across the stream and struck the ground near the wolf\u2019s feet, and the thing vanished as though by magic. He stood stock-still for an instant, staring. He had not imagined it, surely?</p><p>No, Rollo was raving, bellowing and teeth bared, flecks of foam flying from his muzzle. There were stones at the stream\u2019s edge; Ian seized one, another, scraped up a handful, another, stubbing his fingers in haste on the rocks and frozen soil, holding up the front of his shirt to make a bag.</p><p>The more-distant wolf howled again; the near one answered, so close that the hairs rose up straight on the back of his neck. He heaved a rock in the direction of the call, turned, and ran, the bundle of rocks clutched hard against his belly.</p><p>The sky had lightened into dawn. Heart and lungs strained for blood and air, and yet it seemed as though he ran so slowly that he floated over the forest floor, passing like a drifting cloud, unable to go faster. He could see each tree, each separate needle of a spruce he passed, short and thick, soft silver-green in the light.</p><p>His breath came hard, his vision blurred and cleared, as tears of effort clouded his eyes, were blinked away, welled back again. A tree branch lashed his face and blinded him, the scent of it sharp in his nose.</p><p>\u201cRed Cedar, help me!\u201d he gasped, the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka coming to his lips as though he had never spoken English or called upon Christ and His mother.</p><p>Behind you. It was a small voice, quiet, perhaps no more than the voice of his own instinct, but he whirled at once, stone in hand, and slung it with all his force. Another, and another, and another, as fast as he could fling. There was a crack, a thump, and a yelp, and Rollo slewed and skidded, eager to turn and attack.</p><p>\u201cCome-come-come!\u201d He seized the big dog\u2019s ruff as he ran, dragging him round, forcing him along.</p><p>He could hear them now, or thought he could. The wind that comes at dawn rustled through the trees, and they whispered overhead, calling him this way, then that, guiding him as he ran. He saw nothing but color, half-blind with effort, but felt their embrace, cool in his mind; a prickling touch of spruce and fir, the skin of white aspen, smooth as a woman\u2019s, sticky with blood.</p><p>Go here, come this way, he thought he heard, and followed the sound of the wind.</p><p>A howl came from behind them, followed by short yips, and another of acknowledgment. Close, too close! He flung stones behind him as he ran, not looking, no time to turn and aim.</p><p>Then there were no more stones and he dropped the empty flap of shirt, arms pumping as he ran, a harsh panting in his ears that might have been his own breath, or the dog\u2019s\u2014or the sound of the beasts behind him.</p><p>How many of them? How far to go? He was beginning to stagger, streaks of black and red shooting through his vision. If the village was not nearby, he had no chance.</p><p>He lurched sideways, hit the yielding branch of a tree that bent under his weight, then pushed him upright, setting him roughly back on his feet. He had lost his impetus, though, and his sense of direction.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he gasped to the trees. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>If there was an answer, he didn\u2019t hear it. There was a roar and a thud behind him, a mad scuffle punctuated with the growls and yelps of dogs fighting.</p><p>\u201cRollo!\u201d He turned and flung himself through a growth of dead vines, to find dog and wolf squirming and biting in a writhing ball of fur and flashing teeth.</p><p>He dashed forward, kicking and shouting, punching wildly, glad at last to have something to hit, to be fighting back, even if it was the last fight. Something ripped across his leg, but he felt only the jar of impact as he rammed his knee hard into the wolf\u2019s side. It squealed and rolled away, rounding on him at once.</p><p>It leaped, and its paws struck him in the chest. He fell back, struck his head glancingly on something, lost breath for an instant, and came to himself to find his hand braced beneath the slavering jaws, straining to keep them from his throat.</p><p>Rollo sprang onto the wolf\u2019s back, and Ian lost his grip, collapsing under the weight of reeking fur and squirming flesh. He flung out a hand, seeking anything\u2014a weapon, a tool, a grip to pull himself free\u2014and gripped something hard.</p><p>He wrenched it from its bed in the moss and smashed it against the wolf\u2019s head. Fragments of bloody teeth flew through the air and struck his face. He struck again, sobbing, and again.</p><p>Rollo was whining, a high keening noise\u2014no, it was him. He bashed the rock down once more on the battered skull, but the wolf had stopped fighting; it lay across his thighs, legs twitching, eyes glazing as it died. He pushed it off in a frenzy of revulsion. Rollo\u2019s teeth sank into the wolf\u2019s outstretched throat, and ripped it out, in a final spray of blood and warm flesh.</p><p>Ian closed his eyes and sat still. It didn\u2019t seem possible to move, or to think.</p><p>After a time, it seemed possible to open his eyes, and to breathe, at least. There was a large tree at his back; he had fallen against the trunk when the wolf struck him; it supported him now. Among the twisted roots was a muddy hole, from which he had wrenched the stone.</p><p>He was still holding the stone; it felt as though it had grown to his skin; he couldn\u2019t open his hand. When he looked he saw that this was because the stone had shattered; sharp fragments had cut his hand, and the pieces of the stone were glued to his hand by drying blood. Using the fingers of his other hand, he bent back the clenched fingers, and pushed the broken pieces of the stone off his palm. He scraped moss from the tree roots, made a wad of it in his hand, then let the curled fingers close over it again.</p><p>A wolf howled, in the middle distance. Rollo, who had lain down by Ian, lifted his head with a soft wuff! The howl came again, and seemed to hold a question, a worried tone.</p><p>For the first time, he looked at the body of the wolf. For an instant, he thought it moved, and shook his head to clear his vision. Then he looked again.</p><p>It was moving. The distended belly rose gently, subsided. It was full light now, and he could see the tiny nubs of pink n**ples, showing through the belly fur. Not a pack. A pair. But a pair no more. The wolf in the distance howled again, and Ian leaned to one side and vomited.</p><p>Eats Turtles came upon him a little later, sitting with his back against the red-cedar tree by the dead wolf, Rollo\u2019s bulk pressed close against him. Turtle squatted down, a short distance away, balanced on his heels, and watched.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting, Wolf\u2019s Brother,\u201d he said finally, in greeting. Ian felt the knot between his shoulder blades relax just a little. Turtle\u2019s voice held a quiet tone, but no sorrow. She lived, then.</p><p>\u201cShe whose hearth I share,\u201d he said, careful to avoid speaking her name. To speak it aloud might expose her to evil spirits nearby. \u201cShe is well?\u201d</p><p>Turtle closed his eyes and raised both brows and shoulders. She was alive, and not in danger. Still, it was not for a man to say what might happen. Ian didn\u2019t mention the child. Neither did Turtle.</p><p>Turtle had brought a gun, a bow, and his knife, of course. He took the knife from his belt and handed it to Ian, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYou will want the skins,\u201d he said. \u201cTo wrap your son, when he shall be born.\u201d</p><p>A shock went through Ian, like the shock of sudden rain on bare skin. Eats Turtles saw his face, and turned his head aside, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis child was a daughter,\u201d Turtle said matter-of-factly. \u201cTewaktenyonh told my wife, when she came for a rabbit skin to wrap the body.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his belly tightened and quivered; he thought that perhaps his own skin would burst, but it didn\u2019t. His throat was dry, and he swallowed once, painfully, then shook the moss away and held out his wounded hand for the knife. He bent slowly to skin the wolf.</p><p>Eats Turtles was poking with interest at the bloodstained remnants of the shattered stone, when the howl of a wolf brought him upright, staring.</p><p>It echoed through the forest, that howl, and the trees moved above them, murmuring uneasily at the sound of loss and desolation. The knife drew swiftly down the pale fur of the belly, dividing the two rows of pink n**ples.</p><p>\u201cHer husband will be nearby,\u201d Wolf\u2019s Brother said, not looking up. \u201cGo and kill him.\u201d</p><p>MARSALI STARED at him, scarcely breathing. The sadness in her eyes was still there, but had somehow diminished, overwhelmed with compassion. The anger had left her; she had taken back Henri-Christian, and held the fat bundle of her baby with both arms against her breast, her cheek against the bold round curve of his head.</p><p>\u201cAh, Ian,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMo charaid, mo chridhe.\u201d</p><p>He sat looking down at his hands, clasped loosely in his lap, and seemed not to have heard her. Finally, though, he stirred, like a statue waking. Without looking up, he reached into his shirt and drew out a small, rolled bundle, bound with hair twine, and decorated with a wampum bead.</p><p>He undid this, and leaning over, spread the cured skin of an unborn wolf over the baby\u2019s shoulders. His big, bony hand smoothed the pale fur, cupping for a moment over Marsali\u2019s hand where it held the child.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, cousin,\u201d he said, very softly, \u201cyour husband grieves. But he will come back.\u201d Then he rose and left, silent as an Indian.</p><p>37</p><p>LE MA\u00eeTRE DES</p><p>CHAMPIGNONS</p><p>THE SMALL LIMESTONE CAVE we used for a stable was home at the moment only to a nanny goat with two brand-new kids. All the animals born in the spring were now large enough to be turned out to forage in the wood with their mothers. The goat was still getting room service, though, in the form of kitchen scraps and a little cracked corn.</p><p>It had been raining for several days, and the morning broke cloudy and damp, every leaf dripping and the air thick with the scents of resin and soggy leaf mulch. Luckily, the cloudiness kept the birds subdued; the jays and mockingbirds were quick to learn, and kept a beady eye on the comings and goings of people with food\u2014they dive-bombed me regularly as I made my way up the hill with my basin.</p><p>I was on my guard, but even so, a bold jay dropped from a branch in a flash of blue and landed in the basin, startling me. Before I could react, it had seized a fragment of corn muffin and darted off, so quickly that I could scarcely believe I\u2019d seen it, save for the racing of my heart. Luckily I hadn\u2019t dropped the basin; I heard a triumphant screech from the trees, and hurried to get inside the stable before the jay\u2019s friends should try the same tactic.</p><p>I was surprised to find that the Dutch door was unbolted at the top and stood an inch or two ajar. There was no danger of the goats escaping, of course, but foxes and raccoons were more than capable of climbing over the lower door, and so both doors were normally bolted at night. Perhaps Mr. Wemyss had forgotten; it was his job to muck out the used straw and settle the stock for the night.</p><p>As soon as I pushed open the door, though, I saw that Mr. Wemyss was not to blame. There was a tremendous rustle of straw at my feet, and something big moved in the darkness.</p><p>I uttered a sharp yelp of alarm, and this time did drop the basin, which fell with a clang, scattering food across the floor and rousing the nanny goat, who started blatting her head off.</p><p>\u201cPardon, milady!\u201d</p><p>Hand to my thumping heart, I stepped out of the doorway, so the light fell on Fergus, crouched on the floor, with straws sticking out of his hair like the Madwoman of Chaillot.</p><p>\u201cOh, so there you are,\u201d I said quite coldly.</p><p>He blinked and swallowed, rubbing his hand over a face dark with sprouting whiskers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes,\u201d he said. He seemed to have nothing further to add to this. I stood glaring down at him for a moment, then shook my head and stooped to retrieve the potato peelings and other fragments that had fallen from the basin. He moved as though to help me, but I stopped him with a shooing gesture.</p><p>He sat still, watching me, hands around his knees. It was dim inside the stable, and water dripped steadily from the plants growing out of the cliffside above, making a curtain of falling drops across the open door.</p><p>The goat had stopped making noise, having recognized me, but was now stretching her neck through the railing of her pen, blueberry-colored tongue extended like an anteater\u2019s, in an effort to reach an apple core that had rolled near the pen. I picked it up and handed it to her, trying to think where to start, and what to say when I did.</p><p>\u201cHenri-Christian\u2019s doing well,\u201d I said, for lack of anything else. \u201cPutting on weight.\u201d</p><p>I let the remark trail off, bending over the rail to pour corn and scraps into the wooden feed trough.</p><p>Dead silence. I waited a moment, then turned round, one hand on my hip.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very sweet little baby,\u201d I said.</p><p>I could hear him breathing, but he said nothing. With an audible snort, I went and pushed the bottom half of the door open wide, so that the cloudy light outside streamed in, exposing Fergus. He sat with his face turned stubbornly away. I could smell him at a goodly distance; he reeked of bitter sweat and hunger.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cDwarves of this sort have got quite normal intelligence. I\u2019ve checked him thoroughly, and he has all the usual reflexes and responses that he should have. There\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t be educated, be able to work\u2014at something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d Fergus echoed, the word holding both despair and derision. \u201cSomething.\u201d At last, he turned his face toward me, and I saw the hollowness of his eyes. \u201cWith respect, milady\u2014you have never seen the life of a dwarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have?\u201d I asked, not so much in challenge as curiosity.</p><p>He closed his eyes against the morning light, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, and swallowed. \u201cIn Paris.\u201d</p><p>The brothel where he had grown up in Paris was a large one, with a varied clientele, famous for being able to offer something for almost any taste.</p><p>\u201cThe house itself had les filles, naturellement, and les enfants. They are of course the bread and butter of the establishment. But there are always those who desire . . . the exotic, and will pay. And so now and then the madame would send for those who dealt in such things. La Ma\u00eetresse des Scorpions\u2014avec les flagellantes, tu comprends? Ou Le Ma\u00eetre des Champignons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Master of Mushrooms?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cOui. The Dwarf Master.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had sunk into his head, his gaze turned inward and his face haggard. He was seeing in memory sights and people who had been absent from his thoughts for many years\u2014and was not enjoying the recollection.</p><p>\u201cLes chanterelles, we called them,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe females. The males, they were les morels.\u201d Exotic fungi, valued for the rarity of their twisted shapes, the strange savor of their flesh.</p><p>\u201cThey were not badly treated, les champignons,\u201d he said, abstracted. \u201cThey were of value, you see. Le Ma\u00eetre would buy such infants from their parents\u2014there was one born in the brothel, once, and the madame was delighted at her good fortune\u2014or collect them from the streets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked down at his hand, the long, delicate fingers moving restlessly, pleating the cloth of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cThe streets,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThose who escaped the brothels\u2014they were beggars. I knew one of them quite well\u2014Luc, he was called. We would sometimes assist each other\u2014\u201d The shadow of a smile touched his mouth, and he waved his intact hand in the deft gesture of one picking pockets.</p><p>\u201cBut he was alone, Luc,\u201d he continued matter-of-factly. \u201cHe had no protector. I found him one day in the alley, with his throat cut. I told the madame, and she sent the doorkeep out at once to seize the body, and sold it to a doctor in the next arondissement.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask what the doctor had wanted with Luc\u2019s body. I\u2019d seen the broad, dried hands of dwarves, sold for divination and protection. And other parts.</p> <p>\u201cI begin to see why a brothel might seem safe,\u201d I said, swallowing heavily. \u201cBut still . . .\u201d</p><p>Fergus had been sitting with his head braced on his hand, staring at the straw. At this, he looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cI have parted my buttocks for money, milady,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd thought nothing of it, save when it hurt. But then I met milord, and found a world beyond the brothel and the streets. That my son might return to such places . . .\u201d He stopped abruptly, unable to speak. He closed his eyes again, and shook his head, slowly.</p><p>\u201cFergus. Fergus, dear. You can\u2019t think that Jamie\u2014that we\u2014would ever let such a thing happen,\u201d I said, distressed beyond measure.</p><p>He drew a deep, trembling breath, and thumbed away the tears that hung on his lashes. He opened his eyes and gave me a smile of infinite sadness.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you would not, milady. But you will not live forever, nor will milord. Nor I. But the child will be a dwarf forever. And les petits, they cannot well defend themselves. They will be plucked up by those who seek them, taken and consumed.\u201d He wiped his nose on his sleeve and sat up a little.</p><p>\u201cIf, that is, they should be so fortunate,\u201d he added, his voice hardening. \u201cThey are not valued, outside the cities. Peasants, they believe the birth of such a child is at best a judgment on the sins of his parents.\u201d A deeper shadow crossed his face, his lips drawing tight. \u201cIt may be so. My sins\u2014\u201d But he broke off abruptly, turning away.</p><p>\u201cAt worst\u2014\u201d His voice was soft, head turned away, as though he whispered secrets to the shadows of the cave. \u201cAt worst, they are seen as monstrous, children born of some demon who has lain with the woman. People stone them, burn them\u2014sometimes the woman, too. In the mountain villages of France, a dwarf child would be left for the wolves. But do you not know these things, milady?\u201d he asked, suddenly turning back to face me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I suppose so,\u201d I said, and put out a hand to the wall, suddenly feeling the need of some support. I had known such things, in the abstract way one thinks of the customs of aborigines and savages\u2014people whom one will never meet, safely distant in the pages of geography books, of ancient histories.</p><p>He was right; I knew it. Mrs. Bug had crossed herself, seeing the child, and then made the sign of the horns as protection from evil, pale horror on her face.</p><p>Shocked as we had all been, and then concerned with Marsali, and with Fergus\u2019s absence, I hadn\u2019t been away from the house for a week or more. I had no idea what people might be saying, on the Ridge. Fergus plainly did.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll . . . get used to him,\u201d I said as bravely as I could. \u201cPeople will see that he isn\u2019t a monster. It may take some time, but I promise you, they\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they? And if they let him live, what then will he do?\u201d He rose to his feet quite suddenly. He stretched out his left arm, and with a jerk, freed the leather strip that held his hook. It fell with a soft thump into the straw, and left the narrow stump of his wrist bare, the pale skin creased with red from the tightness of the wrappings.</p><p>\u201cMe, I cannot hunt, cannot do a proper man\u2019s work. I am fit for nothing but to pull the plow, like a mule!\u201d His voice shook with anger and self-loathing. \u201cIf I cannot work as a man does, how shall a dwarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus, it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot keep my family! My wife must labor day and night to feed the children, must put herself in the way of scum and filth who misuse her, who\u2014 Even if I was in Paris, I am too old and crippled to whore!\u201d He shook the stump at me, face convulsed, then whirled and swung his maimed arm, smashing it against the wall, over and over.</p><p>\u201cFergus!\u201d I seized his other arm, but he jerked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat work will he do?\u201d he cried, tears streaming down his face. \u201cHow shall he live? Mon Dieu! Il est aussi inutile que moi!\u201d</p><p>He bent and seized the hook from the ground, and hurled it as hard as he could at the limestone wall. It made a small chiming sound as it struck, and fell into the straw, startling the nanny and her kids.</p> <p>Fergus was gone, the Dutch door left swinging. The goat called after him, a long maaaah! of disapproval.</p><p>I held on to the railing of the pen, feeling as though it was the only solid thing in a slowly tilting world. When I could, I bent and felt carefully in the straw until I touched the metal of the hook, still warm from Fergus\u2019s body. I drew it out and wiped bits of straw and manure carefully off it with my apron, still hearing Fergus\u2019s last words.</p><p>\u201cMy God! He is as useless as I am!\u201d</p><p>38</p><p>A DE\u2019IL IN THE MILK</p><p>HENRI-CHRISTIAN\u2019S EYES nearly crossed with the effort of focusing on the yarn bobble Brianna dangled over his face.</p><p>\u201cI think his eyes might stay blue,\u201d she said, peering thoughtfully at him. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s looking at?\u201d He lay in her lap, knees drawn up nearly to his chin, the soft blue eyes in question fixed somewhere far beyond her.</p><p>\u201cOh, the wee ones still see heaven, my Mam said.\u201d Marsali was spinning, trying out Brianna\u2019s new treadle wheel, but spared a quick glance at her newest son, smiling a little. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an angel sitting on your shoulder, aye? Or a saint who stands behind ye.\u201d</p><p>That gave her an odd feeling, as though someone did stand behind her. Not creepy, though\u2014more a mild, warm sense of reassurance. She opened her mouth to say, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s my father,\u201d but caught herself in time.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the patron saint of laundry?\u201d she said instead. \u201cThat\u2019s who we need.\u201d It was raining; it had been raining for days, and small mounds of clothing lay scattered about the room or draped over the furniture: damp things in various states of drying, filthy things destined for the wash cauldron as soon as the weather broke, less-filthy things that might be brushed, shaken, or beaten into another few days\u2019 wearing, and an ever-growing pile of things needing mending.</p><p>Marsali laughed, deftly feeding thread to the bobbin.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d have to ask Da about that. He kens more saints than anybody. This is wonderful, this wheel! I\u2019ve not seen this kind before. However did ye come to think of such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014saw one somewhere.\u201d Bree flicked a hand, dismissing it. She had\u2014in a folk-art museum. Building it had been time-consuming\u2014she\u2019d first had to make a crude lathe, as well as soak and bend the wood for the wheel itself\u2014but not terribly difficult. \u201cRonnie Sinclair helped a lot; he knows what wood will do and what it won\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe how good you are at that, and this your first time using one like it.\u201d</p><p>Marsali snorted, likewise dismissing the compliment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spun since I was five, a piuthar. All that\u2019s different here is I can sit while I do it, instead of walking to and fro \u2019til I fall over wi\u2019 tiredness.\u201d</p><p>Her stockinged feet flickered back and forth under the hem of her dress, working the treadle. It made a pleasant whish-whir sound\u2014though this was barely audible over the babble at the other side of the room, where Roger was carving yet another car for the children.</p><p>Vrooms were a big hit with the small-fry, and the demand for them unceasing. Brianna watched with amusement as Roger fended off Jem\u2019s inquisitiveness with a deft elbow, frowning in concentration. The tip of his tongue showed between his teeth, and wood shavings littered the hearth and his clothes, and\u2014of course\u2014one was stuck in his hair, a pale curl against its darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that one?\u201d she asked, raising her voice to reach him. He looked up, his eyes a mossy green in the dim rainlight from the window behind him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a \u201957 Chevrolet pickup truck,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cHere, then, a nighean. This one\u2019s yours.\u201d He brushed a last shaving from his creation and handed the blocky thing to F\u00e9licit\u00e9, whose mouth and eyes were round with awe.</p><p>\u201cIssa vroom?\u201d she said, clutching it to her bosom. \u201cMy vroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a druck,\u201d Jemmy informed her with kindly condescension. \u201cDaddy says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA truck is a vroom,\u201d Roger assured F\u00e9licit\u00e9, seeing doubt begin to pucker her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bigger kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIssa big vroom, see!\u201d F\u00e9licit\u00e9 kicked Jem in the shin. He yelped and grabbed for her hair, only to be butted in the stomach by Joan, always there to defend her sister.</p><p>Brianna tensed, ready to intervene, but Roger broke up the incipient riot by holding Jem and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 each at arm\u2019s length, glaring Joan into retreat.</p><p>\u201cRight, you lot. No fighting, or we put the vrooms away \u2019til tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>That quelled them instantly, and Brianna felt Marsali relax, resuming the rhythm of her spinning. The rain hummed on the roof, solid and steady; it was a good day to be inside, despite the difficulty of entertaining bored children.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you play something nice and quiet?\u201d she said, grinning at Roger. \u201cLike . . . oh . . . Indianapolis 500?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a great help,\u201d he said, giving her a dirty look, but he obligingly set the children to work laying out a racetrack in chalk on the big hearthstone.</p><p>\u201cToo bad Germain\u2019s not here,\u201d he said casually. \u201cWhere\u2019s he gone in the rain and all, Marsali?\u201d Germain\u2019s vroom\u2014according to Roger, it was a Jaguar X-KE, though so far as Brianna could tell, it looked exactly like the others: a block of wood with a rudimentary cab and wheels\u2014was sitting on the mantelpiece, awaiting its master\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Fergus,\u201d Marsali answered calmly, not faltering in her rhythm. Her lips pressed together, though, and it was easy to hear the note of strain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s Fergus, then?\u201d Roger looked up at her, kindly, but intent.</p><p>The thread skipped, bounced in Marsali\u2019s hand, and wound itself up with a visible slub in it. She grimaced, and didn\u2019t reply until the thread was running once more smoothly through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWell, I will say, for a man wi\u2019 one hand, he\u2019s a bonny wee fighter,\u201d she said at last, eyes on the thread and a wry note in her voice.</p><p>Brianna glanced at Roger, who raised an eyebrow back at her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he been fighting?\u201d she asked, trying to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cHe doesna often tell me,\u201d Marsali said evenly. \u201cThough yesterday it was the husband of a woman who asked him why he didna just strangle Henri-Christian at birth. He took offense,\u201d she added, offhand, leaving it unclear as to whether it was Fergus, the husband, or both who had taken offense. Lifting the thread, she bit it sharply off.</p><p>\u201cI should think so,\u201d Roger murmured. His head was bent, marking off the starting line, so his hair fell over his forehead, obscuring his face. \u201cNot the only one, though, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marsali began winding the thread onto the niddy-noddy, a small, seemingly permanent frown showing between her fair brows. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s better than the ones who point and whisper. Those are the ones who think Henri-Christian\u2019s the\u2014the devil\u2019s seed,\u201d she finished bravely, though her voice quivered a little. \u201cI think they\u2019d burn the wee man\u2014and me and the other weans along with him, if they thought they could.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt the bottom of her stomach drop, and cuddled the object of discussion in her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of idiots could possibly think such a thing?\u201d she demanded. \u201cLet alone say it out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet alone do it, ye mean.\u201d Marsali put aside the yarn and rose, leaning over to take Henri-Christian and put him to her breast. With his knees still curled up, his body was scarcely half the size of a normal baby\u2019s\u2014and with his large, round head with its sprout of dark hair, Brianna had to admit that he did look . . . odd.</p><p>\u201cDa had a word here and there,\u201d Marsali said. Her eyes were closed, and she was rocking slowly back and forth, cradling Henri-Christian close. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that . . .\u201d Her slender throat moved as she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, let\u2019s go!\u201d Jem, impatient with incomprehensible adult conversation, plucked at Roger\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>Roger had been looking at Marsali, his lean face troubled. At this reminder, he blinked and glanced down at his thoroughly normal son, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, and took down Germain\u2019s car. \u201cWell, then, look. Here\u2019s the starting line. . . .\u201d</p><p>Brianna laid a hand on Marsali\u2019s arm. It was thin, but strongly muscled, the fair skin gold from sun, spattered with tiny freckles. The sight of it, so small and brave-looking, clutched at her throat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll stop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll see. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe.\u201d Marsali cupped Henri-Christian\u2019s small round bottom, holding him closer. Her eyes were still closed. \u201cMaybe not. But if Germain\u2019s wi\u2019 Fergus, he\u2019ll maybe be more careful who he fights. I\u2019d rather they didna kill him, aye?\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head over the baby, settling into the nursing and plainly disinclined to talk any further. Brianna patted her arm, a little awkwardly, then moved to take the seat by the spinning wheel.</p><p>She\u2019d heard the talk, of course. Or some of it. Particularly right after Henri-Christian\u2019s birth, which had sent shock waves through the Ridge. Beyond the first overt expressions of sympathy, there had been a lot of muttering, about recent events and what malign influence might have caused them\u2014from the assault on Marsali and the burning of the malting shed, to the kidnapping of her mother, the slaughter in the woods, and the birth of a dwarf. She\u2019d heard one injudicious girl murmur within her hearing something about \u201c. . . witchcraft, what would ye expect?\u201d\u2014but had rounded fiercely to glare at the girl, who had paled and slunk off with her two friends. The girl had glanced back once, though, then turned away, the three of them spitefully sniggering.</p><p>But no one had ever treated her or her mother with any lack of respect. It was clear that a number of the tenants were rather afraid of Claire\u2014but they were much more afraid of her father. Time and habituation had seemed to be working, though\u2014until the birth of Henri-Christian.</p><p>Working the treadle was soothing; the whir of the spinning wheel faded into the sound of the rain and the bickering of the children.</p><p>At least Fergus had come back. When Henri-Christian was born, he had left the house and not come back for several days. Poor Marsali, she thought, with a mental scowl at Fergus. Left alone to deal with the shock. And everyone had been shocked, her included. Perhaps she couldn\u2019t really blame Fergus.</p><p>She swallowed, imagining, as she did whenever she saw Henri-Christian, what it would be like to have a child born with some terrible defect. She saw them now and then\u2014children with cleft lips, the misshapen features of what her mother said was congenital syphilis, retarded children\u2014and every time, crossed herself and thanked God that Jemmy was normal.</p><p>But then, so were Germain and his sisters. Something like this could come out of the blue, at any time. Despite herself, she glanced at the small shelf where she kept her personal things, and the dark brown jar of dauco seeds. She\u2019d been taking them again, ever since Henri-Christian\u2019s birth, though she hadn\u2019t mentioned it to Roger. She wondered whether he knew; he hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>Marsali was singing softly under her breath. Did Marsali blame Fergus? she wondered. Or he her? She hadn\u2019t seen Fergus to talk to in some time. Marsali didn\u2019t seem critical of him\u2014and she had said she didn\u2019t want him killed. Brianna smiled involuntarily at the memory. Yet there was an undeniable sense of distance when she mentioned him.</p><p>The thread thickened suddenly, and she trod faster, trying to compensate, only to have it catch and snap. Muttering to herself, she stopped and let the wheel run itself down\u2014only then realizing that someone had been pounding on the door of the cabin for some time, the sound of it lost in the racket inside.</p><p>She opened the door to find one of the fisher-folks\u2019 children dripping on the stoop, small, bony, and feral as a wild cat. There were several of them among the tenant families, so alike that she had trouble telling them apart.</p><p>\u201cAidan?\u201d she guessed. \u201cAidan McCallum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood day, mistress,\u201d the little boy said, bobbing his head in nervous acknowledgment of identity. \u201cIs meenister to hame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMee\u2014oh. Yes, I suppose so. Come in, won\u2019t you?\u201d Suppressing a smile, she swung the door wide, beckoning him in. The boy looked quite shocked to see Roger, crouched on the floor, playing Vroom with Jemmy and Joan and F\u00e9licit\u00e9, all industriously screeching and roaring to such effect that they hadn\u2019t noticed the newcomer.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor,\u201d she said, raising her voice to interrupt the bedlam. \u201cHe wants the minister.\u201d Roger broke off in mid-vroom, glancing up in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d he said, sitting up, cross-legged, his own car in hand. Then he spotted the boy, and smiled. \u201cOh. Aidan, a charaid! What is it, then?\u201d</p><p>Aidan screwed up his face in concentration. Obviously, he had been given a specific message, committed to memory.</p><p>\u201cMither says will ye come, please,\u201d he recited, \u201cfor to drive out a de\u2019il what\u2019s got intae the milk.\u201d</p><p>THE RAIN WAS FALLING more lightly now, but they were still soaked nearly through by the time they reached the McCallum residence. If it could be dignified by such a term, Roger thought, slapping rain from his hat as he followed Aidan up the narrow, slippery path to the cabin, which was perched in a high and inconvenient notch in the side of the mountain.</p><p>Orem McCallum had managed to erect the walls of his shakily built cabin, and then had missed his footing and plunged into a rock-strewn ravine, breaking his neck within a month of arrival on the Ridge, and leaving his pregnant wife and young son to its dubious shelter.</p><p>The other men had come and hastily put a roof on, but the cabin as a whole reminded Roger of nothing so much as a pile of giant jackstraws, poised precariously on the side of the mountain and obviously only awaiting the next spring flood to slide down the mountain after its builder.</p><p>Mrs. McCallum was young and pale, and so thin that her dress flapped round her like an empty flour sack. Christ, he thought, what did they have to eat?</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, I do thank ye for coming.\u201d She bobbed an anxious curtsy to him. \u201cI\u2019m that sorry to bring ye out in the rain and all\u2014but I just didna ken what else I might do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d he assured her. \u201cEr . . . Aidan said, though, that ye wanted a minister. I\u2019m not that, ye know.\u201d</p><p>She looked disconcerted at that.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, maybe not exactly, sir. But they do say as how your faither was a minister, and that ye do ken a great deal about the Bible and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, yes,\u201d he replied guardedly, wondering what sort of emergency might require Bible knowledge. \u201cA . . . um . . . devil in your milk, was it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced discreetly from the baby in its cradle to the front of her dress, unsure at first whether she might mean her own breast milk, which would be a problem he was definitely not equipped to deal with. Fortunately, the difficulty seemed to lie with a large wooden pail sitting on the ramshackle table, a muslin cloth draped across it to keep flies out, small stones knotted into the corners as weights.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d Mrs. McCallum nodded at it, obviously afraid to go nearer. \u201cLizzie Wemyss, her from the Big House, she brought that to me last night. She said Herself said as I must give it to Aidan, and drink of it myself.\u201d She looked helplessly at Roger. He understood her reservations; even in his own time, milk was regarded as a beverage only for infants and invalids; coming from a fishing village on the Scottish coast, she had quite possibly never seen a cow before coming to America. He was sure she knew what milk was, and that it technically was edible, but she had likely never tasted any.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s quite all right,\u201d he assured her. \u201cMy family all drink milk; it makes the weans grow tall and strong.\u201d And wouldn\u2019t come amiss to a nursing mother on lean rations, which was undoubtedly what Claire had thought.</p><p>She nodded, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . aye, sir. I wasna quite sure . . . but the lad was hungry, and said he\u2019d drink it. So I went to dip him out a bit, but it\u2014\u201d She glanced at the bucket with an expression of fearful suspicion. \u201cWeel, if it\u2019s no a de\u2019il\u2019s got into it, it\u2019s something else. It\u2019s haunted, sir, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what made him look at Aidan at that moment, but he surprised a fleeting look of deep interest that vanished immediately, leaving the boy with a preternaturally solemn expression.</p><p>So it was with a certain sense of forewarning that he leaned forward and gingerly lifted the cloth. Even so, he let out a yelp and jerked back, the weighted cloth flying sideways to clack against the wall.</p><p>The malevolent green eyes that glared at him from the middle of the bucket disappeared and the milk went gollup!, a spray of creamy drops erupting from the bucket like a miniature volcano.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he said. Mrs. McCallum had backed away as far as she could get and was staring at the bucket in terror, both hands clapped across her mouth. Aidan had one hand pressed over his own mouth, and was similarly wide-eyed\u2014but a faint fizzing sound was audible from his direction.</p><p>Roger\u2019s heart was pounding from adrenaline\u2014and a strong desire to wring Aidan McCallum\u2019s scrawny neck. He wiped the splattered cream deliberately from his face, then, gritting his teeth, reached gingerly into the bucket of milk.</p><p>It took several tries to grab the thing, which felt like nothing so much as a very muscular and animated glob of mucus, but the fourth try succeeded, and he triumphantly pulled a very large and indignant bullfrog out of the bucket, showering milk in every direction.</p><p>The frog dug its back legs ferociously into his slippery palm and broke his grip, launching itself in a soaring leap that covered half the distance to the door and made Mrs. McCallum scream out loud. The startled baby woke and added to the uproar, while the cream-covered frog plopped its way rapidly out of the door and into the rain, leaving yellow splotches in its wake.</p><p>Aidan prudently followed it out at a high rate of speed.</p><p>Mrs. McCallum had sat down on the floor, thrown her apron over her head, and was having hysterics under it. The baby was shrieking, and milk dripped slowly from the edge of the table, punctuating the patter of rain outside. The roof was leaking, he saw; long wet streaks darkened the unbarked logs behind Mrs. McCallum, and she was sitting in a puddle.</p><p>With a deep sigh, he plucked the baby out of its cradle, surprising it sufficiently that it gulped and quit screaming. It blinked at him, and stuck its fist in its mouth. He had no idea of its sex; it was an anonymous bundle of rags, with a pinched wee face and a wary look.</p><p>Holding it in one arm, he crouched and put the other round Mrs. McCallum\u2019s shoulders, patting her gingerly in hopes of getting her to stop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a frog, ye know.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been moaning like a banshee and uttering small intermittent screams, and she kept doing that, though the screams became less frequent, and the moaning disintegrated at last into more or less normal crying, though she refused to come out from under the apron.</p><p>His thigh muscles were cramped from squatting, and he was wet, anyway. With a sigh, he lowered himself into the puddle beside her and sat, patting her shoulder every now and then so she\u2019d know he was still there.</p><p>The baby seemed happy enough, at least; it was sucking its fist, undisturbed by its mother\u2019s fit.</p><p>\u201cHow old\u2019s the wean?\u201d he said conversationally, during a brief pause for breath. He knew its age approximately, because it had been born a week after Orem McCallum\u2019s death\u2014but it was something to say. And for as old as it was, it seemed terribly small and light, at least by contrast to his memories of Jemmy at that age.</p><p>She mumbled something inaudible, but the crying eased off into hiccups and sighs. Then she said something else.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Mrs. McCallum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered from under the faded calico. \u201cWhy has God brought me here?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was a bloody good question; he\u2019d asked that one fairly often himself, but hadn\u2019t got back any really good answers yet.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . we trust He\u2019s got a plan of some sort,\u201d he said a little awkwardly. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine plan,\u201d she said, and sobbed once. \u201cTo bring us all this way, to this terrible place, and then take my man from me and leave me here to starve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . it\u2019s no such a terrible place,\u201d he said, unable to refute anything else in her statement. \u201cThe woods and all . . . the streams, the mountains . . . it\u2019s . . . um . . . very pretty. When it\u2019s not raining.\u201d The inanity of this actually made her laugh, though it quickly devolved into more weeping.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He put an arm round her and pulled her a little closer, both to offer comfort, and in order to make out what she was saying, under her makeshift refuge.</p><p>\u201cI miss the sea,\u201d she said very softly, and leaned her calico-swathed head against his shoulder, as though she was very tired. \u201cI never shall see it again.\u201d</p><p>She was very likely right, and he could find nothing to say in reply. They sat for some time in a silence broken only by the baby\u2019s slobbering over its fist.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let ye starve,\u201d he said at last, softly. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can promise, but I do. Ye won\u2019t starve.\u201d Muscles cramped, he got stiffly to his feet, and reached down to one of the small rough hands that lay limply in her lap. \u201cCome on, then. Get up. Ye can feed the wean, while I tidy up a bit.\u201d</p><p>THE RAIN HAD CEASED by the time he left, and the clouds had begun to drift apart, leaving patches of pale blue sky. He paused at a turn in the steep, muddy path to admire a rainbow\u2014a complete one, that arched from one side of the sky to the other, its misty colors sinking down into the dark wet green of the dripping mountainside across from him.</p><p>It was quiet, save for the splat and drip of water from the leaves and the gurgle of water running down a rocky channel near the trail.</p><p>\u201cA covenant,\u201d he said softly, out loud. \u201cWhat\u2019s the promise, then? Not a pot of gold at the end.\u201d He shook his head and went on, grabbing at branches and bushes to keep from sliding down the mountainside; he didn\u2019t want to end up like Orem McCallum, in a tangle of bones at the bottom.</p><p>He\u2019d talk to Jamie, and also to Tom Christie and Hiram Crombie. Among them, they could put out the word, and ensure the widow McCallum and her children got enough food. Folk were generous to share\u2014but someone had to ask.</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder; the crooked chimney was just visible above the trees, but no smoke came from it. They could gather enough firewood, she said\u2014but wet as it was, it would be days before they had anything that would burn. They needed a shed for the wood, and logs cut, big enough to burn for a day, not the twigs and fallen branches Aidan could carry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As though the thought had summoned him, Aidan came into view then. The boy was fishing, squatting on a rock beside a pool some thirty feet below, back turned to the trail. His shoulder blades stuck out through the worn fabric of his shirt, distinct as tiny angel wings.</p><p>The noise of the water covered Roger\u2019s footsteps as he made his way down the rocks. Very gently, he fitted his hand around the skinny, pale neck, and the bony shoulders hunched in surprise.</p><p>\u201cAidan,\u201d he said. \u201cA word wi\u2019 you, if ye please.\u201d</p><p>THE DARK CAME DOWN on All Hallows\u2019 Eve. We went to sleep to the sound of howling wind and pelting rain, and woke on the Feast of All Saints to whiteness and large soft flakes falling down and down in absolute silence. There is no more perfect stillness than the solitude in the heart of a snowstorm.</p> <p>This is the thin time, when the beloved dead draw near. The world turns inward, and the chilling air grows thick with dreams and mystery. The sky goes from a sharp clear cold where a million stars burn bright and close, to the gray-pink cloud that enfolds the earth with the promise of snow.</p><p>I took one of Bree\u2019s matches from its box and lit it, thrilling to the tiny leap of instant flame, and bent to put it to the kindling. Snow was falling, and winter had come; the season of fire. Candles and hearth fire, that lovely, leaping paradox, that destruction contained but never tamed, held at a safe distance to warm and enchant, but always, still, with that small sense of danger.</p><p>The smell of roasting pumpkins was thick and sweet in the air. Having ruled the night with fire, the jack-o\u2019-lanterns went now to a more peaceful fate as pies and compost, to join the gentle rest of the earth before renewal. I had turned the earth in my garden the day before, planting the winter seeds to sleep and swell, to dream their buried birth.</p><p>Now is the time when we reenter the womb of the world, dreaming the dreams of snow and silence. Waking to the shock of frozen lakes under waning moonlight and the cold sun burning low and blue in the branches of the ice-cased trees, returning from our brief and necessary labors to food and story, to the warmth of firelight in the dark.</p><p>Around a fire, in the dark, all truths can be told, and heard, in safety.</p> <p>I pulled on my woolen stockings, thick petticoats, my warmest shawl, and went down to poke up the kitchen fire. I stood watching wisps of steam rise from the fragrant cauldron, and felt myself turn inward. The world could go away, and we would heal.</p><p>39</p><p>I AM THE RESURRECTION</p><p>November 1773</p><p>A HAMMERING ON THE DOOR roused Roger just before dawn. Next to him, Brianna made an inarticulate noise that experience interpreted as a statement that if he didn\u2019t get up and answer the door, she would\u2014but he\u2019d regret it, and so would the unfortunate person on the other side.</p><p>Resigned, he flung back the quilt and ran a hand through his tangled hair. The air struck cold on his bare legs, and there was an icy breath of snow in the air.</p> <p>\u201cNext time I marry someone, I\u2019ll pick a lass who wakes up cheerful in the morning,\u201d he said to the hunched form beneath the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d said a muffled voice from under the pillow\u2014whose indistinct nature did nothing to disguise its hostile intonation.</p><p>The hammering was repeated, and Jemmy\u2014who did wake up cheerful in the mornings\u2014popped up in his trundle, looking like a redheaded dandelion gone to seed.</p><p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s knocking,\u201d he informed Roger.</p><p>\u201cOh, are they? Mmphm.\u201d Repressing an urge to groan, he rose and went to unbolt the door.</p><p>Hiram Crombie stood outside, looking more dour than usual in the milky half-light. Evidently not a happy riser, either, Roger reflected.</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s auld mither\u2019s passed i\u2019 the night,\u201d he informed Roger without preamble.</p><p>\u201cPassed what?\u201d asked Jemmy with interest, poking his disheveled head out from behind Roger\u2019s leg. He rubbed one eye with a fist, and yawned widely. \u201cMr. Stornaway passed a stone\u2014he showed it to me and Germain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Crombie\u2019s mother-in-law has died,\u201d Roger said, putting a quelling hand on Jem\u2019s head, with an apologetic cough toward Crombie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Mr. Crombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Mr. Crombie appeared indifferent to condolence. \u201cMurdo Lindsay says as ye ken a bit of Scripture for the burying. The wife\u2019s wonderin\u2019 would ye maybe come and say a word at the grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdo said . . . oh!\u201d The Dutch family, that was it. Jamie had forced him to speak at the graves. \u201cAye, of course.\u201d He cleared his throat by reflex; his voice was desperately hoarse\u2014as usual in the mornings, until he\u2019d had a cup of something hot. No wonder Crombie was looking dubious.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he repeated more strongly. \u201cIs there . . . er . . . anything we can do to help?\u201d</p><p>Crombie made a small negative gesture.</p><p>\u201cThe women will have her laid out by now, I expect,\u201d he said, with the briefest of glances at the mound Brianna made in the bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll start the diggin\u2019 after breakfast. With luck, we\u2019ll have her under before snow falls.\u201d He lifted a sharp chin toward an opaque sky the soft gray of Adso\u2019s belly fur, then nodded, turned on his heel, and left without further congenialities.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2014look!\u201d Roger looked down to see Jem, fingers hooked in the corners of his mouth, pulled down to simulate the inverted \u201cU\u201d of Hiram Crombie\u2019s customary expression. Small red brows wrinkled in a ferocious scowl, making the resemblance startling. Surprised into laughter, Roger gasped and choked, then coughed until he doubled over, wheezing.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Brianna had unearthed herself and was sitting up in bed, squint-eyed with sleep, but looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cAye, fine.\u201d The words came out in a thready wheeze, nearly soundless. He took a breath and hawked deeply, expectorating a repellent glob into his hand, for lack of a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cEew!\u201d said the tender wife of his bosom, recoiling.</p><p>\u201cLemme see, Daddy!\u201d said his son and heir, jostling for a look. \u201cEeew!\u201d</p><p>Roger stepped outside and wiped his hand in the wet grass by the door. It was cold out, so early, but Crombie was undoubtedly right; snow was on the way again. The air had that soft, muffled feel to it.</p><p>\u201cSo old Mrs. Wilson is dead?\u201d Brianna had come out after him, a shawl wrapped round her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Imagine coming so far, and then dying in a strange place, before you\u2019ve even had time to settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she had her family with her, at least. I expect she wouldna have wanted to be left alone to die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Bree brushed strands of hair off her cheeks; she\u2019d put her hair into a thick plait for sleeping, but a good bit of it had escaped from captivity and was waving up round her face in the cold, humid air. \u201cShould I go up there, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay our respects? He said they\u2019ve laid the old lady out already.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, white wisps of breath from her nostrils momentarily making him think of dragons.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be later than seven A.M.; it\u2019s still bloody dark out! And I don\u2019t believe for a minute that his wife and sister have been laying out the old lady by candlelight. Hiram would balk at the expense of the extra candle, for one thing. No, he felt itchy about asking a favor, so he was trying to get under your skin about your wife being a lazy slattern.\u201d</p><p>That was perceptive, Roger thought, amused\u2014particularly as she hadn\u2019t seen Crombie\u2019s eloquent glance at her recumbent form.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a slattern?\u201d Jemmy inquired, picking up instantly on anything vaguely improper-sounding.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lady who\u2019s no lady,\u201d Roger informed him. \u201cAnd a bad housekeeper, to boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the words that Mrs. Bug will wash out your mouth with soap if she hears you say it,\u201d amended his wife with ungrammatical acuity.</p><p>Roger was still attired in nothing but a nightshirt, and his legs and feet were freezing. Jem was hopping around barefoot, too, but without the slightest sign of being cold.</p><p>\u201cMummy is not one,\u201d Roger said firmly, taking Jem\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, chum, let\u2019s nip up to the privy while Mummy makes breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence,\u201d Brianna said, yawning. \u201cI\u2019ll take up a jar of honey or something to the Crombies later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go, too,\u201d Jemmy announced promptly.</p><p>Brianna hesitated for a moment, then looked at Roger and raised her brows. Jem had never seen a dead person.</p><p>Roger lifted one shoulder. It would have been a peaceful death, and it was, God knew, a fact of life on the mountain. He didn\u2019t suppose that seeing Mrs. Wilson\u2019s body would give the child nightmares\u2014though knowing Jem, it was quite likely to lead to a number of loud and embarrassing public questions. A bit of preparatory explanation might not be out of place, he reflected.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he told Jem. \u201cBut first we have to go up to the Big House after breakfast, and borrow a Bible from Grandda.\u201d</p><p>HE FOUND JAMIE at breakfast, the warm oatmeal smell of fresh parritch wrapping him like a blanket as he stepped into the kitchen. Before he could explain his errand, Mrs. Bug had sat him down with a bowl of his own, a jug of honey, a plate of savory fried bacon, hot toast dripping butter, and a fresh cup of something dark and fragrant that looked like coffee. Jem was next to him, already smeared with honey and buttered to the ears. For a traitorous instant, he wondered whether Brianna was perhaps a bit of a sluggard, though certainly never a slattern.</p><p>Then he glanced across the table at Claire, uncombed hair standing on end as she blinked sleepily at him over the toast, and generously concluded that it probably wasn\u2019t a conscious choice on Bree\u2019s part, but rather the influence of genetics.</p><p>Claire roused at once, though, when he explained his errand, between bites of bacon and toast.</p><p>\u201cOld Mrs. Wilson?\u201d she asked with interest. \u201cWhat did she die of, did Mr. Crombie say?\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, swallowing oatmeal.</p><p>\u201cOnly that she\u2019d passed in the night. I suppose they found her dead. Her heart, maybe\u2014she must have been at least eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was about five years older than I am,\u201d Claire said dryly. \u201cShe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Mmphm.\u201d Clearing his throat hurt, and he took a sip of the hot, dark stuff in his cup. It was a brew of roasted chicory and acorns, but not that bad.</p><p>\u201cI hope ye didna tell her how old you are, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie reached across and snared the last piece of toast. Mrs. Bug, ever-vigilant, whisked the plate away to refill it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that careless,\u201d Claire said, dabbing a forefinger delicately into a smear of honey and licking it. \u201cThey already think I\u2019ve made some sort of pact with the devil; if I told them my age, they\u2019d be sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Roger chuckled, but thought privately that she was right. The marks of her ordeal had nearly vanished, bruises faded and the bridge of her nose healed straight and clean. Even unkempt and puffy-eyed from sleep, she was more than handsome, with lovely skin, lushly thick curly hair, and an elegance of feature undreamt of among the Highland fisher-folk. To say nothing of the eyes, sherry-gold and startling.</p><p>Add to these natural gifts the twentieth-century practices of nutrition and hygiene\u2014she had all of her teeth, white and straight\u2014and she easily appeared a good twenty years younger than other women of her own age. He found that a comforting thought; perhaps Bree had inherited the art of aging beautifully from her mother, as well. He could always make his own breakfast, after all.</p><p>Jamie had finished his own meal and gone to fetch the Bible. He came back, laying it beside Roger\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go up with ye to the burying,\u201d he said, nodding at the book. \u201cMrs. Bug\u2014can ye maybe put up a wee basket for the Crombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone it already,\u201d she informed him, and plunked a large basket on the table before him, covered with a napkin and bulging with goodies. \u201cYe\u2019ll take it, then? I must go tell Arch and fetch my good shawl, and we\u2019ll see ye at the graveside, aye?\u201d</p><p>Brianna came in then, yawning but well-groomed, and set about making Jem presentable while Claire vanished to find cap and shawl. Roger picked up the Bible, intending to thumb through the Psalms for something suitably somber but uplifting.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Twenty-third?\u201d he said, half to himself. \u201cNice and short. Always a classic. And it does mention death, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give a eulogy?\u201d Brianna asked, interested. \u201cOr a sermon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, I hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d he said in dismay. He cleared his throat experimentally. \u201cIs there more coffee?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been to a great many funerals in Inverness presided over by the Reverend, and was well aware that the paying customers considered such an event a dismal failure unless the preaching went on for at least half an hour. Granted, beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers, and the Crombies couldn\u2019t expect\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a Protestant Bible, Da?\u201d Bree paused in the act of disentangling a piece of toast from Jemmy\u2019s hair, peering over Roger\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Surprised, he shut the cover, but she was right; King James Version, it said, the letters of the inscription nearly worn away.</p><p>\u201cIt was given to me,\u201d Jamie said. The reply was casual, but Roger glanced up; there was something odd in Jamie\u2019s voice. Brianna heard it, too; she shot her father a brief, sharp look, but his face was tranquil as he took a final bite of bacon and wiped his lips.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want a dram in your coffee, Roger Mac?\u201d he said, nodding at Roger\u2019s cup, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to offer whisky with breakfast.</p><p>In fact, the notion sounded really appealing, given the immediate prospects, but Roger shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks; I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Brianna transferred the sharp look to him. \u201cMaybe you should. For your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said shortly. He was worried about his voice himself; he didn\u2019t need solicitude from the redheaded contingent, all three of whom were giving him thoughtful looks that he interpreted as casting extreme doubt upon his speaking abilities. Whisky might help his throat, but he doubted it would do much for his preaching\u2014and the last thing he wanted was to show up at a funeral reeking of strong drink in front of a lot of strict teetotalers.</p><p>\u201cVinegar,\u201d advised Mrs. Bug, bending to take away his plate. \u201cHot vinegar\u2019s the thing. Cuts the phlegm, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet it would,\u201d Roger said, smiling despite his misgivings. \u201cBut I think I won\u2019t, Mrs. Bug, thanks.\u201d He\u2019d awakened with a slight sore throat, and hoped the consumption of breakfast would cure it. It hadn\u2019t, and the thought of drinking hot vinegar made his tonsils seize up.</p><p>He held out his cup for more chicory coffee, instead, and set his mind to the task ahead.</p><p>\u201cNow\u2014does anyone know anything about old Mrs. Wilson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Jemmy piped up confidently. Everybody laughed, and Jem looked confused, but then joined the laughter, though plainly having not the slightest idea what was funny.</p><p>\u201cGood start, sport.\u201d Roger reached out and brushed crumbs from Jemmy\u2019s shirtfront. \u201cMight be a point, at that. The Reverend had a decent sermon on something in the Epistles\u2014the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. I heard him give it more than once. What d\u2019ye think?\u201d He raised a brow at Brianna, who frowned in thought and picked up the Bible.</p><p>\u201cThat would probably work. Does this thing have a concordance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie put down his coffee cup. \u201cIt\u2019s in Romans, chapter six, though.\u201d Seeing the looks of surprise turned upon him, he flushed slightly, and jerked his head toward the Bible.</p><p>\u201cI had that book in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI read it. Come along, a bhailach, are ye ready now?\u201d</p><p>THE WEATHER WAS louring, clouds threatening anything from freezing rain to the first snow of the season, and occasional cold gusts of wind catching cloaks and skirts, bellying them out like sails. The men held tight to their hats, and the women huddled deep in their hoods, all walking with their heads down, like sheep pushing stubbornly into the wind.</p><p>\u201cGreat weather for a funeral,\u201d Brianna murmured, pulling her cloak tight around her after one such gust.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Roger responded automatically, obviously unaware of what she\u2019d said, but registering that she\u2019d spoken. His brow was furrowed, and he seemed tight-lipped and pale. She put a hand on his arm, squeezing in reassurance, and he glanced at her with a faint smile, his face easing.</p><p>An unearthly wail cut through the air, and Brianna froze, clutching Roger\u2019s arm. It rose to a shriek, then broke in a series of short, jerky gulps, coming down a scale of sobs like a dead body rolling down a staircase.</p><p>Gooseflesh prickled down her spine and her stomach clenched. She glanced at Roger; he looked nearly as pale as she felt, though he pressed her hand reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cThat will be the ban-treim,\u201d her father remarked calmly. \u201cI didna ken there was one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d said her mother. \u201cWho do you suppose it is?\u201d She had startled, too, at the sound of it, but now looked merely interested.</p><p>Roger had been holding his breath, too; he let it out now, with a small rattling sound, and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cA mourning woman,\u201d he said. The words emerged thickly, and he cleared his throat again, much harder. \u201cThey, um, keen. After the coffin.\u201d</p><p>The voice rose again out of the wood, this time with a more deliberate sound. Brianna thought there were words in the wailing, but couldn\u2019t make them out. Wendigo. The word came unbidden into her mind, and she shivered convulsively. Jemmy whimpered, trying to burrow inside his grandfather\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to fear, a bhailach.\u201d He patted Jemmy on the back. Jem appeared unconvinced, and put his thumb in his mouth, huddling round-eyed into Jamie\u2019s chest as the wailing faded into moans.</p><p>\u201cWell, come, then, we\u2019ll meet her, shall we?\u201d Jamie turned aside and began making his way into the forest, toward the voice.</p><p>There was nothing to do but follow. Brianna squeezed Roger\u2019s arm, but left him, walking close to her father so Jemmy could see her and be reassured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, pal,\u201d she said softly. The weather was growing colder; her breath puffed out in wisps of white. The end of Jemmy\u2019s nose was red and his eyes seemed a little pink around the edges\u2014was he catching a cold, too?</p><p>She put out a hand to touch his forehead, but just then the voice broke out afresh. This time, though, something seemed to have happened to it. It was a high, thready sound, not the robust keening they\u2019d heard before. And uncertain\u2014like an apprentice ghost, she thought in uneasy jest.</p><p>An apprentice it proved to be, though not a ghost. Her father ducked under a low pine and she followed him, emerging in a clearing facing two surprised women. Or rather, a woman and a teenaged girl, with shawls wrapped over their heads. She knew them, but what were their names?</p><p>\u201cMaduinn mhath, maighistear,\u201d the older woman said, recovering from her surprise and dropping into a low curtsy to Jamie. Good morn to you, sir.</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, my mistresses,\u201d he replied, also in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cGood morn, Mrs. Gwilty,\u201d Roger said in his soft, hoarse voice. \u201cAnd to you, a nighean,\u201d he added, bowing courteously to the girl. Olanna, that was it; Brianna recalled the round face, just like the \u201cO\u201d that began her name. She was Mrs. Gwilty\u2019s . . . daughter? Or her niece?</p><p>\u201cAch, bonny boy,\u201d the girl crooned, reaching out a finger to touch Jem\u2019s rounded cheek. He pulled back a little and sucked harder on his thumb, watching her suspiciously under the edge of his blue woolly bonnet.</p><p>The women spoke no English, but Brianna\u2019s Gaelic was sufficient by now to allow her to follow the conversation, if not to join fluently in it. Mrs. Gwilty was, she explained, showing her niece the way of a proper coronach.</p><p>\u201cAnd a fine job of work you will make of it between you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Jamie said politely.</p><p>Mrs. Gwilty sniffed, and gave her niece a disparaging look.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d she said. \u201cA voice like a bat farting, but she is the only woman left of my family, and I shall not live forever.\u201d</p><p>Roger made a small choking noise, which he hastily developed into a convincing cough. Olanna\u2019s pleasant round face, already flushed from the cold, went a blotchy red, but she said nothing, merely cast her eyes down and huddled deeper into her shawl. It was a dark brown homespun, Brianna saw; Mrs. Gwilty\u2019s was a fine wool, dyed black\u2014and if it was a trifle frayed around the edges, she wore it still with the dignity of her profession.</p><p>\u201cIt is sorrowful we are for you,\u201d Jamie said, in formal condolence. \u201cShe who is gone . . . ?\u201d He paused in delicate inquiry.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s sister,\u201d answered Mrs. Gwilty promptly. \u201cWoe, woe, that she should be buried among strangers.\u201d She had a lean, underfed face, the spare flesh deeply hollowed and bruised-looking round dark eyes. She turned these deep-set eyes on Jemmy, who promptly grabbed the edge of his bonnet and pulled it down over his face. Seeing the dark, bottomless eyes swivel in her direction, Brianna was hard-pressed not to do the same.</p><p>\u201cI hope\u2014that her shade will find comfort. With\u2014with your family being here,\u201d Claire said, in her halting Gaelic. It sounded most peculiar in her mother\u2019s English accent, and Brianna saw her father bite his lower lip in order not to smile.</p><p>\u201cShe will not lack company for long.\u201d Olanna blurted it out, then, catching Jamie\u2019s eye, went beet-red and buried her nose in her shawl.</p><p>This odd statement seemed to make sense to her father, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cOch, so? Who is it ails?\u201d He looked at her mother in question, but she shook her head slightly. If anyone was sick, they hadn\u2019t sought her help.</p><p>Mrs. Gwilty\u2019s long, seamed upper lip pressed down over dreadful teeth.</p><p>\u201cSeaumais Buchan,\u201d she remarked with grim satisfaction. \u201cHe lies fevered and his chest will kill him before the week is out, but we\u2019ve beaten him. A fortunate thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Claire, frowning in bewilderment.</p><p>Mrs. Gwilty\u2019s eyes narrowed at her.</p><p>\u201cThe last person buried in a graveyard must stand watch over it, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie explained in English. \u201cUntil another comes to take his place.\u201d</p><p>Switching smoothly back to Gaelic, he said, \u201cFortunate is she, and the more fortunate, in having such bean-treim to follow her.\u201d He put a hand into his pocket and handed over a coin, which Mrs. Gwilty glanced at, then blinked and looked again.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, gratified. \u201cWell, we will do our best, the girl and I. Come then, a nighean, let me hear you.\u201d</p><p>Olanna, thus pressed to perform before company, looked terrified. Under her aunt\u2019s monitory eye, though, there was no escape. Closing her eyes, she inflated her chest, thrust back her shoulders, and emitted a piercing, \u201cEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEeeeEEE-uh-Ee-uh-Ee-uh,\u201d before breaking off, gasping for breath.</p><p>Roger flinched as though the sound were bamboo splinters being shoved under his fingernails and Claire\u2019s mouth dropped open. Jemmy\u2019s shoulders were hunched up round his ears, and he clung to his grandfather\u2019s coat like a small blue bur. Even Jamie looked a little startled.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d said Mrs. Gwilty judiciously. \u201cPerhaps it will not be a complete disgrace. I am hearing that Hiram asked you to speak a word?\u201d she added with a disparaging glance at Roger.</p><p>\u201cHe has,\u201d Roger replied, still hoarse, but as firmly as possible. \u201cI am honored.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Gwilty did not reply to this, but merely looked him up and down, then, shaking her head, turned her back and raised her arms.</p><p>\u201cAaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAaaaIIIIeeeeeeee,\u201d she wailed, in a voice that made Brianna feel ice crystals in her blood. \u201cWoe, woe, woooooooooooe! AAaayaaaAAaayaaaAAhaaaaahaaa! Woe is come to the house of Crombie\u2014Woe!\u201d</p><p>Dutifully turning her back on them, as well, Olanna joined in with a descant wail of her own. Claire rather untactfully but practically put her fingers in her ears.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you give them?\u201d she asked Jamie in English.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s shoulders shook briefly, and he hastily ushered her away, a firm hand on her elbow.</p><p>Beside Brianna, Roger swallowed, the sound just audible under the noise.</p><p>\u201cYou should have had that drink,\u201d she said to him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said hoarsely, and sneezed.</p><p>\u201cHAVE YOU EVEN heard of Seaumais Buchan?\u201d I asked Jamie, as we picked our way across the sodden earth of the Crombie\u2019s dooryard. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard of him, aye,\u201d he replied, putting an arm round me to help swing me across a fetid puddle of what looked like goat urine. \u201cOof. God, you\u2019re a solid wee thing, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the basket,\u201d I replied absently. \u201cI believe Mrs. Bug\u2019s put lead shot in it. Or maybe only fruitcake. Who is he, then? One of the fisher-folk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. He\u2019s great-uncle to Maisie MacArdle, her who\u2019s marrit to him that was a boatbuilder. Ye recall her? Red hair and a verra long nose, six bairns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely. However do you remember these things?\u201d I demanded, but he merely smiled, and offered me his arm. I took it, and we strode gravely through the mud and the scattered straw laid down across it, the laird and his lady come to the funeral.</p><p>The door of the cabin was open despite the cold, to let the spirit of the dead go out. Fortunately, it also let a little light come in, as the cabin was crudely built and had no windows. It was also completely packed with people, most of whom had not bathed any time in the preceding four months.</p><p>I was no stranger to claustrophobic cabins or unwashed bodies, though, and since I knew that one of the bodies present was probably clean but certainly dead, I had already begun breathing through my mouth by the time one of the Crombie daughters, shawled and red-eyed, invited us in.</p><p>Grannie Wilson was laid out on the table with a candle at her head, wrapped in the shroud she had no doubt woven as a new bride; the linen cloth was yellowed and creased with age, but clean and soft in the candlelight, embroidered on the edges with a simple pattern of vine leaves. It had been carefully kept, brought from Scotland at the cost of who knew what pains.</p><p>Jamie paused at the door, removing his hat, and murmured formal condolences, which the Crombies, male and female, accepted with nods and grunts, respectively. I handed over the basket of food and nodded back, with what I hoped was a suitable expression of dignified sympathy, keeping an eye on Jemmy.</p><p>Brianna had done her best to explain to him, but I had no idea what he might make of the situation\u2014or the corpse. He had been persuaded with some difficulty to emerge from his bonnet, and was looking round now with interest, his cowlick standing on end.</p><p>\u201cIs that the dead lady, Grandma?\u201d he whispered loudly to me, pointing at the body.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d I said, with an uneasy glance at old Mrs. Wilson. She looked perfectly all right, though, done up properly in her best cap with a bandage under her jaw to keep her mouth closed, dry eyelids sealed against the glimmer of the candle. I didn\u2019t think Jemmy had ever met the old lady in life; there was no real reason for him to be upset at seeing her dead\u2014and he\u2019d been taken hunting regularly since he could walk; he certainly understood the concept of death. Besides, a corpse was definitely anticlimactic, after our encounter with the bean-treim. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay our respects now, lad,\u201d Jamie said quietly to him, and set him on the floor. I caught Jamie\u2019s glance at the door, where Roger and Bree were murmuring condolences in their turn, and realized he had been waiting for them to catch up, so that they could watch him, and know what to do next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He led Jemmy through the press of people, who gave way respectfully, and up to the table, where he laid his hand on the corpse\u2019s chest. Oh, so it was that sort of funeral.</p><p>At some Highland funerals, it was the custom for everyone to touch the body, so that the dead person should not haunt them. I doubted that Grannie Wilson would have any interest in haunting me, but care never hurt\u2014and I did have an uneasy memory of a skull with silver fillings in its teeth, and my encounter with what might have been its possessor, seen by corpse-light on a black mountain night. Despite myself, I glanced at the candle, but it seemed a perfectly normal thing of brown beeswax, pleasantly fragrant and leaning a little crooked in its pottery candlestick.</p><p>Steeling myself, I leaned over and laid my own hand gently on the shroud. An earthenware saucer, holding a piece of bread and a heap of salt, sat on the dead woman\u2019s chest, and a small wooden bowl filled with dark liquid\u2014wine?\u2014sat beside her on the table. What with the good beeswax candle, the salt, and the bean-treim, it looked as though Hiram Crombie was trying to do right by his late mother-in-law\u2014though I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to thriftily reuse the salt after the funeral.</p><p>Something seemed wrong, though; an air of uneasiness curled among the cracked boots and rag-wrapped feet of the crowd like the cold draft from the door. At first I had thought it might be due to our presence, but that wasn\u2019t it; there had been a brief exhalation of approval when Jamie approached the body.</p> <p>Jamie whispered to Jemmy, then boosted him up, legs dangling, to touch the corpse. He showed no reluctance, and peered into the dead woman\u2019s waxen face with interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d he asked loudly, reaching for the bread. \u201cIs she going to eat it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie grabbed his wrist, and planted his hand firmly on the shroud instead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the sin-eater, a bhailach. Leave it, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater.\u201d No one argued with Jamie when he used that tone of voice, and Jemmy subsided, putting his thumb back in his mouth as Jamie set him down. Bree came up and scooped him into her arms, belatedly remembering to touch the corpse herself, and murmur, \u201cGod rest you.\u201d</p><p>Then Roger stepped forward, and there was a stir of interest among the crowd.</p><p>He looked pale, but composed. His face was lean and rather ascetic, usually saved from sternness by the gentleness of his eyes and a mobile mouth, ready to laugh. This was no time for laughter, though, and his eyes were bleak in the dim light.</p><p>He laid a hand on the dead woman\u2019s chest, and bowed his head. I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was praying for the repose of her soul, or for inspiration, but he stayed that way for more than minute. The crowd watched respectfully, with no sound save coughs and the clearing of throats. Roger wasn\u2019t the only one catching a cold, I thought\u2014and thought suddenly again of Seaumais Buchan.</p><p>\u201cHe lies fevered and his chest will kill him before the week is out.\u201d So Mrs. Gwilty had said. Pneumonia, perhaps\u2014or bronchitis, or even consumption. And no one had told me.</p><p>I felt a slight pang at that, equal parts annoyance, guilt, and unease. I knew the new tenants didn\u2019t yet trust me; I had thought that I should allow them to get used to me before I started dropping in on them at random. Many of them would never have seen an English person, before coming to the colonies\u2014and I was well aware of their attitude toward both Sassenachs and Catholics.</p> <p>But evidently there was now a man dying virtually on my doorstep\u2014and I hadn\u2019t even known of his existence, let alone his illness.</p><p>Should I go to see him, as soon as the funeral was over? But where in bloody hell did the man live? It couldn\u2019t be very close; I did know all the fisher-folk who had settled down the mountain; the MacArdles must be up across the ridge. I stole a look at the door, trying to judge how soon the threatening clouds would cut loose their burden of snow.</p><p>There were shufflings and the murmurs of low speech outside; more people had arrived, coming up from the nearby hollows, crowding round the door. I caught the words, \u201cd\u00e8an caithris,\u201d in a questioning tone, and suddenly realized what was odd about the present occasion.</p><p>There was no wake. Customarily, the body would have been washed and laid out, but then kept on display for a day or two, to allow everyone in the area time to come and pay their regards. Listening intently, I caught a distinct tone of disgruntlement and surprise\u2014the neighbors thought this haste unseemly.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a wake?\u201d I whispered to Jamie. He lifted one shoulder a fraction of an inch, but nodded toward the door, and the muffled sky beyond.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a great deal of snow by nightfall, a Sorcha,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd likely to go on for days, by the looks of it. I wouldna want to be having to dig a grave and bury a coffin in the midst of that, myself. And should it snow for days, where are they to put the body in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Mac Dubh,\u201d said Kenny Lindsay, overhearing. He glanced round at the people near us, and edged closer, lowering his voice. \u201cBut it\u2019s true, too, as Hiram Crombie\u2019s no owerfond of the auld bes\u2014er, his good-mother.\u201d He raised his chin a fraction, indicating the corpse. \u201cSome say as he canna get the auld woman underground fast enough\u2014before she changes her mind, aye?\u201d He grinned briefly, and Jamie hid his own smile, looking down.</p><p>\u201cSaves a bit on the food, too, I suppose.\u201d Hiram\u2019s reputation as a cheapskate was well-known\u2014which was saying something, among the thrifty but hospitable Highlanders.</p> <p>A fresh bustle was taking place outside, as new arrivals came. There was a sort of congestion at the door, as someone sought to press inside, though the house was filled shoulder to shoulder, with the only bit of open floor space left under the table on which Mrs. Wilson reposed.</p><p>The people near the door gave way reluctantly, and Mrs. Bug surged into the cabin, arrayed in her best cap and shawl, Arch at her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYe forgot the whisky, sir,\u201d she informed Jamie, handing him a corked bottle. Looking round, she at once spotted the Crombies and bowed to them ceremoniously, murmuring sympathy. Bobbing upright, she set her cap straight and looked expectantly round. Clearly, the festivities could now commence.</p><p>Hiram Crombie glanced round, then nodded to Roger.</p><p>Roger drew himself up slightly, nodded back, and began. He spoke simply for a few minutes, generalities about the preciousness of life, the enormity of death, and the importance of kin and neighbors in facing such things. This all seemed to be going over well with the punters, who were nodding slightly in approval and seemed to be settling down in expectation of decent entertainment.</p><p>Roger paused to cough and blow his nose, then shifted into what appeared to be some version of the Presbyterian funeral service\u2014or what he recalled of it, from his life with the Reverend Wakefield.</p><p>This too seemed to be acceptable. Bree seemed to relax a little, and put Jemmy down.</p><p>It was going well . . . and yet I was still conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness. Part of that, of course, was that I could see Roger. The growing warmth of the cabin was making his nose run; he kept his handkerchief in his hand, dabbing furtively and now and then stopping to blow his nose as discreetly as possible.</p><p>Phlegm, though, runs downhill. And as the congestion got worse, it began to affect his vulnerable throat. The choked note in his voice, always present, was getting noticeably worse. He was having to clear his throat repeatedly, in order to speak.</p><p>Beside me, Jemmy stirred restively, and from the corner of my eye, I saw Bree put a hand on his head to quiet him. He looked up at her, but her attention was fixed anxiously on Roger.</p><p>\u201cWe give thanks to God for the life of this woman,\u201d he said, and paused to clear his throat\u2014again. I found myself doing it with him in sheer nervous sympathy.</p><p>\u201cShe is a servant of God, faithful and true, and now praises Him before His throne, with the sa\u2014\u201d I saw sudden doubt flicker across his face as to whether his present congregation countenanced the concept of saints, or would consider such a mention to be Romish heresy. He coughed, and resumed, \u201cWith the angels.\u201d</p><p>Evidently angels were innocuous; the faces around me looked somber, but unoffended. Exhaling visibly, Roger picked up the little green Bible and opened it at a marked page.</p><p>\u201cLet us speak together a psalm in praise of Him who\u2014\u201d He glanced at the page and, too late, realized the difficulty of translating an English psalm into Gaelic on the wing.</p><p>He cleared his throat explosively, and half a dozen throats among the crowd echoed him in reflex. On my other side, Jamie murmured, \u201cOh, God,\u201d in heartfelt prayer.</p><p>Jemmy tugged at his mother\u2019s skirt, whispering something, but was peremptorily shushed. I could see Bree yearning toward Roger, body tensed in the urgent desire to help somehow, if only by mental telepathy.</p><p>With no alternative in sight, Roger began to read the psalm, haltingly. Half the crowd had taken him at his word when he invited them to \u201cspeak together,\u201d and were reciting the psalm from memory\u2014several times faster than he could read.</p><p>I closed my eyes, unable to watch, but there was no way to avoid hearing, as the congregation ripped through the psalm and fell silent, waiting in dour patience for Roger to stumble his way to the end. Which he did, doggedly.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d said Jamie loudly. And alone. I opened my eyes to find everyone staring at us, with looks ranging from mild surprise to glowering hostility. Jamie took a deep breath and let it out, very slowly.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Christ,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>A bead of sweat ran down Roger\u2019s cheek, and he wiped it away with the sleeve of his coat.</p><p>\u201cWould anyone wish to say a few words regarding the deceased?\u201d he asked, glancing from face to face. Silence and the whine of the wind answered him.</p><p>He cleared his throat, and someone snickered.</p><p>\u201cGrannie\u2014\u201d whispered Jemmy, tugging on my skirt.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Grandma\u2014\u201d The sense of urgency in his voice made me turn and look down at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go to the privy?\u201d I whispered, bending down to him. He shook his head, violently enough to make the heavy mop of red-gold hair flop to and fro on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cO, God, our Heavenly Father, who art leading us through the changes of time to the rest and blessedness of eternity, be Thou near to us now, to comfort and to uphold.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up, to see that Roger had laid his hand once more on the corpse, evidently deciding to bring the proceedings to a close. From the relief evident in his face and voice, I thought he must be falling back on some accustomed prayer from the Book of Common Worship, familiar enough to him that he could manage it with fair fluency in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cMake us to know that Thy children are precious in Thy sight. . . .\u201d He stopped, visibly struggling; the muscles of his throat worked, trying vainly to clear the obstruction in silence, but it was no good.</p><p>\u201cErr . . . HRRM!\u201d A sound, not quite laughter, ran through the room, and Bree made a small rumbling noise in her own throat, like a volcano getting ready to spew lava.</p><p>\u201cGrannie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . thy sight. That they . . . live evermore with Thee and that Thy mercy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrannie!\u201d</p><p>Jemmy was wiggling as though a colony of ants had taken up residence in his breeches, an expression of agonized urgency on his face.</p><p>\u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead . . . rr-hm . . . yet shall he live\u2014\u201d With the end in sight, Roger was making a gallant finish, forcing his voice past its limits, hoarser than ever and cracking on every other word, but firm and loud.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d I hissed. \u201cI\u2019ll take you out in a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Grannie! Look!\u201d</p><p>I followed his outthrust finger, and for a moment, thought he was pointing at his father. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Old Mrs. Wilson had opened her eyes.</p><p>THERE WAS AN INSTANT\u2019S silence, as everyone\u2019s eyes fastened at once on Mrs. Wilson. Then there was a collective gasp, and an instinctive stepping back, with shrieks of dismay and cries of pain as toes were trodden on and people squashed against the unyielding rough logs of the walls.</p><p>Jamie grabbed Jemmy up off the floor in time to save his being crushed, inflated his lungs, and bellowed, \u201cSheas!\u201d at the top of his voice. Such was his volume that the crowd did indeed freeze momentarily\u2014long enough for him to thrust Jemmy into Brianna\u2019s arms and elbow his way toward the table.</p><p>Roger had got hold of the erstwhile corpse, and was lifting her into a sitting position, her hand feebly flapping at the bandage round her jaws. I pushed after Jamie, ruthlessly shoving people out of the way.</p><p>\u201cGive her a bit of air, please,\u201d I said, raising my voice. The stunned silence was giving way to a rising murmur of excitement, but this quelled as I fumbled to untie the bandage. The room waited in quivering expectation as the corpse worked stiff jaws.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d she said in a quavering voice. Her gaze passed disbelievingly round the room, settling at last on her daughter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cMairi?\u201d she said dubiously, and Mrs. Crombie rushed forward and fell on her knees, bursting into tears as she gripped her mother\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cA M\u00e0thair! A M\u00e0thair!\u201d she cried. The old woman set a trembling hand on her daughter\u2019s hair, looking as though she were not quite sure she was real.</p><p>I, meanwhile, had been doing my best to check the old lady\u2019s vital signs, which were not all that vital, but nonetheless fairly good for someone who had been dead a moment before. Respiration very shallow, labored, a color like week-old oatmeal, cold, clammy skin despite the heat in the room, and I couldn\u2019t find a pulse at all\u2014though plainly she must have one. Mustn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She put a trembling hand to her belly.</p><p>\u201cI do feel that wee bit poorly,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I put my own hand on her abdomen, and felt it instantly. A pulse, where no pulse should be. It was irregular, stumbling, and bumping\u2014but most assuredly there.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t say it loudly, but Mrs. Crombie gasped, and I saw her apron twitch, as she doubtless made the horns beneath it.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t time to bother with apology, but stood and grabbed Roger by the sleeve, pulling him aside.</p><p>\u201cShe has an aortic aneurysm,\u201d I said to him very softly. \u201cShe must have been bleeding internally for some time, enough to make her lose consciousness and seem cold. It\u2019s going to rupture very soon, and then she\u2019ll die for real.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed audibly, his face very pale, but said only, \u201cDo you know how long?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Mrs. Wilson; her face was the same gray as the snow-laden sky, and her eyes were going in and out of focus like the flickering of a candle in a wind.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Roger said, though I hadn\u2019t spoken. He took a deep breath and cleared his throat.</p><p>The crowd, which had been hissing amongst themselves like a flock of agitated geese, ceased at once. Every eye in the place was riveted on the tableau before them.</p><p>\u201cThis our sister has been restored to life, as we all shall be one day by the grace of God,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cIt is a sign to us, of hope and faith. She will go soon again to the arms of the angels, but has come back to us for a moment, to bring us assurance of God\u2019s love.\u201d He paused a moment, obviously groping for something further to say. He cleared his throat and bent his head toward Mrs. Wilson\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . wish to say anything, O, mother?\u201d he whispered in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d Mrs. Wilson seemed to be gaining strength\u2014and with it, indignation. A faint pinkness showed in her waxy cheeks as she glared round at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of wake is this, Hiram Crombie?\u201d she demanded, fixing her son-in-law with a gimlet eye. \u201cI see nay food laid out, nay drink\u2014and what is this?\u201d Her voice rose in a furious squeak, her eye having fallen on the plate of bread and salt, which Roger had hastily set aside when he lifted her.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d She looked wildly round at the assembled crowd, and the truth of it dawned upon her. Her sunken eyes bulged. \u201cWhy . . . ye shameless skinflint! This is nay wake at all! Ye\u2019ve meant to bury me wi\u2019 nothing but a crust o\u2019 bread and a drap o\u2019 wine for the sin-eater, and a wonder ye spared that! Nay doot ye\u2019ll thieve the winding claes from my corpse to make cloots for your snotty-nosed bairns, and where\u2019s my good brooch I said I wanted to be buried with?\u201d One scrawny hand closed on her shrunken bosom, catching a fistful of wilted linen.</p><p>\u201cMairi! My brooch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is, Mother, here it is!\u201d Poor Mrs. Crombie, altogether undone, was fumbling in her pocket, sobbing and gasping. \u201cI put it away to be safe\u2014I meant to put it on ye before\u2014before . . .\u201d She came out with an ugly lump of garnets, which her mother snatched from her, cradling it against her breast, and glaring round with jealous suspicion. Clearly she suspected her neighbors of waiting the chance to steal it from her body; I heard an offended inhalation from the woman standing behind me, but had no time to turn and see who it was.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d I said, using my best soothing bedside manner. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be all right.\u201d Aside from the fact that you\u2019re going to die in the next few minutes, that is, I thought, suppressing a hysterical urge to laugh inappropriately. Actually, it might be in the next few seconds, if her blood pressure rose any higher.</p><p>I had my fingers on the thumping big pulse in her abdomen that betrayed the fatal weakening of her abdominal aorta. It had to have begun to leak already, to make her lose consciousness to such a degree as to seem dead. Eventually, she would simply blow a gasket, and that would be it.</p><p>Roger and Jamie were both doing their best to soothe her, muttering in English and Gaelic and patting her comfortingly. She seemed to be responding to this treatment, though still breathing like a steam engine.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s production of the bottle of whisky from his pocket helped still further.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more like it!\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, somewhat mollified, as he hastily pulled the cork and waved the bottle under her nose so she could appreciate the quality of it. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ve brought food, too?\u201d Mrs. Bug had bustled her way to the front, basket held before her like a battering ram. \u201cHmph! I never thought I should live to see Papists kinder than my ain kin!\u201d This last was directed at Hiram Crombie, who had so far been opening and closing his mouth, without finding anything whatever to say in reply to his mother-in-law\u2019s tirade.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . why . . .\u201d he stammered in outrage, torn between shock, obvious fury, and a need to justify himself before his neighbors. \u201cKinder than your ain kin! Why, have I not given ye a hame, these twenty years past? Fed and clothed ye as ye were my ain mither? B-borne your wicked tongue and foul t-tempers for years, and never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie and Roger both leapt in to try to stifle him, but instead interrupted each other, and in the confusion, Hiram was allowed to go on speaking his mind, which he did. So did Mrs. Wilson, who was no slouch at invective, either.</p><p>The pulse in her belly was throbbing under my hand, and I was hard put to it to keep her from leaping off the table and dotting Hiram with the bottle of whisky. The neighbors were agog.</p><p>Roger took matters\u2014and Mrs. Wilson\u2014firmly into his own hands, seizing her by her scrawny shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wilson,\u201d he said hoarsely, but loudly enough to drown Hiram\u2019s indignant rebuttal of Mrs. Wilson\u2019s most recent depiction of his character. \u201cMrs. Wilson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d She paused for breath, blinking up at him in momentary confusion.</p><p>\u201cCease. And you, too!\u201d He glared at Hiram, who was opening his mouth again. Hiram shut it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll no have this,\u201d Roger said, and thumped the Bible down on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not fitting, and I\u2019ll not have it, d\u2019ye hear me?\u201d He glowered from one to the other of the combatants, black brows low and fierce.</p><p>The room was silent, bar Hiram\u2019s heavy breathing, Mrs. Crombie\u2019s small sobs, and Mrs. Wilson\u2019s faint, asthmatic wheeze.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d Roger said, still glaring round to prevent any further interruptions. He put a hand over Mrs. Wilson\u2019s thin, age-spotted one.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wilson\u2014d\u2019ye not ken that you stand before God this minute?\u201d He darted a look at me, and I nodded; yes, she was definitely going to die. Her head was wobbling on her neck and the glow of anger fading from her eyes, even as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cGod is near to us,\u201d he said, lifting his head to address the congregation at large. He repeated this in Gaelic, and there was a sort of collective sigh. He narrowed his eyes at them.</p><p>\u201cWe will not profane this holy occasion with anger nor bitterness. Now\u2014sister.\u201d He squeezed her hand gently. \u201cCompose your soul. God will\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Mrs. Wilson was no longer listening. Her withered mouth dropped open in horror.</p><p>\u201cThe sin-eater!\u201d she cried, looking wildly round. She grabbed the dish from the table next to her, showering salt down the front of her winding-sheet. \u201cWhere is the sin-eater?\u201d</p><p>Hiram stiffened as though goosed with a red-hot poker, then whirled and fought his way toward the door, the crowd giving way before him. Murmurs of speculation rose in his wake, only to stop abruptly as a piercing wail rose from outside, another rising behind it as the first one fell.</p><p>An awed \u201coooh!\u201d rose from the crowd, and Mrs. Wilson looked gratified, as the bean-treim started in to earn their money in earnest.</p><p>Then there was a stirring near the door, and the crowd parted like the Red Sea, leaving a narrow path to the table. Mrs. Wilson sat bolt upright, dead-white and barely breathing. The pulse in her abdomen skittered and jumped under my fingers. Roger and Jamie had hold of her arms, supporting her.</p><p>A complete hush had fallen over the room; the only sounds were the howling of the bean-treim\u2014and slow, shuffling footsteps, soft on the ground outside, then suddenly louder on the boards of the floor. The sin-eater had arrived.</p><p>He was a tall man, or had been, once. It was impossible to tell his age; either years or illness had eaten away his flesh, so that his wide shoulders bowed and his spine had hunched, a gaunt head poking forward, crowned with a balding straggle of graying strands.</p><p>I glanced up at Jamie, eyebrows raised. I had never seen the man before. He shrugged slightly; he didn\u2019t know him, either. As the sin-eater came closer, I saw that his body was crooked; he seemed caved in on one side, ribs perhaps crushed by some accident.</p><p>Every eye was fixed on the man, but he met none of them, keeping his gaze focused on the floor. The path to the table was narrow, but the people shrank back as he passed, careful that he should not touch them. Only when he reached the table did he lift his head, and I saw that one eye was missing, evidently clawed away by a bear, judging from the welted mass of scar tissue.</p><p>The other one was working; he halted in surprise, seeing Mrs. Wilson, and glanced round, obviously unsure what to do next.</p><p>She wiggled one arm free of Roger\u2019s grip and pushed the dish containing the bread and salt toward him.</p><p>\u201cGet on, then,\u201d she said, her voice high and a little frightened.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not dead.\u201d It was a soft, educated voice, betraying only puzzlement, but the crowd reacted as though it had been the hissing of a serpent, and recoiled further, if such a thing were possible.</p><p>\u201cWell, what of it?\u201d Agitation was making Mrs. Wilson tremble even more; I could feel a small constant vibration through the table. \u201cYe\u2019ve been paid to eat my sins\u2014be after doing it, then!\u201d A thought occurred to her and she jerked upright, squinting at her son-in-law. \u201cYe did pay him, Hiram?\u201d</p><p>Hiram was still flushed from the previous exchanges, but went a sort of puce at this, and clutched his side\u2014clutching at his purse, I thought, rather than his heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no going to pay him before he\u2019s done the job,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat sort of way is that to be carrying on?\u201d</p><p>Seeing renewed riot about to break out, Jamie let go his hold on Mrs. Wilson and fumbled hastily in his sporran, emerging with a silver shilling, which he thrust across the table toward the sin-eater\u2014though careful, I saw, not to touch the man.</p><p>\u201cNow ye\u2019ve been paid,\u201d he said gruffly, nodding to him. \u201cBest be about your business, sir.\u201d</p><p>The man looked slowly round the room, and the intake of breath from the crowd was audible, even over the wails of \u201cWOOOOOOOOOOOEEEE to the house of CROMMMMBIIIEEEEEE\u201d going on outside.</p><p>He was standing no more than a foot away from me, close enough that I could smell the sweet-sour odor of him: ancient sweat and dirt in his rags, and something else, some faint aroma that spoke of pustulant sores and unhealed wounds. He turned his head and looked straight at me. It was a soft brown eye, amber in color, and startlingly like my own. Meeting his gaze gave me a queer feeling in the pit of the stomach, as though I looked for a moment into a distorting mirror, and saw that cruelly misshapen face replace my own.</p><p>He did not change expression, and yet I felt something nameless pass between us. Then he turned his head away, and reached out a long, weathered, very dirty hand to pick up the piece of bread.</p><p>A sort of sigh went through the room as he ate\u2014slowly gumming the bread, for he had few teeth. I could feel Mrs. Wilson\u2019s pulse, much lighter now, and fast, like a hummingbird\u2019s. She hung nearly limp in the men\u2019s grasp, the withered lids of her eyes drooping as she watched.</p><p>He wrapped both hands around the cup of wine, as though it were a chalice, and drank it down, eyes closed. He set the empty cup down and looked at Mrs. Wilson, curiously. I supposed he never had met one of his clients alive before, and wondered how long he had fulfilled this strange office.</p><p>Mrs. Wilson stared into his eyes, face blank as a child\u2019s. Her abdominal pulse was skipping like a stone, a few light beats, a pause, then a thump that struck my palm like a blow, and back to its erratic jumps.</p><p>The sin-eater bowed to her, very slowly. Then he turned round, and scampered for the door, with amazing speed for such an infirm specimen.</p><p>Several of the boys and younger men near the door rushed out after him, yelling; one or two seized sticks of wood from the fire basket by the hearth. Others were torn; they glanced toward the open door, where shouts and the thumps of thrown stones mingled with the wailing of the bean-treim\u2014but their eyes were drawn back ineluctably to Mrs. Wilson.</p><p>She looked . . . peaceful, was the only word. It was no surprise whatever to feel the pulse beneath my hand simply stop. Somewhere deeper, in my own depths, I felt the dizzying rush of the hemorrhage begin, a flooding warmth that pulled me into it, made black spots whirl before my eyes, and caused a ringing in my ears. I knew to all intents and purposes she had now died for good. I felt her go. And yet I heard her voice above the racket, very small but calm and clear.</p><p>\u201cI forgive ye, Hiram,\u201d she said. \u201cYe\u2019ve been a good lad.\u201d</p><p>My vision had gone dark, but I could still hear and sense things dimly. Something grasped me, pulled me away, and a moment later I came to myself, leaning against Jamie in a corner, his arms supporting me.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d he was saying urgently, shaking me a little and patting my cheek.</p><p>The black-clad bean-treim had come as far as the door. I could see them outside, standing like twin pillars of darkness, falling snow beginning to whirl round them as the cold wind came inside, small hard dry flakes skittering and bouncing in its wake across the floor. The women\u2019s voices rose and fell, blending with the wind. By the table, Hiram Crombie was trying to fix his mother-in-law\u2019s garnet brooch to her shroud, though his hands shook and his narrow face was wet with tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said faintly, then \u201cyes\u201d a little stronger. \u201cEverything is all right now.\u201d</p><p>PART SIX</p><p>On the Mountain</p><p>40</p> <p>BIRD-SPRING</p><p>March 1774</p><p>IT WAS SPRING, and the long months of desolation melted into running water, with streamlets pouring from every hill and miniature waterfalls leaping from stone to stone to stone.</p><p>The air was filled with the racket of birds, a cacophony of melody that replaced the lonely calling of geese passing by far overhead.</p><p>Birds go one by one in the winter, a single raven hunched brooding in a barren tree, an owl fluffed against the cold in the high, dark shadows of a barn. Or they go in flocks, a massed thunder of wings to bear them up and away, wheeling through the sky like handsful of pepper grains thrown aloft, calling their way in Vs of mournful courage toward the promise of a distant and problematic survival.</p> <p>In winter, the raptors draw apart unto themselves; the songbirds flee away, all the color of the feathered world reduced to the brutal simplification of predator and prey, gray shadows passing overhead, with no more than a small bright drop of blood fallen back to earth here and there to mark the passing of life, leaving a drift of scattered feathers, borne on the wind.</p><p>But as spring blooms, the birds grow drunk with love and the bushes riot with their songs. Far, far into the night, darkness mutes but does not silence them, and small melodious conversations break out at all hours, invisible and strangely intimate in the dead of night, as though one overheard the lovemaking of strangers in the room next door.</p><p>I moved closer to Jamie, hearing the clear, sweet song of a thrush in the great red spruce that stood behind the house. It was still cold at night, but not with the bitter chill of winter; rather with the sweet fresh cold of thawing earth and springing leaves, a cold that sent the blood tingling and made warm bodies seek one another, nesting.</p><p>A rumbling snore echoed across the landing\u2014another harbinger of spring. Major MacDonald, who had arrived mud-caked and wind-bitten the night before, bringing unwelcome news of the outside world.</p><p>Jamie stirred briefly at the sound, groaned, farted briefly, and lay still. He\u2019d stayed up late, entertaining the Major\u2014if entertainment was the word for it.</p><p>I could hear Lizzie and Mrs. Bug in the kitchen below, talking as they banged pots and slammed doors in hopes of rousing us. Breakfast smells began to rise up the stairs, enticing, the bitter smell of roasting chicory spicing the thick warmth of buttered porridge.</p> <p>The sound of Jamie\u2019s breathing had changed, and I knew he was awake, though he still lay with his eyes closed. I didn\u2019t know whether this denoted an urge to continue the physical pleasure of sleep\u2014or a marked disinclination to get up and deal with Major MacDonald.</p><p>He resolved this doubt at once by rolling over, enveloping me in his arms, and moving his lower body against mine in a manner that made it obvious that, while physical pleasure was what was on his mind, he was quite through sleeping.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t reached the point of coherent speech yet, though, and nuzzled my ear, making small interrogatory hums in his throat. Well, the Major was still asleep, and the coffee\u2014such as it was\u2014wouldn\u2019t be ready for a bit. I hummed back, reached to the bedside table for a bit of almond cream, and commenced a slow and pleasurable rummage through the layers of bedclothes and nightshirt to apply it.</p><p>Some small while later, snorts and thumps across the hall denoted the resurrection of Major MacDonald, and the delectable scents of frying ham and potatoes with onions had joined the throng of olfactory stimuli. The sweet smell of almond cream was stronger, though.</p><p>\u201cGreased lightning,\u201d Jamie said with a drowsy air of satisfaction. He was still in bed, lying on his side to watch me dress.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turned from my looking glass to eye him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, I suppose. Or were ye not thunderstruck, there at the end?\u201d He laughed, almost silently, rustling the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve been talking to Bree again,\u201d I said tolerantly. I turned back to the glass. \u201cThat particular figure of speech is a metaphor for extreme speed, not lubricated brilliance.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him in the glass as I brushed knots out of my hair. He had unplaited it while I was anointing him, and subsequent exertions had caused it to explode. Come to think, it did faintly resemble the effects of electrocution.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can be fast, too,\u201d he said judiciously, sitting up and rubbing a hand through his own hair. \u201cBut not first thing in the morning. There are worse ways to wake up, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, much worse.\u201d Sounds of hawking and spitting came from across the landing, followed by the distinctive sound of someone with very vigorous bladder function employing a chamber pot. \u201cIs he staying long, did he say?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head. Rising slowly, he stretched himself like a cat and then came across in his shirt to put his arms around me. I hadn\u2019t yet poked up the fire, and the room was chilly; his body was pleasantly warm.</p><p>He rested his chin on top of my head, regarding our stacked reflections in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to go,\u201d he said softly. \u201cTomorrow, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened a little, brush in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere? To the Indians?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes on mine.</p><p>\u201cMacDonald brought newspapers, wi\u2019 the text of letters from Governor Martin to various people\u2014Tryon in New York, General Gage\u2014asking help. He\u2019s losing his grip upon the colony\u2014insofar as he ever had one\u2014and is seriously thinking of arming the Indians. Though that bit of information hasna made it into the newspapers, and a good thing, too.\u201d</p><p>He released me, and reached for the drawer where his clean shirts and stockings stayed.</p><p>\u201cThat is a good thing,\u201d I said, bundling back my hair and hunting for a ribbon to tie it with. We\u2019d seen few newspapers through the winter, but even so, the level of disagreement between the Governor and the Assembly was clear; he\u2019d resorted to a practice of continuous proroguing, repeatedly dismissing the Assembly in order to prevent them passing legislation at odds with his desires.</p><p>I could well imagine what the public response would be to the revelation that he contemplated arming the Cherokee, Catawba, and Creek, and inciting them against his own people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that he isn\u2019t actually going to do that,\u201d I said, finding the blue ribbon I was looking for, \u201cbecause if he had\u2014does, I mean\u2014the Revolution would have got going in North Carolina right now, rather than in Massachusetts or Philadelphia two years from now. But why on earth is he publishing these letters in the newspaper?\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed. He shook his head, pushing back the disheveled hair from his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not. Evidently, the Governor\u2019s mail is being intercepted. He\u2019s no verra pleased about it, MacDonald says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay not.\u201d Mail was notoriously insecure, and always had been. In fact, we had originally acquired Fergus when Jamie hired him as a pickpocket, in order to steal letters in Paris. \u201cHow is Fergus doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jamie made a small grimace, pulling on his stockings.</p><p>\u201cBetter, I think. Marsali says he\u2019s staying more to home, which is good. And he\u2019s earning a wee bit, teaching French to Hiram Crombie. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiram? French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cHiram\u2019s set upon the idea that he must go and preach to the Indians, and he thinks he\u2019ll be best equipped to manage if he\u2019s got some French as well as English. Ian\u2019s teaching him a bit of the Tsalagi, too, but there are so many Indian tongues, he\u2019d never learn them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill wonders never cease,\u201d I murmured. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>I was interrupted at this point by Mrs. Bug bellowing up the stairs, \u201cIf Certain Persons are wantin\u2019 to let a good breakfast be spoilt, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re welcome!\u201d</p><p>Like clockwork, Major MacDonald\u2019s door popped open, and his feet clattered eagerly down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I said to Jamie. He seized my hairbrush and tidied himself with a few licks, then came to open the door and bowed, ushering me ceremoniously out.</p><p>\u201cWhat ye said, Sassenach,\u201d he said as he followed me down the stair. \u201cAbout it starting in two years. It\u2019s already well begun. Ye know that, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said, rather grimly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to think about it on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>ROGER STOOD UP straight, measuring. The edge of the kiln pit he stood in came just under his chin. Six feet would be just about at eye level; only a few more inches, then. That was heartening. Setting the shovel against the dirt wall, he stooped, grabbed a wooden bucket full of earth, and heaved it up over the rim.</p><p>\u201cDirt!\u201d he yelled. There was no response to his shout. He rose on his toes, peering balefully round for his so-called assistants. Jemmy and Germain were meant to be taking it in turn to empty the buckets and pass them back down to him, but had a tendency to vanish abruptly.</p><p>\u201cDirt!\u201d he shouted as loudly as he could. The wee buggers couldn\u2019t have gone far; it took him less than two minutes to fill a bucket.</p><p>This call was answered, but not by the boys. A cold shadow fell over him, and he squinted up to see the silhouette of his father-in-law, stooping to grab the handle of the bucket. Jamie strode two paces and flung the dirt onto the slowly mounting heap, then came back, hopping down into the pit to return it.</p><p>\u201cA tidy wee hole ye have here,\u201d he said, turning round to survey it. \u201cYe could barbecue an ox in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need one. I\u2019m starving.\u201d Roger wiped a sleeve across his forehead; the spring day was cool and crisp, but he was drenched with sweat.</p><p>Jamie had picked up his shovel and was examining the blade with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the like. Is it the lass\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a bit of help from Dai Jones, aye.\u201d It had taken roughly thirty seconds\u2019 work with an eighteenth-century shovel to convince Brianna that improvements could be made. It had taken three months to acquire a chunk of iron that could be shaped to her directions by the blacksmith and to persuade Dai Jones\u2014who was Welsh and thus by definition stubborn\u2014into doing it. The normal spade was made of wood, and looked like nothing so much as a roof shingle attached to a pole.</p><p>\u201cMay I try?\u201d Enchanted, Jamie drove the pointed end of the new spade into the dirt at his feet.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>Roger scrambled up out of the deep part of the pit into the shallower end of the kiln. Jamie stood in the part where the fire would go, according to Brianna, with a chimney to be raised over it. Items to be fired would sit in the longer, relatively shallow part of the pit and be covered over. After a week of shoveling, Roger was less inclined to think the distant possibility of plumbing was worth all the labor involved, but Bree wanted it\u2014and like her father, Bree was difficult to resist, though their methods varied.</p><p>Jamie shoveled briskly, tossing spadesful of dirt into the bucket, with small exclamations of delight and admiration at the ease and speed with which dirt could be dug. Despite his dim view of the occupation, Roger felt a sense of pride in his wife\u2019s implement.</p><p>\u201cFirst the wee matchsticks,\u201d Jamie said, making a joke of it, \u201cnow shovels. What will she think of next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask,\u201d Roger said, with a tinge of rue that made Jamie laugh.</p><p>The bucket filled, Roger picked it up and took it to empty, while Jamie filled the second. And without spoken agreement, they continued the job, Jamie digging, Roger carrying, finishing in what seemed no time at all.</p><p>Jamie climbed out of the pit and joined Roger on the edge, looking down at their handiwork in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it doesna work well as a kiln,\u201d Jamie observed, \u201cshe can make a root cellar of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste not, want not,\u201d Roger agreed. They stood looking down into the hole, the breeze chilly through their damp shirts now that they\u2019d stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think ye might go back, you and the lass?\u201d Jamie said. He spoke so casually that Roger missed his meaning at first, not catching on until he saw his father-in-law\u2019s face, set in the imperturbable calm that\u2014he\u2019d learned to his cost\u2014generally covered some strong emotion.</p><p>\u201cBack,\u201d he repeated uncertainly. Surely he didn\u2019t mean\u2014but of course he did. \u201cThrough the stones, do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, seeming to find some fascination in the walls of the pit, where drying grass rootlets hung in tangles, and the jagged edges of stones protruded from the patchy damp dirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it,\u201d Roger said, after a pause. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought. But . . .\u201d He let his voice trail off, finding no good way to explain.</p><p>Jamie nodded again, though, as if he had. He supposed Jamie and Claire must have discussed it, even as he and Bree had, playing over the pros and cons. The dangers of the passage\u2014and he did not underestimate those dangers, the more so in light of what Claire had told him about Donner and his comrades; what if he made it through\u2014and Bree and Jem didn\u2019t? It didn\u2019t bear thinking.</p><p>Beyond that, if they all survived the passage, was the pain of separation\u2014and he would admit that it would be painful for him, as well. Whatever its limitations or inconveniences, the Ridge was home.</p><p>Against those considerations, though, stood the dangers of the present time, for the four horsemen of the apocalypse rode widely here; it was no trick to catch a glimpse of pestilence or famine from the corner of your eye. And the pale horse and its rider were inclined to show up unexpectedly\u2014and often.</p><p>But that\u2019s what Jamie meant, of course, he realized belatedly.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the war, ye mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe O\u2019Brians,\u201d Jamie said quietly. \u201cThat will happen again, ken? Many times.\u201d</p><p>It was spring now, not autumn, but the cold wind that touched his bones was the same as the one that had blown brown and golden leaves across the face of the little girl. Roger had a sudden vision of the two of them, Jamie and himself, standing now at the edge of this cavernous hole, like bedraggled mourners at a graveside. He turned his back on the pit, looking instead into the budding green of the chestnut trees.</p><p>\u201cYe know,\u201d he said, after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cwhen I first learned what\u2014what Claire is, what we are, all about it\u2014I thought, \u2018How fascinating!\u2019 To actually see history in the making, I mean. In all honesty, I maybe came as much for that as for Bree. Then, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed shortly, turning round as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, and is it? Fascinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I ever thought,\u201d Roger assured him, with extreme dryness. \u201cBut why are ye asking now? I told ye a year ago that we\u2019d stay.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, pursing his lips.</p><p>\u201cYe did. The thing is\u2014I am thinking I must sell one or more of the gemstones.\u201d</p><p>That brought Roger up a bit. He\u2019d not consciously thought it, of course\u2014but the knowledge that the gems were there, in case of need . . . He hadn\u2019t realized what a sense of security that knowledge had held, until this moment.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re yours to sell,\u201d he replied, cautious. \u201cWhy now, though? Are things difficult?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave him an exceedingly wry look.</p><p>\u201cDifficult,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAye, ye could say that.\u201d And proceeded to lay out the situation succinctly.</p><p>The marauders had destroyed not only a season\u2019s whisky in the making, but also the malting shed, only now rebuilding. That meant no surplus of the lovely drink this year to sell or trade for necessities. There were twenty-two more tenant families on the Ridge to be mindful of, most of them struggling with a place and a profession that they could never have imagined, trying merely to keep alive long enough to learn how to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Jamie added grimly, \u201cthere\u2019s MacDonald\u2014speak o\u2019 the devil.\u201d</p><p>The Major himself had come out onto the stoop, his red coat bright in the morning sun. He was dressed for travel, Roger saw, booted and spurred, and wearing his wig, laced hat in hand.</p><p>\u201cA flying visit, I see.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a small, uncouth noise.</p><p>\u201cLong enough to tell me I must try to arrange the purchase of thirty muskets, with shot and powder\u2014at my own expense, mind\u2014to be repaid by the Crown, eventually,\u201d he added, in a cynic tone that made it obvious how remote he considered this eventuality to be.</p><p>\u201cThirty muskets.\u201d Roger contemplated that, pursing his own lips in a soundless whistle. Jamie had not been able even to afford to replace the rifle he had given Bird for his help in the matter of Brownsville.</p><p>Jamie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there are wee matters like the dowry I\u2019ve promised Lizzie Wemyss\u2014she\u2019ll be wed this summer. And Marsali\u2019s mother, Laoghaire\u2014\u201d He glanced warily at Roger, unsure how much he might know regarding Laoghaire. More than Jamie would be comfortable knowing, Roger thought, and tactfully kept his face blank.</p><p>\u201cI owe a bit to her, for maintenance. We can live, aye, with what we\u2019ve got\u2014but for the rest . . . I must sell land, or the stones. And I willna give up the land.\u201d His fingers drummed restlessly against his thigh, then stopped, as he raised his hand to wave to the Major, who had just spotted them across the clearing.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, then . . .\u201d Plainly, it had to be done; it was foolish to sit on a fortune in gems, merely because they might one day be needed for a far-fetched and risky purpose. Still, the notion made Roger feel slightly hollow, like rappelling down a cliff and having someone cut your safety line.</p><p>Jamie blew out his breath.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. I\u2019ll send one wi\u2019 Bobby Higgins to his Lordship in Virginia. He\u2019ll get me a good price, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Roger halted, his attention deflected by the scenario unfolding before him.</p><p>The Major, obviously well-breakfasted and cheerful, had come down the steps and was strolling toward them\u2014oblivious of the white sow, who had emerged from her den beneath the foundation and was ambling along the side of the house, bent on her own breakfast. It would be a matter of seconds before she spotted the Major.</p><p>\u201cHoy!\u201d Roger bellowed, and felt something tear in his throat. The pain was so sharp that it stopped him cold, and he clutched at his throat, struck suddenly mute.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ware the pig!\u201d Jamie was shouting, waving and pointing. The Major thrust his head forward, hand behind his ear\u2014then caught the repeated bellows of \u201cPig!\u201d and looked wildly round, just in time to see the white sow break into a ponderous trot, scything her tusks from side to side.</p><p>He would have been best served by wheeling and sprinting back to the safety of the stoop, but instead panic struck him and he ran\u2014away from the pig, coming straight for Jamie and Roger, who promptly ran in different directions.</p><p>Glancing back, Roger saw the Major gaining on the pig with long-legged leaps, his goal evidently the cabin. Between the Major and the cabin, though, lay the open hole of the groundhog kiln, masked by the heavy growth of long spring grass through which the Major bounded.</p><p>\u201cPit!\u201d Roger shouted, only the word came out in a strangled croak. Nonetheless, MacDonald seemed to hear him, for a bright red face turned in his direction, eyes bulging. It must have sounded like \u201cPig!\u201d for the Major glanced back over his shoulder then to see the sow trot faster, small pink eyes fixed on him with murderous intent.</p><p>The distraction proved nearly fatal, for the Major\u2019s spurs caught and tangled, and he sprawled headlong in the grass, losing his grip on the laced hat\u2014which he had held throughout the chase\u2014and sending it pinwheeling through the air.</p><p>Roger hesitated for an instant, but then ran back to help, with a smothered oath. He saw Jamie running back, too, spade held at the ready\u2014though even a metal shovel seemed pitifully inadequate to deal with a five-hundred-pound hog.</p><p>MacDonald was already scrambling to his feet, though; before either of them could reach him, he took off running as though the devil himself were breathing on his coattails. Arms pumping and face set in puce determination, he ran for his life, bounding like a jackrabbit through the grass\u2014and disappeared. One instant he was there, and the next he had vanished, as though by magic.</p><p>Jamie looked wide-eyed at Roger, then at the pig, who had stopped short on the far side of the kiln pit. Then, moving gingerly, one eye always on the pig, he sidled toward the pit, glancing sideways, as though afraid to see what lay at the bottom.</p><p>Roger moved to stand at Jamie\u2019s shoulder, looking down. Major MacDonald had fallen into the deeper hole at the end, where he lay curled up like a hedgehog, arms clasped protectively over his wig\u2014which had remained in place by some miracle, though now much bespattered with dirt and bits of grass.</p><p>\u201cMacDonald?\u201d Jamie called down. \u201cAre ye damaged, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she there?\u201d quavered the Major, not emerging from his ball.</p><p>Roger glanced across the pit at the pig, now some distance away, snout down in the long grass.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . aye, she is.\u201d To his surprise, his voice came easy, if a little hoarse. He cleared his throat and spoke a little louder. \u201cYe needna worry, though. She\u2019s busy eating your hat.\u201d</p><p>41</p><p>THE GUN-SMITH</p><p>JAMIE ACCOMPANIED MacDonald as far as Coopersville, where he set the Major on the road back to Salisbury, equipped with food, a disreputable slouched hat against the weather, and a small bottle of whisky to fortify his bruised spirits. Then, with an internal sigh, he turned into the McGillivrays\u2019 place.</p><p>Robin was at work in his forge, surrounded by the smells of hot metal, wood shavings, and gun oil. A lanky young man with a hatchet face was working the leather bellows, though his dreamy expression showed a certain lack of attention to the job.</p><p>Robin caught the shadow of Jamie\u2019s entrance and glanced up, gave a quick nod, and returned to his work.</p><p>He was hammering bar iron into flat bands; the iron cylinder he meant to wrap them round to form a gun barrel was waiting, propped between two blocks. Jamie moved carefully out of range of flying sparks and sat down on a bucket to wait.</p><p>That was Senga\u2019s betrothed at the bellows . . . Heinrich. Heinrich Strasse. He picked the name unerringly out of the hundreds he carried in his mind, and along with it came automatically all he knew of young Heinrich\u2019s history, family, and connections, these appearing in his imagination round the boy\u2019s long, dreamy face in a constellation of social affinities, orderly and complex as the pattern of a snowflake.</p><p>He always saw people in this way, but seldom thought of it consciously. There was something about the shape of Strasse\u2019s face, though, that reinforced the mental imagery\u2014the long axis of forehead, nose, and chin, emphasized by a horsey upper lip, deeply grooved, the horizontal axis shorter, but no less sharply defined by long, narrow eyes and flat dark brows above them.</p><p>He could see the boy\u2019s origins\u2014the middle of nine children, but the eldest boy, son of an overbearing father and a mother who dealt with this by means of subterfuge and quiet malice\u2014sprouting in a delicate array from the rather pointed top of his head, his religion\u2014Lutheran, but slack about it\u2014a lacy spray under an equally pointed chin, his relation with Robin\u2014cordial, but wary, as befitted a new son-in-law who was also an apprentice\u2014extending like a fanned spike from his right ear, that with Ute\u2014a mix of terror and helpless abashment\u2014from the left.</p><p>This notion entertained him very much, and he was obliged to look away, affecting interest in Robin\u2019s workbench, in order to keep from staring and rendering the lad uncomfortable.</p><p>The gunsmith was not tidy; scraps of wood and metal lay among a jumble of spikes, scribes, hammers, blocks of wood, bits of filthy garnet cloth and sticks of charcoal on the bench. A few papers were weighted down with a spoiled gunstock that had split in the making, their dirty edges fluttering in the hot breath of the forge. He would have taken no notice, save that he recognized the style of the drawing, would have known that boldness and delicacy of line anywhere.</p><p>Frowning, he rose and pulled the papers from under the gunstock. Drawings of a gun, executed from different angles\u2014a rifle, there was the cutaway interior of the barrel, the grooves and landings clear\u2014but most peculiar. One drawing showed it whole, reasonably familiar, bar the odd hornlike growths on the barrel. But the next . . . the gun seemed as though someone had broken it over his knee; it was snapped through, stock and barrel pointing downward in opposite directions, joined only by . . . what sort of hinge was that? He closed one eye, considering.</p><p>The cessation of clamor from the forge and the loud hiss of hot metal in the sump broke his fascination with the drawings and made him look up.</p><p>\u201cDid your lass show ye those?\u201d Robin asked, with a nod at the papers. He pulled the tail of his shirt up from behind his leather apron, and mopped steam from his sweating face, looking amused.</p><p>\u201cNo. What is she about? Is she wanting ye to make her a gun?\u201d He relinquished the sheets to the gunsmith, who shuffled through them, sniffing with interest.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s no way of paying for that, Mac Dubh, unless Roger Mac\u2019s discovered a pot o\u2019 fairy gold since last week. No, she\u2019s only been telling me her notions of improvement in the art of riflery, asking what it might cost to make such a thing.\u201d The cynic smile that had been lurking in the corner of Robin\u2019s mouth broadened into a grin, and he shoved the papers back at Jamie. \u201cI can tell she\u2019s yours, Mac Dubh. What other lass would spend her time thinking of guns, rather than gowns and bairns?\u201d</p><p>There was more than a little implied criticism in this remark\u2014Brianna had undoubtedly been a good deal more forthright in manner than was becoming\u2014but he let it pass for the moment. He needed Robin\u2019s goodwill.</p><p>\u201cWell, any woman has her fancies,\u201d he observed mildly. \u201cEven wee Lizzie, I suppose\u2014but Manfred will see to that, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019ll be in Salisbury just now? Or Hillsboro?\u201d</p><p>Robin McGillivray was by no means a stupid man. The abrupt transition of subject made him arch one brow, but he passed no remark. Instead, he sent Heinrich off to the house to fetch them some beer, waiting for the lad to disappear before turning back to Jamie, expectant.</p><p>\u201cI need thirty muskets, Robin,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll need them quickly\u2014within three months.\u201d</p><p>The gunsmith\u2019s face went comically blank with astonishment, but only for a moment. He blinked then, and closed his mouth with a snap, resuming his usual expression of sardonic good humor.</p><p>\u201cStarting your own army, are ye, Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>Jamie merely smiled at that without answering. If word got around that he meant to arm his tenantry and muster his own Committee of Safety in answer to Richard Brown\u2019s banditry, that would do nay harm and might do good. Letting word get out that the Governor was working secretly to arm the savages, in case he required to suppress an armed rising in the backcountry, and that he, Jamie Fraser, was the agent of such action\u2014that was an excellent way to get himself killed and his house burnt to the ground, to say nothing of what other trouble might ensue.</p><p>\u201cHow many can ye find for me, Robin? And how fast?\u201d</p><p>The gunsmith squinted, thinking, then darted a sideways glance at him.</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, seeing Robin\u2019s lips purse in a soundless whistle of astonishment. Robin kent as well as anyone that he had no money to speak of\u2014let alone the small fortune required to assemble that many guns.</p><p>He could see the speculation in Robin\u2019s eyes, as to where he might be planning to acquire that sort of money\u2014but the gunsmith said nothing aloud. McGillivray\u2019s upper teeth sank into his lower lip in concentration, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI can find six, maybe seven, betwixt Salisbury and Salem. Brugge\u201d\u2014naming the Moravian gunsmith\u2014\u201cwould do one or two, if he kent it was for you. . . .\u201d Seeing the infinitesimal shake of Jamie\u2019s head he nodded in resignation. \u201cAye, well, maybe seven, then. And Manfred and I can manage maybe three more\u2014it\u2019s only muskets you\u2019re wanting, nothing fancy?\u201d He tilted his head toward Brianna\u2019s drawing with a small flash of his earlier humor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing fancy,\u201d Jamie said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s ten, then.\u201d He waited. Robin sighed, settling himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s no an easy matter. Particularly if ye dinna mean your name to be heard in connection\u2014and I gather ye don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a man o\u2019 rare wit and discretion, Robin,\u201d Jamie assured him gravely, making him laugh. It was true, for all that; Robin McGillivray had fought beside him at Culloden, lived three years with him in Ardsmuir; Jamie would trust him with his life\u2014and was. He began to wish the pig had eaten MacDonald after all, but put the unworthy thought from his mind and drank the beer Heinrich brought, chatting of inconsequence and trivia until it was polite to take his leave.</p><p>He had ridden Gideon, to bear MacDonald company on his horse, but meant to leave him in Dai Jones\u2019s barn. Through a complex bit of bargaining, Gideon would cover John Woolam\u2019s spotted mare\u2014to be brought up when Woolam returned from Bear Creek\u2014and when the harvest was in come autumn, Jamie would collect a hundredweight of barley, with a bottle of whisky to Dai for his assistance.</p> <p>Exchanging a bit of conversation with Dai\u2014he could never decide whether the blacksmith was truly a man of few words, or was it only that he despaired of making the Scots understand his Welsh singsong\u2014Jamie slapped Gideon encouragingly on the neck and left him to eat grain and fettle his loins against the coming of the spotted mare.</p><p>Dai had offered him food, but he declined; he was peckish, but looked forward to the peace of the five-mile walk home. The day was fine and pale blue, with the spring leaves murmuring to themselves overhead, and a bit of solitude would be welcome.</p><p>The decision had been made when he asked Robin to find him guns. But the situation bore thought.</p><p>There were sixty-four villages of the Cherokee; each with its own headman, its own peace chief and war chief. Only five of those villages were within his power to influence\u2014the three villages of the Snowbird people, and two that belonged to the Overhill Cherokee. Those, he thought, would follow the leaders of the Overhill, regardless of his words.</p><p>Roger Mac had known relatively little of the Cherokee, or what their role might be in the looming fight. He had been able to say only that the Cherokee had not acted en masse; some villages chose to fight, some did not\u2014some fought for one side, some for another.</p> <p>Well, so. It was not likely that anything he said or did would turn the tide of war, and that was a comfort. But he could not escape the knowledge that his own time to jump was coming. So far as anyone knew now, he was a loyal subject to His Majesty, a Tory beavering away in Geordie\u2019s interest, suborning savages and distributing guns with an eye to suppressing the riotous passions of Regulators, Whigs, and would-be republicans.</p><p>At some point, this facade must necessarily crumble to reveal him as a dyed-in-the-wool rebel and a traitor. But when? He wondered idly whether he might have a price on his head this time, and how much it would be.</p><p>It might be not so difficult, with the Scots. Grudge-bearing and hardheaded as they were, he was one of them, and personal liking might moderate the sense of outrage at his turning rebel, when the time came.</p><p>No, it was the Indians he worried over\u2014for he came to them as the agent of the King. How suddenly to explain his change of heart? And further, do it in such a way that they might share it? Surely they would see this as treachery at worst, grossly suspicious behavior at best. He thought they would not kill him, but how in God\u2019s name to induce them to fall in with the cause of rebellion, when they enjoyed a stable and prosperous relation with His Majesty?</p><p>Oh, God, and there was John. What could he say to his friend, when the time came? Convince him by logic and rhetoric to change his coat as well? He hissed through his teeth and shook his head in consternation, trying\u2014and failing utterly\u2014to envision John Grey, lifelong soldier, ex-Royal Governor, that very soul of loyalty and honor, suddenly declaring himself for rebellion and republic.</p><p>He passed on, fretting in this fashion for some time, but gradually found the walking soothe his mind, and the peace of the day lighten his heart. There would be time before supper to take wee Jem fishing, he thought; the sun was bright, but there was a certain dampness to the air under the trees that was promising for a first hatch of flies on the water. He had a feeling in his bones that the trout would rise near sunset.</p> <p>In this more pleasant frame of mind, he was glad to meet his daughter, some little way below the Ridge. His heart lifted at sight of her hair, streaming wanton down her back in ruddy glory.</p><p>\u201cCiamar a tha thu, a nighean?\u201d he said, kissing her cheek in greeting.</p><p>\u201cTha mi gu math, mo athair,\u201d she said, and she smiled, but he noted a small frown that troubled the smooth flesh of her forehead like the hatch of mayfly on a trout pond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d she said, taking his arm. \u201cI wanted to talk to you before you go to the Indians tomorrow.\u201d And there was that in her tone that drove all thought of fish from his mind upon the instant.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but seemed to have some difficulty in finding words\u2014an occurrence that alarmed him still further. But he could not help her, without some notion what it was about, and so kept pace with her, silent but encouraging. A mockingbird was busy nearby, practicing its repertoire of calls. It was the bird who lived in the red spruce behind the house; he knew because it paused now and then in the midst of its chatter and trilling to give a fine imitation of Adso the cat\u2019s midnight yowl.</p><p>\u201cWhen you talked to Roger about the Indians,\u201d Brianna said finally, and turned her head to look at him, \u201cdid he mention something called the Trail of Tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, curious. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p> <p>She grimaced, hunching her shoulders in a way that seemed disconcertingly familiar.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe he hadn\u2019t. He said he\u2019d told you all he knew about the Indians and the Revolution\u2014not that he knows all that much, it wasn\u2019t his specialty\u2014but this happened\u2014will happen later, after the Revolution. So he maybe didn\u2019t think it was important. Maybe it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, as though wanting him to tell her that it wasn\u2019t. He only waited, though, and she sighed, looking at her feet as she paced along. She was wearing sandals without stockings, and her long, bare toes were grimed with the soft dust of the wagon road. The sight of her feet always filled him with an odd mixture of pride at their elegant shape and a faint sense of shame at their size\u2014but as he was responsible for both, he supposed he had no grounds for complaint.</p><p>\u201cAbout sixty years from now,\u201d she said at last, eyes on the ground, \u201cthe American government will take the Cherokee from their land and move them. A long way\u2014to a place called Oklahoma. It\u2019s a thousand miles, at least, and hundreds and hundreds of them will starve and die on the way. That\u2019s why they called it\u2014will call it\u2014the Trail of Tears.\u201d</p><p>He was impressed to hear that there should be a government capable of doing such a thing, and said so. She shot him an angry glance.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll do it by cheating. They\u2019ll talk some of the Cherokee leaders into agreeing by promising them things and not keeping their bargain.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how most governments behave,\u201d he observed mildly. \u201cWhy are ye telling me this, lass? I will\u2014thank God\u2014be safely dead before any of it happens.\u201d</p><p>He saw a flicker cross her face at mention of his death, and was sorry to have caused her distress by his levity. Before he could apologize, though, she squared her shoulders and went on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you because I thought you should know,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all of the Cherokee went\u2014some of them went farther up into the mountains and hid; the army didn\u2019t find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and gave him a look from those eyes that were his own, touching in their earnestness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see? Mama told you what would happen\u2014about Culloden. You couldn\u2019t stop it, but you saved Lallybroch. And your men, your tenants. Because you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he said, realizing with a shock what she meant. Recollection washed through him in a flood, the terror and desperation and uncertainty of that time\u2014the numb despair that had carried him through that last fatal day. \u201cYe want me to tell Bird.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed a hand over her face, and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if you should tell him\u2014or if you do, whether he\u2019ll listen. But Roger and I talked about it, after you asked him about the Indians. And I kept thinking about it . . . and, well, it just didn\u2019t seem right, to know and not do anything. So I thought I\u2019d better tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I see,\u201d he said a little bleakly.</p><p>He had noticed before the inclination of persons with tender consciences to ease their discomfort by handing the necessity of taking action on to someone else, but forbore to mention it. She could hardly be telling Bird herself, after all.</p><p>As though the situation he faced with the Cherokee were not sufficiently difficult already, he thought wryly\u2014now he must deal with saving unknown future generations of savages? The mockingbird zoomed past his ear, unnervingly close, clucking like a hen, of all things.</p><p>It was so incongruous that he laughed. And then realized that there was nothing else to do. Not now.</p><p>Brianna was looking at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He stretched himself, slowly, luxuriously, feeling the muscles of his back pull upon his bones, feeling each of them, alive and solid. The sun was coming down the sky, supper was beginning to cook, and for now, for this one last night, he need do nothing. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going fishing,\u201d he said, smiling at his lovely, unlikely, problematical daughter. \u201cFetch the wee lad, aye? I\u2019ll get the poles.\u201d</p><p>James Fraser, Esq. from Fraser\u2019s Ridge</p><p>To my Lord John Grey, Mount Josiah Plantation,</p><p>this 2nd day of April, Anno Domini 1774</p><p>My lord,</p><p>I depart in the morning to visit the Cherokee, and so leave this with my wife, to be entrusted to Mr. Higgins when he shall next arrive, to be delivered with its accompanying parcel into your hands.</p><p>I presume upon your kindness and your solicitude for my family in asking your favor to help in selling the object I entrust to you. I suspect that your connexions might enable you to obtain a better price than I might do myself\u2014and to do so discreetly.</p><p>I shall hope upon my return to confide in you the reasons for my action, as well as certain philosophical reflections which you may find of interest. In the meantime, believe me ever</p><p>Your most affectionate friend and humble servant,</p><p>J. Fraser</p><p>42</p><p>DRESS REHEARSAL</p><p>BOBBY HIGGINS looked uneasily at me over his mug of beer.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon, mum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t be a-thinking of practicing some type of physic upon me, would you? The worms are gone, I\u2019m sure of it. And the\u2014the other\u201d\u2014he blushed slightly and squirmed upon the bench\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s quite all right, too. I\u2019ve et so many beans, I fart quite regular, and not a touch of the fiery knives about it!\u201d</p><p>Jamie had frequently remarked upon the transparency of my features, but this was surprising perspicacity on Bobby\u2019s part.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to hear it,\u201d I said, evading his question momentarily. \u201cYou look quite in the pink of health, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He did; the hollow, wasted look had left him, and his flesh was firm and solid, his eyes bright. The blind one hadn\u2019t gone milky, nor did it wander perceptibly; he must have some residual ability to detect light and shape, which strengthened my original diagnosis of a partially detached retina.</p><p>He nodded warily, and took a sip of beer, still keeping his eyes fixed on me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very well indeed, mum,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSplendid. You don\u2019t happen to know how much you weigh, do you, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>The look of wariness vanished, replaced by modest pride.</p><p>\u201cHappen I do, mum. I took some fleeces to the river port for his Lordship last month, and was a mercer there what had a scale for weighing out\u2014tobacco or rice, or blocks of indigo as it might be. Some of us fellows got to wagering for sport what this or that might weigh, and . . . well, ten stone four it is, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d I said with approval. \u201cLord John\u2019s cook must be feeding you well.\u201d I thought he couldn\u2019t have weighed more than a hundred and ten pounds when I first saw him; a hundred and forty-four was still on the light side for a man of nearly six feet, but it was a major improvement. And a real stroke of luck, that he should have known his weight exactly.</p><p>Of course, if I didn\u2019t act fast, he might easily gain a stone or two; Mrs. Bug had set herself to outdo Lord John\u2019s Indian cook (of whom we had heard much), and to this end was shoveling eggs, onions, venison, and a slice of leftover pork pie onto Bobby\u2019s plate, to say nothing of the basket of fragrant muffins already in front of him.</p><p>Lizzie, seated beside me, took one of these and spread it with butter. I noted with approval that she, too, was looking healthier, delicately flushed\u2014though I must remember to take a sample to check the malarial parasites in her blood. That would be an excellent thing to do while she was out. No way of getting an exact weight for her, unfortunately\u2014but she couldn\u2019t weigh more than seven stone, small and light-boned as she was.</p><p>Now, Bree and Roger at the other end of the scale . . . Roger had to weigh at least a hundred and eighty-five; Bree probably one-fifty. I took a muffin myself, thinking how best to bring up my plan. Roger would do it if I asked, of course, but Bree . . . I\u2019d have to be careful there. She\u2019d had her tonsils out under ether at the age of ten, and hadn\u2019t liked the experience. If she found out what I was up to and began expressing her opinions freely, she might arouse alarm in the rest of my guinea pigs.</p><p>Enthused by my success at making ether, I had seriously underestimated the difficulty of inducing anyone to let me use it on them. Mr. Christie might well be an awkward bugger, as Jamie on occasion called him\u2014but he was not alone in his resistance to the notion of being rendered suddenly unconscious.</p><p>I would have thought that the appeal of painlessness was universal\u2014but not to people who had never experienced it. They had no context in which to place such a notion, and while they presumably didn\u2019t all think ether was a Papist plot, they did view an offer to remove pain from them as being in some way contrary to the divine vision of the universe.</p><p>Bobby and Lizzie, though, were sufficiently under my sway that I was fairly sure I could coax\u2014or bully\u2014them into a brief trial. If they then reported the experience in a positive light . . . but improved public relations was only the half of it.</p><p>The real necessity was to try my ether out on a variety of subjects, taking careful note of the results. The scare of Henri-Christian\u2019s birth had shown me how woefully unprepared I was. I needed to have some idea of how much to administer per unit of body weight, how long such-and-such a dose might last, and how deep the resulting stupor might be. The last thing I wanted was to be up to my elbows in someone\u2019s abdomen, only to have them come suddenly round with a shriek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again, mum.\u201d Bobby\u2019s brow creased as he chewed slowly, eyes narrowed at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What am I doing?\u201d I feigned innocence, helping myself to a bit of the pork pie.</p><p>\u201cWatching me. Same as a sparrer hawk watches a mouse, just afore she stoops. I\u2019n\u2019t she?\u201d he appealed to Lizzie.</p><p>\u201cAye, she is,\u201d Lizzie agreed, dimpling at me. \u201cBut it\u2019s only her way, ken. Ye\u2019d make a big mouse, Bobby.\u201d Being Scottish, she pronounced it \u201cmoose,\u201d which made Bobby laugh and choke over his muffin.</p><p>Mrs. Bug paused to pound him helpfully on the back, leaving him purple and gasping.</p><p>\u201cWell, wha\u2019s amiss wi\u2019 him, then?\u201d she asked, coming round to squint critically at Bobby\u2019s face. \u201cYe\u2019ve no got the shits again, have ye, lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, mum,\u201d he croaked. \u201cPerish the thought! \u2019Twas only eating green apples, the once.\u201d He choked, coughed, and sat up straight, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan we please not talk about me bowels, mum?\u201d he asked plaintively. \u201cNot over breakfast, at least?\u201d</p><p>I could feel Lizzie vibrating with amusement next to me, but she kept her eyes demurely on her plate, not to embarrass him further.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be staying for a few days, Bobby?\u201d He\u2019d come the day before, bearing the usual assortment of letters and newspapers from Lord John\u2014along with a package containing a marvelous present for Jemmy: a musical jack-in-the-box, sent specially from London by the good offices of Lord John\u2019s son, Willie.</p><p>\u201cOh, I s\u2019all, mum, yes,\u201d he assured me, mouth full of muffin. \u201cHis Lordship said I was to see if Mr. Fraser had a letter for me to carry back, so I must wait for him, mustn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jamie and Ian had gone to the Cherokee a week before; it was likely to be another week before they returned. Plenty of time to make my experiments.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I might do, mum, in the way of service to you?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cSeeing as I\u2019m here, I mean, and Mr. Fraser and Mr. Ian not.\u201d There was a small tone of satisfaction in this; he got on all right with Ian, but there was no doubt that he preferred to have Lizzie\u2019s attention to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d I said, scooping up a bit of porridge. \u201cNow that you mention it, Bobby . . .\u201d</p><p>By the time I had finished explaining, Bobby still looked healthy, but a good deal less in bloom.</p><p>\u201cPut me asleep,\u201d he repeated uncertainly. He glanced at Lizzie, who looked a little uncertain, too, but who was much too used to being told to do unreasonable things to protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only be asleep for a moment,\u201d I assured him. \u201cLikely you won\u2019t even notice.\u201d</p><p>His face expressed considerable skepticism, and I could see him shifting about for some excuse. I\u2019d foreseen that ploy, though, and now played my trump card.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only me needing to judge the dose,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t operate on someone and give the ether at the same time\u2014or not easily. Malva Christie will be assisting me; she\u2019ll need the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Bobby said thoughtfully. \u201cMiss Christie.\u201d A sort of soft, dreamy expression spread across his face. \u201cWell. I s\u2019ouldn\u2019t want to put Miss Christie out, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie made one of those economical Scottish noises in the back of her throat, managing to convey scorn, derision, and abiding disapproval in the space of two glottal syllables.</p><p>Bobby looked up in inquiry, a bit of pie poised on his fork.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d she said. \u201cO\u2019 course not.\u201d She got up abruptly and, carrying her apron before her, neatly shook crumbs into the fire, and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cWhen d\u2019ye mean to do it?\u201d she demanded, adding a belated, \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d I said. \u201cIt needs to be done on an empty stomach, so we\u2019ll do it first thing, before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d she said, and stamped out.</p><p>Bobby blinked after her, then turned to me, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug\u2019s eye met mine in perfect understanding.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing, lad,\u201d she said, depositing a fresh spatulaful of scrambled eggs onto his plate. \u201cEat up. Ye\u2019ll need your strength.\u201d</p><p>BRIANNA, CLEVER WITH her hands, had made the mask to my specifications, woven of oak splits. It was simple enough, a sort of double cage, hinged so that the two halves of it swung apart for the insertion of a thick layer of cotton wool between them, and then back together, the whole thing shaped to fit like a catcher\u2019s mask over the patient\u2019s nose and mouth.</p><p>\u201cPut enough ether on to dampen the cotton wool all through,\u201d I instructed Malva. \u201cWe\u2019ll want it to take effect quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am. Oh, it does smell queer, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d She sniffed cautiously, face turned half away as she dripped ether onto the mask.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do be careful not to breathe too much of it yourself,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you falling over in the midst of an operation.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but dutifully held the mask further away.</p><p>Lizzie had bravely offered to go first\u2014with the clear intent of deflecting Bobby\u2019s attention from Malva to her. This was working; she lay in a languid pose on the table, cap off, and her soft, pale hair displayed to best advantage on the pillow. Bobby sat beside her, earnestly holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d I had a tiny minute-glass to hand, the best I could do by way of keeping accurate time. \u201cPut it gently over her face. Lizzie, just breathe deeply, and count with me, one . . . two . . . goodness, that didn\u2019t take long, did it?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken one long breath, rib cage rising high\u2014and then gone limp as a dead flounder as the breath went out. I hastily flipped the glass, and came to take her pulse. All well there.</p><p>\u201cWait for a bit; you can feel it, when they start to come round, a sort of vibration in the flesh,\u201d I instructed Malva, keeping one eye on Lizzie and the other on the glass. \u201cPut your hand on her shoulder. . . . There, do you feel it?\u201d</p><p>Malva nodded, nearly trembling with excitement.</p><p>\u201cTwo or three drops then.\u201d She added these, her own breath held, and Lizzie relaxed again with a sigh like an escape of air from a punctured tire.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s blue eyes were absolutely round, but he clung fiercely to Lizzie\u2019s other hand.</p><p>I timed the period to arousal once or twice more, then let Malva put her under a little more deeply. I picked up the lancet I had ready, and pricked Lizzie\u2019s finger. Bobby gasped as the blood welled up, looking back and forth from the crimson drop to Lizzie\u2019s angelically peaceful face.</p><p>\u201cWhy, she don\u2019t feel it!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cLook, she\u2019s never moved a muscle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I said, with a profound feeling of satisfaction. \u201cShe won\u2019t feel anything at all, until she comes round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser says we could cut someone quite open,\u201d Malva informed Bobby, self-importantly. \u201cSlice into them, and get at what\u2019s ailing\u2014and they\u2019d never feel a thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not until they woke up,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cThey\u2019d feel it then, I\u2019m afraid. But it really is quite a marvelous thing,\u201d I added more softly, looking down at Lizzie\u2019s unconscious face.</p><p>I let her stay under whilst I checked the fresh blood sample, then told Malva to take the mask off. Within a minute, Lizzie\u2019s eyelids began to flutter. She looked curiously round, then turned to me.</p><p>\u201cWhen are ye going to start it, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Despite assurances from both Bobby and Malva that she had been to all appearances dead as a doornail for the last quarter hour, she refused to believe it, asserting indignantly that she couldn\u2019t have been\u2014though at a loss to explain the prick on her finger and the slide of freshly smeared blood.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the mask on your face?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd my telling you to take a deep breath?\u201d</p><p>She nodded uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do, then, and it felt for a moment as though I were choking\u2014but then ye were all just staring down at me, next thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose the only way to convince her is to show her,\u201d I said, smiling at the three flushed young faces. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>Eager to demonstrate the truth of the matter to Lizzie, he hopped up on the table and laid himself down with a will, though the pulse in his slender throat was hammering as Malva dripped ether on the mask. He drew a deep, convulsive gasp the moment she put it on his face. Frowning a bit, he took another\u2014one more\u2014and went limp.</p><p>Lizzie clapped both hands to her mouth, staring.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Joseph, and Mary!\u201d she exclaimed. Malva giggled, thrilled at the effect.</p><p>Lizzie looked at me, eyes wide, then back at Bobby. Stooping to his ear, she called his name, to no effect, then picked up his hand and wiggled it gingerly. His arm waggled limply, and she made a soft exclamation and set his hand down again. She looked quite agitated.</p><p>\u201cCan he no wake up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we take away the mask,\u201d Malva told her, rather smug.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t want to keep someone under longer than you need to,\u201d I added. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for them to be anesthetized too long.\u201d</p><p>Malva obediently brought Bobby back to the edge of consciousness and put him back under several times, while I made note of times and dosages. During the last of these notes, I glanced up, to see her looking down at Bobby with an intent sort of expression, seeming to concentrate on something. Lizzie had withdrawn to a corner of the surgery, plainly made uneasy by seeing Bobby unconscious, and sat on a stool, plaiting her hair and twisting it up under her cap.</p><p>I stood up and took the mask from Malva\u2019s hand, setting it aside.</p><p>\u201cYou did a wonderful job,\u201d I told her, speaking quietly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, face glowing.</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am! It was . . . I\u2019ve never seen the like. It\u2019s such a feeling, is it not? Like as we killed him, and brought him alive again.\u201d She spread her hands out, looking at them half-unconsciously, as though wondering how she had done such a marvel, then closed them into small fists, and smiled at me, conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cI think I see why my faither says it\u2019s devil\u2019s work. Were he to see what it\u2019s like\u201d\u2014she glanced at Bobby, who was beginning to stir\u2014\u201che\u2019d say no one but God has a right to do such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I said, rather dryly. From the gleam in her eye, her father\u2019s likely reaction to what we had been doing was one of the chief attractions of the experiment. For an instant, I rather pitied Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . perhaps you\u2019d better not tell your father, then,\u201d I suggested. She smiled, showing small, sharp white teeth, and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it, ma\u2019am,\u201d she assured me. \u201cHe\u2019d stop me coming, as quick as\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bobby opened his eyes, turned his head to one side, and threw up, putting a stop to the discussion. Lizzie gave a cry and hurried to his side, fussing over him, wiping his face and fetching him brandy to drink. Malva, looking slightly superior, stood aside and let her.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s queer,\u201d Bobby repeated, for perhaps the tenth time, rubbing a hand across his mouth. \u201cI saw the most terrible thing\u2014just for a moment, there\u2014and then I felt sick, and here it was all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of terrible thing?\u201d Malva asked, interested. He glanced at her, looking wary and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI scarcely know, tell \u2019ee true, miss. Only as it was . . . dark, like. A form, as you might say; I thought \u2019twas a woman\u2019s. But . . . terrible,\u201d he finished, helpless.</p><p>Well, that was too bad. Hallucination wasn\u2019t an uncommon side effect, but I hadn\u2019t expected it with such a brief dose.</p><p>\u201cWell, I imagine it was just a bit of nightmare,\u201d I said soothingly. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a form of sleep, so it\u2019s not surprising that you might get the odd bit of dreaming now and then.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, Lizzie shook her head at this.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no sleep at all. When ye sleep, ken, ye give your soul up to the angels\u2019 keeping, so as no ghoulies shall come near. But this . . .\u201d Frowning, she eyed the bottle of ether, now safely corked again, then looked at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did wonder,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere does your soul go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I should think it simply stays with your body. It must. I mean\u2014you aren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>Both Lizzie and Bobby were shaking their heads decidedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lizzie said. \u201cWhen ye\u2019re sleepin\u2019, ye\u2019re still there. When ye do that\u201d\u2014she gestured toward the mask, a faint uneasiness on her small features\u2014\u201cye\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, mum,\u201d Bobby assured me. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think maybe ye go to limbo, wi\u2019 the unbaptized babes and all?\u201d Lizzie asked anxiously.</p><p>Malva gave an unladylike snort.</p><p>\u201cLimbo\u2019s no real place,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a notion thought up by the Pope.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock at this blasphemy, but Bobby luckily distracted her by feeling dizzy and requiring to lie down.</p> <p>Malva seemed inclined to go on with the argument, but beyond repeating, \u201cThe Pope . . .\u201d once or twice, simply stood, swaying to and fro with her mouth open, blinking a little. I glanced at Lizzie, only to find her glassy-eyed as well. She gave an enormous yawn and blinked at me, eyes watering.</p><p>It occurred to me that I was beginning to feel a trifle light-headed myself.</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d I snatched the ether mask from Malva\u2019s hand, and guided her hastily to a stool. \u201cLet me get rid of this, or we\u2019ll all be giddy.\u201d</p><p>I flipped open the mask, pulled the damp wad of cotton wool out of it, and carried it outside at arm\u2019s length. I\u2019d opened both the surgery windows, to provide ventilation and save us all being gassed, but ether was insidious. Heavier than air, it tended to sink toward the floor of a room and accumulate there, unless there was a fan or some other device to remove it. I might have to operate in the open air, I thought, were I using it for any length of time.</p><p>I laid the cotton-wool pad on a stone to dry out, and came back, hoping that they were all too groggy now to continue their philosophical speculations. I didn\u2019t want them following that line of thought; let it get around the Ridge that ether separated people from their souls, and I\u2019d never get anyone to let me use it on them, no matter how dire the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you all for helping,\u201d I said, smiling as I entered the room, relieved to find them all looking reasonably alert. \u201cYou\u2019ve done something very useful and valuable. You can all go along about your business now, though\u2014I\u2019ll tidy up.\u201d</p> <p>Malva and Lizzie hesitated for a moment, neither girl wanting to leave Bobby to the other, but under the impetus of my shooing, drifted toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhen are ye to be wed, Miss Wemyss?\u201d Malva asked casually\u2014and loudly enough for Bobby to hear\u2014though she certainly knew; everyone on the Ridge did.</p><p>\u201cIn August,\u201d Lizzie replied coolly, lifting her small nose half an inch. \u201cRight after the haying\u2014Miss Christie.\u201d And then I shall be Mrs. McGillivray, her satisfied expression said. And you\u2014Miss Christie\u2014without an admirer to your name. Not that Malva attracted no notice from young men; only that her father and brother were assiduous in keeping them away from her.</p><p>\u201cI wish ye great joy of it,\u201d Malva said. She glanced at Bobby Higgins, then back at Lizzie, and smiled, demure beneath her starched white cap.</p><p>Bobby stayed sitting on the table for a moment, looking after the girls.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d I said, struck by the deeply thoughtful expression on his face, \u201cthe figure you saw under the anesthetic\u2014did you recognize it?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, then his eyes slid back to the empty doorway, as though unable to keep away.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, mum,\u201d he said, in such a tone of earnest conviction that I knew he lied. \u201cNot at all!\u201d</p> <p>43</p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS</p><p>THEY HAD STOPPED to water the horses by the edge of the small lake the Indians called Thick Rushes. It was a warm day, and they hobbled the horses, stripped, and waded into the water, spring-fed and gloriously cold. Cold enough to shock the senses and, for a moment at least, drive away Jamie\u2019s moody contemplation of the note MacDonald had delivered him from John Stuart, the Indian Superintendent of the Southern Department.</p><p>It had been complimentary enough, praising his celerity and enterprise in drawing the Snowbird Cherokee into the British sphere of influence\u2014but had gone on to urge more vigorous involvement, pointing out Stuart\u2019s own coup in directing the choice of leaders among the Choctaws and the Chickasaw, at a congress he had himself convened two years before.</p><p>. . . The competition and anxiety of the candidates for medals and commissions was as great as can be imagined and equalled the struggles of the most aspiring and ambitious for honours and preferment in great states. I took every step to be informed of characters and filled the vacancies with the most worthy and likely to answer the purposes of maintaining order and the attachment of this nation to the British interest. I urge you to strive for similar good results to be achieved among the Cherokee.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said aloud, popping up among the rushes and shaking water from his hair. \u201cI\u2019m to depose Tsisqua, nay doubt by assassination, and bribe them all to install Pipestone Carver\u201d\u2014the smallest and most self-effacing Indian Jamie had ever seen\u2014\u201cas peace chief. Heugh!\u201d He sank again, in a rush of bubbles, entertaining himself by cursing Stuart\u2019s presumption, watching his words rise up in wavering quicksilver balls, to disappear magically at the bright light of the surface.</p><p>He rose again, gasping, then gulped air and held his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d said a startled voice nearby. \u201cIs it them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d said another, low and urgent. \u201cThere are only two; I see them both, over there, do you see?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth and breathed like a zephyr, striving to hear over the pounding of his heart.</p><p>He had understood them, but for an instant, could not put a name to their tongue. Indians, aye, but not Cherokee, they were . . . Tuscarora, that was it.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t spoken with any Tuscarora for years; most of them had gone north in the wake of the measles epidemic that had destroyed so many\u2014going to join their Mohawk \u201cfathers\u201d in the lands ruled by the Iroquois League.</p><p>These two were arguing in whispers, but near enough that he made out most of what they said; they were no more than a few feet from him, hidden by a thick growth of rushes and cattail plants that stood nearly as high as a man\u2019s head.</p><p>Where was Ian? He could hear distant splashing, at the far end of the lake, and turning his head gently, saw from the corner of his eye that Ian and Rollo were sporting in the water, the dog submerged to his ruff, paddling to and fro. If one didn\u2019t know\u2014and the beast didn\u2019t sense the intruders and bark\u2014it looked very much like two men swimming.</p><p>The Indians had concluded that this was likely the case\u2014two horses, thus two men, and both safely distant. With much creaking and rustling, they began to make their way stealthily in the direction of the horses.</p><p>Jamie was half-inclined to let them try to take Gideon and see how far they got with such an enterprise. But they might only make off with Ian\u2019s horse and the pack mule\u2014and Claire would be fashit, did he let them take Clarence. Feeling himself very much at a disadvantage, he slithered nak*d through the reeds, grimacing at the rasp of them on his skin, and crawled up among the cattails, into the mud of the shore.</p><p>Had they the wit to look back, they must have seen the cattails shaking\u2014and he hoped Ian would see\u2014but they were intent on their errand. He could glimpse them now, skulking in the tall grass at the forest edge, glancing to and fro\u2014but never in the right direction.</p><p>Only two, he was sure of that now. Young, from the way they moved, and unsure. He couldn\u2019t see if they were armed.</p><p>Slimed with mud, he crept further, sinking onto his belly in the rank grasses near the lake, squirming rapidly toward the shelter of a sumac bush. What he wanted was a club, and quickly.</p><p>In such circumstances, of course, nothing came to hand but twigs and long-rotted branches. For lack of better, he seized a good-sized stone, but then found what he wanted: a dogwood branch cracked by wind and hanging in reach, still attached to the tree. They were approaching the grazing horses now; Gideon saw them and lifted his head abruptly. He went on chewing, but his ears lay half back in patent suspicion. Clarence, the ever-sociable, took notice and raised his head, as well, ears twitching to alertness.</p><p>Jamie seized the chance, and as Clarence emitted a welcoming bray, he ripped the branch from the tree and charged the intruders, roaring, \u201cTulach Ard!\u201d at the top of his voice.</p><p>Wide eyes met his, and one man bolted, long hair flying. The other followed, but limping badly, going down on one knee as something gave way. He was up again at once, but too slow; Jamie swept the branch at his legs with a two-handed fury that knocked him flat, and leapt on his back, driving a vicious knee into his kidney.</p><p>The man made a strangled noise and froze, paralyzed by pain. Jamie had dropped his rock\u2014no, there it was. He snatched it up and thumped the man solidly behind the ear, for luck. Then he was off and running after the other, who had made for the wood but sheered off, blocked by a rock-bound streamlet in his path. Now the man was bounding through the sedges; Jamie saw him cast a terrified look toward the water, where Ian and Rollo were making their way toward him, swimming like beaver.</p><p>The Indian might have made it to the sanctuary of the forest, had one foot not suddenly sunk in soft mud. He staggered sideways, and Jamie was on him, feet sliding in the mud, grappling.</p><p>The man was young and wiry and fought like an eel. Jamie, with the advantage of size and weight, managed to push him over, and they fell together and rolled about in the sedges and mud, clawing and thumping. The Indian caught Jamie\u2019s long hair and yanked, bringing tears to his eyes; he punched the man hard in the ribs to make him let go, and when he did, butted him in the face.</p><p>Their foreheads met with a dull thunk, and blinding pain shot through his head. They fell apart, gasping, and Jamie rolled up onto his knees, head spinning and eyes watering, trying to see.</p><p>There was a blur of gray and a shriek of terror. Rollo gave one deep-chested, snarling bark, then settled into a rumbling, continuous growl. Jamie shut one eye, a hand to his throbbing forehead, and made out his opponent lying flat in the mud, Rollo poised over him, black lips drawn back to show all his teeth.</p><p>The splash of feet running through the shallows, and Ian was there, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>He took his hand away and looked at his fingers. No blood, though he would have sworn his head was split open.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut better than him. Oh, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid ye kill the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>Lowering himself to his hands and knees, he crawled a short distance away and threw up. Behind him, he could hear Ian sharply demanding to know who the men were and whether there were others with them, in Cherokee.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Tuscarora,\u201d he said. His head still throbbed, but he felt a little better.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Ian was surprised, but at once shifted into the tongue of the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka. The young captive, already terrorized by Rollo, looked as though he might die of fright, seeing Ian\u2019s tattoos and hearing him speak Mohawk. Kahnyen\u2019kehaka was of the same family as Tuscarora, and plainly the young man could make out what Ian said, for he replied, stammering with fear. They were alone. Was his brother dead?</p><p>Jamie rinsed his mouth with water, splashed it on his face. That was better, though a lump like a duck\u2019s egg was swelling over his left eye.</p><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d</p><p>Yes, the young man said, his brother. If they did not mean to kill him now, might he go and see? His brother was wounded.</p><p>Ian glanced at Jamie for agreement, then called Rollo off with a word. The bedraggled captive struggled painfully to his feet, staggering, and set off back along the shore, followed by the dog and the two nak*d Scots.</p><p>The other man was indeed wounded; blood was seeping through a crude bandage round his leg. He had made the bandage of his shirt, and was bare-chested, scrawny, and starved-looking. Jamie glanced from one to the other; neither could be older than twenty, he thought, and likely younger than that, with their faces pinched by hunger and ill-usage, their clothes little more than rags.</p><p>The horses had moved off a little, nervous of the fighting, but the clothes the Scots had left hanging from the bushes were still there. Ian pulled on his breeches and went to fetch food and drink from the saddlebags, while Jamie dressed more slowly, interrogating the young man as the latter anxiously examined his brother.</p><p>They were Tuscarora, the young man confirmed. His name was a long one, meaning roughly \u201cthe gleam of light on water in a spring\u201d; this was his brother, \u201cthe goose that encourages the leader when they fly,\u201d more simply known as Goose.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Jamie pulled his shirt over his head and nodded\u2014wincing at the movement\u2014at the gash in Goose\u2019s leg, quite obviously made by something like an ax.</p><p>Light on Water took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment. He had a substantial knot on his head, as well.</p><p>\u201cTsalagi,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were two score in number; the rest are dead, or taken. You will not give us to them, Lord? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsalagi? Which?\u201d</p><p>Light shook his head; he could not say. His band had chosen to stay when his village moved north, but they had not prospered; there were not enough men to defend a village and hunt, and without defenders, others stole their crops, took their women.</p><p>Growing poorer, they, too, had taken to stealing and to begging to survive through the winter. More had died of cold and sickness, and the remnants moved from place to place, now and then finding a place to settle for a few weeks, but then driven out by the much stronger Cherokee.</p><p>A few days past, they had been set upon by a party of Cherokee warriors, who had taken them by surprise, killed most of them, and taken some women.</p><p>\u201cThey took my wife,\u201d Light said, his voice unsteady. \u201cWe came to\u2014to take her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will kill us, of course,\u201d said Goose weakly, but with a fair amount of cheerfulness. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t signify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jamie said, smiling despite himself. \u201cDo you know where they took her?\u201d</p><p>The brothers knew the direction taken by the raiders, and had been following, to track them to their village. That way, they said, pointing toward a notch. Ian glanced at Jamie, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cBird,\u201d he said. \u201cOr Fox, I should say,\u201d for Running Fox was war chief of the village; a good warrior, though somewhat lacking in imagination\u2014a trait Bird possessed in quantity.</p><p>\u201cShall we help them, then?\u201d Ian said in English. His feathery brows arched in question, but Jamie could see that it was a question in form only.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I expect we will.\u201d He rubbed gingerly at his forehead; the skin over the lump was already stretched and tender. \u201cLet\u2019s eat first, though.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS NOT a question of whether the thing might be done; only how. Jamie and Ian both dismissed out of hand any suggestion that the brothers might steal back Light\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cThey will kill ye,\u201d Ian assured them.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mind,\u201d Light said stoutly.</p><p>\u201cOf course ye don\u2019t,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cBut what of your wife? She\u2019d be left alone, then, and in no better case.\u201d</p><p>Goose nodded judiciously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, you know,\u201d he said to his glowering brother.</p><p>\u201cWe could ask for her,\u201d Jamie suggested. \u201cA wife for you, Ian. Bird thinks well of ye; he\u2019d likely give her to you.\u201d</p><p>He was only half-joking. If no one had yet taken the young woman to wife, the person who had her as slave might be persuaded to give her to Ian, who was deeply respected.</p><p>Ian gave a perfunctory smile, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, we\u2019d best ransom her. Or\u2014\u201d He looked consideringly at the two Indians, industriously eating their way through the remainder of the food in the saddlebags. \u201cMight we ask Bird to adopt them?\u201d</p><p>That was a thought, to be sure. For once they had got the young woman back, by whatever means, she and the brothers would be in the same dire case\u2014wandering and hungry.</p><p>The brothers frowned, though, and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cFood is a good thing,\u201d Goose said, licking his fingers. \u201cBut we saw them kill our family, our friends. If we hadn\u2019t seen it ourselves, it would be possible. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I see,\u201d Jamie said, and was struck for an instant by mild astonishment that he did see; evidently, he had spent longer among the Indians than he supposed.</p><p>The brothers exchanged glances, obviously communicating something. Decision made, Light made a gesture of respect to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWe are your slaves,\u201d he pointed out with some diffidence. \u201cIt is yours to decide what to do with us.\u201d He paused delicately, waiting.</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand over his face, considering that perhaps he hadn\u2019t spent quite enough time with Indians after all. Ian didn\u2019t smile, but seemed to emit a low vibration of amusement.</p><p>MacDonald had told him stories of campaigns during the French and Indian War; soldiers who took Indian prisoners commonly either killed them for scalp money or sold them as slaves. Those campaigns lay a scant ten years in the past; the peace since had been frequently uneasy, and God knew the various Indians made slaves of their prisoners, unless they chose\u2014for whatever inscrutable Indian motive\u2014to adopt or kill them, instead.</p><p>Jamie had captured the two Tuscarora; ergo, by custom, they were now his slaves.</p><p>He understood quite well what Light was suggesting\u2014that he adopt the brothers, and doubtless the young woman, too, once he\u2019d rescued her\u2014and how in God\u2019s name had he suddenly become responsible for doing that?</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s nay market for their scalps just now,\u201d Ian pointed out. \u201cThough I suppose ye could sell the two of them to Bird. Though they\u2019re no worth a great deal, scrawny and ill-feckit as they are.\u201d</p><p>The brothers stared at him, impassive, awaiting his decision. Light belched suddenly, and looked surprised at the sound. Ian did laugh at that, a low creaking noise.</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldna do any such thing, and the three of ye ken that perfectly well,\u201d Jamie said crossly. \u201cI should have hit ye harder and saved myself trouble,\u201d he said to Goose, who grinned at him, with gap-toothed good nature.</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle,\u201d he said, bowing low in deep respect.</p><p>Jamie made a displeased sound in response, but the two Indians took no notice.</p><p>It would have to be the medals, then. MacDonald had brought him a chest bulging with medals, gilt buttons, cheap brass compasses, steel knife blades, and other bits of attractive rubbish. Since the chiefs derived their power from their popularity, and their popularity increased in direct proportion to their ability to give gifts, the British Indian agents exerted influence by distributing largesse to those chiefs who indicated a willingness to ally themselves to the Crown.</p><p>He\u2019d brought only two small bags of such bribery; the rest left at home for future use. What he had on hand would, he was sure, be sufficient to ransom Mrs. Light, but to expend it all in such fashion would leave him empty-handed with respect to the other village chiefs\u2014and that wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Well, and he supposed he must send Ian back, then, to fetch more. But not until he\u2019d arranged the ransom; he wanted Ian\u2019s help in that matter.</p><p>\u201cFine, then,\u201d he said, standing up. He fought off a wave of dizziness. \u201cBut I am not adopting them.\u201d The last thing he needed just this minute was three more mouths to feed.</p><p>44</p><p>SCOTCHEE</p><p>ARRANGING THE RANSOM was, as he had supposed, a simple matter of bargaining. And in the end, Mrs. Light came fairly cheap, at the price of six medals, four knives, and a compass. Granted, he hadn\u2019t seen her until the conclusion of the dealing\u2014if he had, he might have offered even less; she was a small, pockmarked lass of perhaps fourteen, with a slight walleye.</p><p>Still, he reflected, there was no accounting for taste, and both Light and Goose had been willing to die for her. Doubtless she had a kind heart, or some other excellent quality of character, such as a talent and affinity for bed.</p><p>He was quite shocked to find himself thinking such a thing, and looked at her more closely. It was in no way obvious\u2014and yet, now that he did look\u2014she did radiate that strange appeal, that remarkable gift, held by a few women, that bypassed such superficial appreciations as looks, age, or wit, and caused a man simply to wish to seize her and\u2014</p><p>He choked the sprouting image off at the root. He\u2019d known a few such women, most of them French. And had thought more than once that perhaps it was his own wife\u2019s French heritage that was responsible for her possession of that most desirable but very dangerous gift.</p><p>He could see Bird eyeing the girl thoughtfully, quite obviously regretting that he had let her go for so little. Fortunately, a distraction occurred to drive the matter from his attention\u2014the return of a hunting party, bringing with them guests.</p><p>The guests were Cherokee of the Overhill Band, far from their home in the Tennessee mountains. And with them was a man Jamie had often heard of, but never met until this day\u2014one Alexander Cameron, whom the Indians called \u201cScotchee.\u201d</p><p>A dark, weathered man of middle-age, Cameron was distinguishable from the Indians only by his heavy beard and the long, inquisitive shape of his nose. He had lived with the Cherokee since the age of fifteen, had a Cherokee wife, and was much esteemed among them. He was also an Indian agent, thick with John Stuart. And his presence here, two hundred miles from home, caused Jamie\u2019s own long, inquisitive nose to twitch with interest.</p><p>The interest was frankly mutual; Cameron examined him with deep-set eyes in which intelligence and wiliness showed in equal measure.</p><p>\u201cThe redheided Bear-Killer, och, och!\u201d he exclaimed, shaking Jamie warmly by the hand, and then embracing him in the Indian fashion. \u201cI\u2019ve heard such tales of ye, ken, and fair dyin\u2019 to meet ye to see were they true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThe last one I heard myself, I\u2019d done for three bears at once, killin\u2019 the last of them high in a tree, where he\u2019d chased me after chewin\u2019 off my foot.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, Cameron looked down at Jamie\u2019s feet, then looked up and hooted with laughter, all the lines of his face curving in such irresistible merriment that Jamie felt his own laughter bubble up.</p><p>It was not, of course, proper to speak of business yet awhile. The hunting party had brought down one of the woods buffaloes, and a great feast was preparing: the liver taken away to be singed and devoured at once, the strap of tender meat from the back roasted with whole onions, and the heart\u2014so Ian told him\u2014to be shared among the four of them: Jamie, Cameron, Bird, and Running Fox, a mark of honor.</p><p>After the liver had been eaten, they retired to Bird\u2019s house to drink beer for an hour or two, while the women made ready the rest of the food. And in the course of nature, he found himself outside, having a comfortable piss against a tree, when a quiet footfall came behind him, and Alexander Cameron stepped up alongside, undoing the fall of his breeches.</p><p>It seemed natural\u2014though plainly Cameron had intended it\u2014to walk about together for a bit then, the cool air of the evening a respite from the smoke inside the house, and speak of things of common interest\u2014John Stuart, for one, and the ways and means of the Southern Department. Indians, for another; comparing the personalities and means of dealing with the various village chiefs, speculating as to who would make a leader, and whether there might be a great congress called within the year.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll be wondering, I expect,\u201d Cameron said quite casually, \u201cat my presence here?\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a slight motion of the shoulders, admitting interest, but indicating a polite lack of inquisition into Cameron\u2019s affairs.</p><p>Cameron chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s no secret, to be sure. It\u2019s James Henderson, is what it is\u2014ye\u2019ll ken the name, maybe?\u201d</p><p>He did. Henderson had been Chief Justice of the Superior Court in North Carolina\u2014until the Regulation had caused him to leave, climbing out the window of his courthouse and fleeing for his life from a mob bent on violence.</p><p>A wealthy man, and one with a due regard for the value of his skin, Henderson had retired from public life and set about increasing his fortune. To which end, he proposed now to buy an enormous tract of land from the Cherokee, this located in Tennessee, and establish townships there.</p><p>Jamie gave Cameron an eye, apprehending at once the complexity of the situation. For the one thing, the lands in question lay far, far inside the Treaty Line. For Henderson to instigate such dealings was an indication\u2014had any been needed\u2014of just how feeble the grasp of the Crown had grown of late. Plainly, Henderson thought nothing of flouting His Majesty\u2019s treaty, and expected no interference with his affairs as a result of doing so.</p><p>That was one thing. For another, though\u2014the Cherokee held land in common, as all the Indians did. Leaders could and did sell land to whites, without such legal niceties as clear title, but were still subject to the ex post facto approval or disapproval of their people. Such approval would not affect the sale, which would be already accomplished, but could result in the fall of a leader, and in a good deal of trouble for the man who tried to take possession of land paid for in good faith\u2014or what passed for good faith, in such dealings.</p><p>\u201cJohn Stuart knows of this, of course,\u201d Jamie said, and Cameron nodded, with a small air of complacency.</p><p>\u201cNot officially, mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>Naturally not. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs could hardly countenance such an arrangement officially. At the same time, it would be smiled on unofficially, as such a purchase could not help but further the department\u2019s goal of bringing the Indians further under the sway of British influence.</p><p>Jamie wondered idly whether Stuart profited in any personal way from the sale. Stuart had a good reputation and was not known to be corrupt\u2014but he might well have a silent interest in the matter. Then again, he might have no financial interest himself, and be turning an officially blind eye to the arrangement only in furtherance of the department\u2019s purposes.</p><p>Cameron, though . . . He couldn\u2019t say, of course, but would be most surprised if Cameron had no finger in the pie.</p><p>He did not know where Cameron\u2019s natural interest lay, whether with the Indians among whom he lived or with the British to whom he had been born. He doubted that anyone did\u2014perhaps not even Cameron. Regardless of his abiding interests, though, Cameron\u2019s immediate goals were clear. He wished the sale to be met with approval\u2014or at least indifference\u2014by the surrounding Cherokee, thus keeping his own pet chiefs in good odor with their followers, and allowing Henderson to go forward with his plans with no undue harassment by Indians in the area.</p><p>\u201cI shall not, of course, say anything for a day or two,\u201d Cameron told him, and he nodded. There was a natural rhythm to such business. But of course, Cameron had told him now so that he might be of help when the subject arose in due course.</p><p>Cameron took it for granted that he would help. There was no explicit promise of a bit of Henderson\u2019s pie for himself, but no need; it was the sort of opportunity that was a perquisite of being an Indian agent\u2014the reason that such appointments were considered plums.</p><p>Given what Jamie knew of the near future, he had neither expectation nor interest in Henderson\u2019s purchase\u2014but the subject did give him a welcome opportunity for a useful quid pro quo.</p><p>He coughed gently.</p><p>\u201cYe ken the wee Tuscarora lassie I bought from Bird?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cameron laughed.</p><p>\u201cAye. And he\u2019s most perplexed what ye mean to do with her; he says ye willna take any of the lasses he sends to warm your bed. She\u2019s no so much to look at\u2014but still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d Jamie assured him. \u201cShe\u2019s marrit, for the one thing. I brought two Tuscaroran lads with me; she belongs to one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Cameron\u2019s nose twitched with interest, scenting a story. Jamie had been waiting for this opportunity since the sight of Cameron first gave him the notion, and he told it well, with the satisfactory outcome that Cameron agreed to take the three displaced young Tuscaroras with him, and sponsor their adoption into the Overhill Band.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll no be the first time,\u201d he told Jamie. \u201cThere are more and more of them\u2014wee scraps of what were villages, even whole peoples\u2014wandering about the country starved and wretched. Heard of the Dogash, have ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor are ye like to,\u201d Cameron said, shaking his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no but ten or so of them left. They came to us last winter; offered themselves as slaves, only so that they might survive the cold. No\u2014dinna fash yourself, man,\u201d he assured Jamie, catching sight of Jamie\u2019s expression. \u201cYour wee lads and the lass won\u2019t be slaves; my word on it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded his thanks, pleased with the business. They had wandered some distance outside the village, and stood talking near the edge of a gorge, where the wood opened suddenly over a vista of mountain ranges, rolling away and away like furrows plowed in some endless field of the gods, their backs dark and brooding beneath a starlit sky.</p><p>\u201cHow can there ever be people enough to settle such a wilderness?\u201d he said, moved suddenly by the sight of it. And yet the smell of woodsmoke and cooking meat hung heavy in the air. People did inhabit it, few and scattered as they were.</p> <p>Cameron shook his head in contemplation.</p><p>\u201cThey come,\u201d he said, \u201cand they keep on coming. My ain folk came from Scotland. You have,\u201d he added, teeth a brief gleam in his beard. \u201cAnd dinna mean to go back, I\u2019ll warrant.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled at that, but made no answer, though a queer feeling rose in his wame at the thought. He did not mean to go back. Had said goodbye to Scotland at the rail of the Artemis, knowing full well it was likely his last sight of the place. And yet, the notion that he would never set foot there again had never fully settled on him \u2019til this moment.</p><p>Calls of \u201cScotchee, Scotchee\u201d summoned them, and he turned to follow Cameron back to the village, conscious all the time of the glorious, terrifying emptiness behind him\u2014and the more terrifying emptiness within.</p><p>THEY SMOKED THAT night, after feasting, in ceremonious observance of Jamie\u2019s bargain with Bird, in welcome to Cameron. When the pipe had gone twice around the fire, they began to tell stories.</p><p>Stories of raids, of battles. Exhausted from the day, head still throbbing, mellowed by food and spruce beer, and slightly intoxicated by the smoke, Jamie had meant only to listen. Perhaps it was the thought of Scotland, so casually evoked by Cameron\u2019s remark. But at some point, a memory had stirred, and when the next expectant silence fell, he was surprised to hear his own voice, telling them of Culloden.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there near a wall I saw a man I knew, named MacAllister, besieged by a horde of enemies. He fought with gun and sword, but both failed him\u2014his blade was broken, his shield shattered upon his breast.\u201d</p><p>The fume of the pipe reached him and he raised it and drew deep, as though he drank the air of the moor, hazed with rain and the smoke of the day.</p><p>\u201cStill they came, his enemies, to kill him, and he seized up a piece of metal, the tongue of a wagon, and with it, killed six\u201d\u2014he held up both hands, fingers stuck up in illustration\u2014\u201csix of them, before he was at last brought down.\u201d</p><p>Sounds of awe and tongue clicks of approval greeted this recounting.</p><p>\u201cAnd you yourself, Bear-Killer, how many men did you kill in this battle?\u201d</p><p>The smoke burned in his chest, behind his eyes, and for an instant he tasted the bitter smoke of cannon fire, not sweet tobacco. He saw\u2014he saw\u2014Alistair MacAllister, dead at his feet among the red-clothed bodies, the side of his head crushed in and the round curve of his shoulder shining solid through the cloth of the shirt, so wetly did it cling to him.</p><p>He was there, on the moor, the wet and cold no more than a shimmer on his skin, rain slick on his face, his own shirt sopping and steaming on him with the heat of his rage.</p><p>And then he no longer stood on Drumossie, and became aware a second too late of the indrawn breaths around him. He saw Robert Talltree\u2019s face, the wrinkles all turned up in astonishment, and only then looked down, to see all ten of his fingers flex and fold, and the four fingers of the right extend again, quite without his meaning it. The thumb wavered, indecisive. He watched this with fascination, then, coming finally to his wits, balled his right hand as well as he could and wrapped the left around it, as though to throttle the memory that had been thrust with such unnerving suddenness into the palm of his hand.</p> <p>He looked up to see Talltree glance sharply at his face, and he saw the dark old eyes harden, then narrow under a frown\u2014and then the old man took the pipe, drank deep, and blew the smoke across him, bowing forward. Talltree did this twice more, and a hum of hushed approval at the honor came from the clustered men.</p><p>He took the pipe and returned the honor of the gesture, then passed it to the next man, refusing to speak further.</p><p>They didn\u2019t push him to, seeming to recognize and respect the shock he felt.</p><p>Shock. Not even that. What he felt was the blankest astonishment. Cautiously, unwilling, he stole a keek at that picture of Alistair. God, it was there.</p><p>He realized that he was holding his breath, not wanting to breathe the reek of blood and spilled bowels. He breathed, soft smoke and a copper tang of seasoned bodies, and could have wept, swept with sudden longing for the cold, sharp air of the Highlands, pungent with the scents of peat and gorse.</p><p>Alexander Cameron said something to him, but he couldn\u2019t reply. Ian, seeing the difficulty, leaned forward to answer, and they all laughed. Ian gave him a curious look, but then turned back to the conversation, beginning a story of a famous game of lacrosse he had played among the Mohawk. Leaving Jamie to sit still, wreathed in the smoke.</p><p>Fourteen men. And he did not remember a single face. And that random thumb, hovering uncertainly. Whatever did he mean by that? That he had fought yet another, but not made certain of the fellow?</p><p>He was afraid even to think of the memory. Unsure what to do with it. But at the same time, conscious of a sense of awe. And despite everything, grateful to have this small thing back.</p><p>IT WAS VERY LATE, and most of the men had gone to their own houses, or lay comfortably asleep around the fire. Ian had left the fire, but hadn\u2019t come back. Cameron was still there, smoking his own pipe now, though he shared this with Bird, taking turn and turn about.</p><p>\u201cThere is a thing I would tell you,\u201d Jamie said abruptly, in the midst of a drowsy silence. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d Bird raised his brows in slow question, drugged with tobacco.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known he meant to say it. Had thought to wait, judge his time\u2014if he spoke at all. Perhaps it was the closeness of the house, the dark intimacy of the fireside, or the intoxication of tobacco. Perhaps only the kinship of an exile for those who would suffer the same fate. But he\u2019d spoken; had no choice now but to tell them what he knew.</p><p>\u201cThe women of my family are . . .\u201d He groped, not knowing the Cherokee word. \u201cThose who see in dreams what is to come.\u201d He darted a look at Cameron, who appeared to take this in his stride, for he nodded, and closed his eyes to draw smoke into his lungs.</p><p>\u201cHave they the Sight, then?\u201d he asked, mildly interested.</p><p>Jamie nodded; it was as good an explanation as any.</p><p>\u201cThey have seen a thing concerning the Tsalagi. Both my wife and my daughter have seen this thing.\u201d</p><p>Bird\u2019s attention sharpened, hearing this. Dreams were important; for more than one person to share a dream was extraordinary, and therefore most important.</p><p>\u201cIt grieves me to tell you,\u201d Jamie said, and meant it. \u201cSixty years from this time, the Tsalagi will be taken from their lands, removed to a new place. Many will die on this journey, so that the path they tread will be called . . .\u201d He groped for the word for \u201ctears,\u201d did not find it, and ended, \u201cthe trail where they wept.\u201d</p><p>Bird\u2019s lips pursed, as though to draw smoke, but the pipe fumed unnoticed in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWho will do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho can?\u201d</p><p>Jamie drew a deep breath; here was the difficulty. And yet\u2014so much less difficult than he had thought, now that it came to the matter.</p><p>\u201cIt will be white men,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will not be King George\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe French?\u201d Cameron spoke with a hint of incredulity, but frowned, nonetheless, trying to see how this might come to pass. \u201cOr the Spanish, do they mean? The Spanish are a good deal closer\u2014but none sae many.\u201d Spain still held the country south of Georgia, and parts of the Indies, but the English held Georgia firmly; there was little apparent chance of any northward movement by the Spaniards.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not Spanish, not French.\u201d He could wish Ian had stayed, for more than one reason. But the lad had not, and so he would have to struggle with the Tsalagi, which was an interesting tongue, but one in which he could talk fluently only of solid things\u2014and of a very limited future.</p><p>\u201cWhat they tell me\u2014what my women say\u2014\u201d He struggled to find sensible words. \u201cA thing that they see in their dreams, this thing will come to pass, if it concerns many people. But they think it may not come to pass, if it concerns a few, or one.\u201d</p><p>Bird blinked, confused\u2014and no wonder. Grimly, Jamie tried again to explain.</p><p>\u201cThere are large things, and there are small things. A large thing is a thing like a great battle, or the raising up of a notable chief\u2014though he is one man, he is raised up by the voices of many. If my women dream of these large things, then they will happen. But in any large thing, there are many people. Some say do this; others, do that.\u201d He zigzagged his hand to and fro, and Bird nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo. If many people say, \u2018Do this\u2019\u201d\u2014he stabbed his fingers sharply to the left\u2014\u201cthen this happens. But what of the people who said, \u2018do that\u2019?\u201d And he jerked a thumb back the other way. \u201cThese people may choose a different way.\u201d</p><p>Bird made the hm-hm-hm! sound he used when startled.</p><p>\u201cSo it may be that some will not go?\u201d Cameron asked sharply. \u201cThey might escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Jamie said simply.</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, each man staring into the fire, each seeing his own visions\u2014of the future, or the past.</p><p>\u201cThis wife you have,\u201d Bird said at last, deeply contemplative, \u201cdid you pay a great deal for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cost me almost everything I had,\u201d he said, with a wry tone that made the others laugh. \u201cBut worth it.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS VERY LATE when he went to the guesthouse; the moon had set, and the sky had that look of deep serenity, the stars singing to themselves in endless night. His body ached in every muscle, and he was so tired that he stumbled on the threshold. His instincts were still working, though, and he felt, rather than saw, someone move in the shadows of the sleeping-couch.</p><p>God, Bird was still at it. Well, tonight it wouldn\u2019t matter; he could lie nak*d with a covey of young women, and sleep sound. Too exhausted to be annoyed by her presence, he struggled for some polite acknowledgment of the woman. Then she stood up.</p><p>The firelight showed him an elderly woman, her hair in grizzled plaits, her dress of white buckskin decorated with paint and porcupine quills. He recognized Calls-in-the-Forest, dressed in her best. Bird\u2019s sense of humor had finally got completely out of hand; he had sent Jamie his mother.</p><p>All grasp of Tsalagi deserted him. He opened his mouth, but merely gaped at her. She smiled, very slightly, and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome and lie down, Bear-Killer,\u201d she said. Her voice was kind and gruff. \u201cI\u2019ve come to comb the snakes from your hair.\u201d</p><p>She drew him unresisting to the couch, and made him lie down with his head in her lap. Sure enough; she unplaited his hair and spread it out across her knees, her touch soothing to his throbbing head and the painful knot on his brow.</p><p>He had no idea how old she might be, but her fingers were muscular and tireless, making small, rhythmic circles in his scalp, on his temples, behind his ears, near to the bone at the base of his skull. She had thrown sweet grass and some other herb on the fire; the chimney hole was drawing well and he could see white smoke rising upward in a wavering pillar, very calm, but a sense of constant movement in it.</p><p>She was humming to herself, or rather whispering some song, the words too indistinct to make out. He watched the silent shapes stream upward in the smoke, and felt his body growing heavy, limbs filled with wet sand, his body a sandbag placed in the path of a flood.</p><p>\u201cTalk, Bear-Killer,\u201d she said very softly, breaking off her chant. She had a wooden comb in her hand; he felt the teeth of it caress his scalp, rounded with wear.</p><p>\u201cI cannot call your words to me,\u201d he said, searching for each word in Tsalagi, and thus speaking very slowly. She made a small snorting noise in reply.</p><p>\u201cThe words don\u2019t matter, nor the tongue in which you speak,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly talk. I will understand.\u201d</p><p>And so he began haltingly to speak\u2014in Gaelic, as it was the only tongue that didn\u2019t seem to require any effort. He understood that he was to speak of what filled his heart, and so began with Scotland\u2014and Culloden. Of grief. Of loss. Of fear.</p><p>And in the speaking turned from past to future, where he saw these three specters loom again, cold creatures coming toward him out of the fog, looking through their empty eyes.</p><p>Another stood among them\u2014Jack Randall\u2014confusingly on both sides of him. Those eyes were not empty, but alive, intent in a misty face. Had he killed the man, or not? If he had, did the ghost follow at his heels? Or if he had not, was it the thought of vengeance unsatisfied that haunted him, taunted him with its imperfect memory?</p><p>But in the speaking, he seemed somehow to rise a little way above his body, and see himself at rest, eyes open, fixed upward, his hair darkly flaming in a halo round his head, streaked with the silver of his age. And here he saw that he merely was, in a place between, apart. And quite alone. At peace.</p><p>\u201cI hold to no evil in my heart,\u201d he said, hearing his voice come slow, from a long way off. \u201cThis evil does not touch me. More may come, but not this. Not here. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d whispered the old woman, and went on combing his hair as the white smoke rose silent toward the hole to the sky.</p><p>45</p><p>A TAINT IN THE BLOOD</p><p>June 1774</p><p>I SAT BACK ON MY HEELS and stretched, tired but pleased. My back ached, my knees creaked like hinges, my fingernails were caked with dirt, and strands of hair stuck to my neck and cheeks\u2014but the new crops of pole beans, onions, turnips, and radishes were planted, the cabbages weeded and culled, and a dozen large peanut bushes had been pulled up and hung to dry on the garden palisades, safe from marauding squirrels.</p><p>I glanced up at the sun; still above the chestnut trees. Time enough then before supper for a last chore or two. I stood up and surveyed my small kingdom, debating where best to spend my remaining time. Rooting up the catmint and lemon balm that threatened to engulf the far corner of the garden? Carting baskets of nicely rotted manure up from the heap behind the barn? No, that was man\u2019s work.</p><p>Herbs? My three French lavender bushes stood knee-high, thick with deep blue swabs on slender stalks, and the yarrow was well in bloom, with lacy umbels of white and pink and yellow. I rubbed a finger under my itching nose, trying to recall whether this was the proper phase of the moon in which to cut yarrow. Lavender and rosemary should be cut in the morning, though, when the volatile oils had risen with the sun; it wasn\u2019t as potent if taken later in the day.</p><p>Down with the mint, then. I reached for the hoe I had left leaning against the fence, saw a face leering through the palisades, and started back, my heart leaping into my throat.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d My visitor had jumped back, too, equally startled. \u201cBitte, ma\u2019am! Didn\u2019t mean to fright ye.\u201d</p><p>It was Manfred McGillivray, peeping shyly through the drooping vines of morning glory and wild yam. He\u2019d come earlier in the day, bringing a canvas-wrapped bundle containing several muskets for Jamie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d I stooped to pick up the hoe I had dropped. \u201cAre you looking for Lizzie? She\u2019s in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, no, ma\u2019am. That is, I\u2014do ye think I might have a word, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cAlone, like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come along in; we can talk while I hoe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and went round to let himself in by the gate. What might he want with me? I wondered. He had on a coat and boots, both covered in dust, and his breeches were badly creased. He\u2019d been riding some way, then, not just from his family\u2019s cabin\u2014and he hadn\u2019t been into the house yet; Mrs. Bug would have dusted him off, forcibly.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d I asked, offering him the gourd dipper from my water bucket. He accepted it, drinking thirstily, then wiped his mouth politely on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cThank ye, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve been to Hillsboro, for to fetch the . . . er . . . the things for Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That seems a long way,\u201d I said mildly.</p><p>A look of profound uneasiness crossed his face. He was a nice-looking boy, tanned and handsome as a young faun under his crop of dark, curly hair, but he looked almost furtive now, glancing back over his shoulder toward the house, as though fearful of interruption.</p><p>\u201cI . . . um . . . well, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s to do, a bit, with what I meant to speak to ye about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Well . . .\u201d I made a cordial gesture, indicating that he should feel free to unburden himself, and turned away to begin my hoeing, so that he might feel less self-conscious. I was beginning to suspect what he wanted to ask me, though I wasn\u2019t sure what Hillsboro had to do with it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . ah . . . well, it\u2019s to do with Mrs. Lizzie,\u201d he began, folding his hands behind him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said encouragingly, nearly sure that I was right in my suppositions. I glanced toward the western end of the garden, where the bees were buzzing happily among the tall yellow umbels of the dauco plants. Well, it was better than the eighteenth-century notion of condoms, at least.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry her,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stopped hoeing and straightened up, staring at him. His lips were pressed tightly together, and I saw now that what I had taken for shyness had been his attempt to mask a deep unhappiness that now showed plainly in the lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come and sit down.\u201d I led him to the small bench Jamie had made me, set beneath the shade of a black gum tree that overhung the north side of the garden.</p><p>He sat, head drooping and hands trapped between his knees. I took off my broad-brimmed sun hat, wiped my face on my apron, and pinned up my hair more neatly, breathing in the cool freshness of the spruce and balsam trees that grew on the slope above.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked gently, seeing that he did not know how to start. \u201cAre you afraid that perhaps you don\u2019t love her?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a startled look, then turned his head back to the studied contemplation of his knees.</p><p>\u201cOh. No, ma\u2019am. I mean\u2014I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s no matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean\u2014I\u2019m sure we should grow to be fond of one another, meine Mutter says so. And I like her well enough now, to be sure,\u201d he added hastily, as though fearing this might sound insulting. \u201cDa says she\u2019s a tidy wee soul, and my sisters are verra fond of her indeed.\u201d</p><p>I made a noncommittal sound. I had had my doubts about this match to begin with, and it was beginning to sound as though they were justified.</p><p>\u201cIs there . . . perhaps someone else?\u201d I asked delicately.</p><p>Manfred shook his head slowly, and I heard him swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am.\u201d He drew a deep breath. \u201cI mean\u2014there was. But that\u2019s all done with now.\u201d</p><p>I was puzzled by this. If he had decided to renounce this mysterious other girl\u2014whether out of fear of his mother, or for some other reason\u2014then what was stopping him from going through with the marriage to Lizzie?</p><p>\u201cThe other girl\u2014is she by chance from Hillsboro?\u201d Things were coming a little clearer. When I had first met him and his family at the Gathering, his sisters had exchanged knowing glances at mention of Manfred\u2019s visits to Hillsboro. They had known about it then, even if Ute had not.</p><p>\u201cAye. That\u2019s why I went to Hillsboro\u2014I mean, I had to go, for the . . . er . . . But I meant to see . . . Myra . . . and tell her that I would be married to Miss Wemyss and couldna come to see her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyra.\u201d So she had a name, at least. I sat back, tapping my foot meditatively. \u201cYou meant to\u2014so you didn\u2019t see her, after all?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again, and I saw a tear drop and spread suddenly on the dusty homespun of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice half-choked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. She was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said softly. \u201cOh, I am so sorry.\u201d The tears were falling on his knees, making spots on the cloth, and his shoulders shook, but he didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>I reached out and gathered him into my arms, holding him tight against my shoulder. His hair was soft and springy and his skin flushed with heat against my neck. I felt helpless to deal with his grief; he was too old to comfort with mere touch, too young\u2014perhaps\u2014to find any solace in words. There was nothing I could do for the moment save hold him.</p><p>His arms went round my waist, though, and he clung to me for several minutes after his weeping was spent. I held him quietly, patting his back and keeping watch through the flickering green shadows of the vine-twined palisades, lest anyone else come looking for me in the garden.</p><p>At last he sighed, let go, and sat up. I groped for a handkerchief, and not finding one, pulled off my apron and handed it to him to wipe his face.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t marry right away,\u201d I said, when he seemed to have regained possession of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s only right that you should take a little time to\u2014to heal. But we can find some excuse to put the wedding off; I\u2019ll speak to Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was shaking his head, a look of sad determination taking the place of tears.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, low-voiced but definite. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyra was a whore, ma\u2019am. She died of the French disease.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me then, and I saw the terror in his eyes, behind the grief.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYE\u2019RE SURE?\u201d Jamie set down the hoof he had been trimming, and looked bleakly at Manfred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I said tartly. I had obliged Manfred to show me the evidence\u2014in fact, I had taken scrapings from the lesion to examine microscopically\u2014then took him straight to find Jamie, barely waiting for the boy to do up his breeches.</p><p>Jamie looked fixedly at Manfred, plainly trying to decide what to say. Manfred, purple-faced from the double stress of confession and examination, dropped his own eyes before this basilisk gaze, staring at a crescent of black hoof paring that lay on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that sorry, sir,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2014I didna mean to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna suppose anyone does,\u201d Jamie said. He breathed deeply and made a sort of subterranean growling noise that caused Manfred to hunch his shoulders and try to withdraw his head, turtlelike, into the safer confines of his clothing.</p><p>\u201cHe did do the right thing,\u201d I pointed out, trying to put the best face possible on the situation. \u201cNow, I mean\u2014telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted.</p><p>\u201cWell, he couldna be poxing wee Lizzie, now, could he? That\u2019s worse than only going wi\u2019 a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose some men would just keep quiet about it, and hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, some would.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at Manfred, evidently looking for overt indications that Manfred might be a villain of this description.</p><p>Gideon, who disliked having his feet messed about and was consequently in bad temper, stamped heavily, narrowly missing Jamie\u2019s own foot. He tossed his head, and emitted a rumbling noise that I thought was roughly the equivalent of Jamie\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d Jamie left off glaring at Manfred, and grabbed Gideon\u2019s halter. \u201cGo along to the house with him, Sassenach. I\u2019ll finish here, and then we\u2019ll have Joseph in and see what\u2019s to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I hesitated, unsure whether to speak in front of Manfred. I didn\u2019t want to raise his hopes too much, until I\u2019d had a chance to look at the scrapings under the microscope.</p><p>The spirochetes of syphilis were very distinctive, but I didn\u2019t think I had a stain that would allow me to see them with a simple light microscope such as mine was. And while I thought my homemade penicillin could likely eliminate the infection, I would have no way of knowing for certain, unless I could see them, and then see that they had disappeared from his blood.</p><p>I contented myself with saying, \u201cI have got penicillin, mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken that well enough, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie switched his baleful look from Manfred to me. I\u2019d saved his life with the penicillin\u2014twice\u2014but he hadn\u2019t enjoyed the process. With a Scottish noise of dismissal, he bent and picked up Gideon\u2019s enormous hoof again.</p><p>Manfred seemed a bit shell-shocked, and said nothing on the way to the house. He hesitated at the door to the surgery, glancing uneasily from the gleaming microscope to the open box of surgical tools, and then toward the covered bowls lined up on the counter, in which I grew my penicillin colonies.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, but was obliged to reach out and take him by the sleeve before he would step across the threshold. It occurred to me that he hadn\u2019t been to the surgery before; it was a good five miles to the McGillivrays\u2019 place, and Frau McGillivray was entirely capable of dealing with her family\u2019s minor ills.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t feeling terribly charitable toward Manfred at the moment, but gave him a stool and asked if he would like a cup of coffee. I thought he could probably use a stiff drink, if he was about to have an interview with Jamie and Joseph Wemyss, but supposed I had better keep him clear-headed.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, and swallowed, white-faced. \u201cI mean, thank ye, no.\u201d</p><p>He looked extremely young, and very frightened.</p><p>\u201cRoll up your sleeve then, please. I\u2019m going to draw a bit of blood, but it won\u2019t hurt much. How did you come to meet the, er, young lady? Myra, that was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am.\u201d Tears welled in his eyes at her name; I suppose he really had loved her, poor boy\u2014or thought he had.</p><p>He had met Myra in a tavern in Hillsboro. She had seemed kind, he said, and was very pretty, and when she asked the young gunsmith to buy her a glass of geneva, he had obliged, feeling dashing.</p><p>\u201cSo we drank a bit together, and she laughed at me, and . . .\u201d He seemed rather at a loss to explain how matters had progressed from there, but he had waked up in her bed. That had sealed the matter, so far as he was concerned, and he had seized every excuse to go to Hillsboro thereafter.</p><p>\u201cHow long did this affair go on?\u201d I asked, interested. Lacking a decent syringe for drawing blood, I\u2019d merely pierced the vein inside his elbow with a fleam, and drained off the welling blood into a small vial. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the better part of two years, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI kent I couldna wed her,\u201d he explained earnestly. \u201cMeine Mutter would never . . .\u201d He trailed off, assuming the look of a startled rabbit hearing hounds in its immediate vicinity. \u201cGruss Gott!\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been wondering about that particular aspect of the affair myself. Ute McGillivray wasn\u2019t going to be at all pleased to hear that her pride and joy, her only son, had contracted a disreputable disease, and furthermore, one which was about to lead to the breaking of his carefully engineered engagement and very likely to a scandal that the entire backcountry would hear about. The fact that it was generally a fatal disease would probably be a secondary concern.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll kill me!\u201d he said, sliding off his stool and rolling his sleeve down hastily.</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cThough I suppose\u2014\u201d</p><p>At this fraught moment came the sound of the back door opening and voices in the kitchen. Manfred stiffened, dark curls quivering with alarm. Then heavy footsteps started down the hall toward the surgery, and he dived across the room, flung a leg across the windowsill, and was off, running like a deer for the trees.</p><p>\u201cCome back here, you ass!\u201d I bellowed through the open window.</p><p>\u201cWhich ass is that, Auntie?\u201d I turned to see that the heavy footsteps belonged to Young Ian\u2014heavy, because he was carrying Lizzie Wemyss in his arms.</p><p>\u201cLizzie! What\u2019s the matter? Here, put her on the table.\u201d I could see at once what the matter was: a return of the malarial fever. She was limp, but shivered nonetheless with chill, the contracting muscles shaking her like jelly.</p> <p>\u201cI found her in the dairy shed,\u201d Ian said, laying her gently on the table. \u201cThe deaf Beardsley came rushin\u2019 out as though the devil was chasing him, saw me, and dragged me in. She was on the floor, wi\u2019 the churn overturned beside her.\u201d</p><p>This was very worrying\u2014she hadn\u2019t had an attack for some time, but for a second time, the attack had come upon her too suddenly for her to go for help, causing almost immediate collapse.</p><p>\u201cTop shelf of the cupboard,\u201d I said to Ian, hastily rolling Lizzie on her side and undoing her laces. \u201cThat bluish jar\u2014no, the big one.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed it without question, removing the lid as he brought it to me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Auntie! What\u2019s that?\u201d He wrinkled his nose at the smell from the ointment.</p><p>\u201cGallberries and cinchona bark in goose grease, among other things. Take some and start rubbing it into her feet.\u201d</p> <p>Looking bemused, he gingerly scooped up a dollop of the purplish-gray cream and did as I said, Lizzie\u2019s small bare foot nearly disappearing between the large palms of his hands.</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right, d\u2019ye think, Auntie?\u201d He glanced at her face, looking troubled. The look of her was enough to trouble anyone\u2014the clammy color of whey, and the flesh gone slack so that her delicate cheeks juddered with the chills.</p><p>\u201cProbably. Close your eyes, Ian.\u201d I\u2019d got her clothes loosened, and now pulled off her gown, petticoats, pocket, and stays. I threw a ratty blanket over her before working the shift off over her head\u2014she owned only two, and wouldn\u2019t want one spoiled with the reek of the ointment.</p><p>Ian had obediently closed his eyes, but was still rubbing the ointment methodically into her feet, a small frown drawing his brows together, the look of concern lending him for a moment a brief but startling resemblance to Jamie.</p><p>I drew the jar toward me, scooped up some ointment, and, reaching under the blanket, began to rub it into the thinner skin beneath her armpits, then over her back and belly. I could feel the outlines of her liver distinctly, a large, firm mass beneath her ribs. Swollen, and tender from the way she grimaced at my touch; there was some ongoing damage there, certainly.</p><p>\u201cCan I open my eyes now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014yes, of course. Rub more up her legs, please, Ian.\u201d Shoving the jar back in his direction, I caught a glimpse of movement in the doorway. One of the Beardsley twins stood there, clinging to the jamb, dark eyes fixed on Lizzie. Kezzie, it must be; Ian had said \u201cthe deaf Beardsley\u201d had come to fetch help.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said to him, raising my voice, and he nodded once, then disappeared, with a single burning glance at Ian.</p> <p>\u201cWho was it ye were shouting at, Auntie Claire?\u201d Ian looked up at me, clearly as much to preserve Lizzie\u2019s modesty as from courtesy to me; the blanket was turned back and his big hands were smoothing ointment into the skin above her knee, thumbs gently circling the small rounded curves of her patella, her skin so thin that the pearly bone seemed almost visible through it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014oh. Manfred McGillivray,\u201d I said, suddenly recollecting. \u201cDamn! The blood!\u201d I leapt up and wiped my hands hurriedly on my apron. Thank God, I\u2019d corked the vial; the blood inside was still liquid. It wouldn\u2019t keep long, though.</p><p>\u201cDo her hands and arms, would you please, Ian? I\u2019ve got to manage this quickly.\u201d</p><p>He moved obligingly to do as I said, while I hastily spilled a drop of blood on each of several slides, dragging a clean slide across each one to make a smear. What sort of stain might work on spirochetes? No telling; I\u2019d try them all.</p><p>I explained the matter disjointedly to Ian, as I pulled stain bottles out of the cupboard, made up the solutions, and set the slides to soak.</p><p>\u201cThe pox? Poor lad; he must be nearly mad wi\u2019 fright.\u201d He eased Lizzie\u2019s arm, gleaming with ointment, under the blanket and tucked it gently round her.</p><p>I was momentarily surprised at this show of sympathy, but then remembered. Ian had been exposed to syphilis some years before, after his abduction by Geillis Duncan; I hadn\u2019t been sure that he had the disease, but had dosed him with the last of my twentieth-century penicillin, just in case.</p><p>\u201cDid ye not tell him ye could cure him, though, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t the chance. Though I\u2019m not absolutely sure that I can, to be honest.\u201d I sat down on a stool, and took Lizzie\u2019s other hand, feeling for her pulse.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re not?\u201d His feathery brows went up at that. \u201cYe told me I was cured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIf you ever had the disease in the first place.\u201d I gave him a sharp look. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a sore on your prick, have you? Or anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, mute, a dark wave of blood staining his lean cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGood. But the penicillin I gave you\u2014that was some that I\u2019d brought from . . . well, from before. That was purified\u2014very strong and certainly potent. I\u2019m never sure, when I use this stuff\u201d\u2014I gestured at the culturing bowls on the counter\u2014\u201cwhether it\u2019s strong enough to work, or even the right strain. . . .\u201d I rubbed the back of my hand under my nose; the gallberry ointment, had a most penetrating smell.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d I had had more than one patient with an infection that didn\u2019t respond to one of my penicillin concoctions\u2014though in those cases, I had often succeeded with another attempt. In a few instances, the person had recovered on his own before the second brew was ready. In one instance, the patient had died, despite applications of two different penicillin mixtures.</p><p>Ian nodded slowly, his eyes on Lizzie\u2019s face. The first bout of chills had spent itself and she lay quiet, the blanket barely moving over the slight round of her chest.</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019re no sure, then . . . ye\u2019d not let him marry her, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Jamie said he\u2019d speak to Mr. Wemyss, see what he thought of the matter.\u201d</p><p>I rose and took the first of the slides from its pinkish bath, shook off the clinging drops, and, wiping the bottom of the slide, placed it carefully on the platform of my microscope.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye looking for, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings called spirochetes. Those are the particular kind of germ that causes syphilis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Despite the seriousness of the situation, I smiled, hearing the note of skepticism in his voice. I\u2019d shown him microorganisms before, but\u2014like Jamie\u2014like almost everyone\u2014he simply couldn\u2019t believe that something so nearly invisible was capable of harm. The only one who had seemed to accept the notion wholeheartedly was Malva Christie, and in her case, I thought the acceptance was due simply to her faith in me. If I told her something, she believed me; very refreshing, after years of assorted Scots looking at me with varying degrees of squiggle-eyed suspicion.</p><p>\u201cHas he gone home, d\u2019ye think? Manfred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I spoke absently, slowly moving the slide to and fro, searching. I could make out the red blood cells, pale pink discs that floated past my field of view, drifting lazily in the watery stain. No deadly spirals visible\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t there, only that the stain I had used might not reveal them.</p><p>Lizzie stirred and moaned, and I looked round to see her eyes flutter open.</p><p>\u201cThere, lass,\u201d Ian said softly, and smiled at her. \u201cBetter, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she said faintly. Still, the corners of her mouth lifted slightly, and she put a hand out from under her blanket, groping. He took it in his, patting it.</p><p>\u201cManfred,\u201d she said, turning her head to and fro, eyes half-lidded. \u201cIs Manfred here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . no,\u201d I said, exchanging a quick glance of consternation with Ian. How much had she heard? \u201cNo, he was here, but he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Seeming to lose interest, she closed her eyes again. Ian looked down at her, still stroking her hand. His face showed deep sympathy\u2014with perhaps a tinge of calculation.</p><p>\u201cShall I maybe carry the lassie up to her bed?\u201d he asked softly, as though she might be sleeping. \u201cAnd then maybe go and find . . . ?\u201d He tilted his head toward the open window, raising one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIf you would, please, Ian.\u201d I hesitated, and his eyes met mine, deep hazel and soft with worry and the shadow of remembered pain. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said, trying to infuse a sense of certainty into the words.</p><p>\u201cAye, she will,\u201d he said firmly, and stooped to gather her up, tucking the blanket under her. \u201cIf I\u2019ve anything to say about it.\u201d</p><p>46</p><p>IN WHICH THINGS</p><p>GANG AGLEY</p><p>MANFRED MCGILLIVRAY did not come back. Ian did, with a blackened eye, skinned knuckles, and the terse report that Manfred had declared a set intention of going off and hanging himself, and good riddance to the fornicating son of a bitch, and might his rotten bowels gush forth like Judas Iscariot\u2019s, the traitorous, stinking wee turd. He then stamped upstairs, to stand silent over Lizzie\u2019s bed for a time.</p><p>Hearing this, I hoped that Manfred\u2019s statement was merely the counsel of temporary despair\u2014and cursed myself for not having told him at once and in the strongest terms that he could be cured, whether it was absolutely true or not. Surely he wouldn\u2019t . . .</p><p>Lizzie was half-conscious, prostrated with the burning fevers and shaking agues of malaria, and in no fit state to be told of her betrothed\u2019s desertion, nor the cause of it. I would have to make some delicate inquiries, though, so soon as she was fit, because there was the possibility that she and Manfred had anticipated their marriage vows, and if so . . .</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s the one thing about it,\u201d Jamie observed grimly. \u201cThe Beardsley twins were making ready to track our poxed lad down and castrate him, but now they\u2019ve heard he means to hang himself, they\u2019ve magnanimously decided that will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord for small blessings,\u201d I said, sinking down at the table. \u201cThey might really do it.\u201d The Beardsleys, particularly Josiah, were excellent trackers\u2014and not given to idle threats.</p><p>\u201cOh, they would,\u201d Jamie assured me. \u201cThey were most seriously sharpening their knives when I found them at it and told them not to trouble themselves.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed an involuntary smile at the image of the Beardsleys, bent side by side over a grindstone, their lean, dark faces set in identical scowls of vengeance, but the momentary flash of humor faded.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. We\u2019ll have to tell the McGillivrays.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, looking pale at the thought, but pushed back his bench.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best go straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2019til ye\u2019ve had a bite.\u201d Mrs. Bug put a plate of food firmly in front of him. \u201cYe dinna want to be dealing wi\u2019 Ute McGillivray on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated, but evidently found her argument to have merit, for he picked up his fork and addressed himself to the ragoo\u2019d pork with grim determination.</p><p>\u201cJamie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should let the Beardsleys track Manfred down. Not to hurt him, I don\u2019t mean\u2014but we need to find him. He will die of it, if he isn\u2019t treated.\u201d</p><p>He paused, a forkful of ragoo halfway to his mouth, and regarded me under lowered brows.</p><p>\u201cAye, and if they find him, he\u2019ll die of that, Sassenach.\u201d He shook his head, and the fork completed its journey. He chewed and swallowed, evidently completing his plan as he did so.</p><p>\u201cJoseph\u2019s in Bethabara, courting. He\u2019ll have to be told, and by rights, I should fetch him to go with me to the McGillivrays\u2019. But . . .\u201d He hesitated, clearly envisioning Mr. Wemyss, that mildest and shyest of men, and no one\u2019s notion of a useful ally. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll go and tell Robin. May be as he\u2019ll start searching for the lad himself\u2014or Manfred may have thought better of it and run for home already.\u201d</p><p>That was a cheering thought, and I saw him off with hope in mind. But he returned near midnight, grim-faced and silent, and I knew that Manfred had not come home.</p><p>\u201cYou told them both?\u201d I asked, turning back the coverlet for him to crawl in beside me. He smelled of horse and night, cool and pungent.</p><p>\u201cI asked Robin to walk outside wi\u2019 me, and told him. I hadna the nerve to tell Ute to her face,\u201d he admitted. He smiled at me, snuggling under the quilt. \u201cYe dinna think me too much a coward, I hope, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d I assured him, and leaned to blow out the candle. \u201cDiscretion is the better part of valor.\u201d</p><p>WE WERE ROUSED just before dawn by a thunderous pounding on the door. Rollo, who had been sleeping on the landing, shot down the stair, roaring threats. He was closely followed by Ian, who had been sitting up by Lizzie\u2019s bed, keeping watch while I slept. Jamie leapt out of bed and, seizing a loaded pistol from the top of the wardrobe, rushed to join the fray.</p><p>Shocked and dazed\u2014I had been asleep for less than an hour\u2014I sat up, heart pounding. Rollo stopped barking for a moment, and I heard Jamie shout, \u201cWho is it?\u201d through the door.</p><p>This query was answered by a renewed pounding that echoed up the stairwell and seemed to shake the house, accompanied by an upraised feminine voice that would have done credit to Wagner in one of his more robust moods. Ute McGillivray.</p><p>I began to struggle out of the bedclothes. Meanwhile, a confusion of voices, renewed barking, the grate of the bolt being lifted\u2014and then more confused voices, all much louder. I ran to the window and looked out; Robin McGillivray was standing in the dooryard, having evidently just dismounted from one of a pair of mules.</p><p>He looked much older, and somehow deflated, as though the spirit had gone out of him, taking all his strength and leaving him flabby. He turned his head away from whatever riot was taking place on the stoop, closing his eyes. The sun was just up now, and the pure clear light showed up all the lines and hollows of exhaustion and a desperate unhappiness.</p><p>As though he sensed me looking at him, he opened his eyes and raised his face toward the window. He was red-eyed, disheveled. He saw me, but didn\u2019t respond to my tentative wave of greeting. Instead, he turned away, closing his eyes again, and stood, waiting.</p><p>The riot below had moved inside, and appeared to be progressing up the stairs, borne on a wave of Scottish expostulations and Germanic shrieks, punctuated by enthusiastic barking from Rollo, always willing to lend his efforts to further the festivities.</p><p>I seized my wrapper from its peg, but had barely got one arm into it before the door of the bedchamber was flung open, crashing into the wall so hard that it rebounded and hit her in the chest. Nothing daunted, she slammed it open again and advanced on me like a juggernaut, cap awry and eyes blazing.</p><p>\u201cYou! Weibchen! How you dare, such insult, such lies to say my son about! You I kill, I tear off your hair, nighean na galladh! You\u2014\u201d</p><p>She lunged at me and I flung myself sideways, narrowly avoiding her grab at my arm.</p><p>\u201cUte! Frau McGillivray! Listen to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The second grab was more successful; she got hold of the sleeve of my night rail and wrenched, dragging the garment off my shoulder with a rending noise of torn cloth, even as she clawed at my face with her free hand.</p><p>I jerked back, and screamed with all my strength, my nerves recalling for one dreadful instant a hand striking at my face, hands pulling at me. . . .</p><p>I struck at her, the strength of terror flooding through my limbs, screaming, screaming, some tiny remnant of rationality in my brain watching this, bemused, appalled\u2014but completely unable to stop the animal panic, the unreasoning rage that geysered up from some deep and unsuspected well.</p><p>I hit out, hammering blindly, screaming\u2014wondering even as I did so, why, why was I doing this?</p><p>An arm grabbed me round the waist and I was lifted off the ground. A fresh spurt of panic ripped through me, and then I found myself suddenly alone, untouched. I was standing in the corner by the wardrobe, swaying drunkenly, panting. Jamie stood in front of me, shoulders braced and elbows raised, shielding me.</p><p>He was talking, very calmly, but I had lost the capacity to make sense of words. I pressed my hands back against the wall, and felt some sense of comfort from its solid bulk.</p><p>My heart was still hammering in my ears, the sound of my own breathing scaring me, it was so like the gasping sound when Harley Boble had broken my nose. I shut my mouth hard, trying to stop. Holding my breath seemed to work, allowing only small inhalations through my now-functioning nose.</p><p>The movement of Ute\u2019s mouth caught my eye and I stared at it, trying to fix myself once more in time and space. I was hearing words, but couldn\u2019t quite make the jump of comprehension. I breathed, letting the words flow over me like water, taking emotion from them\u2014anger, reason, protest, placation, shrillness, growling\u2014but no explicit meaning.</p><p>Then I took a deep breath, wiped my face\u2014I was surprised to find it wet\u2014and suddenly everything snapped back to normal. I could hear, and understand.</p><p>Ute was staring at me, anger and dislike clear on her face, but muted by a lurking horror.</p><p>\u201cYou are mad,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cI see.\u201d She sounded almost calm at this point. \u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Jamie, automatically twisting up untidy handsful of grizzled blond hair, stuffing them under her enormous cap. The ribbon had been torn; a loop of it dangled absurdly over one eye.</p><p>\u201cSo, she is mad. I will say so, but still, my son\u2014my son!\u2014is gone. So.\u201d She stood heaving, surveying me, and shook her head, then turned again to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cSalem is closed to you,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cMy family, those who know us\u2014they will not trade with you. Nor anyone else I speak to, to tell them the wicked thing she has done.\u201d Her eye drifted back to me, a cold, gelid blue, and her lip curled in a heavy sneer under the loop of torn ribbon.</p><p>\u201cYou are shunned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do not exist, you.\u201d She turned on her heel and walked out, forcing Ian and Rollo to sidestep hastily out of her way. Her footfalls echoed heavily on the stair, a ponderous, measured tread, like the tolling of a passing bell.</p><p>I saw the tension in Jamie\u2019s shoulders relax, little by little. He was still wearing his nightshirt\u2014there was a damp patch between his shoulder blades\u2014and had the pistol still in his hand.</p><p>The front door boomed shut below. Everyone stood still, struck silent.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really have shot her, would you?\u201d I asked, clearing my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned, staring at me. Then he caught the direction of my glance, and looked at the pistol in his hand as though wondering where that had come from.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cno,\u201d and shook his head, reaching up to put it back on top of the wardrobe. \u201cI forgot I had it. Though God kens well enough that I should like to shoot the besotted auld besom,\u201d he added. \u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>He stooped to look at me, his eyes soft with worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. I don\u2019t know what\u2014but it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said softly, and looked away, lashes coming down to hide his eyes. Had he felt it, too, then? Found himself suddenly . . . back? I knew he had sometimes. Remembered waking from sleep in Paris to see him braced in an open window, pressing so hard against the frame that the muscles stood out in his arms, visible by moonlight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I repeated, touching him, and he gave me a brief, shy smile.</p><p>\u201cYe should have bitten her,\u201d Ian was saying earnestly to Rollo. \u201cShe\u2019s got an arse the size of a hogshead of tobacco\u2014how could ye miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably afraid of being poisoned,\u201d I said, coming out of my corner. \u201cDo you suppose she meant it\u2014or no, she meant it, certainly. But do you suppose she can do it? Stop anyone trading with us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can stop Robin,\u201d Jamie said, a certain grimness returning to his expression. \u201cFor the rest . . . we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, frowning, and rubbed his knuckled fist gingerly against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI kent I should have broken Manfred\u2019s neck,\u201d he said with real regret. \u201cWe could ha\u2019 told Frau Ute he fell off a rock, and saved a deal of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManfred?\u201d The small voice made everyone turn as one, to see who had spoken.</p><p>Lizzie stood in the doorway, thin and pale as a starveling ghost, her eyes huge and glassy with recent fever.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Manfred?\u201d she said. She swayed dangerously, and put out a hand to the jamb, to save herself falling. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoxed and gone,\u201d Ian said curtly, drawing himself up. \u201cYe didna give him your maidenheid, I hope.\u201d</p><p>IN THE EVENT, Ute McGillivray was not quite able to fulfill her threat\u2014but she did enough damage. Manfred\u2019s dramatic disappearance, the breaking of his engagement to Lizzie, and the reason for it was a fearful scandal, and word of it spread from Hillsboro and Salisbury, where he had worked now and then as an itinerant gunsmith, to Salem and High Point.</p><p>But thanks to Ute\u2019s efforts, the story was even more confused than would be normal for such gossip; some said that he was poxed, others that I had maliciously and falsely accused him of being poxed, because of some fancied disagreement with his parents. Others, more kindly, did not believe Manfred was poxed, but said that doubtless I had been mistaken.</p><p>Those who believed him to be poxed were divided as to how he had achieved that condition, half of them convinced that he had got it from some whore, and a good many of the rest speculating that he had got it from poor Lizzie, whose reputation suffered terribly\u2014until Ian, Jamie, the Beardsley twins, and even Roger took to defending her honor with their fists, at which point people did not, of course, stop talking\u2014but stopped talking where any of her champions might hear directly.</p><p>All of Ute\u2019s numerous relatives in and around Wachovia, Salem, Bethabara, and Bethania of course believed her version of the story, and tongues wagged busily. All of Salem did not cease trading with us\u2014but many people did. And more than once, I had the unnerving experience of greeting Moravians I knew well, only to have them stare past me in stony silence, or turn their backs upon me. Often enough that I no longer went to Salem.</p><p>Lizzie, beyond a certain initial mortification, seemed not terribly upset at the rupture of her engagement. Bewildered, confused, and sorry\u2014she said\u2014for Manfred, but not desolated by his loss. And since she seldom left the Ridge anymore, she didn\u2019t hear what people said about her. What did trouble her was the loss of the McGillivrays\u2014particularly Ute.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye see, ma\u2019am,\u201d she told me wistfully, \u201cI\u2019d never had a mother, for my own died when I was born. And then Mutti\u2014she asked me to call her so when I said I\u2019d marry Manfred\u2014she said I was her daughter, just like Hilda and Inga and Senga. She\u2019d fuss over me, and bully me and laugh at me, just as she did them. And it was . . . just so nice, to have all that family. And now I\u2019ve lost them.\u201d</p><p>Robin, who had been sincerely attached to her, had sent her a short, regretful note, sneaked out through the good offices of Ronnie Sinclair. But since Manfred\u2019s disappearance, neither Ute nor the girls had come to see her, nor sent a single word.</p><p>It was Joseph Wemyss, though, who was most visibly affected by the affair. He said nothing, plainly not wishing to make matters worse for Lizzie\u2014but he drooped, like a flower deprived of rain. Beyond his pain for Lizzie, and his distress at the blackening of her reputation, he, too, missed the McGillivrays, missed the joy and comfort of suddenly being part of a large, exuberant family, after so many years of loneliness.</p><p>Worse, though, was that while Ute had not been able to carry out her threat entirely, she had been able to influence her near relatives\u2014including Pastor Berrisch, and his sister, Monika, who, Jamie told me privately, had been forbidden to see or speak to Joseph again.</p><p>\u201cThe Pastor\u2019s sent her away to his wife\u2019s relatives in Halifax,\u201d he said, shaking his head sadly. \u201cTo forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>And of Manfred, there was no slightest trace. Jamie had sent word through all his usual avenues, but no one had seen him since his flight from the Ridge. I thought of him\u2014and prayed for him\u2014daily, haunted by pictures of him skulking in the woods alone, the deadly spirochetes multiplying in his blood day by day. Or, much worse, working his way to the Indies on some ship, pausing in every port to drown his sorrows in the arms of unsuspecting whores, to whom he would pass on the silent, fatal infection\u2014and they, in turn . . .</p><p>Or sometimes, the nightmare image of a bundle of rotting clothes hanging from a tree limb, deep in the forest, with no mourners save the crows who came to pick the flesh from his bones. And despite everything, I could not find it in my heart to hate Ute McGillivray, who must be thinking the same thoughts.</p><p>The sole bright spot in this ruddy quagmire was that Thomas Christie, quite contrary to my expectations, had allowed Malva to continue to come to the surgery, his sole stipulation being that if I proposed to involve his daughter in any further use of the ether, he was to be told ahead of time.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d I stood back, gesturing to her to look through the eyepiece of the microscope. \u201cDo you see them?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed in silent fascination. It had taken no little effort to find a combination of staining and reflected sunlight that would reveal the spirochetes, but I had succeeded at last. They weren\u2019t strongly visible, but you could see them, if you knew what you were looking for\u2014and despite my complete conviction in my original diagnosis, I was relieved to see them.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! Wee spirals. I see them plain!\u201d She looked up at me, blinking. \u201cD\u2019ye mean seriously to tell me that these bittie things are what\u2019s poxed Manfred?\u201d She was too polite to express open skepticism, but I could see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do indeed.\u201d I had explained the germ theory of disease a number of times, to a variety of disbelieving eighteenth-century listeners, and in the light of this experience had little expectation of finding a favorable reception. The normal response was either a blank stare, indulgent laughter, or a sniff of dismissal, and I was more or less expecting a polite version of one of these reactions from Malva. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To my surprise, though, she seemed to grasp the notion at once\u2014or at least pretended to.</p><p>\u201cWell, so.\u201d She put both hands on the counter and peered again at the spirochetes. \u201cThese wee beasties cause the syphilis, then. However do they do that? And why is it that the bittie things ye showed me from my teeth don\u2019t make me ill?\u201d</p><p>I explained, as best I could, the notion of \u201cgood bugs\u201d or \u201cindifferent bugs\u201d versus \u201cbad bugs,\u201d which she seemed to grasp easily\u2014but my explanation of cells, and the concept of the body being composed of these, left her frowning at the palm of her hand in confusion, trying to make out the individual cells. She shook off her doubt, though, and folding up her hand in her apron, returned to her questions.</p><p>Did the bugs cause all disease? The penicillin\u2014why did it work on some of the germs, but not all? And how did the bugs get from one person to another?</p> <p>\u201cSome travel by air\u2014that\u2019s why you must try to avoid people coughing or sneezing on you\u2014and some by water\u2014which is why you mustn\u2019t drink from a stream that someone\u2019s been using as a privy\u2014and some . . . well, by other means.\u201d I didn\u2019t know how much she might know about sex in humans\u2014she lived on a farm, clearly she knew how pigs, chickens, and horses behaved\u2014and I was wary of enlightening her, lest her father hear about it. I rather thought he\u2019d prefer her to be dealing with ether.</p><p>Naturally, she pounced on my evasion.</p><p>\u201cOther means? What other means are there?\u201d With an internal sigh, I told her.</p><p>\u201cThey do what?\u201d she said, incredulous. \u201cMen, I mean. Like an animal! Whyever would a woman let a man do that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they are animals, you know,\u201d I said, suppressing an urge to laugh. \u201cSo are women. As to why one would let them . . .\u201d I rubbed my nose, looking for a tasteful way of putting it. She was moving rapidly ahead of me, though, putting two and two together.</p> <p>\u201cFor money,\u201d she said, looking thunderstruck. \u201cThat\u2019s what a whore does! She lets them do such things to her for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes\u2014but women who aren\u2019t whores\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bairns, aye, ye said.\u201d She nodded, but was plainly thinking of other things; her small, smooth forehead was wrinkled in concentration.</p><p>\u201cHow much money do they get?\u201d she asked. \u201cI should want a lot, I think, to let a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, somewhat taken aback. \u201cDifferent amounts, I expect. Depending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending . . . oh, if he was maybe ugly, ye mean, ye could make him pay more? Or if she were ugly . . .\u201d She gave me a quick, interested look. \u201cBobby Higgins told me of a whore he kent in London, that her looks was spoilt by vitriol.\u201d She looked up at the cupboard where I kept the sulfuric acid under lock and key, and shivered, her delicate shoulders quivering with revulsion at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cYes, he told me about her, too. Vitriol is what we call a caustic\u2014a liquid that burns. That\u2019s why\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her mind had already returned to the subject of fascination.</p><p>\u201cTo think of Manfred McGillivray doing such a thing!\u201d She turned round gray eyes on me. \u201cWell, and Bobby. He must have been, mustn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe soldiers are inclined\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Bible,\u201d she said, squinting thoughtfully. \u201cIt says ye mustna be whoring after idols. Does that mean men went about sticking their pricks into\u2014did the idols look like women, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what it means, no,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cMore a metaphor, you know. Er . . . lusting after something, I think it means, not, er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLust,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s to want something sinful bad, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, rather.\u201d Heat was wavering over my skin, dancing in tiny veils. I needed cool air, quickly, or I\u2019d be flushed as a tomato and drenched with sweat. I rose to go out, but felt I really mustn\u2019t leave her with the impression that sex had to do only with money or babies\u2014even though it well might, for some women.</p> <p>\u201cThere is another reason for intercourse, you know,\u201d I said, speaking over my shoulder as I headed for the door. \u201cWhen you love someone, you want to give them pleasure. And they want to do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure?\u201d Her voice rose behind me, incredulous. \u201cYe mean some women like it?\u201d</p><p>47</p><p>BEES AND SWITCHES</p><p>I WAS BY NO MEANS SPYING. One of my hives had swarmed, and I was looking for the fugitive bees.</p><p>New swarms usually didn\u2019t travel far, and stopped frequently, often resting for hours in a tree fork or open log, where they formed a ball of humming conference. If they could be located before making up their collective mind about where to settle, they could often be persuaded into a temptingly empty basket hive, and thus hauled back into captivity.</p><p>The trouble with bees is that they don\u2019t leave footprints. Now I was casting to and fro on the mountainside, nearly a mile from the house, an empty basket hive slung on a rope over my shoulder, trying to follow Jamie\u2019s instructions regarding hunting, and think like a bee.</p><p>There were huge blooming patches of galax, fire-weed, and other wildflowers on the hillside far above me, but there was a very attractive dead snag\u2014if one was a bee\u2014poking out of the heavy growth some way below.</p><p>The basket hive was heavy, and the slope was steep. It was easier to go down than up. I hitched up the rope, which was beginning to rub the skin off my shoulder, and began sidling downward through sumac and hobble-bush, bracing my feet against rocks and grabbing at branches to keep from slipping.</p><p>Concentrating on my feet, I didn\u2019t take particular notice of where I was. I emerged into a gap in the bushes from which the roof of a cabin was visible, some distance below me. Whose was that? The Christies\u2019, I thought. I wiped a sleeve across the sweat dripping from the point of my chin; the day was warm, and I hadn\u2019t brought a canteen. Perhaps I would stop and ask for water on the way home.</p><p>Making my way at last to the snag, I was disappointed to find no sign of the swarm. I stood still, blotting sweat from my face and listening, in hopes of picking up the bees\u2019 telltale deep drone. I heard the hum and whine of assorted flying insects, and the genial racket of a flock of foraging pygmy nuthatches on the slope above\u2014but no bees.</p><p>I sighed and turned to make my way around the snag, but then paused, my eye caught by a glimpse of white below.</p><p>Thomas Christie and Malva were in the small clearing at the back of their cabin. I had caught the flash of his shirt as he moved, but now he stood motionless, arms crossed.</p><p>His attention appeared to be fixed on his daughter, who was cutting branches from one of the mountain ash trees at the side of the clearing. What for? I wondered.</p><p>There seemed something very peculiar about the scene, though I couldn\u2019t think exactly what. Some attitude of body? Some air of tension between them?</p><p>Malva turned and walked toward her father, several long, slender branches in her hand. Her head was bent, her step dragging, and when she handed him the branches, I understood abruptly what was going on.</p><p>They were too far away for me to hear them, but he apparently said something to her, gesturing brusquely toward the stump they used as a chopping block. She knelt down by it, bent forward, and lifted up her skirts, exposing her bare buttocks.</p><p>Without hesitation, he raised the switches and slashed them hard across her rump, then whipped them back in the other direction, crisscrossing her flesh with vivid lines that I could see even at such a distance. He repeated this several times, whipping the springy twigs back and forth with a measured deliberation whose violence was the more shocking for its lack of apparent emotion.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me to look away. I stood stock-still in the shrubbery, too stunned even to brush away the gnats that swarmed around my face.</p><p>Christie had thrown down the switches, turned on his heel, and gone into the house before I could do more than blink. Malva sat back on her heels and shook down her skirts, smoothing the fabric gingerly over her bottom as she rose. She was red-faced, but not weeping or distraught.</p><p>She\u2019s used to it. The thought came unbidden. I hesitated, not knowing what to do. Before I could decide, Malva had settled her cap, turned, and walked into the woods with an air of determination\u2014headed straight toward me.</p><p>I ducked behind a big tulip poplar, before I was even aware of making a decision. She wasn\u2019t injured, and I was sure she wouldn\u2019t like to know that anyone had seen the incident.</p><p>Malva passed within a few feet of me, puffing a little on the climb, and snorting through her nose and muttering in a way that made me think she was very angry, rather than upset.</p><p>I peered cautiously round the poplar, but caught no more than a glimpse of her cap, bobbing through the trees. There were no cabins up there, and she hadn\u2019t carried a basket or any tools for foraging. Perhaps she only wanted to be alone, to recover herself. No surprise, if so.</p><p>I waited until she was safely out of sight, then made my own way slowly down the slope. I didn\u2019t stop at the Christie cabin, thirsty as I was, and had quite lost interest in errant bees.</p><p>I MET JAMIE AT a stiled fence, some little distance from home, in conversation with Hiram Crombie. I nodded in greeting, and waited in some impatience for Crombie to finish his business, so I could tell Jamie what I had just witnessed.</p><p>Luckily, Hiram showed no inclination to linger; I made him nervous.</p><p>I told Jamie at once what I had seen, and was annoyed to find that he didn\u2019t share my concern. If Tom Christie thought it necessary to whip his daughter, that was his affair.</p><p>\u201cBut he might be . . . it might be\u2014perhaps it doesn\u2019t stop with a switching. Perhaps he does . . . other things to her.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cTom? D\u2019ye have any reason to think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted reluctantly. The Christie m\u00e9nage gave me an uncomfortable feeling, but that was likely only because I didn\u2019t get on with Tom. I wasn\u2019t so foolish as to think that a tendency toward Bible-thumping meant a person wouldn\u2019t engage in wickedness\u2014but in all fairness, it didn\u2019t mean he did, either. \u201cBut surely he shouldn\u2019t be whipping her like that\u2014at her age?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me in mild exasperation.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna understand a thing, do ye?\u201d he said, echoing my thought exactly.</p><p>\u201cI was about to say just that, to you,\u201d I said, giving him look for look. He didn\u2019t look away, but held my gaze, his own slowly taking on a wry amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo it will be different?\u201d he said. \u201cIn your world?\u201d There was just enough edge in his voice to remind me forcibly that we were not in my world\u2014nor ever would be. Sudden gooseflesh ran up my arm, lifting the fine blond hairs.</p><p>\u201cA man wouldna beat a woman, then, in your time? Not even for good cause?\u201d</p><p>And what was I to say to that? I couldn\u2019t lie, even if I wanted to; he knew my face much too well.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same. There\u2014then, I mean\u2014a man who beat his wife would be a criminal. But,\u201d I added in fairness, \u201ca man who beat his wife then would most often be using his fists.\u201d</p><p>A look of astonished disgust crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of man would do that?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cA bad one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should think, Sassenach. And ye dinna think there\u2019s a difference?\u201d he asked. \u201cYe\u2019d see it the same, if I were to smash your face, rather than only take a tawse to your bum?\u201d</p><p>Blood flared abruptly in my cheeks. He once had taken a strap to me, and I hadn\u2019t forgotten it. I had wanted to kill him at the time\u2014and didn\u2019t feel kindly toward him at the memory. At the same time, I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to equate his actions with those of a modern-day wife-beater.</p><p>He glanced at me, raised one eyebrow, then understood what I was recalling. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d I said very cross. I had succeeded in putting that extremely humiliating episode out of mind, and didn\u2019t at all like having it recalled.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was plainly enjoying the recollection. He eyed me in a manner I found grossly insufferable, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cGod, ye screamed like a ban-sidhe.\u201d</p><p>I began to feel a distinct throbbing of blood in my temples.</p><p>\u201cI bloody well had cause to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, and the grin widened. \u201cYe did. Your own fault, mind,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cMy f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou apologized!\u201d I said completely outraged. \u201cYou know you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. And it was still your fault to begin with,\u201d he said, with complete lack of logic. \u201cYe wouldna have got nearly such a wicked tanning, if ye\u2019d only minded me in the first place, when I told ye to kneel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinded you! You think I would have just meekly given in and let you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen ye do anything meek, Sassenach.\u201d He took my arm to help me over the stile, but I jerked free, puffing with indignation.</p><p>\u201cYou beastly Scot!\u201d I dropped the hive on the ground at his feet, picked up my skirts, and scrambled over the stile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I havena done it again,\u201d he protested, behind me. \u201cI promised, aye?\u201d</p><p>I whirled round on the other side and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cOnly because I threatened to cut your heart out if you ever tried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even so. I could have\u2014and ye ken that well, Sassenach. Aye?\u201d He\u2019d quit grinning, but there was a distinct glint in his eye.</p><p>I took several deep breaths, trying simultaneously to control my annoyance and think of some crushing rejoinder. I failed in both attempts, and with a briefly dignified \u201cHmph!\u201d turned on my heel.</p><p>I heard the rustle of his kilt as he picked up the hive, hopped over the stile, and came after me, catching up within a stride or two. I didn\u2019t look at him; my cheeks were still flaming.</p><p>The infuriating fact was that I did know that. I remembered all too well. He had used his sword belt to such effect that I hadn\u2019t been able to sit comfortably for several days\u2014and if he should ever decide to do it again, there was absolutely nothing to stop him.</p><p>I was, for the most part, able to ignore the fact that I was legally his property. That didn\u2019t alter the fact that it was a fact\u2014and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brianna?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWould you feel the same way about it, if young Roger suddenly decided to take his belt or a switch to your daughter?\u201d</p><p>He appeared to find something amusing in the notion.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019d have the devil of a fight on his hands if he tried,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a braw wee lassie, no? And she has your notions of what constitutes wifely obedience, I\u2019m afraid. But then,\u201d he added, swinging the hive\u2019s rope across his shoulder, \u201cye never ken what goes on in a marriage, do ye? Perhaps she\u2019d be pleased if he tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased?!\u201d I gawked at him in astonishment. \u201cHow can you think that any woman would ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? What about my sister?\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead in the middle of the path, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your sister? Surely you aren\u2019t telling me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d The glint was back, but I didn\u2019t think he was joking.</p><p>\u201cIan beat her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do wish ye\u2019d stop calling it that,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cIt sounds as though Ian took his fists to her, or blackened her eyes. I gave ye a decent skelping, but I didna bloody ye, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d His eyes flicked briefly toward my face; everything had healed, at least outwardly; the only trace left was a tiny scar through one eyebrow\u2014invisible, unless one parted the hairs there and looked closely. \u201cNeither would Ian.\u201d</p><p>I was completely flabbergasted to hear this. I had lived in close proximity with Ian and Jenny Murray for months at a time, and had never seen the slightest indication that he possessed a violent nature. For that matter, it was impossible to imagine anyone trying such a thing on Jenny Murray, who had\u2014if such a thing was possible\u2014an even stronger personality than her brother.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did he do? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019d only take his belt to her now and then,\u201d he said, \u201cand only if she made him.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIf she made him?\u201d I asked calmly, under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye ken Ian,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cHe\u2019s no the one to be doing that sort of thing unless Jenny deviled him into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw anything of that sort going on,\u201d I said, giving him a hard look.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019d scarcely do it in front of ye, would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she would, in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not precisely, no,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I wasna often in the house, after Culloden. Now and then, though, I\u2019d come down for a visit, and I\u2019d see that she was . . . brewing for something.\u201d He rubbed his nose and squinted against the sun, searching for words. \u201cShe\u2019d devil him,\u201d he said at last, shrugging. \u201cPick at him over nothing, make wee sarcastic remarks. She\u2019d\u2014\u201d His face cleared a bit, as he came up with a suitable description. \u201cShe\u2019d act like a spoilt wee lassie in need of the tawse.\u201d</p><p>I found this description completely incredible. Jenny Murray had a sharp tongue, and few inhibitions about using it on anyone, her husband included. Ian, the soul of good nature, merely laughed at her. But I simply couldn\u2019t countenance the notion of her behaving in the manner described.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. I\u2019d seen that a time or two, as I say. And Ian would give her an eye, but held his peace. But then the once, I was out hunting, near sunset, and took a small deer on the hill just behind the broch\u2014ye ken the place?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still feeling stunned.</p><p>\u201cIt was close enough to carry the carcass to the house without help, so I brought it down to the smoke shed and hung it. There was no one about\u2014I found out later the children had all gone to the market in Broch Mhorda, and the servants with them. So I thought the house was empty altogether, and stepped into the kitchen to find a bite and a cup of buttermilk before I left.\u201d</p><p>Thinking the house empty, he had been startled by noises in the bedchamber overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of noises?\u201d I asked, fascinated.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . shrieks,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cAnd giggling. A bit of shoving and banging, with a stool or some such falling over. If it weren\u2019t for the yaffling, I should have thought there were thieves in the house. But I kent it was Jenny\u2019s voice, and Ian\u2019s, and\u2014\u201d He broke off, his ears going pink at the memory.</p><p>\u201cSo then . . . there was a bit more\u2014raised voices, like\u2014and then the crack of a belt on a bum, and the sort of skelloch ye could hear across six fields.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was taken back a bit, and couldna think what to do at once.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, understanding that, at least.</p><p>\u201cI expect it would be a bit of an awkward situation, yes. It . . . er . . . went on, though?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His ears were a deep red by now, and his face flushed, though that might only be from heat.</p><p>\u201cAye, it did.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cMind, Sassenach, if I\u2019d thought he meant harm to her, I should have been up the stairs in an instant. But . . .\u201d He brushed away an inquisitive bee, shaking his head. \u201cThere was\u2014it felt\u2014I canna even think how to say it. It wasna really that Jenny kept laughing, because she didna\u2014but that I felt she wanted to. And Ian . . . well, Ian was laughing. Not out loud, I dinna mean; it was just . . . in his voice.\u201d</p><p>He blew out his breath, and swiped his knuckles along his jaw, wiping sweat.</p><p>\u201cI stayed quite frozen there, wi\u2019 a bit of pie in my hand, listening. I came to myself only when the flies started lighting in my open mouth, and by that time, they\u2019d . . . ah . . . they were . . . mmphm.\u201d He hunched his shoulders, as though his shirt were too tight.</p><p>\u201cMaking it up, were they?\u201d I asked very dryly.</p><p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d he replied, rather primly. \u201cI left. Walked all the way to Foyne, and stayed the night with Grannie MacNab.\u201d Foyne was a tiny hamlet, some fifteen miles from Lallybroch.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had to,\u201d he said logically. \u201cI couldna ignore it, after all. It was either walk about and think of things, or else give in and abuse myself, and I couldna verra well do that\u2014it was my own sister, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you can\u2019t think and engage in sexual activity at the same time?\u201d I asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said\u2014thus confirming a long-held private opinion of mine\u2014and gave me a look as though I were crazy. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, yes.\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow, plainly unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not saying I do, always,\u201d I admitted, \u201cbut it\u2019s possible. Women are used to doing more than one thing at once\u2014they have to, because of the children. Anyway, go back to Jenny and Ian. Why on earth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did walk about and think of it,\u201d Jamie admitted. \u201cI couldna seem to stop thinking of it, to be honest. Grannie MacNab could see I\u2019d something on my mind, and pestered me over the supper until . . . ah . . . well, until I told her about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. What did she say?\u201d I asked, fascinated. I\u2019d known Grannie MacNab, a sprightly old person with a highly forthright manner\u2014and a lot of experience with human weakness.</p><p>\u201cShe cackled like thorns under a pot,\u201d he said, one side of his mouth turning up. \u201cI thought she\u2019d fall into the fire wi\u2019 merriment.\u201d</p><p>Recovered to some extent, though, the old lady had wiped her eyes and explained matters to him, kindly, as though addressing a simpleton.</p><p>\u201cShe said it was because of Ian\u2019s leg,\u201d Jamie said, glancing at me to see whether this made sense to me. \u201cShe said that such a thing would make no difference to Jenny, but it would to him. She said,\u201d he added, his color heightening, \u201cthat men havena got any idea what women think about bed, but they always think they have, so it causes trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I liked Grannie MacNab,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so. She said it was likely that Jenny was only makin\u2019 it clear to Ian\u2014and maybe to herself, as well\u2014that she still thought he was a man, leg or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Sassenach,\u201d he said, very dryly indeed, \u201cwhen ye\u2019re a man, a good bit of what ye have to do is to draw up lines and fight other folk who come over them. Your enemies, your tenants, your children\u2014your wife. Ye canna always just strike them or take a strap to them, but when ye can, at least it\u2019s clear to everyone who\u2019s in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s perfectly\u2014\u201d I began, and then broke off, frowning as I considered this.</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye\u2019re a man, you\u2019re in charge. It\u2019s you that keeps order, whether ye like it or not. It\u2019s true,\u201d he said, then touched my elbow as he nodded toward an opening in the wood. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty. Shall we stop a bit?\u201d</p><p>I followed him up a narrow path through the wood to what we called the Green Spring\u2014a bubbling flow of water over pale serpentine stone, set in a cool, shady bowl of surrounding moss. We knelt, splashed our faces, and drank, sighing with grateful relief. Jamie tipped a handful of water down inside his shirt, closing his eyes in bliss. I laughed at him, but unpinned my sweat-soaked kerchief and doused it in the spring, using it to wipe my neck and arms.</p><p>The walk to the spring had caused a break in the conversation, and I wasn\u2019t sure quite how\u2014or whether\u2014to resume it. Instead, I merely sat quietly in the shade, arms about my knees, idly wriggling my toes in the moss.</p><p>Jamie, too, seemed to feel no need of speech for the moment. He leaned comfortably back against a rock, the wet fabric of his shirt plastered to his chest, and we sat still, listening to the wood.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but that didn\u2019t mean I had stopped thinking about the conversation. In an odd way, I thought I understood what Grannie MacNab had meant\u2014though I wasn\u2019t quite sure I agreed with it.</p><p>I was thinking more about what Jamie had said, though, regarding a man\u2019s responsibility. Was it true? Perhaps it was, though I had never thought of it in that light before. It was true that he was a bulwark\u2014not only for me, and for the family, but for the tenants, as well. Was that really how he did it, though? \u201cDraw up lines, and fight other folk who come over them\u201d? I rather thought it was.</p><p>There were lines between him and me, surely; I could have drawn them on the moss. Which was not to say we did not \u201ccome across\u201d each other\u2019s lines\u2014we did, frequently, and with varying results. I had my own defenses\u2014and means of enforcement. But he had only beaten me once for crossing his lines, and that was early on. So, had he seen that as a necessary fight? I supposed he had; that was what he was telling me.</p><p>But he had been following his own train of thought, which was running on a different track.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra odd,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cLaoghaire drove me mad wi\u2019 great regularity, but it never once occurred to me to thrash her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how very thoughtless of you,\u201d I said, drawing myself up. I disliked hearing him refer to Laoghaire, no matter what the context.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was,\u201d he replied seriously, taking no notice of my sarcasm. \u201cI think it was that I didna care enough for her to think of it, let alone do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t care enough to beat her? Wasn\u2019t she the lucky one, then?\u201d</p><p>He caught the tone of pique in my voice; his eyes sharpened and fixed on my face.</p><p>\u201cNot to hurt her,\u201d he said. Some new thought came to him; I saw it cross his face.</p><p>He smiled a little, got up, and came toward me. He reached down and pulled me to my feet, then took hold of my wrist, which he lifted gently over my head and pinned against the trunk of the pine I had been sitting under, so that I was obliged to lean back flat against it.</p><p>\u201cNot to hurt her,\u201d he said again, speaking softly. \u201cTo own her. I didna want to possess her. You, mo nighean donn\u2014you, I would own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwn me?\u201d I said. \u201cAnd what, exactly, do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I say.\u201d There was still a gleam of humor in his eyes, but his voice was serious. \u201cYe\u2019re mine, Sassenach. And I would do anything I thought I must to make that clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed. Including beating me on a regular basis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldna do that.\u201d The corner of his mouth lifted slightly, and the pressure of his grip on my trapped wrist increased. His eyes were deep blue, an inch from mine. \u201cI dinna need to\u2014because I could, Sassenach\u2014and ye ken that well.\u201d</p><p>I pulled against his grip, by sheer reflex. I remembered vividly that night in Doonesbury: the feeling of fighting him with all my strength\u2014to no avail whatever. The horrifying feeling of being pinned to the bed, defenseless and exposed, realizing that he could do anything whatever that he liked to me\u2014and would.</p><p>I squirmed violently, trying to escape the grip of memory, as much as his grasp on my flesh. I didn\u2019t succeed, but did turn my wrist so as to be able to sink my nails into his hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t flinch or look away. His other hand touched me lightly\u2014no more than a brush of my earlobe, but that was quite enough. He could touch me anywhere\u2014in any way.</p><p>Evidently, women are capable of experiencing rational thought and sexual arousal simultaneously, because I appeared to be doing precisely that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My brain was engaged in indignant rebuttal of all kinds of things, including at least half of everything he\u2019d said in the course of the last few minutes.</p><p>At the same time, the other end of my spinal cord was not merely shamefully aroused at the thought of physical possession; it was bloody deliriously weak-kneed with desire at the notion, and was causing my h*ps to sway outward, brushing his.</p><p>He was still ignoring the dig of my nails. His other hand came up and took my free hand before I could do anything violent with it; he folded his fingers around mine and held them captive, down at my side.</p><p>\u201cIf ye asked me, Sassenach, to free ye\u2014\u201d he whispered, \u201cd\u2019ye think I\u2019d do so?\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath; deep enough that my br**sts brushed his chest, he stood so close, and realization welled up in me. I stood still, breathing, watching his eyes, and felt my agitation fade slowly away, mutating into a sense of conviction, heavy and warm in the pit of my belly.</p><p>I had thought my body swayed in answer to his\u2014and it did. But his moved unconsciously with mine; the rhythm of the pulse I saw in his throat was the pounding of the heartbeat that echoed in my wrist, and the sway of his body followed mine, barely touching, moving scarcely more than the leaves above, sighing on the breeze.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019d tell you. And you\u2019d do it. You\u2019d do as I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I?\u201d His grip on my wrist was still firm, and his face so close to mine that I felt his smile, rather than saw it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I had stopped pulling at my trapped wrist; instead, I pulled my other hand from his\u2014he made no move to stop me\u2014and brushed a thumb from the lobe of his ear down the side of his neck. He took a short, sharp breath, and a tiny shudder ran through him, stippling his skin with goosebumps in the wake of my touch.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you would,\u201d I said again very softly. \u201cBecause I own you, too . . . man. Don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>His hand released its grip abruptly and slid upward, long fingers intertwining with mine, his palm large and warm and hard against my own.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, just as softly. \u201cYe do.\u201d He lowered his head the last half-inch and his lips brushed mine, whispering, so that I felt the words as much as heard them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I ken that verra well indeed, mo nighean donn.\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>WOODEARS</p> <p>DESPITE HIS DISMISSAL of her worries, Jamie had promised his wife to look into the matter, and found opportunity to speak with Malva Christie a few days later.</p><p>Coming back from Kenny Lindsay\u2019s place, he met a snake curled up in the dust of the path before him. It was a largish creature, but gaily striped\u2014not one of the venomous vipers. Still, he couldn\u2019t help it; snakes gave him the grue, and he did not wish to pick it up with his hands, nor yet to step over it. It might not be disposed to lunge up his kilt\u2014but then again, it might. For its part, the snake remained stubbornly curled among the leaves, not budging in response to his \u201cShoo!\u201d or the stamping of his foot.</p><p>He took a step to the side, found an alder, and cut a good stick from it, with which he firmly escorted the wee beastie off the path and into the wood. Affronted, the snake writhed off at a good rate of speed into a hobble-bush, and next thing, a loud shriek came from the other side of the bush.</p><p>He darted round it to find Malva Christie, making an urgent, though unsuccessful, effort to squash the agitated snake with a large basket.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, lass, let him go.\u201d He seized her arm, causing a number of mushrooms to cascade out of her basket, and the snake decamped indignantly in search of quieter surroundings.</p><p>He crouched and scooped up the mushrooms for her, while she gasped and fanned herself with the end of her apron.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank ye, sir,\u201d she said, bosom heaving. \u201cI\u2019m that terrified o\u2019 snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, well, that\u2019s no but a wee king snake,\u201d he said, affecting nonchalance. \u201cGreat ratters\u2014or so I\u2019m told.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe so, but they\u2019ve a wicked bite.\u201d She shuddered briefly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve no been bitten, have ye?\u201d He stood up and dumped a final handful of fungus into her basket, and she curtsied in thanks.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d She straightened her cap \u201cBut Mr. Crombie was. Gully Dornan brought one of those things in a box, to Sunday meeting last, just for mischief, for he kent the text was For they shall take up poisonous serpents and suffer no harm. I think he meant to let it out in the midst of the prayin\u2019.\u201d She grinned at the telling, clearly reliving the event.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. Crombie saw him with the box, and took it from him, not knowing what was in it. Well, so\u2014Gully was shaking of the box, to keep the snake awake, and when Mr. Crombie opened it, the snake came out like a jack-i\u2019-the-box and bit Mr. Crombie on the lip.\u201d</p><p>Jamie couldn\u2019t help smiling in turn.</p><p>\u201cDid it, then? I dinna recall hearing about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Crombie was that furious,\u201d she said, trying for tact. \u201cI imagine no one wanted to spread the story, sir, for fear he\u2019d maybe pop with rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I see,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why he wouldna come to have my wife see to the wound, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wouldna do that, sir,\u201d she assured him, shaking her head. \u201cNot if he was to have cut off his nose by mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She picked up the basket, glancing shyly up at him.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . no. Some say may be as your wife\u2019s a witch, did ye ken that?\u201d</p><p>He felt an unpleasant tightness in his wame, though he was not surprised to hear it.</p><p>\u201cShe is a Sassenach,\u201d he answered, calm. \u201cFolk will always say such things of a stranger, especially a woman.\u201d He glanced sideways at her, but her eyes were modestly cast down to the contents of her basket. \u201cThink so yourself, do ye?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at that, gray eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir! Never!\u201d</p><p>She spoke with such earnestness that he smiled, despite the seriousness of his errand.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose ye\u2019d have noticed, so much time as ye spend in her surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I should wish nothing but to be just like her, sir!\u201d she assured him, clutching the handle of her basket in worshipful enthusiasm. \u201cShe is so kind and lovely, and she kens so much! I want to know all she can teach me, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. She\u2019s said often how good it is to have such a pupil as yourself, lass. Ye\u2019re a great help to her.\u201d He cleared his throat, wondering how best to work round from these cordialities to a rude inquiry as to whether her father was interfering with her. \u201cAh . . . your Da doesna mind that ye spend so much time with my wife?\u201d</p><p>A cloud fell upon her countenance at that, and her long black lashes swept down, hiding the dove-gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. He . . . he doesna say I mustna go.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a noncommittal sound in his throat, and gestured her ahead of him back to the path, where he strode along for a bit without further question, allowing her to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye think your father will do,\u201d he inquired, swishing his stick casually through a patch of toadflax, \u201conce ye\u2019ve wed and left his house? Is there a woman he might consider? He\u2019d need someone to do for him, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened at that, to his interest, and a faint flush rose in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean to be wed anytime soon, sir. We\u2019ll manage well enough.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was short enough to cause him to probe a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo? Surely ye\u2019ve suitors, lass\u2014the lads swoon after ye in droves; I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p><p>The flush on her skin bloomed brighter.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sir, ye\u2019ll say no such thing to my faither!\u201d</p><p>That rang a small alarm bell in him\u2014but then, she might mean only that Tom Christie was a strict parent, vigilant of his daughter\u2019s virtue. And he would have been astonished to the marrow to learn that Christie was soft, indulgent, or in any way delinquent in such responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cI shall not,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI was only teasin\u2019, lass. Is your father sae fierce, then?\u201d</p><p>She did look at him then, very direct.</p><p>\u201cThought ye kent him, sir.\u201d</p><p>He burst out laughing at that, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, she joined him, with a small titter like the sound of the wee birds in the trees above.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, recovering. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, Tom\u2014if a bit dour.\u201d</p><p>He looked to see the effect of this. Her face was still flushed, but there was a tiny residual smile on her lips. That was good.</p><p>\u201cWell, so,\u201d he resumed casually, \u201chave ye enough of the woodears there?\u201d He nodded at her basket. \u201cI saw a good many yesterday, up near the Green Spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did ye?\u201d She glanced up, interested. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed that way,\u201d he said \u201cCome if ye like, I\u2019ll show ye.\u201d</p><p>They made their way along the Ridge, talking of inconsequent things. He led her now and then back to the subject of her father, and noted that she seemed to have no reservations concerning him\u2014only a prudent regard for his foibles and temper.</p><p>\u201cYour brother, then,\u201d he said thoughtfully, at one point. \u201cIs he content, d\u2019ye think? Or will he be wanting to leave, maybe go down to the coast? I ken he\u2019s no really a farmer at heart, is he?\u201d</p><p>She snorted a bit, but shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, that he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do, then? I mean, he grew up on a plantation, did he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir.\u201d She looked up at him, surprised. \u201cHe grew up in Edinburgh. We both did.\u201d</p><p>He was taken back a bit at that. It was true, both she and Allan had an educated accent, but he had thought it only that Christie was a schoolmaster, and strict of such things.</p><p>\u201cHow is that, lass? Tom said he\u2019d married here, in the Colonies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so he did, sir,\u201d she assured him hastily. \u201cBut his wife was not a bond servant; she went back to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said mildly, seeing her face grow much pinker and her lips press tight. Tom had said his wife had died\u2014well, and he supposed she had, but in Scotland, after she\u2019d left him. Proud as Christie was, he could hardly wonder that the man hadn\u2019t confessed to his wife\u2019s desertion. But\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs it true, sir, that your grandsire was Lord Lovat? Him they called the Old Fox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI come from a long line of traitors, thieves, and bastards, ken?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that, and very prettily urged him to tell her more of his sordid family history\u2014quite obviously, as a means of avoiding his asking more questions regarding hers.</p><p>The \u201cbut\u201d lingered in his mind, though, even as they talked, with increasing desultoriness as they climbed through the dark, scented forest.</p><p>But. Tom Christie had been arrested two or three days after the Battle of Culloden, and imprisoned for the next ten years, before being transported to America. He did not know Malva\u2019s exact age, but he thought she must be eighteen or so\u2014though she often seemed older, her manner was so poised.</p><p>She must have been conceived, then, quite soon after Christie\u2019s arrival in the Colonies. No great wonder, if the man had seized the first chance he had to marry, after living without a woman for so long. And then the wife had thought better of her bargain, and gone. Christie had told Roger Mac his wife had died of influenza\u2014well, a man had his pride, and God knew Tom Christie had more than most.</p><p>But Allan Christie . . . where had he come from? The young man was somewhere in his twenties; it was possible that he had been conceived before Culloden. But if so\u2014who was his mother?</p><p>\u201cYou and your brother,\u201d he said abruptly, at the next break in conversation. \u201cDid ye have the same mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, looking startled.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and let the subject drop. Well, now. So Christie had been wed before Culloden. And then the woman, whoever she was, had come to find him in the Colonies. That argued a high degree of determination and devotion, and made him regard Christie with a good deal more interest. But that devotion had not been proof against the hardships of the Colonies\u2014or else she found Tom so changed by time and circumstance that the devotion had been drowned in disappointment, and she had left again.</p><p>He could see that, easily\u2014and felt an unexpected bond of sympathy with Tom Christie. He recalled his own feelings, all too well, when Claire came back to find him. The disbelieving joy of her presence\u2014and the bone-deep fear that she would not recognize the man she had known, in the man who stood before her.</p><p>Worse, if she had discovered something that made her flee\u2014and well as he knew Claire, he still was not sure that she would have stayed, if he\u2019d told her at once about his marriage to Laoghaire. For that matter, if Laoghaire hadn\u2019t shot him and nearly killed him, Claire might well have run away, and been lost for good. The thought of it was a black pit, gaping at his feet.</p><p>Of course, had she gone, he would have died, he reflected. And never come to this place and got his land, nor seen his daughter, nor held his grandson in his arms. Come to think, perhaps being nearly killed wasn\u2019t always a misfortune\u2014so long as you didn\u2019t actually die of it.</p><p>\u201cDoes your arm trouble ye, sir?\u201d He was jerked back from his thoughts to realize that he was standing like a fool, one hand clutching the spot on his upper arm where Laoghaire\u2019s pistol ball had gone through and Malva squinting at him in concern.</p><p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d he said hastily, dropping his hand. \u201cA midgie bite. The bittie things are out early. Tell me\u201d\u2014he groped for some neutral topic of conversation\u2014\u201cd\u2019ye like it here in the mountains?\u201d</p><p>Inane as the question was, she appeared to consider it seriously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lonely, sometimes,\u201d she said, and glanced into the forest, where falling shafts of sunlight splintered on leaves and needles, shrubs and rocks, filling the air with a shattered green light. \u201cBut it is . . .\u201d she groped for a word. \u201cPretty,\u201d she said, with a small smile at him, acknowledging the inadequacy of the word.</p><p>They had reached the small clearing where the water bubbled out over a ledge of what his daughter said was serpentine\u2014the rock whose soft green gave the spring its name; that, and the thick layer of vivid moss that grew around it.</p><p>He gestured to her to kneel and drink first. She did, cupping her hands to her face and closing her eyes in bliss at the taste of the cold, sweet water. She gulped, cupped her hands and drank again, almost greedily. She was very pretty herself, he thought in amusement, and the word was much more appropriate to the wee lassie, with that delicate chin and the lobes of her tender pink ears peeping from her cap, than to the spirit of the mountains. Her mother must have been lovely, he thought\u2014and it was fortunate for the lass that she had not taken much of her father\u2019s grim looks, save those gray eyes.</p><p>She sat back on her heels, breathing deep, and scooted to the side, nodding at him to kneel and take his turn. The day wasn\u2019t hot, but it was a steep climb to the spring, and the cold water went down gratefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the Highlands,\u201d Malva said, dabbing the end of her kerchief over her wet face. \u201cSome say this place is like it, though. D\u2019ye think so yourself, sir?\u201d</p><p>He shook the water from his fingers and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSomething like. Some parts. The Great Glen, and the forest\u2014aye, that\u2019s verra like this.\u201d He pointed his chin up at the trees surrounding them, murmurous and resin-scented. \u201cBut there\u2019s nay bracken here. And nay peat, of course. And nay heather; that\u2019s the biggest difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe hear the stories\u2014of men hiding in the heather. Did ye ever do so yourself, sir?\u201d She dimpled slightly, and he didn\u2019t know whether she meant to tease, or was only making conversation.</p><p>\u201cNow and then,\u201d he said, and smiled at her as he rose, brushing pine needles from his kilt. \u201cStalking the deer, aye? Here, I\u2019ll show ye the woodears.\u201d</p><p>The fungus grew in thick shelves at the foot of an oak, no more than ten feet from the spring. Some of the things had opened their gills already, begun to darken and curl; the ground nearby was scattered with the spores, a dark brown powder that lay upon the glossy crackle of last year\u2019s dry leaves. The fresher fungi were still bright, though, deep orange and meaty.</p><p>He left her there with a cordial word, and went back down the narrow trail, wondering about the woman who had loved and left Tom Christie.</p><p>49</p><p>THE VENOM OF THE</p><p>NORTH WIND</p><p>July 1774</p><p>BRIANNA DROVE THE SHARP end of the spade into the muddy bank and pulled out a chunk of clay the color of chocolate fudge. She could have done without the reminder of food, she thought, flinging it aside into the current with a grunt. She hitched up her soggy shift and wiped a forearm across her brow. She hadn\u2019t eaten since mid-morning, and it was nearly teatime. Not that she meant to stop until supper. Roger was up the mountain, helping Amy McCallum rebuild her chimney stack, and the little boys had gone up to the Big House to be fed bread and butter and honey and generally spoiled by Mrs. Bug. She\u2019d wait to eat; there was too much to do here.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye need help, lass?\u201d</p><p>She squinted, shading her eyes against the sun. Her father was standing on the bank above, viewing her efforts with what looked like amusement.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I need help?\u201d she asked irritably, swiping the back of a mud-streaked hand across her jaw.</p><p>\u201cYe do, aye.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been fishing; barefoot and wet to mid-thigh. He laid his rod against a tree and swung the creel from his shoulder, woven reeds creaking with the weight of the catch. Then he grasped a sapling for balance, and started to edge down the slippery bank, bare toes squelching in the mud.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014take your shirt off!\u201d She realized her mistake an instant too late. A startled look flitted across his face, only for a moment, and then was gone.</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . the mud . . .\u201d she said, knowing it was too late. \u201cThe washing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, to be sure.\u201d Without hesitation, he pulled the shirt over his head and turned his back to her, hunting for a convenient branch from which to hang it.</p><p>His scars were not really shocking. She\u2019d glimpsed them before, imagined them many times, and the reality was much less vivid. The scars were old, a faint silvered net, moving easily over the shadows of his ribs as he reached upward. He moved naturally. Only the tension in his shoulders suggested otherwise.</p><p>Her hand closed involuntarily, feeling for an absent pencil, feeling the stroke of the line that would capture that tiny sense of unease, the jarring note that would draw the observer closer, closer still, wondering what it was about this scene of pastoral grace. . . .</p><p>Thou shalt not uncover thy father\u2019s nak*dness, she thought, and spread her hand flat, pressing it hard against her thigh. But he had turned back and was coming down the bank, eyes on the tangled rushes and protruding stones underfoot.</p><p>He slid the last two feet and arrived beside her with a splash, arms flailing to keep his balance. She laughed, as he\u2019d intended, and he smiled. She\u2019d thought for an instant to speak of it, make some apology\u2014but he would not meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, then, move it, or go round?\u201d His attention focused on the boulder embedded in the bank, he leaned his weight against it and shoved experimentally.</p><p>\u201cCan we move it, do you think?\u201d She waded up beside him, retucking the hem of her shift, which she had pulled between her legs and fastened with a belt. \u201cGoing round would mean digging another ten feet of ditch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much?\u201d He glanced at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want to cut a notch here, to cut through to that bend\u2014then I can put a small water-wheel here and get a good fall.\u201d She leaned past him, pointing downstream. \u201cThe next-best place would be down there\u2014see where the banks rise?\u2014but this is better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, all right. Wait a bit, then.\u201d He made his way back to the bank, scrambled up, and disappeared into the wood, from whence he returned with several stout lengths of fresh oak sapling, still sporting the remnants of their glossy leaves.</p><p>\u201cWe dinna need to get it out of the creekbed, aye?\u201d he asked. \u201cOnly move it a few feet, so ye can cut through the bank beyond it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Rivulets of sweat, trapped by her thick eyebrows, ran tickling down the sides of her face. She\u2019d been digging for the best part of an hour; her arms ached from heaving shovelsful of heavy mud, and her hands were blistered. With a sense of profound gratitude, she surrendered the spade and stepped back in the creek, stooping to splash cold water on her scratched arms and flushed face.</p><p>\u201cHeavy work,\u201d her father observed, grunting a little as he briskly finished undermining the boulder. \u201cCould ye not have asked Roger Mac to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy,\u201d she said, perceiving the shortness of her tone, but not inclined to disguise it.</p><p>Her father darted a sharp glance at her, but said no more, merely busying himself with the proper placement of his oak staves. Attracted like iron filings to the magnetism of their grandfather\u2019s presence, Jemmy and Germain appeared like magic, loudly wanting to help.</p><p>She\u2019d asked them to help, and they\u2019d helped\u2014for a few minutes, before being drawn away by the glimpse of a porcupine high up in the trees. With Jamie in charge, of course, they leaped to the task, madly scooping dirt from the bank with flat bits of wood, giggling, pushing, getting in the way, and stuffing handsful of mud down the back of each other\u2019s breeches.</p><p>Jamie being Jamie, he ignored the nuisance, merely directing their efforts and finally ordering them out of the creek, so as not to be crushed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, lass,\u201d he said, turning to her. \u201cTake a grip there.\u201d The boulder had been loosened from the confining clay, and now protruded from the bank, oak staves thrust into the mud beneath, sticking up on either side, and another behind.</p><p>She seized the one he indicated, while he took the other two.</p><p>\u201cOn the count of three . . . one . . . two . . . heave!\u201d</p><p>Jem and Germain, perched above, chimed in, chanting \u201cOne . . . two . . . heave!\u201d like a small Greek chorus. There was a splinter in her thumb and the wood rasped against the waterlogged creases of her skin, but she felt suddenly like laughing.</p><p>\u201cOne . . . two . . . hea\u2014\u201d With a sudden shift, a swirl of mud, and a cascade of loose dirt from the bank above, the boulder gave way, falling into the stream with a splash that soaked them both to the chest and made both little boys shriek with joy.</p><p>Jamie was grinning ear-to-ear and so was she, wet shift and muddy children notwithstanding. The boulder now lay near the opposite bank of the stream, and\u2014just as she had calculated\u2014the diverted current was already eating into the newly created hollow in the near bank, a strong eddy eating away the fine-grained clay in streams and spirals.</p><p>\u201cSee that?\u201d She nodded at it, dabbing her mud-spattered face on the shoulder of her shift. \u201cI don\u2019t know how far it will erode, but if I let it go for a day or two, there won\u2019t be much digging left to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe kent that would happen?\u201d Her father glanced at her, face alight, and laughed. \u201cWhy, ye clever, bonnie wee thing!\u201d</p><p>The glow of recognized achievement did quite a bit to dampen her resentment of Roger\u2019s absence. The presence of a bottle of cider in Jamie\u2019s creel, keeping cold amongst the dead trout, did a lot more. They sat companionably on the bank, passing the bottle back and forth, admiring the industry of the new eddy pool at work.</p><p>\u201cThis looks like good clay,\u201d she observed, leaning forward to scoop a little of the wet stuff out of the crumbling bank. She squeezed it in her hand, letting grayish water run down her arm, and opened her hand to show him how it kept its shape, showing clearly the prints of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood for your kiln?\u201d he asked, peering dutifully at it.</p><p>\u201cWorth a try.\u201d She had made several less-than-successful experiments with the kiln so far, producing a succession of malformed plates and bowls, most of which had either exploded in the kiln or shattered immediately upon removal. One or two survivals, deformed and scorched round the edges, had been pressed into dubious service, but it was precious little reward for the effort of stoking the kiln and minding it for days.</p><p>What she needed was advice from someone who knew about kilns and making earthenware. But with the strained relations now existent between the Ridge and Salem, she couldn\u2019t seek it. It had been awkward enough, her speaking directly to Brother Mordecai about his ceramic processes\u2014a Popish woman, and speaking to a man she wasn\u2019t married to, the scandal!</p><p>\u201cDamn wee Manfred,\u201d her father agreed, hearing her complaint. He\u2019d heard it before, but didn\u2019t mention it. He hesitated. \u201cWould it maybe help was I to go and ask? A few o\u2019 the Brethren will still speak to me, and it might be that they\u2019d let me talk wi\u2019 Mordecai. If ye were to tell me what it is ye need to know . . . ? Ye could maybe write it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Da, I love you!\u201d Grateful, she leaned to kiss him, and he laughed, clearly gratified to be doing her a service.</p><p>Elated, she took another drink of cider, and rosy visions of hardened clay pipes began to dance in her brain. She had a wooden cistern already built, with a lot of complaint and obstruction from Ronnie Sinclair. She needed help to heave that into place. Then, if she could get only twenty feet of reliable pipe . . .</p><p>\u201cMama, come look!\u201d Jem\u2019s impatient voice cut through the fog of calculation. With a mental sigh, she made a hasty note of where she had been, and pushed the process carefully into a corner of her mind, where it would perhaps helpfully ferment.</p><p>She handed the bottle back to her father, and made her way down the bank to where the boys squatted, expecting to be shown frog spawn, a drowned skunk, or some other wonder of nature appealing to small boys.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cLook, look!\u201d Jemmy spotted her and popped upright, pointing to the rock at his feet.</p><p>They were standing on the Flat Rock, a prominent feature of the creek. As the name suggested, it was a flat shelf of granite, large enough for three men to occupy at once, undercut by the water so that it jutted out over the boiling stream. It was a favorite spot for fishing.</p><p>Someone had built a small fire; there was a blackened smudge on the rock, with what looked like the remnants of charred sticks in the center. It was much too small for a cooking fire, but still, she would have thought nothing of it. Her father was frowning at the fire site, though, in a way that made her walk out onto the rock and stand beside him, looking.</p><p>The objects in the ashes weren\u2019t sticks.</p><p>\u201cBones,\u201d she said at once, and squatted down to look closer. \u201cWhat kind of animal are those from?\u201d Even as she said it, her mind was analyzing and rejecting\u2014squirrel, possum, rabbit, deer, pig\u2014unable to make sense of the shapes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re finger bones, lass,\u201d he said, lowering his voice as he glanced at Jemmy\u2014who had lost interest in the fire and was now sliding down the muddy bank, to the further detriment of his breeches. \u201cDinna touch them,\u201d he added\u2014unnecessarily, as she had drawn back her hand in instant revulsion.</p><p>\u201cFrom a human, you mean?\u201d Instinctively, she wiped her hand on the side of her thigh, though she had touched nothing.</p><p>He nodded, and squatted beside her, studying the charred remains. There were blackened lumps there, too\u2014though she thought these were the remains of some plant material; one was greenish, maybe a stem of something, incompletely burned.</p><p>Jamie bent low, sniffing at the burned remains. Instinctively, Brianna drew a deep breath through her nose in imitation\u2014then snorted, trying to get rid of the smell. It was disconcerting: a reek of char, overlaid with something bitter and chalky\u2014and that in turn overlaid with a sort of pungent scent that reminded her of medicine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere could they have come from?\u201d she asked, also low-voiced\u2014though Jemmy and Germain had begun pelting each other with mudballs, and wouldn\u2019t have noticed if she\u2019d shouted.</p><p>\u201cI havena noticed anyone missing a hand, have you?\u201d Jamie glanced up, giving her a half-smile. She didn\u2019t return it.</p><p>\u201cNot walking around, no. But if they aren\u2019t walking around\u2014\u201d She swallowed, trying to ignore the half-imagined taste of bitter herbs and burning. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest? Of the body, I mean.\u201d</p><p>That word, \u201cbody,\u201d seemed to bring the whole thing into a new and nasty focus.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of that finger, I wonder?\u201d Jamie was frowning at the blackened smudge. He moved a knuckle toward it, and she saw what he had seen: a paler smudge within the circle of the fire, where part of the ashes had been swept away. There were three fingers, she saw, still swallowing repeatedly. Two were intact, the bones gray-white and spectral among the ashes. Two joints of the third were gone, though; only the slender last phalanx remained.</p><p>\u201cAn animal?\u201d She glanced round for traces, but there were no pawprints on the surface of the rock\u2014only the muddy smudges left by the little boys\u2019 bare feet.</p><p>Vague visions of cannibalism were beginning to stir queasily in the pit of her stomach, though she rejected the notion at once.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Ian\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d Her father looked up, astonished. \u201cWhy should Ian do such a thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he would,\u201d she said, taking hold of common sense. \u201cNot at all. It was just a thought\u2014I\u2019d heard that the Iroquois sometimes . . . sometimes . . .\u201d She nodded at the charred bones, unwilling to articulate the thought further. \u201cUm . . . maybe a friend of Ian\u2019s? Uh . . . visiting?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face darkened a little, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, there\u2019s the smell of the Highlands about this. The Iroquois will burn an enemy. Or cut bits off him, to be sure. But not like that.\u201d He pointed at the bones with his chin, in the Highland way. \u201cThis is a private business, ken? A witch\u2014or one of their shamans, maybe\u2014might do a thing like that; not a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Indians of any kind lately. Not on the Ridge. Have you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the burned smudge a moment longer, frowning, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, nor anyone missing a few fingers, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure they\u2019re human?\u201d She studied the bones, trying for other possibilities. \u201cMaybe from a small bear? Or a big coon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said flatly, but she could tell he said it only for her sake. He was sure.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d The patter of bare feet on the rock behind her was succeeded by a tug at her sleeve. \u201cMama, we\u2019re hungry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d she said, rising to meet the demand, but still gazing abstractedly at the charred remnants. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten in nearly an hour. What did you\u2014\u201d Her gaze drifted slowly from the fire to her son, then snapped abruptly, focusing on the two little boys, who stood grinning at her, covered from head to foot in mud.</p><p>\u201cLook at you!\u201d she said, dismay tempered by resignation. \u201cHow could you possibly get that filthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s easy, lass,\u201d her father assured her, grinning as he rose to his feet. \u201cEasy cured, too, though.\u201d He bent, and seizing Germain by the back of shirt and seat of breeks, heaved him neatly off the rock and into the pool below.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, me, too! Me, too, Grandda!\u201d Jemmy was dancing up and down in excitement, spattering clods of mud in all direction.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. You, too.\u201d Jamie bent and grabbed Jem round the waist, launching him high into the air in a flutter of shirt before Brianna could cry out.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t swim!\u201d</p><p>This protest coincided with a huge splash, as Jem hit the water and promptly sank like a rock. She was striding toward the edge, prepared to dive in after him, when her father put a hand on her arm to stop her.</p><p>\u201cWait a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will ye ken whether he swims or not, if ye dinna let him try?\u201d</p><p>Germain was already arrowing his way toward shore, his sleek blond head dark with water. Jemmy popped up behind him, though, splashing and spluttering, and Germain dived, turned like an otter, and came up alongside.</p><p>\u201cKick!\u201d he called to Jemmy, churning up a huge spray in illustration. \u201cGo on your back!\u201d</p><p>Jemmy ceased flailing, went on his back, and kicked madly. His hair was plastered over his face and the spray of his efforts must have obscured any remnants of vision\u2014but he went on valiantly kicking, to encouraging whoops from Jamie and Germain.</p><p>The pool was no more than ten feet across, and he reached the shallows on the opposite bank within seconds, beaching among the rocks by virtue of crashing headfirst into one. He stopped, thrashing feebly in the shallows, then bounced to his feet, showering water, and shoved the wet hair out of his face. He looked amazed.</p><p>\u201cI can swim!\u201d he shouted. \u201cMama, I can swim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d she called, torn between sharing his ecstatic pride, the urge to rush home and tell Roger about it\u2014and dire visions of Jemmy now leaping heedlessly into bottomless ponds and rock-jagged rapids, under the reckless delusion that he could indeed swim. But he\u2019d gotten his feet wet, in no uncertain terms; there was no going back.</p><p>\u201cCome here!\u201d She bent toward him, clapping her hands. \u201cCan you swim back to me? Come on, come here!\u201d</p><p>He looked blankly at her for an instant, then around him at the rippling water of the pool. The blaze of excitement in his face died.</p><p>\u201cI forget,\u201d he said, and his mouth curled down, fat with sudden woe. \u201cI forget how!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFall down and kick!\u201d Germain bellowed helpfully, from his perch on the rock. \u201cYou can do it, cousin!\u201d</p><p>Jemmy took one or two blundering steps into the water, but stopped, lip trembling, terror and confusion starting to overwhelm him.</p><p>\u201cStay there, a chuisle! I\u2019m coming!\u201d Jamie called, and dove cleanly into the pool, a long pale streak beneath the water, bubbles streaming from hair and breeks. He popped up in front of Jemmy in an explosion of breath and shook his head, flinging strands of wet red hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, man,\u201d he said, scooting round on his knees in the shallows, so that his back was to Jemmy. He looked back, patting his own shoulder. \u201cTake hold of me here, aye? We\u2019ll swim back together.\u201d</p><p>And they did, kicking and splashing in ungainly dog paddle, Jemmy\u2019s shrieks of excitement echoed by Germain, who had leaped into the water to paddle alongside.</p><p>Hauled out onto the rock, the three of them lay puddled, gasping and laughing at her feet, water spreading in pools around them.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are cleaner,\u201d she said judiciously, moving her foot away from a spreading streamlet. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are.\u201d Jamie sat up, wringing out the long tail of his hair. \u201cIt occurs to me, lass, that there\u2019s maybe a better way to do what ye want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I w\u2014oh. You mean the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that.\u201d He sniffed, and rubbed the back of his hand under his nose. \u201cI\u2019ll show ye, if ye come up to the house after supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Grandda?\u201d Jemmy had got to his feet, wet hair standing up in red spikes, and was looking curiously at Jamie\u2019s back. He put out a tentative finger and traced one of the long, curving scars.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh . . . that.\u201d Jamie\u2019s face went quite blank for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . ah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome bad people hurt Grandda once,\u201d she interrupted firmly, bending down to pick Jemmy up. \u201cBut that was a long time ago. He\u2019s all right now. You weigh a ton!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa says Grandp\u00e8re is perhaps a silkie,\u201d Germain remarked, viewing Jamie\u2019s back with interest. \u201cLike his papa before him. Did the bad people find you in your silkie skin, Grandp\u00e8re, and try to cut it from you? He would then of course become a man again,\u201d he explained matter-of-factly, looking up at Jemmy, \u201cand could kill them with his sword.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was staring at Germain. He blinked, and wiped his nose again.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cAye. Um. Aye, I expect that was the way of it. If your papa says so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a silkie?\u201d asked Jemmy, bewildered but interested. He wiggled in Brianna\u2019s arms, wanting to be put down, and she lowered him back to the rock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Germain admitted. \u201cBut they have fur. What\u2019s a silkie, Grandp\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>Jamie closed his eyes against the sinking sun, and rubbed a hand over his face, shaking his head a little. Brianna thought he was smiling, but couldn\u2019t tell for sure.</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d he said, sitting up straighter, opening his eyes, and throwing back his wet hair. \u201cA silkie is a creature who is a man upon the land, but becomes a seal within the sea. And a seal,\u201d he added, cutting off Jemmy, who had been opening his mouth to ask, \u201cis a great sleek beastie that barks like a dog, is as big as an ox, and beautiful as the black of night. They live in the sea, but come out onto the rocks near the shore sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen them, Grandp\u00e8re?\u201d Germain asked, eager.</p><p>\u201cOh, many a time,\u201d Jamie assured him. \u201cThere are a great many seals who live on the coasts of Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland,\u201d Jemmy echoed. His eyes were round.</p><p>\u201cMa m\u00e8re says Scotland is a good place,\u201d Germain remarked. \u201cShe cries sometimes, when she talks of it. I am not so sure I would like it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Brianna asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s full of giants and water horses and . . . things,\u201d Germain replied, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t want to meet any of those. And parritch, Maman says, but we have parritch here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have. And I expect it\u2019s time we were going home to eat some.\u201d Jamie got to his feet and stretched, groaning in the pleasure of it. The late-afternoon sun washed rock and water with a golden light, gleaming on the boys\u2019 cheeks and the bright hairs on her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>Jemmy stretched and groaned, too, in worshipful imitation, and Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, wee fishie. D\u2019ye want a ride home?\u201d He bent so that Jemmy could scramble onto his back, then straightened up, settling the little boy\u2019s weight, and put out a hand to take Germain\u2019s.</p><p>Jamie saw her attention turn momentarily back toward the blackened smudge at the edge of the rock.</p><p>\u201cLeave it, lass,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s a charm of some kind. Ye dinna want to touch it.\u201d</p><p>Then he stepped off the rock and made for the trail, Jemmy on his back and Germain clutched firmly by the back of the neck, both boys giggling as they made their way through the slippery mud of the path.</p><p>Brianna retrieved her spade and Jamie\u2019s shirt from the creekbank, and caught the boys up on the trail to the Big House. A breeze had begun to breathe through the trees, chilly in the damp cloth of her shift, but the heat of walking was enough to keep her from being cold.</p><p>Germain was singing softly to himself, still hand-in-hand with his grandfather, his small blond head tilting back and forth like a metronome.</p><p>Jemmy sighed in exhausted bliss, legs wrapped round Jamie\u2019s middle, arms about his neck, and leaned his sun-reddened cheek against the scarred back. Then he thought of something, for he raised his head and kissed his grandfather with a loud smacking noise, between the shoulder blades.</p><p>Her father jerked, nearly dropping Jem, and made a high-pitched noise that made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cIs that make it better?\u201d Jem inquired seriously, pulling himself up and trying to look over Jamie\u2019s shoulder into his face.</p><p>\u201cOh. Aye, lad,\u201d his grandfather assured him, face twitching. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>The gnats and midges were out in force now. She beat a cloud of them away from her face, and slapped a mosquito that lit on Germain\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cAk!\u201d he said, hunching his shoulders, but then resumed singing \u201cAlouette,\u201d undisturbed.</p><p>Jemmy\u2019s shirt was thin, worn linen, cut down from one of Roger\u2019s old ones. The cloth had dried to the shape of his body, square-rumped and solid, the breadth of his small, tender shoulders echoing the wide set of the older, firmer ones he clung to. She glanced from the redheads to Germain, walking reed-thin and graceful through shadows and light, still singing, and thought how desperately beautiful men were.</p><p>\u201cWho were the bad people, Grandda?\u201d Jemmy asked drowsily, head nodding with the rhythm of Jamie\u2019s steps.</p><p>\u201cSassunaich,\u201d Jamie replied briefly. \u201cEnglish soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish canaille,\u201d Germain amplified, breaking off his song. \u201cThey are the ones who cut off my papa\u2019s hand, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were?\u201d Jemmy\u2019s head lifted in momentary attention, then fell back between Jamie\u2019s shoulder blades with a thump that made his grandfather grunt. \u201cDid you kill them with your sword, Grandda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kill the rest, when I am big,\u201d Germain declared. \u201cIf there are any left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there might be.\u201d Jamie hitched Jem\u2019s weight a little higher, letting go Germain\u2019s hand in order to hold Jemmy\u2019s slackening legs tight to his body.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Jemmy murmured, eyelids drooping. \u201cI\u2019ll kill them, too.\u201d</p><p>At the fork in the trail, Jamie surrendered her son to her, sound asleep, and took back his shirt. He pulled it on, brushing disheveled hair out of his face as his head came through. He smiled at her, then leaned forward and kissed her forehead, gently, putting one hand on Jemmy\u2019s round, red head where it lay against her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, lass,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Mordecai. And your man. Take care of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS A PRIVATE BUSINESS,\u201d her father had said. The general implication being that she should leave it alone. And she might have, save for a couple of things. One, that Roger had come home well after dark, whistling a song he said Amy McCallum had taught him. And two, that other offhand remark her father had made about the fire on the Flat Rock\u2014that there was a smell of the Highlands about it.</p><p>Brianna had a very keen nose, and she smelled a rat. She also had recognized\u2014belatedly\u2014what had made Jamie say what he had. The odd smell of the fire, that tang of medicine\u2014it was iodine; the smell of burned seaweed. She\u2019d smelled a fire built of sea wrack on the shore near Ullapool, in her own time, when Roger had taken her up there for a picnic.</p><p>There was certainly seaweed on the coast, and it wasn\u2019t impossible that someone, sometime, had brought some inland. But it also wasn\u2019t impossible that some of the fisher-folk had brought bits of it from Scotland, in the way that some exiles might bring earth in jar, or a handful of pebbles to remind them of the land left behind.</p><p>A charm, her father had said. And the song Roger had learned from Amy McCallum was called \u201cThe Deasil Charm,\u201d he said.</p><p>All of which was no particular evidence of anything. Still, she mentioned the small fire and its contents to Mrs. Bug, just from curiosity. Mrs. Bug knew a good deal about Highland charms of all sorts.</p><p>Mrs. Bug frowned thoughtfully at her description, lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cBones, ye say? What sort\u2014the bones of an animal, were they, or a man?\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt as though someone had dropped a slug down her back.</p><p>\u201cA man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. There\u2019s some charms that take grave dust, ken, and some the dust of bones, or the ashes of a body.\u201d Evidently reminded by the mention of ashes, Mrs. Bug pulled a big pottery mixing bowl from the warm ashes of the hearth, and peered into it. The bread starter had died a few days before, and the bowl of flour, water, and honey had been set out in hopes of snaring a wild yeast from the passing air.</p><p>The round little Scotswoman frowned at the bowl, shook her head, and put it back with a brief muttered verse in Gaelic. Naturally, Brianna thought, slightly amused, there would be a prayer for catching yeast. Which patron saint was in charge of that?</p><p>\u201cWhat ye said, though,\u201d Mrs. Bug said, returning both to her chopping of turnips and to the original subject of conversation. \u201cAbout it bein\u2019 on the Flat Rock. Seaweed, bones, and a flat rock. That\u2019s a love charm, lass. The one they call the Venom o\u2019 the North Wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a really peculiar name for a love charm,\u201d she said, staring at Mrs. Bug, who laughed.</p><p>\u201cOch, now, do I remember it at all?\u201d she asked rhetorically. She wiped her hands upon her apron, and folding them at her waist with a vaguely theatrical air, recited:</p><p>\u201cA love charm for thee,</p><p>Water drawn through a straw,</p><p>The warmth of him thou lovest,</p><p>With love to draw on thee.</p><p>\u201cArise betimes on Lord\u2019s day,</p><p>To the flat rock of the shore</p><p>Take with thee the butterbur</p><p>And the foxglove.</p><p>\u201cA small quantity of embers</p><p>In the skirt of thy kirtle,</p><p>A special handful of seaweed</p><p>In a wooden shovel.</p><p>\u201cThree bones of an old man,</p><p>Newly torn from the grave,</p><p>Nine stalks of royal fern,</p><p>Newly trimmed with an ax.</p><p>\u201cBurn them on a fire of faggots</p><p>And make them all into ashes;</p><p>Sprinkle in the fleshy breast of thy lover,</p><p>Against the venom of the north wind.</p><p>\u201cGo round the rath of procreation,</p><p>The circuit of the five turns,</p><p>And I will vow and warrant thee</p><p>That man shall never leave thee.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug unfolded her hands and took another turnip, quartering it with neat, quick chops and tossing the pieces into the pot. \u201cYe\u2019re not wanting such a thing yourself, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brianna murmured, feeling the small cold feeling continue down her back. \u201cDo you think\u2014would the fisher-folk use a charm like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as to that, I canna say what they\u2019d do\u2014but surely a few would ken that charm; it\u2019s weel enough known, though I havena kent anyone myself has done it. There are easier ways to make a lad fall in love wi\u2019 ye, lass,\u201d she added, pointing a stubby finger at Brianna in admonition. \u201cCook him up a nice plate o\u2019 neeps boiled in milk and served wi\u2019 butter, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d Brianna promised, smiling, and excused herself.</p><p>She had meant to go home; there were dozens of things needing to be done, from spinning yarn and weaving cloth, to plucking and drawing the half dozen dead geese she had shot and hung in the lean-to. But instead she found her footsteps turning up the hill, along the overgrown trail that led to the graveyard.</p><p>Surely it wasn\u2019t Amy McCallum who\u2019d made that charm, she thought. It would have taken her hours to walk down the mountain from her cabin, and her with a small baby to tend. But babies could be carried. And no one would know whether she had left her cabin, save perhaps Aidan\u2014and Aidan didn\u2019t talk to anyone but Roger, whom he worshipped.</p><p>The sun was nearly down, and the tiny cemetery had a melancholy look to it, long shadows from its sheltering trees slanting cold and dark across the needle-strewn ground and the small collection of crude markers, cairns, and wooden crosses. The pines and hemlocks murmured uneasily overhead in the rising breeze of evening.</p><p>The sense of cold had spread from her backbone, making a wide patch between her shoulder blades. Seeing the earth grubbed up beneath the wooden marker with Ephraim on it didn\u2019t help.</p><p>50</p><p>SHARP EDGES</p><p>HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN better. Did know better. But what could he have done? Much more important, what was he to do now?</p><p>Roger made his way slowly up the mountainside, nearly oblivious to its beauty. Nearly, but not quite. Desolate in the bleakness of winter, the secluded notch where Amy McCallum\u2019s ramshackle cabin perched among the laurels was a blaze of color and life in spring and summer\u2014so vivid that even his worry couldn\u2019t stop his noticing the blaze of pinks and reds, interrupted by soft patches of creamy dogwood and carpets of bluets, their tiny blue flowers nodding on slender stems above the torrent of the stream that bounded down beside the rocky trail.</p><p>They must have chosen the site in summer, he reflected cynically. It would have seemed charming then. He hadn\u2019t known Orem McCallum, but plainly the man hadn\u2019t been any more practical than his wife, or they would have realized the dangers of their remoteness.</p><p>The present situation wasn\u2019t Amy\u2019s fault, though; he shouldn\u2019t blame her for his own lack of judgment.</p><p>He didn\u2019t precisely blame himself, either\u2014but he should have noticed sooner what was going on; what was being said.</p><p>\u201cEverybody kens ye spend more time up at the notch wi\u2019 the widow McCallum than ye do with your own wife.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Malva Christie had said, her little pointed chin raised in defiance. \u201cTell my father, and I\u2019ll tell everyone I\u2019ve seen you kiss Amy McCallum. They\u2019ll all believe me.\u201d</p><p>He felt an echo of the astonishment he\u2019d felt at her words\u2014an astonishment succeeded by anger. At the girl and her silly threat, but much more at himself.</p><p>He\u2019d been working at the whisky clearing and, heading back to the cabin for dinner, had rounded a turn in the trail and surprised the two of them, Malva and Bobby Higgins, locked in an embrace. They\u2019d sprung apart like a pair of startled deer, eyes wide, so alarmed as to be funny.</p><p>He\u2019d smiled, but before he could either apologize or fade tactfully into the underbrush, Malva had stepped up to him, eyes still wide, but blazing with determination.</p><p>\u201cTell my father,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell everyone I\u2019ve seen you kiss Amy McCallum.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so taken aback by her words that he\u2019d scarcely noticed Bobby, until the young soldier had put a hand on her arm, murmuring something to her, drawing her away. She\u2019d turned reluctantly, with a last, wary, meaningful glance at Roger, and a parting shot that left him staggered.</p><p>\u201cEverybody kens ye spend more time up at the notch wi\u2019 the widow McCallum than ye do with your own wife. They\u2019ll all believe me.\u201d</p><p>God damn it, they would, too, and it was his own bloody fault. Bar one or two sarcastic remarks, Bree hadn\u2019t protested his visits; she\u2019d accepted\u2014or seemed to\u2014that someone had to go now and then to see the McCallums, make sure they had food and fire, provide a few moments\u2019 company, a small respite in the monotony of loneliness and labor.</p><p>He\u2019d done such things often, going with the Reverend to call on the aged, the widowed, the ill of the congregation; take them food, stop for a bit to talk\u2014to listen. It was just what you did for a neighbor, he told himself; a normal kindness.</p><p>But he should have taken more notice. Now he recalled Jamie\u2019s thoughtful glance over the supper table, the breath taken as though to say something, when Roger had asked Claire for a salve for wee Orrie McCallum\u2019s rash\u2014and then Claire\u2019s glance at Brianna, and Jamie\u2019s closing his mouth, whatever he\u2019d thought of saying left unspoken.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all believe me.\u201d For the girl to have said that, there must have been talk already. Likely Jamie had heard it; he could only hope that Bree hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The crooked chimney came in sight above the laurels, the smoke a nearly transparent wisp that made the clear air above the rooftree seem to quiver, as though the cabin were enchanted, might vanish with a blink.</p><p>The worst of it was that he knew precisely how it had happened. He had a weakness for young mothers, a terrible tenderness toward them, a desire to take care of them. The fact that he knew exactly why he harbored such an urge\u2014the memory of his own young mother, who had died saving his life during the Blitz\u2014didn\u2019t help.</p><p>It was a tenderness that had nearly cost him his life at Alamance, when that bloody-minded fool William Buccleigh MacKenzie had mistaken Roger\u2019s concern for Morag MacKenzie for . . . well, all right, he\u2019d kissed her, but only on the forehead, and for God\u2019s sake, she was his own many-times-great-grannie . . . and the thundering idiocy of nearly being killed by your own great-great-etc.-grandfather for molesting his wife . . . it had cost him his voice, and he should have learned his lesson, but he hadn\u2019t, not well enough.</p><p>Suddenly furious with himself\u2014and with Malva Christie, the malicious little chit\u2014he picked up a stone from the trail and flung it down the mountain, into the stream. It struck another in the water, bounced twice, and vanished into the rushing gurgle.</p><p>His visits to the McCallums had to stop, at once. He saw that clearly. Another way would have to be found for them . . . but he had to come once more, to explain. Amy would understand, he thought\u2014but how to explain to Aidan what reputation was, and why gossip was a deadly sin, and why Roger couldn\u2019t come anymore to fish or show him how to build things. . . .</p><p>Cursing steadily under his breath, he made the last short, steep ascent and came into the ragged, overgrown little dooryard. Before he could call out to announce his presence, though, the door flew open.</p><p>\u201cRoger Mac!\u201d Amy McCallum half-fell down the step and into his arms, gasping and weeping. \u201cOh, you came, you came! I prayed for someone to come, but I didna think anyone would, in time, and he\u2019d die, but ye\u2019ve come, God be thankit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong? Is wee Orrie taken sick?\u201d He got hold of her arms, steadying her, and she shook her head, so violently that her cap slid half off.</p><p>\u201cAidan,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s Aidan.\u201d</p><p>AIDAN MCCALLUM lay doubled up on my surgery table, white as a sheet, making little gasping groans. My first hope\u2014green apples or gooseberries\u2014vanished with a closer look at him. I was fairly sure what I had here, but appendicitis shares symptoms with a number of other conditions. A classic case does, however, have one striking aspect.</p><p>\u201cCan you unfold him, just for a moment?\u201d I looked at his mother, hovering over him on the verge of tears, but it was Roger who nodded and came to put his hands on Aidan\u2019s knees and shoulders, gently persuading him to lie flat.</p><p>I put a thumb in his navel, my little finger on his right hipbone, and pressed his abdomen sharply with my middle finger, wondering for a second as I did so whether McBurney had yet discovered and named this diagnostic spot. Pain in McBurney\u2019s Spot was a specific diagnostic symptom for acute appendicitis. I pressed Aidan\u2019s stomach there, then I released the pressure, he screamed, arched up off the table, and doubled up like a jackknife.</p><p>A hot appendix for sure. I\u2019d known I\u2019d encounter one sometime. And with a mixed sense of dismay and excitement, I realized that the time had come for me finally to use the ether. No doubt about it, and no choice; if the appendix wasn\u2019t removed, it would rupture.</p><p>I glanced up; Roger was supporting little Mrs. McCallum with a hand under her elbow; she clutched the baby close to her chest, wrapped in its bundle. She\u2019d need to stay; Aidan would need her.</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2014get Lizzie to come mind the baby, will you? And then run as fast as you can to the Christies\u2019; I\u2019ll need Malva to come and help.\u201d</p><p>The most extraordinary expression flitted across his face; I couldn\u2019t interpret it, but it was gone in an instant, and I didn\u2019t have time to worry about it. He nodded and left without a word, and I turned my attention to Mrs. McCallum, asking her the questions I needed answered before I cut into her small son\u2019s belly.</p><p>IT WAS ALLAN CHRISTIE who opened the door to Roger\u2019s brusque knock. A darker, leaner version of his owl-faced father, he blinked slowly at the question as to Malva\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . she\u2019s gone to the stream,\u201d he said. \u201cGathering rushes, she said.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhy do ye want her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Fraser needs her to come and help with\u2014with something.\u201d Something moved inside; the back door opening. Tom Christie came in, a book in his hand, the page he\u2019d been reading caught between two fingers.</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie,\u201d he said, with a short jerk of the head in acknowledgment. \u201cDid ye say Mrs. Fraser is wanting Malva? Why?\u201d He frowned as well, the two Christies looking exactly like a pair of barn owls contemplating a questionable mouse. \u201cOnly that wee Aidan McCallum\u2019s taken badly, and she\u2019d be glad of Malva\u2019s help. I\u2019ll go and find her.\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s frown deepened, and he opened his mouth to speak, but Roger had already turned, hurrying into the trees before either of them could stop him.</p><p>He found her fairly quickly, though every moment spent searching seemed an eternity. How long did it take an appendix to burst? She was knee-deep in the stream, skirts kirtled high and her rush basket floating beside her, tethered by an apron string. She didn\u2019t hear him at first, deafened by the flow of the water. When he called her name more loudly, her head jerked up in alarm, and she raised the rush knife, gripped tightly in her hand.</p> <p>The look of alarm faded when she saw who it was, though she kept a wary eye on him\u2014and a good grip on the knife, he saw. His summons was received with a flash of interest.</p><p>\u201cThe ether? Really, she\u2019s going to cut him?\u201d she asked eagerly, wading toward him.</p><p>\u201cYes. Come on; I\u2019ve already told your father Mrs. Fraser needs you. We needn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Her face changed at that.</p><p>\u201cYe told him?\u201d Her brow creased for a moment. Then she bit her lip and shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, raising her voice above the sound of the stream.</p><p>\u201cYes, ye can,\u201d he said, as encouragingly as possible, and stretched out a hand to help her. \u201cCome on; I\u2019ll give ye a hand with your things.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head more decidedly, pink lower lip poking out a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo. My father\u2014he\u2019ll no have it.\u201d She glanced in the direction of the cabin, and he turned to look, but it was all right; neither Allan nor Tom had followed him. Yet.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes and stepped into the icy creek, the stones rolling, hard and slippery under his feet. Malva\u2019s eyes widened and her mouth fell open as he bent and grabbed her basket, ripped it from her apron string, and tossed it onto the bank. Then he took the knife from her hand, thrust it through his belt, grabbed her round the waist, and picking her up, splashed ashore with her, disregarding the kicking and squealing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he said, grunting as he set her down. \u201cYe want to walk, or do I carry you?\u201d</p> <p>He thought she seemed more intrigued than horrified at this proposal, but she shook her head again, backing away from him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014truly! He\u2019ll\u2014he\u2019ll beat me if he finds out I\u2019ve been meddling wi\u2019 the ether.\u201d</p><p>That checked him momentarily. Would he? Perhaps. But Aidan\u2019s life was at stake.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t find out, then,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if he does, I\u2019ll see to it that he does ye no harm. Come, for God\u2019s sake\u2014there\u2019s no time to be wasting!\u201d</p><p>Her small pink mouth compressed itself in stubbornness. No time for scruples, then. He leaned down to bring his face close to hers and stared her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, fists curling, \u201cor I tell your father and your brother about you and Bobby Higgins. Say what ye like about me\u2014I don\u2019t care. But if ye think your father would beat you for helping Mrs. Fraser, what\u2019s he likely to do if he hears ye\u2019ve been snogging Bobby?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what the eighteenth-century equivalent of snogging was, but plainly she understood him. And if she\u2019d been anywhere near his own size, she would have knocked him down, if he read the dangerous light in those big gray eyes correctly.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t, and after an instant\u2019s consideration, she bent, dried her legs on her skirts, and shuffled hurriedly into her sandals.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d she said briefly, seeing him stoop for the basket. \u201cAnd give me back my knife.\u201d</p><p>It might have been simply an urge to keep some influence over her until she was safely in the surgery\u2014surely he wasn\u2019t afraid of her. He put a hand to the knife at his belt, though, and said, \u201cLater. When it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother arguing, but scampered up the bank ahead of him and headed for the Big House, the soles of her sandals flapping against her bare heels.</p><p>I HAD MY FINGERS on the brachial pulse in Aidan\u2019s armpit, counting. His skin was very hot to the touch, maybe a temperature of 101, 102. The pulse was strong, though rapid . . . slowing as he went further under. I could feel Malva counting under her breath, so many drops of ether, so long a pause before the next . . . I lost my own count of the pulse, but it didn\u2019t matter; I was taking it into myself, feeling my own pulse begin to beat in the same rhythm, and it was normal, steady.</p><p>He was breathing well. The little abdomen rose and fell slightly under my hand, and I could feel the muscles relaxing by the moment, everything except the tense, distended belly, the visible ribs arching high above it as he breathed. I had the sudden illusion that I could push my hand straight through the wall of his abdomen and touch the swollen appendix, could see it in my mind, throbbing malignantly in the dark security of its sealed world. Time, then.</p><p>Mrs. McCallum made a small sound when I took up the scalpel, a louder one when I pressed it down into the pale flesh, still gleaming wet with the alcohol I\u2019d swabbed it with, like a fish\u2019s belly yielding to the gutting knife.</p><p>The skin parted easily, blood welling in that odd, magical way, seeming to appear from nowhere. He had almost no fat beneath it; the muscles were right there, dark red, resilient to the touch. There were other people in the room; I felt them vaguely. I had no attention to spare, though. Every sense I had was focused on the small body under my hands. Someone stood at my shoulder, though\u2014Bree?</p><p>\u201cGive me a retractor\u2014yes, that thing.\u201d Yes, it was Bree; a long-fingered hand, wet with disinfectant, picked up the claw-shaped thing and put it in my waiting left hand. I missed the services of a good surgical nurse, but we\u2019d manage.</p><p>\u201cHold that, just there.\u201d I nosed the blade between the muscle fibers, splitting them easily, and then pinched up the thick soft gleam of the peritoneum, lifted it and sliced it.</p><p>His innards were very warm, sucking wet around two probing fingers. Soft squish of intestine, small half-firm lumps of matter felt through their walls, the brush of bone against my knuckle\u2014he was so small, there wasn\u2019t much room to feel around. I had my eyes closed, concentrating on touch alone. The cecum had to be right under my fingers, that was the curve of the large intestine I could feel, inert but live, like a sleeping snake. Behind? Below? I probed carefully, opened my eyes, and peered closely into the wound. He wasn\u2019t bleeding badly, but the wound was still awash. Ought I take the time to cauterize the small bleeders? I glanced at Malva; she was frowning in concentration, her lips moving silently, counting\u2014and she had one hand on the pulse in his neck, keeping track.</p><p>\u201cCautery iron\u2014a small one.\u201d A moment\u2019s pause; with the flammability of ether in mind, I had doused the hearth and put the brazier across the hall, in Jamie\u2019s study. Bree was quick, though; I had it in my hand in seconds. A wisp of smoke rose from his belly and the sizzle of seared flesh struck into the thick warm smell of blood. I glanced up to hand the iron back to Bree, and saw Mrs. McCallum\u2019s face, all eyes, staring.</p><p>I blotted away the blood with a handful of lint, looked again\u2014my fingers were still holding what I thought . . . all right.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said out loud, triumphant. \u201cGot you!\u201d Very carefully, I hooked a finger under the curve of the cecum and pulled a section of it up through the wound, the inflamed appendix sticking out from it like an angry fat worm, purple with inflammation.</p><p>\u201cLigature.\u201d</p><p>I had it now. I could see the membrane down the side of the appendix and the blood vessels feeding it. Those had to be tied off first; then I could tie off the appendix itself and cut it away. Difficult only because of the small size, but no real problem . . .</p><p>The room was so still, I could hear the tiny hisses and pops from the charcoal in the brazier across the hall. Sweat was running down behind my ears, between my br**sts, and I became dimly aware that my teeth were sunk in my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cForceps.\u201d I pulled the purse-string stitch tight, and taking the forceps, poked the tied-off stump of the appendix neatly up into the cecum. I pressed this firmly back into his belly and took a breath.</p><p>\u201cHow long, Malva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit more than ten minutes, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s all right.\u201d She took her eyes off the ether mask long enough to dart a quick smile at me, then took up the dropping bottle, lips resuming her silent count.</p><p>Closing up was quick. I painted the sutured wound with a thick layer of honey, wrapped a bandage tightly round his body, tucked warm blankets over him and breathed.</p><p>\u201cTake off the mask,\u201d I said to Malva, straightening up. She made no reply, and I looked at her. She had raised the mask, was holding it in both hands before her, like a shield. But she wasn\u2019t watching Aidan anymore; her eyes were fixed on her father, standing rigid in the doorway.</p><p>TOM CHRISTIE looked back and forth from the small nak*d body on the table to his daughter. She took an uncertain step back, still clutching the ether mask. His head twisted, piercing me with a fierce gray look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to do here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat are ye doing to that child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving his life,\u201d I replied tartly. I was still vibrating from the intensity of the surgery, and in no mood for rannygazoo. \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s thin lips pressed tight, but before he could reply, his son, Allan, pushed his way past into the room, and reaching his sister in a couple of strides, grabbed her by the wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome away, ye wee gomerel,\u201d he said roughly, jerking at her. \u201cYe\u2019ve no business here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of her.\u201d Roger spoke sharply, and took hold of Allan\u2019s shoulder, to pull him away. Allan whirled on his heel and punched Roger in the stomach, short and sharp. Roger made a hollow crowing noise, but didn\u2019t crumple. Instead, he slugged Allan Christie in the jaw. Allan reeled backward, knocking over the little table of instruments\u2014blades and retractors clattered over the floor in a swash of falling metal, and the jar of catgut ligatures in alcohol smashed on the boards, spraying glass and liquid everywhere.</p><p>A soft thump from the floor made me look down. Amy McCallum, overcome by ether fumes and emotion, had passed out.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t time to do anything about that; Allan bounced back with a wild swing, Roger ducked, caught the rush of the younger Christie\u2019s body, and the two of them staggered backward, hit the sill, and fell out of the open window, entangled.</p><p>Tom Christie made a low growling noise and hurried toward the window. Malva, seizing her chance, ran out the door; I heard her footsteps pattering hastily down the hall toward the kitchen\u2014and, presumably, the back door.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth . . . ?\u201d Bree said, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Which was true; I did, however, have a sinking feeling that my involving Malva in the operation had a lot to do with it. Tom Christie and I had reached something like rapprochement, following my operation on his hand\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean he had altered his views on the ungodliness of ether.</p><p>Bree drew herself abruptly upright, stiffening. A certain amount of grunting, gasping, and incoherent half-insults outside indicated that the fight was continuing\u2014but Allan Christie\u2019s raised voice had just called Roger an adulterer.</p><p>Brianna glanced sharply at the huddled form of Amy McCallum, and I said a very bad word to myself. I\u2019d heard a few sidelong remarks about Roger\u2019s visits to the McCallums\u2014and Jamie had come close to saying something to Roger about it, but I had dissuaded him from interfering, telling him that I\u2019d take up the matter tactfully with Bree. I hadn\u2019t had the chance, though, and now\u2014</p><p>With a last unfriendly look at Amy McCallum, Bree strode out the door, plainly intending to take a hand in the fight. I clutched my brow and must have moaned, for Tom Christie turned sharply from the window.</p><p>\u201cAre ye ill, mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, a little wanly. \u201cJust . . . look, Tom. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve caused trouble, asking Malva to help me. She has a real gift for healing, I think\u2014but I didn\u2019t mean to persuade her into doing something you didn\u2019t approve of.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a bleak look, which he then transferred to Aidan\u2019s slack body. The look sharpened suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIs that child dead?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said. \u201cI gave him ether; he\u2019s just gone aslee\u2014\u201d</p><p>My voice dried in my throat, as I noticed that Aidan had chosen this inconvenient moment to stop breathing.</p><p>With an incoherent cry, I shoved Tom Christie out of the way and fell on Aidan, gluing my mouth over his and pressing the heel of my hand hard in the center of his chest.</p><p>The ether in his lungs flowed over my face as I took my mouth away, making my head swim. I gripped the edge of the table hard with my free hand, putting my mouth back on his. I could not black out, I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>My vision swam and the room seemed to be revolving slowly round me. I clung doggedly to consciousness, though, urgently blowing into his lungs, feeling the tiny chest under my hand rise gently, then fall.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been more than a minute, but a minute filled with nightmare, everything spinning round me, the feel of Aidan\u2019s flesh the only solid anchor in a whirl of chaos. Amy McCallum stirred on the floor beside me, rose swaying to her knees\u2014then fell on me with a shriek, pulling at me, trying to get me off her son. I heard Tom Christie\u2019s voice, raised in command, trying to calm her; he must have pulled her away, for suddenly her grip on my leg was gone.</p><p>I blew into Aidan once more\u2014and this time, the chest under my hand twitched. He coughed, choked, coughed again, and started simultaneously to breathe and to cry. I stood up, head spinning, and had to hold on to the table to avoid falling.</p><p>I saw a pair of figures before me, black, distorted, with gaping mouths that opened toward me, filled with sharp fangs. I blinked, staggering, and took deep gulps of air. Blinked again, and the figures resolved themselves into Tom Christie and Amy McCallum. He was holding her round the waist, keeping her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, my own voice sounding strange and far off. \u201cHe\u2019s all right. Let her come to him.\u201d</p><p>She flung herself at Aidan with a sob, pulling him into her arms. Tom Christie and I stood staring at each other over the wreckage. Outside, everything had gone quiet.</p><p>\u201cDid ye just raise that child from the dead?\u201d he asked. His voice was almost conversational, though his feathery brows arched high.</p><p>I wiped a hand across my mouth, still tasting the sickly sweetness of the ether.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, blank-faced. The room reeked of alcohol, and it seemed to sear my nasal lining. My eyes were watering a little; I wiped them on my apron. Finally, he nodded, as though to himself, and turned to go.</p><p>I had to see to Aidan and his mother. But I couldn\u2019t let him go without trying to mend things for Malva, so far as I could.</p><p>\u201cTom\u2014Mr. Christie.\u201d I hurried after him, and caught him by the sleeve. He turned, surprised and frowning.</p><p>\u201cMalva. It\u2019s my fault; I sent Roger to bring her. You won\u2019t\u2014\u201d I hesitated, but couldn\u2019t think of any tactful way to put it. \u201cYou won\u2019t punish her, will you?\u201d</p><p>The frown deepened momentarily, then lifted. He shook his head, very slightly, and with a small bow, detached his sleeve from my hand.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said quietly, and with a last glance at Aidan\u2014presently demanding food\u2014he left.</p><p>BRIANNA DABBED THE wet corner of a handkerchief at Roger\u2019s lower lip, split on one side, swollen and bleeding from the impact of some part of Allan Christie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he said, for the third time. \u201cI should have thought of something sensible to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she said, beginning to lose her precarious grip on her patience. \u201cIf you keep talking, it won\u2019t stop bleeding.\u201d It was the first thing she\u2019d said to him since the fight.</p><p>With a mumbled apology, he took the handkerchief from her and pressed it to his mouth. Unable to keep still, though, he got up and went to the open door of the cabin, looking out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not still hanging around, is he? Allan?\u201d She came to look over his shoulder. \u201cIf he is, leave him alone. I\u2019ll go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d Roger interrupted her. Hand still pressed to his mouth, he nodded toward the Big House, at the far end of the sloped clearing. \u201cIt\u2019s Tom.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Tom Christie was standing on the stoop. Just standing, apparently deep in thought. As they watched, he shook his head like a dog shedding water, and set off with decision in the direction of his own place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and talk to him.\u201d Roger tossed the handkerchief at the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you won\u2019t.\u201d She grabbed him by the arm as he turned toward the door. \u201cYou stay out of it, Roger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight him,\u201d he said, patting her hand in what he plainly thought a reassuring manner. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She tightened her grip on his arm, and pulled, trying to bring him back to the hearth. \u201cYou\u2019ll just make it worse. Leave them alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d he said, irritation beginning to show on his face. \u201cWhat do ye mean, I\u2019ll make it worse? What d\u2019ye think I am?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a question she wanted to answer right this minute. Vibrating with emotion from the tension of Aidan\u2019s surgery, the explosion of the fight, and the niggling bur of Allan\u2019s shouted insult, she barely trusted herself to speak, let alone be tactful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she repeated, forcing herself to lower her voice, speak calmly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s upset. At least wait until they\u2019ve settled down. Better yet, wait \u2019til Da comes back. He can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he can do everything better than I can, I know that fine,\u201d Roger replied caustically. \u201cBut it\u2019s me that promised Malva she\u2019d come to no harm. I\u2019m going.\u201d He yanked at his sleeve, hard enough that she felt the underarm seam give way.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d She let go, and slapped him hard on the arm. \u201cGo! Take care of everybody in the world but your own family. Go! Bloody go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stopped, scowling, caught between anger and puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me! Go!\u201d She stamped her foot, and the jar of dauco seeds, left too near the edge of the shelf, fell off and smashed on the floor, scattering tiny black seeds like pepper grains. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind! Just never mind. Get out of here.\u201d She was puffing like a grampus with the effort not to cry. Her cheeks were hot with blood and her eyeballs felt red, bloodshot, so hot that she felt she might sear him with a look\u2014certainly she wished she could.</p><p>He hovered, clearly trying to decide whether to stay and conciliate his disgruntled wife, or rush off in chivalrous protection of Malva Christie. He took a hesitant step toward the door, and she dived for the broom, making stupid, high-pitched squeaks of incoherent rage as she swung it at his head.</p><p>He ducked, but she got him on the second swing, catching him across the ribs with a thwack. He jerked in surprise at the impact, but recovered fast enough to catch the broom on the next swing. He yanked it out of her hand, and with a grunt of effort, broke it over his knee with a splintering crack.</p><p>He threw the pieces clattering at her feet and glared at her, angry but self-possessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of God is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>She drew up tall and glared back.</p><p>\u201cWhat I said. If you\u2019re spending so much time with Amy McCallum that it\u2019s common talk you\u2019re having an affair with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d His voice broke with outrage, but there was a shifty look in his eyes that gave him away.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard it, too\u2014haven\u2019t you?\u201d She didn\u2019t feel triumphant at having caught him out; more a sense of sick fury.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly think that\u2019s true, Bree,\u201d he said, his voice pitched uncertainly between angry repudiation and pleading.</p><p>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t true,\u201d she said, and was furious to hear her own voice as shaky and cracked as his was. \u201cThat\u2019s not the effing point, Roger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point,\u201d he repeated. His black brows were drawn down, his eyes sharp and dark beneath them.</p><p>\u201cThe point,\u201d she said, gulping air, \u201cis that you\u2019re always gone. Malva Christie, Amy McCallum, Marsali, Lizzie\u2014you even go help Ute McGillivray, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else is to do it?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cYour father or your cousin might, aye\u2014but they\u2019ve to be gone to the Indians. I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m not always gone,\u201d he added, as an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019m home every night, am I not?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and clenched her fists, feeling the nails dig into her palms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll help any woman but me,\u201d she said, opening her eyes. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long, hard look, and she wondered for an instant whether there was such a thing as a black emerald.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t think ye needed me,\u201d he said. And turning on his heel, he left.</p><p>51</p><p>THE CALLING</p><p>THE WATER LAY CALM as melted silver, the only movement on it the shadows of the evening clouds. But the hatch was about to rise; you could feel it. Or perhaps, Roger thought, what he felt was the expectation in his father-in-law, crouched like a leopard on the bank of the trout pool, pole and fly at the ready for the first sign of a ripple.</p><p>\u201cLike the pool at Bethesda,\u201d he said, amused.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Jamie answered, but didn\u2019t look at him, his attention fixed on the water.</p><p>\u201cThe one where an angel would go down into the pool and trouble the water now and then. So everyone sat about waiting, so as to plunge in the minute the water began to stir.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled, but still didn\u2019t turn. Fishing was serious business.</p><p>That was good; he\u2019d rather not have Jamie look at him. But he\u2019d have to hurry if he meant to say something; Fraser was already paying out the line to make a practice cast or two.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014\u201d He stopped himself, correcting. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think. I know. I want\u2014\u201d His air ran out in a wheeze, annoying him; the last thing he wanted was to sound in any way doubtful about what he was saying. He took a huge breath, and the next words shot out as though fired from a pistol. \u201cI mean to be a minister.\u201d</p><p>Well, then. He\u2019d said it out loud. He glanced upward, involuntarily, but sure enough, the sky hadn\u2019t fallen. It was hazed and riffled with mare\u2019s tails, but the blue calm of it showed through and the ghost of an early moon floated just above the mountain\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Jamie glanced thoughtfully at him, but didn\u2019t seem shocked or taken aback. That was some small comfort, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cA minister. A preacher, d\u2019ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . aye. That, too.\u201d</p><p>The admission disconcerted him. He supposed he would have to preach, though the mere notion of it was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cThat, too?\u201d Fraser repeated, looking at him sideways.</p><p>\u201cAye. I mean\u2014a minister does preach, of course.\u201d Of course. What about? How? \u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2014I mean, that\u2019s not the main thing. Not why I\u2014I have to do it.\u201d He was getting flustered, trying to explain clearly something that he could not even explain properly to himself.</p><p>He sighed, and rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cAye, look. Ye recall Grannie Wilson\u2019s funeral, of course. And the McCallums?\u201d</p><p>Jamie merely nodded, but Roger thought perhaps a flicker of understanding showed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done . . . a few things. A bit like that, when it was needed. And\u2014\u201d He twitched a hand, unsure even how to begin describing things like his meeting with Hermon Husband on the banks of the Alamance, or the conversations had with his dead father, late at night.</p><p>He sighed again, made to toss a pebble into the water, and stopped himself, just in time, when he saw Jamie\u2019s hand tense round his fishing pole. He coughed, feeling the familiar choke and rasp in his throat, and closed his hand around the pebble.</p><p>\u201cThe preaching, aye, I suppose I\u2019ll manage. But it\u2019s the other things\u2014oh, God, this sounds insane, and I do believe I may be. But it\u2019s the burying and the christening and the\u2014the\u2014maybe just being able to help, even if it\u2019s only by listening and praying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe want to take care of them,\u201d Jamie said softly, and it wasn\u2019t a question, but rather an acceptance.</p><p>Roger laughed a little, unhappily, and closed his eyes against the sparkle of the sun off the water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I thought of, and me growing up in a minister\u2019s house. I mean, I ken what it\u2019s like. But someone has to do it, and I am thinking it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them spoke for a bit. Roger opened his eyes and watched the water. Algae coated the rocks, wavering in the current like locks of mermaid\u2019s hair. Fraser stirred a little, drawing back his rod.</p><p>\u201cDo Presbyterians believe in the sacraments, would ye say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roger said, surprised. \u201cOf course we do. Have ye never\u2014\u201d Well, no. He supposed in fact Fraser never had spoken to anyone not a Catholic, regarding such matters. \u201cWe do,\u201d he repeated. He dipped a hand gently in the water, and wiped it across his brow, so the coolness ran down his face and down his neck inside his shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Holy Orders I mean, ken?\u201d The drowned fly swam through the water, a tiny speck of red. \u201cWill ye not need to be ordained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Aye, I would. There\u2019s a Presbyterian academy in Mecklenburg County. I\u2019ll go there and speak with them about it. Though I\u2019m thinking it willna take such a time; I\u2019ve the Greek and Latin already, and for what it\u2019s worth\u201d\u2014he smiled, despite himself\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve a degree from Oxford University. Believe it or not, I was once thought an educated man.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched at the corner as he drew back his arm and snapped his wrist. The line sailed out, a lazy curve, and the fly settled. Roger blinked; sure enough\u2014the surface of the pool was beginning to pucker and shiver, tiny ripples spreading out from the rising hatch of mayflies and damselflies.</p><p>\u201cHave ye spoken to your wife about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, staring across the pool.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d There was no tone of accusation in the question; more curiosity. Why, after all, should he have chosen to talk to his father-in-law first, rather than his wife?</p><p>Because you know what it is to be a man, he thought, and she doesn\u2019t. What he said, though, was another version of the truth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to think me a coward.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a small \u201chmph\u201d noise, almost surprise, but didn\u2019t reply at once, concentrating on reeling in his line. He took the sodden fly from the hook, then hesitated over the collection on his hat, finally choosing a delicate green thing with a curving wisp of black feather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cD\u2019ye think she would?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, Fraser stood and whipped the line up and back, sending the fly out to drift down over the center of the pool, lighting like a leaf on the water.</p><p>Roger watched as he brought it in, playing it over the water in a jerky dance. The Reverend had been a fisherman. All at once, he saw the Ness and its sparkling riffles, running clear brown over the rocks, Dad standing in his battered waders, reeling in his line. He was choked with longing. For Scotland. For his father. For one more day\u2014just one\u2014of peace.</p><p>The mountains and the green wood rose up mysterious and wild around them, and the hazy sky unfurled itself over the hollow like angel\u2019s wings, silent and sunlit. But not peaceful; never peace, not here.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe us\u2014Claire and Brianna and me\u2014about the war that\u2019s coming?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie laughed shortly, gaze fixed on the water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve eyes, man. It doesna take either prophet or witch to see it standing on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d said Roger, giving him a curious look, \u201cis a very odd way of putting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, so? Is that no what the Bible says? When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not, then let them in Judaea flee to the mountains?\u201d</p><p>Let him who readeth understand. Memory supplied the missing part of the verse, and Roger became aware, with a small sense of cold in the bone, that Jamie did indeed see it standing on the road, and recognized it. Nor was he using figures of speech; he was describing, precisely, what he saw\u2014because he had seen it before.</p> <p>The sound of small boys yelling in joy drifted across the water, and Fraser turned his head a little, listening. A faint smile touched his mouth, then he looked down into the moving water, seeming to grow still. The ropes of his hair stirred against the sunburned skin of his neck, in the same way that the leaves of the mountain ash moved above.</p><p>Roger wanted suddenly to ask Jamie whether he was afraid, but kept silence. He knew the answer, in any case.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. He breathed deep, and felt the same answer, to the same question, asked of himself. It didn\u2019t seem to come from anywhere, but was just there inside him, as though he had been born with it, always known it.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. You will do it anyway.</p><p>They stayed for some time in silence. Jamie cast twice more with the green fly, then shook his head and muttered something, reeled it in, changed it for a Dun Fly, and cast again. The little boys charged past on the other bank, nak*d as eels, giggling, and disappeared through the bushes.</p><p>Really odd, Roger thought. He felt all right. Still having not the slightest idea what he meant to do, exactly, still seeing the drifting cloud coming toward them, and now knowing much more about what lay within it. But still all right.</p> <p>Jamie had a fish on the line. He brought it in fast, and jerked it shining and flapping onto the bank, where he killed it with a sharp blow on a rock before tucking it into his creel.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye mean to turn Quaker?\u201d Jamie asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Roger was startled by the question. \u201cWhy do you ask that?\u201d</p><p>Jamie made the odd little half-shrugging gesture that he sometimes used when uncomfortable about something, and didn\u2019t speak again until he\u2019d made the new cast.</p><p>\u201cYe said ye didna want Brianna to think ye coward. I\u2019ve fought by the side of a priest before.\u201d One side of his mouth turned up, wry. \u201cGranted, he wasna much of a swordsman, the Monsignor, and he couldna hit the broad side of a barn wi\u2019 a pistol\u2014but he was game enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Roger scratched the side of his jaw. \u201cAye, I take your meaning. No, I can\u2019t fight with an army, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Saying it, he felt a sharp pang of regret. \u201cBut take up arms in defense of\u2014of those who need it . . . I can square that with my conscience, aye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, then.\u201d</p><p>Jamie reeled in the rest of the line, shook water from the fly, and stuck the hook back into his hat. Laying the line aside, he rummaged in the creel and pulled out a stoneware bottle. He sat down with a sigh, pulled the cork with his teeth, spat it into his hand, and offered Roger the bottle.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thing Claire says to me, now and again,\u201d he explained, and quoted: \u201cMalt does more than Milton can, to justify God\u2019s ways to man.\u201d</p><p>Roger lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cEver read Milton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit. She\u2019s right about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe ken the next lines?\u201d Roger lifted the bottle to his lips. \u201cAle, man, ale\u2019s the stuff to drink, For fellows whom it hurts to think.\u201d</p><p>A subterranean laugh moved through Fraser\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis must be whisky, then,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only smells like beer.\u201d</p><p>It was cool and dark and pleasantly bitter, and they passed the bottle to and fro, not saying much of anything, until the ale was gone. Jamie put the cork thriftily back in, and tucked the empty bottle away in the creel.</p><p>\u201cYour wife,\u201d he said thoughtfully, rising and hitching the strap of the creel onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Roger picked up the battered hat, bestrewn with flies, and gave it to him. Jamie nodded thanks, and set it on his head.</p><p>\u201cShe has eyes, too.\u201d</p><p>52</p><p>M-I-C-</p><p>FIREFLIES LIT THE GRASS, the trees, and floated through the heavy air in a profusion of cool green sparks. One lighted on Brianna\u2019s knee; she watched it pulse, on-off, on-off, and listened to her husband telling her he meant to be a minister.</p><p>They were sitting on the stoop of their cabin as the dusk thickened into night. Across the big clearing, the whoops of small children at play sounded in the bushes, high and cheerful as hunting bats.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . uh . . . could say something,\u201d Roger suggested. His head was turned, looking at her. There was enough light yet to see his face, expectant, slightly anxious.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . give me a minute. I sort of wasn\u2019t expecting this, you know?\u201d</p><p>That was true, and it wasn\u2019t. Certainly, she hadn\u2019t consciously thought of such a thing, yet now that he\u2019d stated his intentions\u2014and he had, she thought; he wasn\u2019t asking her permission\u2014she wasn\u2019t at all surprised. It was less a change than a recognition of something that had been there for some time\u2014and in a way, it was a relief to see it and know it for what it was.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, after a long moment of consideration, \u201cI think that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe do.\u201d The relief in his voice was palpable.</p><p>\u201cYes. If you\u2019re helping all these women because God told you to, that\u2019s better than doing it because you\u2019d rather be with them than with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree! Ye can\u2019t think that, that I\u2014\u201d He leaned closer, looking anxiously into her face. \u201cYe don\u2019t, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, only sometimes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIn my worse moments. Not most of the time.\u201d He looked so anxious that she reached up and cupped her hand to the long curve of his cheek; the stubble of his beard was invisible in this light, but she could feel it, soft and tickling against her palm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she said softly. He nodded, and she saw his throat move as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little at that.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou tell me how, and I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, his face lightening, though his smile was rueful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d he said. \u201cHow to do it, I mean. Let alone what you might do. That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been doing it, anyway, haven\u2019t you? Do you need to do anything formal about this, though? Or can you just announce you\u2019re a minister, like those TV preachers, and start taking up the collection right away?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the joke, but answered seriously.</p><p>\u201cBloody Romanist. Ye always think no one else has any claim to sacraments. We do, though. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll go to the Presbyterian Academy, see what I need to do about ordination. As for taking up the collection\u2014I expect this means I\u2019ll never be rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of wasn\u2019t expecting that, anyway,\u201d she assured him gravely. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I didn\u2019t marry you for your money. If we need more, I\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not selling my body, probably. Not after what happened to Manfred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that,\u201d he said. His hand came down over hers, large and warm.</p><p>Aidan McCallum\u2019s high, piercing voice floated through the air, and a sudden thought struck her.</p><p>\u201cYour\u2014your, um, flock . . .\u201d The word struck her funny bone, and she giggled, despite the seriousness of the question. \u201cWill they mind that I\u2019m a Catholic?\u201d She turned to him suddenly, another thought coming rapidly in its wake. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014you aren\u2019t asking me to convert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he said quickly, firmly. \u201cNot in a million years. As for what they might think\u2014or say\u2014\u201d His face twitched, caught between dismay and determination. \u201cIf they\u2019re not willing to accept it, well . . . they can just go to hell, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing, and he followed her, his laugh cracked, but without restraint.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s Cat is an irreverent cat,\u201d she teased. \u201cAnd how do you say that in Gaelic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea. But the Minister\u2019s Cat is a relieved cat,\u201d he added, still smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what ye might think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not totally sure what I do think about it,\u201d she admitted. She squeezed his hand lightly. \u201cBut I see that you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows?\u201d He smiled, and the last of the evening light glowed briefly in his eyes, a deep and lambent green.</p><p>\u201cIt shows. You\u2019re sort of . . . lighted up inside.\u201d Her throat felt tight. \u201cRoger\u2014you won\u2019t forget about me and Jem, will you? I don\u2019t know that I can compete with God.\u201d</p><p>He looked thunderstruck at that.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his hand tightening on hers, hard enough to make her ring cut into her flesh. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>They sat silent for a little, the fireflies drifting down like slow green rain, their silent mating song lighting the darkening grass and trees. Roger\u2019s face was fading as the light failed, though she still saw the line of his jaw, set in determination.</p><p>\u201cI swear to ye, Bree,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m called to now\u2014and God knows what that is\u2014I was called to be your husband first. Your husband and the father of your bairns above all things\u2014and that I always shall be. Whatever I may do, it will not ever be at the price of my family, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want,\u201d she said softly to the dark, \u201cis for you to love me. Not because of what I can do or what I look like, or because I love you\u2014just because I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, unconditional love?\u201d he said just as softly. \u201cSome would tell ye only God can love that way\u2014but I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have faith in you,\u201d she said, and felt the glow of him reach her own heart.</p><p>\u201cI hope ye always will,\u201d he said. He raised her hand to his lips, kissed her knuckles in formal salutation, his breath warm on her skin.</p><p>As though to test the resolution of his earlier declaration, Jem\u2019s voice rose and fell on the evening breeze, a small, urgent siren. \u201cDadddeeeDaaaddeeeDAAADDDEEE . . .\u201d</p><p>Roger sighed deeply, leaned over, and kissed her, a moment\u2019s soft, deep connection, then rose to deal with the emergency of the moment.</p><p>She sat for a bit, listening. The sound of male voices came from the far end of the clearing, high and low, demand and question, reassurance and excitement. No emergency; Jem wanted to be lifted into a tree too high for him to climb alone. Then laughter, mad rustling of leaves\u2014oh, good grief, Roger was in the tree, too. They were all up there, hooting like owls.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye laughing at, a nighean?\u201d Her father loomed out of the night, smelling of horses.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she said, scooching over to make room for him to sit beside her. It was true. Everything seemed suddenly bright, the candlelight from the windows of the Big House, the fireflies in the grass, the glow of Roger\u2019s face when he told her his desire. She could still feel the touch of his mouth on hers; it fizzed in her blood.</p><p>Jamie reached up and fielded a passing firefly, holding it for a moment cupped in the dark hollow of his hand, where it flashed on and off, the cool light seeping through his fingers. Far off, she heard a brief snatch of her mother\u2019s voice, coming through an open window; Claire was singing \u201cClementine.\u201d</p><p>Now the boys\u2014and Roger\u2014were howling at the moon, though it was no more than a pale sickle on the horizon. She felt her father\u2019s body shake with silent laughter, too.</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of Disneyland,\u201d she said on impulse.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Where\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an amusement park\u2014for children,\u201d she added, knowing that while there were such things as amusement parks in places like London and Paris, these were purely adult places. No one ever thought of entertaining children now, beyond their own games and the occasional toy.</p><p>\u201cDaddy and Mama took me there every summer,\u201d she said, slipping back without effort to the hot, bright days and warm California nights. \u201cThe trees all had little sparkling lights in them\u2014the fireflies reminded me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie spread his palm; the firefly, suddenly free, pulsed to itself once or twice, then spread its wings with a tiny whir and lifted into the air, floating up and away.</p><p>\u201cDwelt a miner, forty-niner, and his daugh-ter, Clementine . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like, then?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . it was wonderful.\u201d She smiled to herself, seeing the brilliant lights of Main Street, the music and mirrors and beautiful, beribboned horses of King Arthur\u2019s Carrousel. \u201cThere were . . . rides, we called them. A boat, where you could float through the jungle on a river, and see crocodiles and hippopotamuses and headhunters . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadhunters?\u201d he said, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cNot real ones,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s all make-believe\u2014but it\u2019s . . . well, it\u2019s a world to itself. When you\u2019re there, the real world sort of disappears; nothing bad can happen there. They call it \u2018The Happiest Place on Earth\u2019\u2014and for a little while, it really seems that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight she was, and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine, Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d hear music everywhere, all the time,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cBands\u2014groups of musicians playing instruments, horns and drums and things\u2014would march up and down the streets, and play in pavilions. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that happens in amusement parks. Or it did, the once I was in one.\u201d She could hear a smile in his voice, as well.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. And there are cartoon characters\u2014I told you about cartoons\u2014walking around. You can go up and shake hands with Mickey Mouse, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMickey Mouse.\u201d She laughed. \u201cA big mouse, life-size\u2014human-size, I mean. He wears gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA giant rat?\u201d he said, sounding slightly stunned. \u201cAnd they take the weans to play with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a rat, a mouse,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really a person dressed up like a mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he said, not sounding terribly reassured.</p><p>\u201cYes. And an enormous carrousel with painted horses, and a railroad train that goes through the Rainbow Caverns, where there are big jewels sticking out of the walls, and colored streams with red and blue water . . . and orange-juice bars. Oh, orange-juice bars!\u201d She moaned softly in ecstatic remembrance of the cold, tart, overwhelming sweetness.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice, then?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThou art lost and gone forever, Dreadful sor-ry . . . Clementine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, sighed, and was silent for a moment. Then she leaned her head against his shoulder, and wrapped her hand around his arm, big and solid.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said, and he made a small interrogatory noise in reply.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice\u2014it was great\u2014but what I really, really loved about it was that when we were there, it was just the three of us, and everything was perfect. Mama wasn\u2019t worrying about her patients, Daddy wasn\u2019t working on a paper\u2014they weren\u2019t ever silent or angry with each other. Both of them laughed\u2014we all laughed, all the time . . . while we were there.\u201d</p><p>He made no reply, but tilted his head so it rested against hers. She sighed again, deeply.</p><p>\u201cJemmy won\u2019t get to go to Disneyland\u2014but he\u2019ll have that. A family that laughs\u2014and millions of little lights in the trees.\u201d</p><p>PART SEVEN</p><p>Rolling Downhill</p><p>53</p><p>PRINCIPLES</p><p>From Fraser\u2019s Ridge, North Carolina,</p><p>on the Third day of July, Anno Domini 1774,</p><p>James Fraser, Esq.</p><p>To his Lordship, John Grey, at Mount Josiah</p><p>Plantation, in the colony of Virginia</p><p>My Dear Friend,</p><p>I cannot begin to express our Gratitude for your kind Behavior in sending a Draft drawn upon your own Bank, as advance Payment against the eventual Sale of the Objects I confided to your disposition. Mr. Higgins, in delivering this Document, was of course most tactful\u2014and yet, I gathered from his anxious Demeanor and his efforts at Discretion that you may perhaps believe us to be in dire Straits. I hasten to assure you that this is not the Case; we will do well enough, so far as Matters of Victuals, Clothes, and the Necessities of Life.</p><p>I said that I would tell you the Details of the Affair, and I see that I must, if only to disabuse you of the Vision of rampant Starvation among my family and tenants.</p><p>Beyond a small legal Obligation requiring Cash, I have a Matter of Business in Hand, involving the acquisition of a Number of Guns. I had been in Hopes of acquiring these through the good offices of a Friend, but find that this Arrangement will no longer answer; I must look further abroad.</p><p>I and my Family are invited to a Barbecue in honor of Miss Flora MacDonald, the Her**ne of the Rising\u2014you are familiar with the Lady, I believe? I recall your telling me once of your meeting with her in London, whilst she was imprisoned there\u2014to take place next month at my aunt\u2019s Plantation, River Run. As this Affair will be attended by a great many Scots, some coming from considerable Distances, I am in Hopes that with Cash in Hand, I may make Arrangements to procure the requisite Weapons via other Avenues. In re which, should your own Connexions suggest any such useful Avenues, I should be grateful to hear of them.</p><p>I write quickly, as Mr. Higgins has other Errands, but my Daughter bids me send herewith a box of Matchsticks, her own Invention. She has schooled Mr. Higgins most carefully in their Use, so if he does not burst inadvertently into Flame on the way back, he will be able to demonstrate them to you.</p><p>Your humble and ob\u2019t. servant,</p><p>James Fraser</p><p>P.S. I require thirty Muskets, with as much Powder and Ammunition as may be possible. These need not be of the latest Manufacture, but must be well-kept and functional.</p><p>\u201c\u2018OTHER AVENUES?\u2019\u201d I said, watching him sand the letter before folding it. \u201cYou mean smugglers? And if so, are you sure that Lord John will understand what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and he will,\u201d Jamie assured me. \u201cI ken a few smugglers myself, who bring things in through the Outer Banks. He\u2019ll know the ones who come through Roanoke, though\u2014and there\u2019s more business there, because of the blockade in Massachusetts. Goods come in through Virginia, and go north overland.\u201d</p><p>He took a half-burned beeswax taper from the shelf and held it to the coals in the hearth, then dripped soft brown wax in a puddle over the seam of the letter. I leaned forward and pressed the back of my left hand into the warm wax, leaving the mark of my wedding ring in it.</p><p>\u201cDamn Manfred McGillivray,\u201d he said, with no particular heat. \u201cIt will be three times the cost, and I must get them from a smuggler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ask about him, though? At the barbecue, I mean?\u201d Flora MacDonald, the woman who had saved Charles Stuart from the English after Culloden, dressing him in her maid\u2019s clothes and smuggling him to a rendezvous with the French on the Isle of Skye, was a living legend to the Scottish Highlanders, and her recent arrival in the colony was the subject of vast excitement, news of it coming even as far as the Ridge. Every well-known Scot in the Cape Fear valley\u2014and a good many from farther away\u2014would be present at the barbecue to be held in her honor. No better place to spread the word for a missing young man.</p><p>He glanced up at me, surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, Sassenach. What d\u2019ye think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re very kind,\u201d I said, kissing him on the forehead. \u201cIf a trifle reckless. And I notice you carefully didn\u2019t tell Lord John why you need thirty muskets.\u201d</p><p>He gave a small snort, and swept the grains of sand carefully off the table into the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken for sure myself, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean by that?\u201d I asked, surprised. \u201cDo you not mean to give them to Bird, after all?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer at once, but the two stiff fingers of his right hand tapped gently on the tabletop. Then he shrugged, reached to the stack of journals and ledgers, and pulled out a paper, which he handed to me. A letter from John Ashe, who had been a fellow commander of militia during the War of the Regulation.</p><p>\u201cThe fourth paragraph,\u201d he said, seeing me frown at a recounting of the latest contretemps between the Governor and the Assembly. I obligingly skimmed down the page, to the indicated spot, and felt a small, premonitory shiver.</p><p>\u201cA Continental Congress is proposed,\u201d I read, \u201cwith delegates to be sent from each colony. The lower house of the Connecticut Assembly has moved already to propose such men, acting through Committees of Correspondence. Some gentlemen with whom you are well-acquainted propose that North Carolina shall do likewise, and will meet to accomplish the matter in mid-August. I could wish that you would join us, friend, for I am convinced that your heart and mind must lie with us in the matter of liberty; surely such a man as yourself is no friend to tyranny.</p><p>\u201cSome gentlemen with whom you are well-acquainted,\u201d I repeated, putting down the letter. \u201cDo you know who he means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMid-August, he says. Before the barbecue, do you think, or after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter. One of the others sent me the date of the meeting. It\u2019s to be in Halifax.\u201d</p><p>I put down the letter. The afternoon was still and hot, and the thin linen of my shift was damp, as were the palms of my hands.</p><p>\u201cOne of the others,\u201d I said. He shot me a quick glance, with a half-smile, and picked up the letter.</p><p>\u201cIn the Committee of Correspondence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, naturally,\u201d I said. \u201cYou might have told me.\u201d Naturally, he would have found a means of inveigling himself into the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence\u2014the center of political intrigue, where the seeds of rebellion were being sown\u2014meanwhile holding a commission as Indian agent for the British Crown and ostensibly working to arm the Indians, in order to suppress precisely those seeds of rebellion.</p><p>\u201cI am telling ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time they\u2019ve asked me to meet wi\u2019 them, even in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWill you go? Is it\u2014is it time?\u201d Time to make the leap, declare himself openly as a Whig, if not yet a rebel. Time to change his public allegiance, and risk the brand of treason. Again.</p><p>He sighed deeply and rubbed a hand through his hair. He\u2019d been thinking; the short hairs of several tiny cowlicks were standing on end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s two years yet, no? The fourth of July, 1776\u2014that\u2019s what Brianna said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s two years until they declare independence\u2014but, Jamie, the fighting will have started already. That will be much too late.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the letters on the desk, and nodded bleakly.</p><p>\u201cAye, it will have to be soon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be likely safe enough,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cWhat you told me about Henderson buying land in Tennessee: if no one\u2019s stopping him, I can\u2019t see anyone in the government being agitated enough to come up here and try to force us out. And surely not if you were only known to have met with the local Whigs?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a small, wry smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no the government I\u2019m worrit by, Sassenach. It\u2019s the folk nearby. It wasna the Governor who hanged the O\u2019Brians and burnt their house, ken? Nor was it Richard Brown, nor Indians. That wasna done for the sake of law nor profit; it was done for hate, and verra likely by someone who knew them.\u201d</p><p>That made a more pronounced chill skitter down my spine. There was a certain amount of political disagreement and discussion on the Ridge, all right, but it hadn\u2019t reached the stage of fisticuffs yet, let alone burning and killing.</p><p>But it would.</p><p>I remembered, all too well. Bomb shelters and ration coupons, blackout wardens and the spirit of cooperation against a dreadful foe. And the stories from Germany, France. People reported on, denounced to the SS, dragged from their houses\u2014others hidden in attics and barns, smuggled across borders.</p><p>In war, government and their armies were a threat, but it was so often the neighbors who damned or saved you.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said baldly.</p><p>\u201cI could guess,\u201d he said, with a shrug. \u201cThe McGillivrays? Richard Brown? Hodgepile\u2019s friends\u2014if he had any. The friends of any of the other men we killed? The Indian ye met\u2014Donner?\u2014if he\u2019s still alive. Neil Forbes? He\u2019s a grudge against Brianna, and she and Roger Mac would do well to remember it. Hiram Crombie and his lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiram?\u201d I said dubiously. \u201cGranted, he doesn\u2019t like you very much\u2014and as for me\u2014but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do doubt it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s possible, aye? His people didna support the Jacobites at all; they\u2019ll no be pleased at an effort to overthrow the King from this side of the water, either.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Crombie and the rest would of necessity have taken an oath of loyalty to King George, before being allowed to travel to America. Jamie had\u2014of necessity\u2014taken the same oath, as part of his pardon. And must\u2014of an even greater necessity\u2014break it. But when?</p><p>He\u2019d stopped drumming his fingers; they rested on the letter before him.</p><p>\u201cI do trust ye\u2019re right, Sassenach,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? What will happen? You know I am,\u201d I said, a little surprised. \u201cBree and Roger told you, too. Why?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand slowly through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never fought for the sake of principle,\u201d he said, reflecting, and shook his head. \u201cOnly necessity. I wonder, would it be any better?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound upset, merely curious, in a detached sort of way. Still, I found this vaguely disturbing.</p><p>\u201cBut there is principle to it, this time,\u201d I protested. \u201cIn fact, it may be the first war ever fought over principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather than something sordid like trade, or land?\u201d Jamie suggested, raising one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say trade and land haven\u2019t anything to do with it,\u201d I replied, wondering precisely how I\u2019d managed to become a defender of the American Revolution\u2014an historical period I knew only from Brianna\u2019s school textbooks. \u201cBut it goes well beyond that, don\u2019t you think? We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d he asked, interested.</p><p>\u201cThomas Jefferson will say it\u2014on behalf of the new republic.

Will be called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll men,\u201d he repeated. \u201cDoes he mean Indians, as well, do ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say,\u201d I said, rather irritated at being forced into this position. \u201cI haven\u2019t met him. If I do, I\u2019ll ask, shall I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He lifted his fingers in brief dismissal. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him myself, and I have the opportunity. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll ask Brianna.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cThough as to principle, Sassenach\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, folded his arms over his chest, and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAs long as but a hundred of us remain alive,\u201d he said precisely, \u201cnever will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom\u2014for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Declaration of Arbroath,\u201d he said, opening his eyes. He gave me a lopsided smile. \u201cWritten some four hundred years ago. Speaking o\u2019 principles, aye?\u201d</p><p>He stood up then, but still remained standing by the battered table he used as a desk, looking down at Ashe\u2019s letter.</p> <p>\u201cAs for my own principles . . .\u201d he said, as though to himself, but then looked at me, as though suddenly realizing that I was still there.</p><p>\u201cAye, I think I mean to give Bird the muskets,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I may have cause to regret it, and I find them pointing at me, two or three years hence. But he shall have them, and do with them what seems best, to defend himself and his people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe price of honor, is it?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, with the ghost of a smile.</p><p>\u201cCall it blood money.\u201d</p><p>54</p> <p>FLORA MACDONALD\u2019S</p><p>BARBECUE</p><p>River Run Plantation</p><p>August 6, 1774</p><p>WHATEVER DID ONE SAY to an icon? Or an icon\u2019s husband, for that matter?</p><p>\u201cOh, I shall faint, I know I shall.\u201d Rachel Campbell was fluttering her fan hard enough to create a perceptible breeze. \u201cWhatever shall I say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Good day, Mrs. MacDonald\u2019?\u201d suggested her husband, a faint smile lurking at the corner of his withered mouth.</p><p>Rachel hit him sharply with her fan, making him chuckle as he dodged away. For all he was thirty-five years her senior, Farquard Campbell had an easy, teasing way with his wife, quite at odds with his usual dignified demeanor.</p> <p>\u201cI shall faint,\u201d Rachel declared again, having evidently decided upon this as a definite social strategy.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye must please yourself, of course, a nighean, but if ye do, it will have to be Mr. Fraser picking you up from the ground; my ancient limbs are scarcely equal to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Rachel cast a quick glance at Jamie, who smiled at her, then hid her blushes behind her fan. While plainly fond of her own husband, she made no secret of her admiration for mine.</p><p>\u201cYour humble servant, madam,\u201d Jamie gravely assured her, bowing.</p><p>She tittered. I shouldn\u2019t like to wrong the woman, but she definitely tittered. I caught Jamie\u2019s eye, and hid a smile behind my own fan.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you say to her, then, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>Jamie pursed his lips and squinted thoughtfully at the brilliant sun streaming through the elm trees that edged the lawn at River Run.</p><p>\u201cOh, I suppose I might say that I\u2019m glad the weather has kept fine for her. It was raining the last time we met.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s jaw dropped, and so did her fan, bouncing on the lawn. Her husband bent to pick it up for her, groaning audibly, but she had no attention to spare for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met her?\u201d she cried, eyes wide with excitement. \u201cWhen? Where? With the prin\u2014with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d Jamie said, smiling. \u201cOn Skye. I\u2019d gone wi\u2019 my father\u2014a matter of sheep, it was. We chanced to meet Hugh MacDonald of Armadale in Portree\u2014Miss Flora\u2019s stepfather, aye?\u2014and he\u2019d brought the lass into the town with him, for a treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Rachel was enchanted. \u201cAnd was she beautiful and gracious as they say?\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned, considering.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she\u2019d a terrible grippe at the time, and no doubt would have looked much improved without the red nose. Gracious? Well, I wouldna say so, really. She snatched a bridie right out of my hand and ate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how old were you both at the time?\u201d I asked, seeing Rachel\u2019s mouth sag in horror.</p><p>\u201cOh, six, maybe,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cOr seven. I doubt I should remember, save I kicked her in the shin when she stole my bridie, and she pulled my hair.\u201d</p><p>Recovering somewhat from the shock, Rachel was pressing Jamie for further reminiscences, a pressure he was laughingly deflecting with jokes.</p><p>Of course, he had come prepared to this occasion; all over the grounds, there were stories being exchanged\u2014humorous, admiring, longing\u2014of the days before Culloden. Odd, that it should have been the defeat of Charles Stuart, and his ignominious flight, that made a her**ne of Flora MacDonald and united these Highland exiles in a way that they could never have achieved\u2014let alone sustained\u2014had he actually won.</p><p>It struck me suddenly that Charlie was likely still alive, quietly drinking himself to death in Rome. In any real way, though, he was long since dead to these people who had loved or hated him. The amber of time had sealed him forever in that one defining moment of his life\u2014Bliadha Tearlach; \u201cCharlie\u2019s Year,\u201d it meant, and even now, I heard people call it that.</p><p>It was Flora\u2019s coming that was causing this flood of sentiment, of course. How strange for her, I thought, with a pang of sympathy\u2014and for the first time, wondered what on earth I might say to her myself.</p><p>I had met famous people before\u2014not the least of them the Bonnie Prince himself. But always before, I had met them when they\u2014and I\u2014were in the midst of their normal lives, not yet past the defining events that would make them famous, and thus still just people. Bar Louis\u2014but then, he was a king. There are rules of etiquette for dealing with kings, since after all, no one ever does approach them as normal people. Not even when\u2014</p><p>I snapped my own fan open, hot blood bursting through my face and body. I breathed deeply, trying not to fan quite as frantically as Rachel, but wanting to.</p><p>I had not once, in all the years since it happened, ever specifically recalled those two or three minutes of physical intimacy with Louis of France. Not deliberately, God knew, and not by accident, either.</p><p>Yet suddenly, the memory of it had touched me, as suddenly as a hand coming out of the crowd to seize my arm. Seize my arm, lift my skirts, and penetrate me in a way much more shockingly intrusive than the actual experience had been.</p><p>The air around me was suffused with the scent of roses, and I heard the creak of the dress cage as Louis\u2019s weight pressed upon it, and heard his sigh of pleasure. The room was dark, lit by one candle; it flickered at the edge of vision, then was blotted out by the man between my\u2014</p><p>\u201cChrist, Claire! Are ye all right?\u201d I hadn\u2019t actually fallen down, thank God. I had reeled back against the wall of Hector Cameron\u2019s mausoleum, and Jamie, seeing me go, had leapt forward to catch hold of me.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d I said, breathless, but imperative. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><p>He heard the note of terror in my voice, and slackened his grip, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to let go altogether, lest I fall. With the energy of sheer panic, I pulled myself upright, out of his grasp.</p><p>I still smelled roses. Not the cloying scent of rose oil\u2014fresh roses. Then I came to myself, and realized that I was standing next to a huge yellow brier rose, trained to climb over the white marble of the mausoleum.</p><p>Knowing that the roses were real was comforting, but I felt as though I stood still on the edge of a vast abyss, alone, separate from every other soul in the universe. Jamie was close enough to touch, and yet it was as though he stood an immeasurable distance away.</p><p>Then he touched me and spoke my name, insistently, and just as suddenly as it had opened, the gap between us closed. I nearly fell into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, a nighean?\u201d he whispered, holding me against his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s frightened ye?\u201d His own heart was thumping under my ear; I\u2019d scared him, too.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, and an overwhelming wave of relief went over me, at the realization that I was safely in the present; Louis had gone back into the shadows, an unpleasant but harmless memory once more. The staggering sense of violation, of loss and grief and isolation, had receded, no more than a shadow on my mind. Best of all, Jamie was there; solid and physical and smelling of sweat and whisky and horses . . . and there. I hadn\u2019t lost him.</p><p>Other people were clustering round, curious, solicitous. Rachel fanned me earnestly, and the breeze of it felt soothing; I was drenched with sweat, wisps of hair clinging damply to my neck.</p><p>\u201cQuite all right,\u201d I murmured, suddenly self-conscious. \u201cJust a bit faint . . . hot day . . .\u201d</p><p>A chorus of offers to fetch me wine, a glass of syllabub, lemon shrub, a burned feather, were all trumped by Jamie\u2019s production of a flask of whisky from his sporran. It was the three-year-old stuff, from the sherry casks, and I felt a qualm as the scent of it reached me, remembering the night we had got drunk together after he had rescued me from Hodgepile and his men. God, was I about to be hurled back into that pit?</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. The whisky was merely hot and consoling, and I felt better with the first sip.</p><p>Flashback. I\u2019d heard colleagues talk about it, arguing as to whether this was the same phenomenon as shell shock, and if it was, whether it truly existed, or should be dismissed as simply \u201cnerves.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered briefly, and took another sip. It most assuredly existed. I felt much better, but I had been shaken to the core, and my bones still felt watery. Beyond the faint echoes of the experience itself was a much more unsettling thought. It had happened once before, when Ute McGillivray attacked me. Was it likely to happen again?</p><p>\u201cShall I carry ye inside, Sassenach? Perhaps ye should lie down a bit.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had shooed away the well-wishers, had a slave fetch me a stool, and was now hovering over me like an anxious bumblebee.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m all right now,\u201d I assured him. \u201cJamie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014when you\u2014do you . . .\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath\u2014and another sip of whisky\u2014and tried again.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I wake up during the night and see you\u2014struggling\u2014and I think it\u2019s with Jack Randall. Is it a dream that you have?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at me for a moment, face blank, but trouble moving in his eyes. He glanced from side to side, but we were quite alone now.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, low-voiced.</p><p>\u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath, swallowed, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye. Sometimes it\u2019s dreams. That\u2019s . . . all right. I wake, and ken where I am, say a wee prayer, and . . . it\u2019s all right. But now and then\u2014\u201d He shut his eyes for a moment, then opened them. \u201cI am awake. And yet I am there, with Jack Randall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I sighed, feeling at once terribly sad for him, and at the same time somewhat reassured. \u201cThen I\u2019m not losing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe think so?\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m that glad to hear it, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>He stood very close, the cloth of his kilt brushing my arm, so that I should have him for support, if I suddenly went faint again. He looked searchingly at me, to be sure that I wasn\u2019t going to keel over, then touched my shoulder and with a brief \u201cSit still\u201d went off.</p><p>Not far; just to the tables set up under the trees at the edge of the lawn. Ignoring the slaves arranging food for the barbecue, he leaned across a platter of boiled crayfish and picked up something from a tiny bowl. Then he was back, leaning down to take my hand. He rubbed his fingers together, and a pinch of salt sprinkled into my open palm.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered. \u201cKeep it by ye, Sassenach. Whoever it is, he\u2019ll trouble ye no more.\u201d</p><p>I closed my hand over the damp grains, feeling absurdly comforted. Trust a Highlander to know precisely what to do about a case of daylight haunting! Salt, they said, kept a ghost in its grave. And if Louis was still alive, the other man, whoever he had been, that pressing weight in the dark, was surely dead.</p><p>There was a sudden rush of excitement, as a call came from the river\u2014the boat had been sighted. As one, the crowd drew itself up on tiptoe, breathless with anticipation.</p><p>I smiled, but felt the giddy contagion of it touch me nonetheless. Then the pipes began to skirl, and my throat at once was tight with unshed tears.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand tightened on my shoulder, unconsciously, and I looked up to see him rub his knuckles hard across his upper lip, as he, too, turned toward the river.</p><p>I looked down, blinking to control myself, and as my vision cleared, I saw the grains of salt on the ground, carefully scattered before the gates of the mausoleum.</p><p>SHE WAS MUCH SMALLER than I\u2019d thought. Famous people always are. Everyone\u2014dressed in their best, and an absolute sea of tartan\u2014pressed close, awed past courtesy. I caught a glimpse of the top of her head, dark hair dressed high with white roses, and then it disappeared behind the thronged backs of well-wishers.</p><p>Her husband, Allan, was visible. A stoutly handsome man with gray-streaked black hair tied neatly back, he was standing\u2014I assumed\u2014behind her, bowing and smiling, acknowledging the flood of Gaelic compliment and welcome.</p><p>Despite myself, I felt the urge to rush forward and stare, with everyone else. I held firm, though. I was standing with Jocasta on the terrace; Mrs. MacDonald would come to us.</p><p>Sure enough; Jamie and Duncan were pushing their way firmly through the crowd, forming a flying wedge with Jocasta\u2019s black butler, Ulysses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really her?\u201d Brianna murmured at my shoulder, eyes fixed with interest on the seething multitude, from which the men had now extracted the guest of honor, escorting her from the dock, up the lawn, toward the terrace. \u201cShe\u2019s smaller than I thought. Oh, it\u2019s too bad Roger isn\u2019t here\u2014he\u2019d just die to see her!\u201d Roger was spending a month at the Presbyterian Academy at Charlotte, having his qualifications for ordination examined.</p><p>\u201cHe may get to see her another time,\u201d I murmured back. \u201cI hear they\u2019ve bought a plantation near Barbecue Creek, by Mount Pleasant.\u201d And they would stay in the colony for at least another year or two, but I didn\u2019t say that out loud; so far as the people here knew, the MacDonalds had immigrated permanently.</p><p>But I had seen the tall memorial stone on Skye\u2014where Flora MacDonald had been born, and would someday die, disillusioned with America.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d met someone and known their fate, of course\u2014but it was always unsettling. The crowd opened and she stepped out, small and pretty, laughing up at Jamie. He had a hand under her elbow, guiding her up onto the terrace, and made a gesture of introduction toward me.</p><p>She looked up, expectant, met my gaze dead on, and blinked, her smile momentarily fading. It was back in an instant, and she was bowing to me and I to her, but I did wonder what she had seen in my face?</p><p>But she turned at once to greet Jocasta, and introduce her grown daughters, Anne and Fanny, a son, a son-in-law, her husband\u2014by the time she had accomplished the confusion of introduction, she was perfectly in command of herself, and greeted me with a charming, gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! I am so much obliged to meet you at last. I have heard such stories of your kindness and skill, I confess I am in awe to be in your presence.\u201d</p><p>It was said with so much warmth and sincerity\u2014she seizing me by the hands\u2014that I found myself responding, in spite of a cynical wonder as to who she\u2019d been talking to about me. My reputation in Cross Creek and Campbelton was notorious, but not universally lauded, by any means.</p><p>\u201cI had the honor of Dr. Fentiman\u2019s acquaintance at the subscription ball held for us in Wilmington\u2014so kind, so amazingly kind of everyone! We have been so well treated, since our arrival\u2014and he was quite in raptures regarding your\u2014\u201d</p><p>I should have liked to hear what had enraptured Fentiman\u2014our relations were still marked by a certain wariness, though we had reached a rapprochement\u2014but at this point, her husband spoke in her ear, desiring her to come and meet Farquard Campbell and some other prominent gentlemen, and with a regretful grimace, she squeezed my hands and departed, the brilliant public smile back in place.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Bree remarked, sotto voce. \u201cLucky for her she\u2019s still got most of her teeth.\u201d</p><p>That was in fact exactly what I\u2019d been thinking, and I laughed, converting it into a hasty coughing fit as I saw Jocasta\u2019s head turn sharply toward us.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s her.\u201d Young Ian had come up on my other side, and was watching the guest of honor with an expression of deep interest. He was dressed in kilt, waistcoat, and coat for the occasion, his brown hair done up in a proper queue, and he looked quite civilized, bar the tattoos that looped across his cheekbones and over the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Jamie agreed. \u201cFionnaghal\u2014the Fair One.\u201d There was a surprising note of nostalgia in his voice, and I glanced at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s her proper name,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cFionnaghal. It\u2019s only the English call her Flora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a crush on her when you were little, Da?\u201d Brianna asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tendresse,\u201d I said, batting my eyelashes delicately at him over my fan.</p><p>\u201cOch, dinna be daft!\u201d he said. \u201cI was seven years old, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Nonetheless, the tips of his ears had gone quite pink.</p><p>\u201cI was in love when I was seven,\u201d Ian remarked, rather dreamily. \u201cWi\u2019 the cook. Did ye hear Ulysses say as she\u2019s brought a looking glass, Uncle? Given to her by Prince Tearlach, with his arms upon the back. Ulysses put it in the parlor, wi\u2019 two of the grooms to stand guard over it.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, those people who weren\u2019t in the swirling crowd surrounding the MacDonalds were all pressing through the double doors into the house, forming a line of animated chatter down the hall to the parlor.</p><p>\u201cSeaumais!\u201d</p><p>Jocasta\u2019s imperious voice put a stop to the teasing. Jamie gave Brianna an austere look, and went to join her. Duncan was detained in conversation with a small knot of prominent men\u2014I recognized Neil Forbes, the lawyer, as well as Cornelius Harnett and Colonel Moore\u2014and Ulysses was nowhere in sight\u2014most likely dealing with the backstage logistics of a barbecue for two hundred people\u2014thus leaving Jocasta temporarily marooned. Her hand on Jamie\u2019s arm, she sailed off the terrace, heading for Allan MacDonald, who had become detached from his wife by the press of people round her, and was standing under a tree, looking vaguely affronted.</p><p>I watched them go across the lawn, amused by Jocasta\u2019s sense of theatrics. Her body servant, Phaedre, was dutifully following\u2014and could plainly have guided her mistress. That wouldn\u2019t have had at all the same effect, though. The two of them together made heads turn\u2014Jocasta tall and slender, graceful despite her age and striking with her white hair piled high and her blue silk gown, Jamie with his Viking height and crimson Fraser tartan, both with those bold MacKenzie bones and catlike grace.</p><p>\u201cColum and Dougal would be proud of their little sister,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Ian spoke absently, not attending. He was still watching Flora MacDonald, now accepting a bunch of flowers from one of Farquard Campbell\u2019s grandchildren, to general applause.</p><p>\u201cNot jealous, are you, Mama?\u201d Brianna teased, seeing me glance in the same direction.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d I said with a certain amount of complacence. \u201cAfter all, I have all my teeth, too.\u201d</p><p>I HAD MISSED HIM in the initial crush, but Major MacDonald was among the revelers, looking very flash in a brilliantly scarlet uniform coat and a new hat, lavish with gold lace. He removed this object and bowed low to me, looking cheerful\u2014no doubt because I was unaccompanied by livestock, Adso and the white sow being both safely on Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, mum,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw that ye had a word with Miss Flora\u2014so charming, is she not? And a canty, handsome woman, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed she is,\u201d I agreed. \u201cDo you know her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, a look of profound satisfaction spreading across his weathered face. \u201cI should not dare to the presumption of friendship\u2014but believe I may stake a modest claim to acquaintancy. I accompanied Mrs. MacDonald and her family from Wilmington, and have had the great honor to assist in settling them in their present situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really?\u201d I gave him an interested eye. The Major wasn\u2019t the type to be awed by celebrity. He was the type to appreciate its uses. So was Governor Martin, evidently.</p><p>The Major was watching Flora MacDonald now with a proprietary eye, noting with approval the way in which people clustered round her.</p><p>\u201cShe has most graciously agreed to speak today,\u201d he told me, rocking back a little on his bootheels. \u201cWhere would be the best place, do you think, mum? From the terrace, as being the point of highest elevation? Or perhaps near the statue on the lawn, as being more central and allowing the crowd to surround her, thus increasing the chance of everyone hearing her remarks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll have a sunstroke, if you put her out on the lawn in this weather,\u201d I said, tilting my own broad-brimmed straw hat to shade my nose. It was easily in the nineties, in terms both of temperature and humidity, and my thin petticoats clung soddenly to my lower limbs. \u201cWhat sort of remarks is she going to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a brief address upon the subject of loyalty, mum,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cAh, there is your husband, talking to Kingsburgh; if you\u2019ll excuse me, mum?\u201d Bowing, he straightened, put his hat back on, and strode down the lawn to join Jamie and Jocasta, who were still with Allan MacDonald\u2014styled \u201cKingsburgh,\u201d in the Scottish fashion, for the name of his estate on Skye.</p><p>Food was beginning to be brought out: tureens of powsowdie and hotchpotch\u2014and an enormous tub of soup \u00e0 la Reine, a clear compliment to the guest of honor\u2014platters of fried fish, fried chicken, fried rabbit; venison collops in red wine, smoked sausages, Forfar bridies, inky-pinky, roast turkeys, pigeon pie; dishes of colcannon, stovies, turnip purry, roasted apples stuffed with dried pumpkin, squash, corn, mushroom pasties; gigantic baskets overflowing with fresh baps, rolls, and other breads . . . all this, I was well aware, merely as prelude to the barbecue whose succulent aroma was drifting through the air: a number of hogs, three or four beeves, two deer, and, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a wood bison, acquired God knew how or where.</p><p>A hum of pleasant anticipation rose around me, as people began metaphorically to loosen their belts, squaring up to the tables with a firm determination to do their duty in honor of the occasion.</p><p>Jamie was still stuck fast to Mrs. MacDonald, I saw; he was helping her to a dish of what looked from the distance to be broccoli salad. He looked up and saw me, beckoned me to join them\u2014but I shook my head, gesturing with my fan toward the buffet tables, where the guests were setting to in the businesslike manner of grasshoppers in a barley field. I didn\u2019t want to lose the opportunity of inquiring about Manfred McGillivray, before the stupor of satiety settled over the crowd.</p><p>I made my way purposefully into the fray, accepting tidbits offered to me by assorted servants and slaves, pausing to chat with any acquaintance I saw, particularly those from Hillsboro. Manfred had spent a great deal of time there, I knew, taking commissions for guns, delivering the finished products, and doing small jobs of repair. That was the most likely place for him to go, I thought. But no one I talked to had seen him, though most knew him.</p><p>\u201cNice lad,\u201d one gentleman told me, pausing momentarily in his potations. \u201cAnd sore missed, too. Besides Robin, there\u2019s few gunsmiths closer than Virginia.\u201d</p><p>I knew that, and knowing, wondered whether Jamie was having any luck in locating the muskets he needed. Perhaps Lord John\u2019s smuggling connections would be necessary.</p><p>I accepted a small pie from a passing slave\u2019s tray, and wandered on, munching and chatting. There was much talk about a series of fiery articles that had appeared recently in the Chronicle, the local newspaper, whose proprietor, one Fogarty Simms, was spoken of with considerable sympathy.</p><p>\u201cA rare plucked \u2019un, is Simms,\u201d said Mr. Goodwin, shaking his head. \u201cBut I doubt me he\u2019ll stand. I spoke with him last week, and he told me he\u2019s in some fear of his skin. There\u2019ve been threats, aye?\u201d</p><p>From the tone of the gathering, I assumed that Mr. Simms must be a Loyalist, and this appeared to be true, from the various accounts I was given. There was talk, apparently, of a rival paper setting up, this to support the Whiggish agenda, with its incautious talk of tyranny and the overthrow of the King. No one knew quite who was behind the new venture, but there was talk\u2014and much indignation at the prospect\u2014that a printer was to be brought down from the north, where folk were notably given to such perverse sentiments.</p><p>The general consensus was that such persons wanted their backsides kicked, to bring them to their senses.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t sat down to eat formally, but after an hour of moving slowly through fields of champing jaws and wandering herds of hors d\u2019oeuvre trays, I felt as though I\u2019d sat through a French royal banquet\u2014those occasions lasting so long that chamber pots were discreetly placed beneath the guests\u2019 chairs, and where the occasional guest giving way and sliding beneath the table was discreetly ignored.</p><p>The present occasion was less formal, but not much less prolonged. After an hour\u2019s preliminary eating, the barbecue was raised steaming from the pits near the stable, and brought to the lawns on wooden trestles, mounted on the shoulders of slaves. The sight of immense sides of beef, pork, venison, and buffalo, gleaming with oil and vinegar and surrounded by the smaller charred carcasses of hundreds of pigeons and quail, was greeted with applause by the guests, all by this time drenched with the sweat of their efforts, but nothing daunted.</p><p>Jocasta, seated by her guest, looked deeply gratified by the sound of her hospitality being so warmly accepted, and leaned toward Duncan, smiling, putting a hand on his arm as she said something to him. Duncan had left off looking nervous\u2014the effect of a quart or two of beer, followed by most of a bottle of whisky\u2014and seemed to be enjoying himself, too. He smiled broadly at Jocasta, then essayed a remark to Mrs. MacDonald, who laughed at whatever he said.</p><p>I had to admire her; she was besieged on all sides by people wanting a word, but she kept her poise admirably, being kind and gracious to everyone\u2014though this meant sitting sometimes for ten minutes, a forkful of food suspended in air as she listened to some interminable story. At least she was in the shade\u2014and Phaedre, dressed in white muslin, stood dutifully behind her with a huge fan made of palmetto fronds, making a breeze and keeping off the flies.</p><p>\u201cLemon shrub, ma\u2019am?\u201d A wilting slave, gleaming with sweat, offered me yet another tray, and I took a glass. I was dripping with perspiration, my legs aching and my throat dried with talking. At this point, I didn\u2019t care what was in the glass, provided it was wet.</p><p>I changed my opinion instantly upon tasting it; it was lemon juice and barley water, and while it was wet, I was much more inclined to pour it down the neck of my gown than to drink it. I edged unobtrusively toward a laburnum bush, intending to pour the drink into it, but was forestalled by the appearance of Neil Forbes, who stepped out from behind it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was as startled to see me as I was to see him; he jerked back, and glanced hastily over his shoulder. I looked in the same direction, and caught sight of Robert Howe and Cornelius Harnett, making off in the opposite direction. Clearly, the three of them had been conferring secretly behind the laburnum bush.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, with a short bow. \u201cYour servant.\u201d</p><p>I curtsied in return, with a vague murmur of politeness. I would have slithered past him, but he leaned toward me, preventing my exit.</p><p>\u201cI hear that your husband is collecting guns, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, his voice at a low and rather unfriendly pitch.</p> <p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I was holding an open fan, as was every other woman there. I waved it languidly before my nose, hiding most of my expression. \u201cWho told you such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the gentlemen whom he approached to that end,\u201d Forbes said. The lawyer was large and somewhat overweight; the unhealthy shade of red in his cheeks might be due to that, rather than to displeasure. Then again . . .</p><p>\u201cIf I might impose so far upon your good nature, ma\u2019am, I would suggest that you exert your influence upon him, so as to suggest that such a course is not the wisest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo begin with,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath of hot, damp air, \u201cjust what course do you think he\u2019s embarked upon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate one, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting the best complexion upon the matter, I assume that the guns he seeks are intended to arm his own company of militia, which is legitimate, though disturbing; the desirability of that course would rest upon his later actions. But his relations with the Cherokee are well-known, and there are rumors about that the weapons are destined to end in the hands of the savages, to the end that they may turn upon His Majesty\u2019s subjects who presume to offer objection to the tyranny, abuse, and corruption so rife among the officials who govern\u2014if so loose a word may be employed to describe their actions\u2014this colony.\u201d</p> <p>I gave him a long look over the edge of my fan.</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t already known you were a lawyer,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat speech would have done it. I think that you just said that you suspect my husband of wanting to give guns to the Indians, and you don\u2019t like that. On the other hand, if he\u2019s wanting to arm his own militia, that might be all right\u2014providing that said militia acts according to your desires. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of amusement showed in his deep-set eyes, and he inclined his head toward me in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cYour perception astounds me, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded, and shut the fan.</p><p>\u201cRight. And what are your desires, may I ask? I won\u2019t ask why you think Jamie ought to take heed of them.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, his heavy face, already flushed with the heat, going a deeper shade of red beneath his neat tie-wig.</p><p>\u201cI desire justice, ma\u2019am; the downfall of tyrants and the cause of liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cAs must any honest man.\u201d</p><p>. . . freedom alone\u2014which any honest man surrenders only with his life. The line echoed in my head, and must have shown on my face, for he looked keenly at me.</p><p>\u201cI esteem your husband deeply, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou will tell him what I have said?\u201d He bowed and turned away, not waiting for my nod.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t guarded his voice when speaking of tyrants and liberty; I saw heads nearby turn, and here and there, men drew together, murmuring as they watched him go.</p><p>Distracted, I took a mouthful of lemon shrub, and was then obliged to swallow the nasty stuff. I turned to find Jamie; he was still near Allan MacDonald, but had moved a little aside, and was in private conversation with Major MacDonald.</p><p>Things were moving faster than I had thought. I had thought republican sentiment was still a minority in this part of the colony, but for Forbes to speak so openly in a public gathering, it was obviously gaining ground.</p><p>I turned back to look after the lawyer, and saw two men confront him, their faces tight with anger and suspicion. I was too far away to hear what was said, but their postures and expressions were eloquent. Words were exchanged, growing in heat, and I glanced toward Jamie; the last time I had attended a barbecue like this at River Run, in the prelude to the War of the Regulation, there had been a fistfight on the lawn, and I rather thought such an occurrence might be about to happen again. Alcohol, heat, and politics made for explosions of temper in any gathering, let alone one composed largely of Highlanders.</p> <p>Such an explosion might have happened\u2014more men were gathering round Forbes and his two opponents, fists curling in readiness\u2014had the boom of Jocasta\u2019s large gong not sounded from the terrace, making everyone look up in startlement.</p><p>The Major was standing on an upturned tobacco hogshead, hands raised in the air, beaming at the multitudes, face shining red with heat, beer, and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cCeud mile f\u00e0ilte!\u201d he called, and was greeted by enthusiastic applause. \u201cAnd we wish a hundred thousand welcomes to our honored guests!\u201d he continued in Gaelic, sweeping a hand toward the MacDonalds, who were now standing side by side near him, nodding and smiling at the applause. From their demeanor, I rather thought they were accustomed to this sort of reception.</p><p>A few more introductory remarks\u2014half-drowned in the enthusiastic cheers\u2014and Jamie and Kingsburgh lifted Mrs. MacDonald carefully up onto the barrel, where she swayed a little, but regained her balance, grabbing the heads of both men for stability, and smiling at the laughter of the audience.</p><p>She beamed at the crowd, who beamed back, en masse, and immediately quieted themselves in order to hear her.</p><p>She had a clear, high voice, and was obviously accustomed to speaking in public\u2014a most unusual attribute in a woman of the time. I was too far away to hear every word, but had no trouble picking up the gist of her speech.</p><p>After graciously thanking her hosts, the Scottish community who had welcomed her family so warmly and generously, and the guests, she commenced an earnest exhortation against what she called \u201cfactionalism,\u201d urging her hearers to join in suppressing this dangerous movement, which could not but cause great unrest, threatening the peace and prosperity that so many of them had achieved in this fair land, they having risked everything to attain it.</p><p>And she was, I realized with a small shock, exactly right. I\u2019d heard Bree and Roger arguing the point\u2014why any of the Highlanders, who had suffered so much under English rule, should have fought on the English side, as many of them eventually would.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Roger had said patiently, \u201cthey had something to lose, and damn little to gain. And\u2014of all people\u2014they knew exactly what it was like to fight against the English. Ye think folk who lived through Cumberland\u2019s cleansing of the Highlands, made it to America, and rebuilt their lives from nothing were eager to live through all that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely they\u2019ll want to fight for freedom,\u201d Bree had protested. He looked at her cynically.</p><p>\u201cThey have freedom, a great deal more than they\u2019ve ever seen in Scotland. They risk losing it in the event of a war\u2014and they know that very well. And then, of course,\u201d he\u2019d added, \u201cnearly all of them have sworn an oath of loyalty to the Crown. They\u2019d not break it lightly, surely not for something that looked like one more wild-eyed\u2014and doubtless short-lived\u2014political upheaval. It\u2019s like\u2014\u201d His brow had furrowed as he looked for a suitable analogy.</p><p>\u201cLike the Black Panthers, or the civil-rights movement. Anyone could see the idealistic point\u2014but a lot of middle-class people found the whole thing threatening or frightening and just wished it would go away, so life could be peaceful.\u201d</p><p>The trouble, of course, was that life never was peaceful\u2014and this particular wild-eyed movement wasn\u2019t going to go away. I could see Brianna on the far side of the crowd, eyes narrowed in thoughtful speculation as she listened to Flora MacDonald\u2019s high, clear voice, talking of the virtues of loyalty.</p><p>I heard a low sort of \u201cHmph!\u201d just to the side, behind me, and turning, saw Neil Forbes, his heavy features set in disapproval. He had reinforcements now, I saw; three or four other gentlemen stood close beside him, glancing to and fro but trying not to look as though they were. Gauging the mood of the crowd, I thought they were outnumbered by roughly two hundred to one, and the two hundred were growing steadily more entrenched in their opinions as the drink took hold and the speech went on.</p><p>Looking away, I caught sight again of Brianna, and realized that she was now looking at Neil Forbes, too\u2014and he was looking back. Both taller than the people around them, they stared at each other over the heads of the intervening crowd, he with animosity, she with aloofness. She had rejected his suit a few years before, and had done so without tact. Forbes certainly hadn\u2019t been in love with her\u2014but he was a man with a fair degree of self-esteem, and not the sort to suffer such a public slight with philosophical resignation.</p><p>Brianna turned away, coolly, as though she had taken no notice of him, and spoke to the woman beside her. I heard him grunt again, say something in a low tone to his compatriots\u2014and then the knot of them were leaving, rudely turning their backs on Mrs. MacDonald, who was still speaking.</p><p>Gasps and murmurs of indignation followed them, as they shoved their way through the thick-packed crowd, but no one offered to stop them, and the offense of their leaving was drowned by the outburst of prolonged applause that greeted the conclusion of the speech\u2014this accompanied by the starting up of bagpipes, the random firing of pistols into the air, organized cheering of \u201cHip, hip, huzzay!\u201d led by Major MacDonald, and such a general hullabaloo that no one would have noticed the arrival of an army, let alone the departure of a few disaffected Whigs.</p><p>I found Jamie in the shade of Hector\u2019s mausoleum, combing out his hair with his fingers, preparatory to retying it.</p><p>\u201cThat went with a bang, didn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of them,\u201d he said, keeping a wary eye on one obviously inebriated gentleman in the act of trying to reload his musket. \u201cWatch that man, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too late to shoot Neil Forbes. Did you see him leave?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, deftly knotting the leather thong at his nape.</p><p>\u201cHe couldna have come much closer to an open declaration, save he\u2019d got up on the barrel next to Fionnaghal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would have made him an excellent target.\u201d I squinted at the red-faced gentleman, presently spilling gunpowder on his shoes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then.\u201d Jamie dismissed him with a wave of the hand. \u201cMajor MacDonald\u2019s in rare form, no? He told me he\u2019s arranged for Mrs. MacDonald to give such speeches here and there about the colony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith himself as impresario, I take it.\u201d I could just catch the gleam of MacDonald\u2019s red coat among the press of well-wishers on the terrace.</p><p>\u201cI daresay.\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t seem pleased at the prospect. In fact, he seemed rather sober, his face shadowed by dark thoughts. His mood would not be improved by hearing about my conversation with Neil Forbes, but I told him anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, it couldna be helped,\u201d he said with a small shrug. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to keep the matter quiet, but wi\u2019 things as they are wi\u2019 Robin McGillivray, I\u2019ve no real choice save to ask where I may, though that lets the matter be known. And talked about.\u201d He moved again, restless.</p><p>\u201cAre ye well, Sassenach?\u201d he asked suddenly, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you aren\u2019t. What is it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s nothing. Nothing I didna ken already. But it\u2019s different, no? Ye think ye\u2019re ready, and then ye meet it face to face, and would give anything to have it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He looked out at the lawn, lifting his chin to point at the crowd. A sea of tartan flowed across the grass, the ladies\u2019 parasols raised against the sun, a field of brightly colored flowers. In the shade of the terrace, a piper played on, the sound of his piobreachd a thin, piercing descant to the hum of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI kent I should have to stand one day against a good many of them, aye? To fight friends and kin. But then I found myself standing there, wi\u2019 Fionnaghal\u2019s hand upon my head like a blessing, face to face wi\u2019 them all, and watching her words fall upon them, see the resolve growing in them . . . and all of a sudden, it was as though a great blade had come down from heaven between them and me, to cleave us forever apart. The day is coming\u2014and I can not stop it.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, and looked down, away from me. I reached out to him, wanting to help, wanting to ease him\u2014and knowing that I couldn\u2019t. It was, after all, by my doing that he found himself here, in this small Gethsemane.</p><p>Nonetheless, he took my hand, not looking at me, and squeezed it hard, so the bones pressed together.</p><p>\u201cLord, that this cup might pass from me?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He nodded, his gaze still resting on the ground, the fallen petals of the yellow roses. Then he looked at me, with a small smile but such pain in his eyes that I caught my breath, stricken to the heart.</p><p>Still, he smiled, and wiping his hand across his forehead, examined his wet fingers.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only water, not blood. I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps you won\u2019t, I thought suddenly, appalled. To fight on the winning side was one thing; to survive, quite another.</p><p>He saw the look on my face, and released the pressure on my hand, thinking he was hurting me. He was, but not physically.</p><p>\u201cBut not my will be done, but Thine,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cI chose my way when I wed ye, though I kent it not at the time. But I chose, and cannot now turn back, even if I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d I looked into his eyes as I asked, and read the answer there. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWould you? For you have chosen, as much as I.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, as well, and felt the small relaxation of his body as his eyes met mine, clear now as the brilliant sky. For the space of a heartbeat, we stood alone together in the universe. Then a knot of chattering girls drifted within earshot, and I changed the subject to something safer.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about poor Manfred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Manfred, is it?\u201d he gave me a cynical look.</p><p>\u201cWell, he may be an immoral young hound, and have caused any amount of trouble\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he ought to die for it.\u201d</p><p>He looked as though he might not be in complete agreement with this sentiment, but let the matter lie, saying merely that he\u2019d asked, but so far without result.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up, though,\u201d he assured me. \u201cLikely in the most inconvenient place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh! Oh! That I should live to see such a day! I thank ye, sir, thank ye indeed!\u201d It was Mrs. Bug, flushed with heat, beer, and happiness, fanning herself fit to burst. Jamie smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cSo, were ye able to hear everything, then, mo chridhe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed I was, sir!\u201d she assured him fervently. \u201cEvery word! Arch found me a lovely place, just by one of they tubs o\u2019 wee flowers, where I could hear and not be trampled.\u201d She had nearly died of excitement when Jamie had offered to bring her down to the barbecue. Arch was coming, of course, and would go on to do errands in Cross Creek, but Mrs. Bug hadn\u2019t been off the Ridge since their arrival several years before.</p><p>Despite my disquiet over the profoundly Loyalist atmosphere that surrounded us, her bubbling delight was infectious, and I found myself smiling, Jamie and myself taking it in turns to answer her questions: she hadn\u2019t seen black slaves close-to before, and thought them exotically beautiful\u2014did they cost a great deal? And must they be taught to wear clothes and speak properly? For she had heard that Africa was a heathen place where folk went entirely nak*d and killed one another with spears, like as one would do with a boar, and if one wanted to speak of nak*d, that statue of the soldier laddie on the lawn was shocking, did we not think? And him wi\u2019 not a stitch behind his shield! And whyever was that woman\u2019s heid at his feet? And had I looked\u2014her hair was made to look as if \u2019twere snakes, of all horrid things! And who was Hector Cameron, whose tomb this was?\u2014and made all of white marble, same as the tombs in Holyrood, imagine! Oh, Mrs. Innes\u2019s late husband? And when had she married Mr. Duncan, whom she had met, and such a sweet, kind-eyed man as he was, such a shame as he had lost his arm, was that in a battle of some type? And\u2014oh, look! Mrs. MacDonald\u2019s husband\u2014and a fine figure of man he was, too\u2014was going to talk, as well!</p><p>Jamie gave the terrace a bleak look. Sure enough, Allan MacDonald was stepping up\u2014merely onto a stool; no doubt the hogshead seemed extreme\u2014and a number of people\u2014far fewer than had attended his wife, but a respectable number\u2014were clustering round attentively.</p><p>\u201cWill ye no come and hear him?\u201d Mrs. Bug was already in flight, hovering above the ground like a hummingbird.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear well enough from here,\u201d Jamie assured her. \u201cYou go along then, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>She bumbled off, buzzing with excitement. Jamie gingerly touched both hands to his ears, testing to be sure they were still attached.</p><p>\u201cIt was kind of you to bring her,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cThe dear old thing probably hasn\u2019t had such fun in half a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cShe likely\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly, frowning as he caught sight of something over my shoulder. I turned to look, but he was already moving past me, and I hurried to catch up.</p><p>It was Jocasta, white as milk, and disheveled in a way I had never seen her. She swayed unsteadily in the side doorway, and might have fallen, had Jamie not come up and taken quick hold of her, one arm about her waist to support her.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Auntie. What\u2019s amiss?\u201d He spoke quietly, not to draw attention, and was moving her back inside the house even as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, oh, merciful God, my head,\u201d she whispered, hand spread over her face like a spider, so that her fingers barely touched the skin, cupping her left eye. \u201cMy eye.\u201d</p><p>The linen blindfold that she wore in public was creased and blotched with moisture; tears were leaking out from under it, but she wasn\u2019t crying. Lacrimation: one eye was watering terribly. Both eyes were tearing, but much worse on the left; the edge of the linen was soaked, and wetness shone on that cheek.</p><p>\u201cI need to look at her eye,\u201d I said to Jamie, touching his elbow, and looking round in vain for any of the servants. \u201cGet her to her sitting room.\u201d That was closest, and all the guests were either outside or traipsing through the parlor to see the Prince\u2019s looking glass.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It was almost a scream. \u201cNo, not there!\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at me, one brow raised in puzzlement, but spoke soothingly to her.</p><p>\u201cNay, Auntie, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll bring ye to your own chamber. Come, then.\u201d He stooped, and lifted her in his arms as though she were a child, her silk skirts falling over his arm with the sound of rushing water.</p><p>\u201cTake her; I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d I\u2019d spotted the slave named Angelina passing through the far end of the hall, and hurried to catch her up. I gave my orders, then rushed back toward the stairs\u2014pausing momentarily to glance into the small sitting room as I did so.</p><p>There was no one there, though the presence of scattered punch cups and the strong scent of pipe tobacco indicated that Jocasta had likely been holding court there earlier. Her workbasket stood open, some half-knitted garment dragged out and left to dangle carelessly down the side like a dead rabbit.</p><p>Children perhaps, I thought; several balls of thread had been pulled out, too, and lay scattered on the parquet floor, trailing their colors. I hesitated\u2014but instinct was too much for me, and I hastily scooped up the balls of thread and dropped them back into the workbasket. I stuffed the knitting in on top, but jerked my hand back with an exclamation.</p><p>A small gash on the side of my thumb was welling blood. I put it in my mouth and sucked hard to apply pressure to the wound; meanwhile, I groped more cautiously in the depths of the basket with my other hand, to see what had cut me.</p><p>A knife, small but businesslike. Likely used to cut embroidery threads; there was a tooled-leather sheath for it, loose in the bottom of the basket. I slipped the knife back into its sheath, seized the needle case I\u2019d come for, and closed the folding tabletop of the workbasket before hurrying for the stairs.</p><p>Allan MacDonald had finished his brief speech; there was a loud clatter of applause outside, with shouts and whoops of Gaelic approval.</p><p>\u201cBloody Scots,\u201d I muttered under my breath. \u201cDon\u2019t they ever learn?\u201d</p><p>But I hadn\u2019t time to consider the implications of the MacDonalds\u2019 rabble-rousing. By the time I reached the top of the stair, one slave was close behind me, puffing under the weight of my medicine box, and another was at the bottom, starting more cautiously up with a pan of hot water from the kitchen.</p><p>Jocasta was bent double in her big chair, moaning, lips pressed into invisibility. Her cap had come off and both hands moved restlessly to and fro through her disordered hair, as though looking helplessly for something to seize. Jamie was stroking her back, murmuring to her in Gaelic; he looked up with obvious relief as I came in.</p><p>I had long suspected that the cause of Jocasta\u2019s blindness was glaucoma\u2014rising pressure inside the eyeball that if untreated eventually damages the optic nerve. Now I was quite sure of it. More than that, I knew what form of the disease she had; she was plainly having an acute attack of closed-angle glaucoma, the most dangerous type.</p><p>There was no treatment for glaucoma now; the condition itself wouldn\u2019t be recognized for some time. Even if there had been, it was far too late; her blindness was permanent. There was, however, something I could do about the immediate situation\u2014and I was afraid I\u2019d have to.</p><p>\u201cPut some of this to steep,\u201d I said to Angelina, grabbing the jar of goldenseal from my box and thrusting it into her hands. \u201cAnd you\u201d\u2014I turned to the other slave, a man whose name I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201cset the water to boil again, fetch me some clean rags, and put them in the water.\u201d</p><p>Even as I talked, I\u2019d got out the tiny spirit lamp I carried in my case. The fire had been allowed to burn down on the hearth, but there were still live coals; I bent and lit the wick, then opened the needle case I\u2019d taken from the sitting room and abstracted the largest needle in it, a three-inch length of steel, used for mending carpets.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Jamie began, then broke off, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d I said briefly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else. Hold her hands.\u201d</p><p>He was nearly as pale as Jocasta, but he nodded and took hold of the clutching fingers, pulling her hands gently away from her head.</p><p>I lifted away the linen bandage. The left eye bulged noticeably beneath its lid, vividly bloodshot. Tears welled up round it and overflowed in a constant stream. I could feel the pressure inside the eyeball, even without touching it, and clenched my teeth in revulsion.</p><p>No help for it. With a quick prayer to Saint Clare\u2014who was, after all, patroness of sore eyes, as well as my own patron saint\u2014I ran the needle through the flame of the lamp, poured pure alcohol onto a rag, and wiped the soot from the needle.</p><p>Swallowing a sudden excess of saliva, I spread the eyelids of the affected eye apart with one hand, commended my soul to God, and shoved the needle hard into the sclera of the eye, near the edge of the iris.</p><p>There was a cough and a splattering on the floor nearby, and the stink of vomit, but I had no attention to spare. I withdrew the needle carefully, though as fast as I could. Jocasta had stiffened abruptly, frozen stiff, hands clawed over Jamie\u2019s. She didn\u2019t move at all, but made small, shocked panting sounds, as though afraid to move enough even to breathe.</p><p>There was a trickle of fluid from the eye, vitreous humor, faintly cloudy, just thick enough to be distinguishable as it flowed sluggishly across the wet surface of the sclera. I was still holding the eyelids apart; I plucked a rag from the goldenseal tea with my free hand, squeezed out the excess liquid, careless of where it went, and touched it gently to her face. Jocasta gasped at the touch of the warmth on her skin, pulled her hands free, and grasped at it.</p><p>I let go then, and allowed her to seize the warm rag, pressing it against her closed left eye, the heat of it some relief.</p><p>Light feet pounded up the stairs again, and down the hall; Angelina, panting, a handful of salt clutched to her bosom, a spoon in her other hand. I brushed the salt from her damp palm into the pan of warm water, and set her to stir it while it dissolved.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring laudanum?\u201d I asked her quietly. Jocasta was lying back in her chair, eyes closed\u2014but rigid as a statue, her eyelids squeezing tight, fists clenched in knots on her knees.</p><p>\u201cI couldna find the laudanum, missus,\u201d Angelina murmured to me, with a frightened glance at Jocasta. \u201cI dinna ken who could be takin\u2019 it\u2014hain\u2019t nobody got the key but Mr. Ulysses and Miz Cameron herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUlysses let you into the simples closet, then\u2014so he knows that Mrs. Cameron is ill?\u201d</p><p>She nodded vigorously, setting the ribbon on her cap a-flutter.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, missus! He be bleezin\u2019, if he find out and I hain\u2019t told him. He say come fetch him quick, she want him\u2014otherwise, I tell Miz Cameron she hain\u2019t to worry none, he take care every single thing.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta let out a long sigh at this, her clenched fists relaxing a little.</p><p>\u201cGod bless the man,\u201d she murmured, eyes closed. \u201cHe will take care of everything. I should be lost without him. Lost.\u201d</p><p>Her white hair was soaked at the temples, and sweat dripped from the ends of the tendrils that lay over her shoulder, making spots on the dark blue silk of her gown.</p><p>Angelina unlaced Jocasta\u2019s gown and stays and got them off. Then I had Jamie lay her down on the bed in her shift, with a thick layer of towels tucked round her head. I filled one of my rattlesnake syringes with the warm salt water, and with Jamie gingerly holding the lids of her eye apart, I was able to gently irrigate the eye, in hopes of perhaps preventing infection to the puncture wound. The wound itself showed as a tiny scarlet spot on the sclera, a small conjunctival bleb above it. Jamie couldn\u2019t look at it without blinking, I saw, and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can go, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, turning to go, but Jocasta\u2019s hand shot out to stop him.</p><p>\u201cNo, be staying, a chuisle\u2014if ye will.\u201d This last was strictly for form\u2019s sake; she had him clutched by the sleeve, hard enough to turn her fingers white.</p><p>\u201cAye, Auntie, of course,\u201d he said mildly, and put his hand over hers, squeezing in reassurance. Still, she didn\u2019t let go until he had sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cWho else is there?\u201d she asked, turning her head fretfully from side to side, trying to hear the telltale sounds of breathing and movement that would inform her. \u201cHave the slaves gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019ve gone back to help with the serving,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s only me and Jamie left.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and drew a deep, shuddering breath, only then beginning to relax a little.</p><p>\u201cGood. I must tell ye a thing, Nephew, and no one else must hear. Niece\u201d\u2014she lifted a long white hand toward me\u2014\u201cgo and be seeing as we\u2019re truly alone.\u201d</p><p>I went obediently to look out into the hall. No one was visible, though there were voices coming from a room down the hall\u2014laughter, and tremendous rustlings and thumpings, as young women chattered and rearranged their hair and clothing. I pulled my head back in and closed the door, and the sounds from the rest of the house receded at once, muffled into a distant rumble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it, then, Auntie?\u201d Jamie was still holding her hand, one big thumb gently stroking the back of it, over and over, in the soothing rhythm I\u2019d seen him use on skittish animals. It was less effective on his aunt than on the average horse or dog, though.</p><p>\u201cIt was him. He\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Her eyes rolled desperately to and fro, as though in a vain attempt to see through not only darkness, but walls, as well.</p> <p>Jamie raised his brows at me, but he could see as well as I that she wasn\u2019t raving, incoherent as she sounded. She realized what she sounded like; I could see the effort in her face as she pulled herself together.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come for the gold,\u201d she said, lowering her voice. \u201cThe Frenchman\u2019s gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Jamie said cautiously. He darted a glance at me, one eyebrow raised, but I shook my head. She wasn\u2019t having hallucinations.</p><p>Jocasta sighed with impatience and shook her head, then stopped abruptly, with a muffled \u201cOch!\u201d of pain, putting both hands to her head as though to keep it on her shoulders.</p><p>She breathed deeply for a moment or two, her lips pressed tight together. Then she slowly lowered her hands.</p> <p>\u201cIt started last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pain in my eye.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d waked in the night to a throbbing in her eye, a dull pain that spread slowly to the side of her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s come before, ken,\u201d she explained. She had pushed herself up to a sitting position now, and was beginning to look a little better, though she still held the warm cloth to her eye. \u201cIt began when I started to lose my sight. Sometimes it would be one eye, sometimes both. But I kent what was coming.\u201d</p><p>But Jocasta MacKenzie Cameron Innes was not a woman to allow mere bodily indisposition to interfere with her plans, let alone interrupt what promised to be the most scintillating social affair in Cross Creek\u2019s history.</p><p>\u201cI was that disgusted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here Miss Flora MacDonald coming!\u201d</p><p>But the arrangements had all been made; the barbecued carcasses were roasting in their pits, hogsheads of ale and beer stood ready by the stables, and the air was full of the fragrance of hot bread and beans from the cookhouse. The slaves were well-trained, and she had full faith that Ulysses would manage everything. All she must do, she\u2019d thought, was to stay on her feet.</p> <p>\u201cI didna want to take opium or laudanum,\u201d she explained. \u201cOr I\u2019d fall asleep for sure. So I made do wi\u2019 the whisky.\u201d</p><p>She was a tall woman, and thoroughly accustomed to an intake of liquor that would have felled a modern man. By the time the MacDonalds arrived, she\u2019d had the better part of a bottle\u2014but the pain was getting worse.</p><p>\u201cAnd then my eye began to water so fierce, everyone would ha\u2019 seen something was wrong, and I didna want that. So I came into my sitting room; I\u2019d taken care to put a wee bottle of laudanum in my workbasket, in case the whisky should be not enough.</p><p>\u201cFolk were swarming thick as lice outside, trying to catch a glimpse or a word with Miss MacDonald, but the sitting room was deserted, so far as I could tell, what wi\u2019 my head pounding and my eye fit to explode.\u201d She said this last quite casually, but I saw Jamie flinch, the memory of what I\u2019d done with the needle obviously still fresh. He swallowed and wiped his knuckles hard across his mouth.</p><p>Jocasta had quickly abstracted the bottle of laudanum, swallowed a few gulps, and then sat for a moment, waiting for it to take effect.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken if ye\u2019ve ever had the stuff, Nephew, but it gives ye an odd feeling, as though ye might be starting to dissolve at the edges. Take a drop too much, and ye begin to see things that aren\u2019t there\u2014blind or not\u2014and hear them, too.\u201d</p><p>Between the effects of laudanum and liquor and the noise of the crowd outside, she hadn\u2019t noticed footsteps, and when the voice spoke near her, she\u2019d thought for a moment that it was a hallucination.</p><p>\u201c\u2018So here ye are, lass,\u2019 he said,\u201d she quoted, and her face, already pale, blanched further at the memory. \u201c\u2018Remember me, do ye?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI take it ye did, Aunt?\u201d Jamie asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she replied just as dryly. \u201cI\u2019d heard that voice twice before. Once at the Gathering where your daughter was wed\u2014and once more than twenty years ago, in an inn near Coigach, in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the wet cloth from her face and put it unerringly back into the bowl of warm water. Her eyes were red and swollen, raw against the pale skin, and looking terribly vulnerable in their blindness\u2014but she had command of herself once more.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did ken him,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>She had recognized the voice at once as one known\u2014but for a moment, could not place it. Then realization had struck her, and she had clutched the arm of her chair for support.</p><p>\u201cWho are ye?\u201d she\u2019d demanded, with what force she could summon. Her heart was pounding in time to the throbbing in her head and eye, and her senses swimming in whisky and laudanum. Perhaps it was the laudanum that seemed to transform the sound of the crowd outside into the sound of a nearby sea, the noise of a slave\u2019s footsteps in the hall to the thump of the landlord\u2019s clogs on the stairs of the inn.</p><p>\u201cI was there. Truly there.\u201d Despite the sweat that still ran down her face, I saw gooseflesh pebble the pale skin of her shoulders. \u201cIn the inn at Coigach. I smelt the sea, and I heard the men\u2014Hector and Dougal\u2014I could hear them! Arguing together, somewhere behind me. And the man wi\u2019 the mask\u2014I could see him,\u201d she said, and a ripple went up the back of my own neck as she turned her blind eyes toward me. She spoke with such conviction that for an instant, it seemed she did see.</p><p>\u201cStanding at the foot of the stair, just as he\u2019d been twenty-five years ago, a knife in his hand and his eyes upon me through the holes in his mask.\u201d</p><p>And, \u201cYe ken well enough who I am, lass,\u201d he\u2019d said, and she had seemed to see his smile, though dimly she had known she only heard it in his voice; she\u2019d never seen his face, even when she had her sight.</p><p>She was sitting up, half doubled over, arms crossed over her breast as though in self-defense and her white hair wild and tangled down her back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come back,\u201d she said, and shook with a sudden convulsive shudder. \u201cHe\u2019s come for the gold\u2014and when he finds it, he will kill me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laid a hand on her arm, in an attempt to calm her.</p><p>\u201cNo one will kill ye while I\u2019m here, Aunt,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this man came to ye in your sitting room, and ye kent him from his voice. What else did he say to ye?\u201d</p><p>She was still shivering, but not so badly. I thought it was as much reaction to massive amounts of laudanum and whisky as from fear.</p><p>She shook her head in the effort of recollection.</p><p>\u201cHe said\u2014he said he had come to take the gold to its rightful owner. That we\u2019d held it in trust, and while he didna grudge me what we\u2019d spent of it, Hector and me\u2014it wasna mine, had never been mine. I should tell him where it was, and he would see to the rest. And then he put his hand on me.\u201d She ceased clutching herself, and held out one arm toward Jamie. \u201cOn my wrist. D\u2019ye see the marks there? D\u2019ye see them, Nephew?\u201d She sounded anxious, and it occurred to me suddenly that she might doubt the existence of the visitor herself.</p><p>\u201cAye, Auntie,\u201d Jamie said softly, touching her wrist. \u201cThere are marks.\u201d</p><p>There were; three purplish smudges, small ovals where fingers had gripped.</p><p>\u201cHe squeezed, and then twisted my wrist so hard I thought it had snapped. Then he let go, but he didna step back. He stayed over me, and I could feel the heat of his breath and the stink of tobacco on my face.\u201d</p><p>I had hold of her other wrist, feeling the pulse beat there. It was strong and rapid, but every once in a while would skip a beat. Hardly surprising. I did wonder how often she took laudanum\u2014and how much.</p><p>\u201cSo I reached down into my workbasket, took my wee knife from its sheath, and went for his balls,\u201d she concluded.</p><p>Taken by surprise, Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid ye get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did,\u201d I said, before Jocasta could answer. \u201cI saw dried blood on the knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that will teach him to terrorize a helpless blind woman, won\u2019t it?\u201d Jamie patted her hand. \u201cYe did well, Auntie. Did he go, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d The recounting of her success had steadied her a lot; she pulled her hand from my grip, in order to push herself up straighter against the pillows. She pulled away the towel still draped around her neck, and dropped it on the floor with a brief grimace of distaste.</p><p>Seeing that she was plainly feeling better, Jamie glanced at me, then rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see is anyone limping about the place, then.\u201d At the door, he paused, though, turning back to Jocasta.</p><p>\u201cAuntie. Ye said ye\u2019d met this fellow twice before? At the inn in Coigach where the men brought the gold ashore\u2014and at the Gathering four years ago?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, brushing back the damp hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cI did. \u2019Twas on the last day. He came into my tent, while I was alone. I kent someone was there, though he didna speak at first, and I asked who was it? He gave a bit of a laugh, then, and said, \u2018It\u2019s true what they said, then\u2014you\u2019re blind entirely?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She had stood up, facing the invisible visitor, recognizing the voice, but not quite knowing yet why.</p><p>\u201c\u2018So ye dinna ken me, Mrs. Cameron? I was a friend to your husband\u2014though it\u2019s been a good many years since last we met. On the coast of Scotland\u2014on a moonlicht nicht.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She licked dry lips at the memory.</p><p>\u201cSo then it came to me, all on the sudden. And I said, \u2018Blind I may be, but I ken ye well, sir. What d\u2019ye want?\u2019 But he was gone. And the next instant, I heard Phaedre and Ulysses talking as they came toward the tent; he\u2019d seen them, and fled away. I asked them, but they\u2019d been ta\u2019en up wi\u2019 their arguing, and hadna seen him leave. I kept someone by me all the time, then, until we left\u2014and he didna come near me again. Until now.\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned and rubbed a knuckle slowly down the long, straight bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhy did ye not tell me then?\u201d</p><p>A trace of humor touched her ravaged face, and she wrapped her fingers round her injured wrist.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was imagining things.\u201d</p><p>PHAEDRE HAD FOUND the bottle of laudanum where Jocasta had dropped it, under her chair in the sitting room. Likewise, a trail of tiny blood spots that I had missed in my hurry. These disappeared before reaching the door, though; whatever wound Jocasta had inflicted on the intruder had been minor.</p><p>Duncan, summoned discreetly, had hurried in to comfort Jocasta\u2014only to be sent directly out again, with instructions to see to the guests; neither injury nor illness was going to mar such an occasion!</p><p>Ulysses met with a slightly more cordial reception. In fact, Jocasta sent for him. Peering into her room to check on her, I found him sitting by the bed, holding his mistress\u2019s hand, with such an expression of gentleness on his usually impassive face that I was quite moved by it, and stepped quietly back into the hall, not to disturb them. He saw me, though, and nodded.</p><p>They were talking in low voices, his head in its stiff white wig bending toward hers. He seemed to be arguing with her, in a most respectful fashion; she shook her head, and gave a small cry of pain. His hand tightened on hers, and I saw that he had taken off his white gloves; her hand lay long and frail, pallid in his powerful dark grasp.</p><p>She breathed deeply, steadying herself. Then she said something definite, squeezed his hand, and lay back. He rose, and stood for a moment beside the bed, looking down at her. Then he drew himself up, and taking his gloves from his pocket, came out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cIf you will fetch your husband, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d he said, low-voiced. \u201cMy mistress wishes me to tell him something.\u201d</p><p>THE PARTY WAS STILL IN full swing, but had shifted to a lower, digestive sort of gear. People greeted Jamie or me as we followed Ulysses into the house, but no one stopped us.</p><p>He led us downstairs to his butler\u2019s pantry, a tiny room that lay off the winter kitchen, its shelves crammed with silver ornaments, bottles of polish, vinegar, blacking, and bluing, a housewife with needles, pins, and threads, small tools for mending, and what looked like a substantial private stock of brandy, whisky, and assorted cordials.</p><p>He removed these from their shelf, and reaching back into the empty space where they had stood, pressed upon the wood of the wall with both white-gloved hands. Something clicked, and a small panel slid aside with a soft rasping sound.</p><p>He stood aside, silently inviting Jamie to look. Jamie raised one eyebrow and leaned forward, peering into the recess. It was dark and shadowy in the butler\u2019s pantry, with only a dim light filtering in from the high basement windows that ran around the top of the kitchen walls.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s empty,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. It should not be.\u201d Ulysses\u2019s voice was low and respectful, but firm.</p><p>\u201cWhat was there?\u201d I asked, glancing out of the pantry to be sure we were not overheard. The kitchen looked as though a bomb had gone off in it, but only a scullion was there, a half-witted boy who was washing pots, singing softly to himself.</p><p>\u201cPart of an ingot of gold,\u201d Ulysses replied softly.</p><p>The French gold Hector Cameron had brought away from Scotland, ten thousand pounds in bullion, cast in ingots and marked with the royal fleur-de-lis, was the foundation of River Run\u2019s wealth. But it would not do, of course, for that fact to be known. First Hector, and then, after Hector\u2019s death, Ulysses, had taken one of the gold bars and scraped bits of the soft yellow metal into a small, anonymous heap. This could then be taken to the river warehouses\u2014or for additional safety, sometimes as far as the coastal towns of Edenton, Wilmington, or New Bern\u2014and there carefully changed, in small amounts that would cause no comment, into cash or warehouse certificates, which could safely be used anywhere.</p><p>\u201cThere was about half of the ingot left,\u201d Ulysses said, nodding toward the cavity in the wall. \u201cI found it gone a few months ago. Since then, of course, I have contrived a new hiding place.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked into the empty cavity, then turned to Ulysses.</p><p>\u201cThe rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe enough, last time I checked, sir.\u201d The bulk of the gold was concealed inside Hector Cameron\u2019s mausoleum, hidden in a coffin and guarded, presumably, by his spirit. One or two of the slaves besides Ulysses might know about it, but the very lively fear of ghosts was enough to keep everyone away. I remembered the line of salt spread on the ground in front of the mausoleum, and shivered a little, in spite of the stifling heat in the basement.</p><p>\u201cI could not, of course, make shift to look today,\u201d the butler added.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. Duncan knows?\u201d Jamie nodded toward the recess, and Ulysses nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe thief might have been anyone. So many people come to this house. . . .\u201d The butler\u2019s massive shoulders moved in a small shrug. \u201cBut now that this man from the sea has come again\u2014it puts a different face upon the matter, does it not, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it does.\u201d Jamie contemplated the matter for a moment, tapping two fingers softly against his leg.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Ye\u2019ll need to stay for a bit, Sassenach, will ye not? To look after my aunt\u2019s eye?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Provided no infection resulted from my crude intervention, there was little or nothing I could do for the eye itself. But it should be watched, kept clean and irrigated, until I could be sure it was healed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay, then, for a bit,\u201d he said, turning to Ulysses. \u201cI\u2019ll send the Bugs back to the Ridge, to mind things and see to the haying. We\u2019ll stay, and watch.\u201d</p><p>THE HOUSE WAS FULL of guests, but I slept in Jocasta\u2019s dressing room, so that I might keep an eye on her. The easing of pressure in her eye had relieved the excruciating pain, and she had fallen soundly asleep, her vital signs reassuring enough that I felt I could sleep, too.</p><p>Knowing I had a patient, though, I slept lightly, waking at intervals to tiptoe into her room. Duncan was sleeping on a pallet at the foot of her bed, dead to the world from the exhaustions of the day. I could hear his heavy breathing, as I lit a taper from the hearth and came to stand by the bed.</p><p>Jocasta was still soundly asleep, lying on her back, arms crossed gracefully over the coverlet and her head thrown back, sternly long-nosed and aristocratic as the tomb figures in the chapel of St. Denys. All she wanted was a crown, and a small dog of some kind crouched at her feet.</p><p>I smiled at the thought, thinking as I did how odd it was: Jamie slept in exactly that fashion, lying flat on his back, hands crossed, straight as an arrow. Brianna didn\u2019t; she was a wild sleeper, and had been from a child. Like me.</p><p>The thought gave me a small, unexpected feeling of pleasure. I knew I had given her some parts of me, of course, but she resembled Jamie so strongly, it was always something of a surprise to notice one.</p><p>I blew out the taper, but didn\u2019t at once return to bed. I had taken Phaedre\u2019s cot in the dressing room, but it was a hot, airless little space. The hot day and the consumption of alcohol had left me cotton-mouthed, with a vague headache; I picked up the carafe from Jocasta\u2019s bedside, but it was empty.</p><p>No need to relight the taper; one of the sconces in the hallway was still burning, and a dim glow outlined the door. I pushed it open quietly and looked out. The corridor was lined with bodies\u2014servants sleeping by the doors of the bedrooms\u2014and the air throbbed gently with the snoring and heavy breathing of a great many people sunk in slumber of varying degrees.</p><p>At the end of the corridor, though, one pale figure stood upright, looking out through the tall casement window toward the river.</p><p>She must have heard me, but didn\u2019t turn around. I came to stand beside her, looking out. Phaedre was undressed to her shift, her hair free of its cloth and falling in a soft thick mass around her shoulders. Rare for a slave to have such hair, I thought; most women kept their hair very short under turban or headcloth, lacking both time and tools for dressing it. But Phaedre was a body servant; she would have some leisure\u2014and a comb, at least.</p><p>\u201cWould you like your bed back?\u201d I asked, low-voiced. \u201cI\u2019ll be up for a while\u2014and can sleep on the divan.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me, and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThankee kindly; I ain\u2019t sleepy.\u201d She saw the carafe I carried, and reached for it. \u201cI fetch you some water, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019d like the air.\u201d Still, I stood beside her, looking out.</p><p>It was a beautiful night, thick with stars that hung low and bright over the river, a faint silver thread that wound its way through the dark. There was a moon, a slender sickle, riding low on its way below the curve of the earth, and one or two small campfires burned in the trees beside the river.</p><p>The window was open, and bugs were swarming in; a small cloud of them danced around the candle in the sconce behind us, and tiny winged things brushed my face and arms. Crickets sang, so many of them that their song was a high, constant sound, like a bow drawn over violin strings.</p><p>Phaedre moved to shut it\u2014to sleep with a window open was considered most unhealthy, and likely was, given the various mosquito-borne diseases in this swampish atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something. Out there,\u201d she said, nodding toward the dark below.</p><p>\u201cOh? Probably my husband,\u201d I said. \u201cOr Ulysses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUlysses?\u201d she said, looking startled.</p><p>Jamie, Ian, and Ulysses had organized a system of patrol, and were doubtless out somewhere in the night, gliding round the house and keeping an eye on Hector\u2019s mausoleum, just in case. Knowing nothing of the disappearing gold nor Jocasta\u2019s mysterious visitor, though, Phaedre wouldn\u2019t be aware of the increased vigilance, save in the indirect way in which slaves always knew things\u2014the instinct that had doubtless roused her to look out the window.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just keeping an eye out,\u201d I said, as reassuringly as I could. \u201cWith so many people here, you know.\u201d The MacDonalds had gone to Farquard Campbell\u2019s plantation to spend the night, and a goodly number of guests had gone with them, but there were still a lot of people on the premises.</p><p>She nodded, but looked troubled.</p><p>\u201cIt just feel like something ain\u2019t right,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t know what \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mistress\u2019s eye\u2014\u201d I began, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I don\u2019t know, but there something in the air; I be feelin\u2019 it. Not just tonight, I don\u2019t mean\u2014something goin\u2019 on. Something coming.\u201d She looked at me, helpless to express what she meant, but her mood communicated itself to me.</p><p>It might be in part simply the heightened emotions of the oncoming conflict. One could in fact feel that in the air. But there might be something else, too\u2014something subterranean, barely sensed, but there, like the dim form of a sea serpent, glimpsed for only a moment, then gone, and so put down to legend.</p><p>\u201cMy grannie, she taken from Africa,\u201d Phaedre said softly, staring out at the night. \u201cShe talk to the bones. Say they tell her when bad things comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d In such an atmosphere, quiet save the night sounds, so many souls adrift around us, there seemed nothing unreal about such a statement. \u201cDid she teach you to . . . talk to bones?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but the corner of her mouth tucked in, a small, secret expression, and I thought she might know more about it than she was willing to say.</p><p>One unwelcome thought had occurred to me. I didn\u2019t see how Stephen Bonnet could be connected to present events\u2014surely he was not the man who had spoken to Jocasta out of her past, and just as surely, stealthy theft was not his style. But he did have some reason to believe there might be gold somewhere at River Run\u2014and from what Roger had told us of Phaedre\u2019s encounter with the big Irishman in Cross Creek . . .</p><p>\u201cThe Irishman you met, when you were out with Jemmy,\u201d I said, changing my grip on the slick surface of the carafe, \u201chave you ever seen him again?\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised at that; clearly Bonnet was the farthest thing from her mind.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said. \u201cAin\u2019t seen him again, ever.\u201d She thought for a moment, big eyes hooded. She was the color of strong coffee with a dash of cream, and her hair\u2014there had been a white man in her family tree at some time, I thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d she repeated softly, and turned her troubled gaze back to the quiet night and the sinking moon. \u201cAll I know\u2014something ain\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Out by the stables, a rooster began to crow, the sound out of place and eerie in the dark.</p><p>55</p><p>WENDIGO</p><p>August 20, 1774</p><p>THE LIGHT IN THE MORNING room was perfect.</p><p>\u201cWe began with this room,\u201d Jocasta had told her great-niece, raising her face to the sun that poured through the open double doors to the terrace, lids closed over her blind eyes. \u201cI wanted a room to paint in, and chose this spot, where the light would come in, bright as crystal in the morning, like still water in the afternoon. And then we built the house around it.\u201d The old woman\u2019s hands, still long-fingered and strong, touched the easel, the pigment pots, the brushes, with affectionate regret, as she might caress the statue of a long-dead lover\u2014a passion recalled, but accepted as forever gone.</p><p>And Brianna, sketching block and pencil in hand, had drawn as quickly, as covertly as she could, to catch that fleeting expression of grief outlived.</p><p>That sketch lay with the others in the bottom of her box, against the day when she might try it in more finished form, try to catch that merciless light, and the deep-carved lines of her aunt\u2019s face, strong bones stark in the sun she could not see.</p><p>For now, though, the painting at hand was a matter of business, rather than love or art. Nothing suspicious had happened since Flora MacDonald\u2019s barbecue, but her parents meant to stay for a little longer, just in case. With Roger still in Charlotte\u2014he had written to her; the letter was secreted in the bottom of her box, with the private sketches\u2014there was no reason why she shouldn\u2019t stay, too. Hearing of her continued presence, two or three of Jocasta\u2019s acquaintances, wealthy planters, had commissioned portraits of themselves or their families; a welcome source of income.</p><p>\u201cI will never understand how ye do that,\u201d Ian said, shaking his head at the canvas on her easel. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>In all honesty, she didn\u2019t understand how she did it, either; it didn\u2019t seem necessary. She\u2019d said as much in answer to similar compliments before, though, and realized that such an answer generally struck the hearer either as false modesty or as condescension.</p><p>She smiled at him, instead, letting the glow of pleasure she felt show in her face.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little, my father would take me walking on the Common, and we\u2019d see an old man there often, painting with an easel. I used to make Daddy stop so I could watch, and he and the old man would chat. I mostly just stared, but once I got up the nerve to ask him how he did that and he looked down at me and smiled, and said, \u2018The only trick, sweetie, is to see what you\u2019re looking at.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ian looked from her to the picture, then back, as though comparing the portrait with the hand that had made it.</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d he said, interested. He lowered his voice, glancing toward the door into the hallway. There were voices, but not close. \u201cYe dinna mean Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She felt the familiar small ache at the thought of her first father, but put it aside. She didn\u2019t mind telling Ian about him\u2014but not here, with slaves all over the place and a constant flow of visitors who might pop in at any moment.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder to be sure no one was near, but the slaves were talking loudly in the foyer, arguing over a misplaced boot scraper. She lifted the cover of the small compartment that held spare brushes, and reached under the strip of felt that lined it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She held the pair of miniatures out for his inspection, one in either palm.</p><p>The look of expectation on his face changed to outright fascination, and he reached slowly for one of the tiny paintings.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d he said. It was the one of her mother, her hair long and curling loose on bare shoulders, the small firm chin raised with an authority that belied the generous curve of the mouth above.</p><p>\u201cThe eyes\u2014I don\u2019t think those are quite right,\u201d she said, peering into his hand. \u201cWorking so small . . . I couldn\u2019t get the color, exactly. Da\u2019s were much easier.\u201d</p><p>Blues just were easier. A tiny dab of cobalt, highlighted with white and that faint green shadow that intensified the blue while vanishing itself . . . well, and that was Da, too. Strong, vivid, and straightforward.</p><p>To get a brown with true depth and subtlety, though, let alone something that even approximated the smoky topaz of her mother\u2019s eyes\u2014always clear, but changing like the light on a peat-brown trout stream\u2014that needed more underpainting than was really possible in the tiny space of a miniature. She\u2019d have to try again sometime, with a larger portrait.</p><p>\u201cAre they like, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wonderful.\u201d Ian looked from one to the other, then he put the portrait of Claire gently back into its place. \u201cHave your parents seen them yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to be sure they were right, before I showed them to anybody. But if they are\u2014I\u2019m thinking I can show them to the people who come to sit, and maybe get commissions for more miniatures. Those I could work on at home, on the Ridge; all I\u2019d need is my paint box and the little ivory discs. I could do the painting from the sketches; I wouldn\u2019t need the sitter to keep coming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a brief, explanatory gesture toward the large canvas she was working on, which showed Farquard Campbell, looking rather like a stuffed ferret in his best suit, surrounded by numerous children and grandchildren, most of these mere whitish blobs at the moment. Her strategy was to have their mothers drag the small ones in one at a time, to have each child\u2019s limbs and features hastily sketched into the appropriate blob before natural wriggliness or tantrums obtruded.</p><p>Ian glanced at the canvas, but his attention returned to the miniatures of her parents. He stood looking at them, a slight smile on his long, half-homely face. Then, feeling her eyes on him, he glanced up, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ye don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Ian, let me just sketch you,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch, that\u2019s what you think,\u201d he countered, backing away as though the pencil she had taken up might be a weapon. \u201cThe Kahnyen\u2019kehaka think to have a likeness of someone gives ye power over them. That\u2019s why the medicine society wear false faces\u2014so the demons causing the illness willna have their true likeness and willna ken who to hurt, aye?\u201d</p><p>This was said in such a serious tone that she squinted at him, to see whether he was joking. He didn\u2019t seem to be.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Ian\u2014Mama explained to you about germs, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she did, o\u2019 course,\u201d he said, in a tone exhibiting no conviction at all. \u201cShe showed me things swimmin\u2019 about, and said they were livin\u2019 in my teeth!\u201d His face showed momentary repugnance at the notion, but he left the matter to return to the subject at hand.</p><p>\u201cThere was a traveling Frenchman came to the village once, a natural philosopher\u2014he\u2019d drawings he\u2019d made of birds and animals, and that astonished them\u2014but then he made the mistake of offering to make a likeness of the war chief\u2019s wife. I barely got him out in one piece.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t a Mohawk,\u201d she said patiently, \u201cand if you were\u2014you\u2019re not afraid of me having power over you, are you?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and gave her a sudden queer look that went through her like a knife through butter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d But his voice had little more conviction than when discussing germs.</p><p>Still, he moved to the stool she kept for sitters, set in good light from the open doors that led to the terrace, and sat down, chin lifted and jaw set like one about to be heroically executed.</p><p>Suppressing a smile, she took up the sketching block and drew as quickly as she could, lest he change his mind. He was a difficult subject; his features lacked the solid, clear-cut bone structure that both her parents and Roger had. And yet it was in no way a soft face, even discounting the stippled tattoos that curved from the bridge of his nose across his cheeks.</p><p>Young and fresh, and yet the firmness of his mouth\u2014it was slightly crooked, she saw with interest; how had she never noticed that before?\u2014belonged to someone much older, bracketed by lines that would cut much deeper with age, but were already firmly entrenched.</p> <p>The eyes . . . she despaired of getting those right. Large and hazel, they were his one claim to beauty, and yet, beautiful was the last thing you would call them. Like most eyes, they weren\u2019t one color at all, but many\u2014the colors of autumn, dark wet earth and crackling oak leaves, and the touch of setting sun on dry grass.</p><p>The color was a challenge, but one she could meet. The expression, though\u2014it changed in an instant from something so guilelessly amiable as to seem almost half-witted to something you wouldn\u2019t want to meet in a dark alley.</p><p>The expression at present was somewhere between these two extremes, but shifted suddenly toward the latter as his attention focused on the open doors behind her, and the terrace beyond.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, startled. Someone was there; she saw the edge of his\u2014or her\u2014shadow, but the person who threw it was keeping out of sight. Whoever it was began to whistle, a tentative, breathy sound.</p><p>For an instant, everything was normal. Then the world shifted. The intruder was whistling \u201cYellow Submarine.\u201d</p><p>All the blood rushed from her head, and she swayed, grabbing the edge of an occasional table to keep from falling. Dimly, she sensed Ian rising like a cat from his stool, seizing one of her palette knives, and sliding noiselessly out of the room into the hallway.</p><p>Her hands had gone cold and numb; so had her lips. She tried to whistle a phrase in reply, but nothing but a little air emerged. Straightening up, she took hold of herself, and sang the last few words instead. She could barely manage the tune, but there was no doubt of the words.</p><p>Dead silence from the terrace; the whistling had stopped.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she said clearly. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>The shadow lengthened slowly, showing a head like a lion\u2019s, light shining through the curls, glowing on the terrace stones. The head itself poked cautiously into sight around the corner of the door. It was an Indian, she saw, with astonishment, though his dress was mostly European\u2014and ragged\u2014bar a wampum necklet. He was lean and dirty, with close-set eyes, which were fixed on her with eagerness and something like avidity.</p><p>\u201cYou alone, man?\u201d he asked, in a hoarse whisper. \u201cThought I heard voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see I am. Who on earth are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . Wendigo. Wendigo Donner. Your name\u2019s Fraser, right?\u201d He had edged all the way into the room now, though still glancing warily from side to side.</p><p>\u201cMy maiden name, yes. Are you\u2014\u201d She stopped, not sure how to ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said softly, looking her up and down in a casual way that no man of the eighteenth century would have employed to a lady. \u201cSo are you, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re her daughter, you have to be.\u201d He spoke with a certain intensity, moving closer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think he meant her harm; he was just very interested. Ian didn\u2019t wait to see, though; there was a brief darkening of the light from the door, and then he had Donner from behind, the Indian\u2019s squawk of alarm choked off by the arm across his throat, the point of the palette knife jabbing him under the ear.</p><p>\u201cWho are ye, arsebite, and what d\u2019ye want?\u201d Ian demanded, tightening the arm across Donner\u2019s throat. The Indian\u2019s eyes bulged, and he made small mewling noises.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect him to answer you, if you\u2019re choking him?\u201d This appeal to reason caused Ian to relax his grip, albeit reluctantly. Donner coughed, rubbing his throat ostentatiously, and shot Ian a resentful look.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that, man, I wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 nothin\u2019 to her.\u201d Donner\u2019s eyes went from her to Ian and back. He jerked his head toward Ian. \u201cIs he . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he knows. Sit down. You met my mother when she\u2014when she was kidnapped, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s feathery brows shot up at this, and he took a firmer grip on the palette knife, which was flexible but had a definite point.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Donner lowered himself gingerly onto the stool, keeping a wary eye on Ian. \u201cMan, they nearly got me. Your mother, she told me her old man was gnarly and I didn\u2019t want to be there when he showed up, but I didn\u2019t believe her. Almost, I didn\u2019t. But when I heard those drums, man, I bugged out, and a damn good thing I did, too.\u201d He swallowed, looking pale. \u201cI went back, in the morning. Jeez, man.\u201d</p><p>Ian said something under his breath, in what Brianna thought was Mohawk. It sounded unfriendly in the extreme, and Donner evidently discerned enough of the meaning to make him scoot his stool a little farther away, hunching his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to her, okay?\u201d He looked pleadingly at Brianna. \u201cI didn\u2019t! I was gonna help her get away\u2014ask her, she\u2019ll tell you! Only Fraser and his guys showed up before I could. Christ, why would I hurt her? She\u2019s the first one I found back here\u2014I needed her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one?\u201d Ian said, frowning. \u201cThe first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first . . . traveler, he means,\u201d Brianna said. Her heart was beating fast. \u201cWhat did you need her for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell me how to get\u2014back.\u201d He swallowed again, his hand going to the wampum ornament around his neck. \u201cYou\u2014did you come through, or were you born here? I\u2019m figuring you came through,\u201d he added, not waiting for an answer. \u201cThey don\u2019t grow \u2019em as big as you now. Little bitty girls. Me, I like a big woman.\u201d He smiled, in what he plainly intended to be an ingratiating manner.</p><p>\u201cI came,\u201d Brianna said shortly. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to get close enough to talk to your mother.\u201d He glanced uneasily over his shoulder; there were slaves in the kitchen garden, their voices audible. \u201cI hid out with the Cherokee for a while, then I figured to come down and talk to her at Fraser\u2019s Ridge when it was safe, but the old lady there told me you were all down here. Heck of a long way to walk,\u201d he added, looking vaguely resentful.</p><p>\u201cBut then that big black dude ran me off twice, when I tried to get in before. Guess I didn\u2019t meet the dress code.\u201d His face flickered, not quite managing a smile.</p><p>\u201cI been sneaking around for the last three days, trying to catch a glimpse of her, find her alone outside. But I saw her talking to you, out on the terrace, and heard you call her Mama. Seeing how big you are, I figured you must be . . . well, I figured if you didn\u2019t pick up on the song, no harm done, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ye want to go back where ye came from, do ye?\u201d Ian asked. Plainly he thought this was an excellent idea.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Donner said fervently. \u201cOh, yeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come through?\u201d Brianna asked. The shock of his appearance was fading, subsumed by curiosity. \u201cIn Scotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, is that where you did it?\u201d he asked eagerly. Scarcely waiting for her nod, he went on. \u201cYour mother said she came and then went back and came again. Can you-all go back and forth, like, you know, a revolving door?\u201d</p><p>Brianna shook her head violently, shuddering in recollection.</p><p>\u201cGod, no. It\u2019s horrible, and it\u2019s so dangerous, even with a gemstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemstone?\u201d He pounced on that. \u201cYou gotta have a gemstone to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot absolutely, but it seems to be some protection. And it may be that there\u2019s some way to use gemstones to\u2014to steer, sort of, but we don\u2019t really know about that.\u201d She hesitated, wanting to ask more questions, but wanting still more to fetch Claire. \u201cIan\u2014could you go get Mama? I think she\u2019s in the kitchen garden with Phaedre.\u201d</p><p>Her cousin gave the visitor a flat, narrow look, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not leave ye alone wi\u2019 this fellow. You go; I\u2019ll watch him.\u201d</p><p>She would have argued, but long experience with Scottish males had taught her to recognize intractable stubbornness when she saw it. Besides, Donner\u2019s eyes were fixed on her in a way that made her slightly uncomfortable\u2014he was looking at her hand, she realized, at the cabochon ruby in her ring. She was reasonably sure she could fight him off, if necessary, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she said, hastily stabbing a neglected brush into the pot of turps. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere!\u201d</p><p>I WAS SHOCKED, but less so than I might have been. I had felt that Donner was alive. Hoped he was, in spite of everything. Still, seeing him face to face, sitting in Jocasta\u2019s morning room, struck me dumb. He was talking when I came in, but stopped when he saw me. He didn\u2019t stand up, naturally, nor yet offer any observations on my survival; just nodded at me, and resumed what he\u2019d been saying.</p><p>\u201cTo stop whitey. Save our lands, save our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came to the wrong time,\u201d Brianna pointed out. \u201cYou were too late.\u201d</p><p>Donner gave her a blank look.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u20141766, that\u2019s when I was supposed to come, and that\u2019s when I came.\u201d He pounded the heel of his hand violently against the side of his head. \u201cCrap! What was wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongenital stupidity?\u201d I suggested politely, having regained my voice. \u201cThat, or hallucinogenic drugs.\u201d</p><p>The blank look flickered a little, and Donner\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, man. There was some of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you came to 1766\u2014and meant to\u201d\u2014Bree objected\u2014\u201cwhat about Robert Springer\u2014Otter-Tooth? According to the story Mama heard about him, he meant to warn the native tribes against white men and prevent them colonizing the place. Only he arrived too late to do that\u2014and even so, he must have arrived forty or fifty years before you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the plan, man!\u201d Donner burst out. He stood up, rubbing both hands violently through his hair in agitation, making it stand out like a bramble bush. \u201cJeez, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t? What the bloody hell was the plan, then?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou did have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, we did.\u201d He dropped his hands, glancing round as though fearing to be overheard. He licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cBob did want to do what you said\u2014only the rest said, nah, that wouldn\u2019t work. Too many different groups, too much pressure to trade with the whiteys . . . just no way it would fly, you know? We couldn\u2019t stop it all, just maybe make it better.\u201d</p><p>The official plan of the group had been somewhat less ambitious in scope. The travelers would arrive in the 1760s, and over the course of the next ten years, in the confusion and reshuffling, the movement of tribes and villages attendant upon the end of the French and Indian War, would infiltrate themselves into various Indian groups along the Treaty Line in the Colonies and up into the Canadian territories.</p><p>They would then use such persuasive powers as they had gained to sway the Indian nations to fight on the British side in the oncoming Revolution, with the intent of insuring a British victory.</p><p>\u201cSee, the English, they act like the Indians are sovereign nations,\u201d he explained, with a glibness suggesting this was a theory learned by rote. \u201cThey won, they\u2019d go on doing trade and like that, which is okay, but they wouldn\u2019t be trying to push the Indians back and stomp \u2019em out. The colonists\u201d\u2014he waved scornfully toward the open door\u2014\u201cgreedy sons o\u2019 bitches been shoving their way into Indian lands for the last hundred years; they ain\u2019t going to stop.\u201d</p><p>Bree raised her brows, but I could see that she found the notion intriguing. Evidently, it wasn\u2019t quite as insane as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cHow could you think you\u2019d succeed?\u201d I demanded. \u201cOnly a few men to\u2014oh, my God,\u201d I said, seeing his face change. \u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ\u2014you weren\u2019t the only ones, were you?\u201d</p><p>Donner shook his head, wordless.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Ian asked. He sounded calm, but I could see that his hands were clenched on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Donner sat down abruptly, slumping into himself like a bag of grain. \u201cThere were like, two or three hundred in the group. But most of \u2019em couldn\u2019t hear the stones.\u201d His head lifted a little, and he glanced at Brianna. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, ruddy brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cBut you think there were more . . . travelers . . . than you and your friends?\u201d</p><p>Donner shrugged, helpless.</p><p>\u201cI got the idea there were, yeah. But Raymond said only five at a time could pass through. So we trained in, like, cells of five. We kept it secret; nobody in the big group knew who could travel and who couldn\u2019t, and Raymond was the only one who knew all of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>I had to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Raymond look like?\u201d A possibility had been stirring in the back of my mind, ever since I\u2019d heard that name.</p><p>Donner blinked, having not expected that question.</p><p>\u201cJeez, I dunno,\u201d he said helplessly \u201cShort dude, I think. White hair. Wore it long, like we all did.\u201d He raked a hand through his knotted locks in illustration, brows furrowed in the search for memory.</p><p>\u201cA rather . . . wide . . . forehead?\u201d I knew I oughtn\u2019t to prompt him, but couldn\u2019t help myself, and drew both index fingers across my own brow in illustration.</p><p>He stared at me in confusion for a moment.</p><p>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said, shaking his head helplessly. \u201cIt was a long time ago. How would I remember something like that?\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell, tell me what happened, when you came through the stones.\u201d</p><p>Donner licked his lips, blinking in the effort of recall. It wasn\u2019t just native stupidity, I saw; he didn\u2019t like thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, there were five of us, like I said. Me, and Rob, and Jeremy and Atta. Oh, and Jojo. We came through on the island, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat island?\u201d Brianna, Ian, and I all chorused together.</p><p>\u201cOcracoke,\u201d he said, looking surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s the northmost portal in the Bermuda Triangle group. We wanted to be as close as we could get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ber\u2014\u201d Brianna and I began, but broke off, looking at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou know where a number of these portals are?\u201d I said, striving for calm.</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d Brianna chimed in, not waiting for his answer.</p><p>The answer, in any event, was confused\u2014no surprise there. Raymond had told them that there were many such places in the world, but that they tended to occur in groups. There was such a group in the Caribbean, another in the Northeast, near the Canadian border. Another in the Southwestern desert\u2014Arizona, he thought, and down through Mexico. Northern Britain and the coast of France, as far as the tip of the Iberian peninsula. Probably more, but that\u2019s all he\u2019d mentioned.</p><p>Not all of the portals were marked with stone circles, though those in places where people had lived for a long time tended to be.</p><p>\u201cRaymond said those were safer,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI dunno why.\u201d</p><p>The spot on Ocracoke hadn\u2019t been bounded by a full circle of stones, though it was marked. Four stones, he said. One of them had marks on it Raymond said were African\u2014maybe made by slaves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of in the water,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cA little stream runs through it, I mean. Ray said he didn\u2019t know about water, whether that made any difference, but he thought it might. But we didn\u2019t know what kind of difference. You guys know?\u201d</p><p>Brianna and I shook our heads, round-eyed as a pair of owls. Ian\u2019s brow, already furrowed, drew further down at this, though. Had he heard something, during his time with Geillis Duncan?</p><p>The five of them\u2014and Raymond\u2014had driven as far as they could; the road that led down the Outer Banks was a poor one, which tended to wash away in storms, and they were obliged to leave the car several miles away from the spot, struggling through the scrub pines of the coastal forest and patches of unexpected quicksand. It was late fall\u2014</p><p>\u201cSamhain,\u201d Brianna said softly, but softly enough that Donner was not distracted from the flow of his story.</p><p>Late fall, he said, and the weather was bad. It had been raining for days, and the footing was uncertain, slippery and boggy by turns. The wind was high, and the storm surge pounded the beaches; they could hear it, even in the secluded spot where the portal lay.</p><p>\u201cWe were all scared\u2014maybe all but Rob\u2014but it was way exciting, man,\u201d he said, beginning to show a glimmer of enthusiasm. \u201cThe trees were just about layin\u2019 down flat, and the sky, it was green. The wind was so bad, you could taste salt, all the time, because little bits of ocean were flying through the air, mixed with the rain. We were, like, soaked through to our choners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d Ian said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cUnderpants\u2014you know, drawers. Smallclothes,\u201d Brianna said, flapping an impatient hand. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Once arrived at the place, Raymond had checked them all, to see that they carried the few necessities they might need\u2014tinderboxes, tobacco, a little money of the time\u2014and then given each one a wampum necklet, and a small leather pouch, which he said was an amulet of ceremonial herbs.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know about that,\u201d he said, seeing the expression on my face. \u201cWhat kind did you use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, not wanting him to wander from his story. \u201cGo on. How did you plan to hit the right time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d He sighed, hunching on his stool. \u201cWe didn\u2019t. Ray said it would be just about two hundred years, give or take a couple. It wasn\u2019t like we could steer\u2014that\u2019s what I was hoping you guys would know. How to get to a specific time. \u2019Cuz, boy, I\u2019d sure like to go back and get there before I got messed up with Ray and them.\u201d</p><p>They had, at Raymond\u2019s direction, walked a pattern among the stones, chanting words. Donner had no idea what the words meant, nor even what the language was. At the conclusion of the pattern, though, they had walked single file toward the stone with African markings, passing carefully to the left of it.</p><p>\u201cAnd, like\u2014pow!\u201d He smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand. \u201cFirst guy in line\u2014he\u2019s gone, man! We were just freaked out. I mean, that\u2019s what was s\u2019posed to happen, but . . . gone,\u201d he repeated, shaking his head. \u201cJust . . . gone.\u201d</p><p>Agog at this evidence of effectiveness, they had repeated the pattern and the chant, and at each repetition, the first man to pass the stone had vanished. Donner had been the fourth.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, going pale at the memory. \u201cOh, God, I never felt anything like that before and I hope I never do again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amulet\u2014the pouch you had,\u201d Brianna said, ignoring his pallor. Her own face was intense, blazing with interest. \u201cWhat happened to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I maybe dropped it, maybe it went someplace else. I passed out, and when I came to, it wasn\u2019t with me.\u201d The day was warm and close, but he began to shiver. \u201cJojo. He was with me. Only he was dead.\u201d</p><p>That statement struck me like a knife blow, just under the ribs. Geillis Duncan\u2019s notebooks had held lists of people found near stone circles\u2014some alive, some dead. I hadn\u2019t needed anything to tell me that the journey through the stones was a perilous passage\u2014but this reminder made me feel weak in the knees, and I sat down on Jocasta\u2019s tufted ottoman.</p><p>\u201cThe others,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cDid they . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He was still clammy and shivering, but sweat glazed his face; he looked very unwell.</p><p>\u201cNever saw \u2019em again,\u201d he said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what had killed Jojo; didn\u2019t pause to look, though he had a vague notion that there might have been burn marks on his shirt. Finding his friend dead, and none of the others nearby, he had stumbled off in a panic through scrub forest and salt marsh, collapsing after several hours of wandering, lying in the sand dunes among stiff grass all night. He had starved for three days, found and eaten a nest of turtle eggs, eventually made his way to the mainland on a stolen canoe, and thereafter had drifted haplessly, working here and there at menial jobs, seeking refuge in drink when he could afford it, falling into company with Hodgepile and his gang a year or so past.</p><p>The wampum necklets, he said, were to allow the conspirators to identify each other should they meet at some point\u2014but he had never seen anybody else wearing one.</p><p>Brianna wasn\u2019t paying attention to this rambling part of the story, though; she had jumped ahead.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Otter-Tooth\u2014Springer\u2014screwed up your group by deliberately trying to go to a different time?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, mouth hanging open a little.</p><p>\u201cI never thoughta that. He went first. He went first,\u201d he repeated, in a wondering sort of way.</p><p>Brianna began to ask another question, but was interrupted by the sound of voices in the hall, coming toward the morning room. Donner was on his feet in an instant, eyes wide with alarm.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s him. You gotta help me!\u201d</p><p>Before I could inquire exactly why he thought so, or who \u201chim\u201d was, the austere form of Ulysses appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said to the cowering Donner, in awful tones. \u201cDid I not tell you to begone, sirrah? How dare you to enter Mrs. Innes\u2019s house and pester her relations?\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside, then, with a nod to whomever stood beside him, and a small, round, cross-looking gentleman in a rumpled suit peered in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d he said, pointing an accusatory finger. \u201cThat\u2019s the blackguard what stole my purse at Jacobs\u2019s ordinary this morning! Took it right out my pocket whilst I was eatin\u2019 ham for breakfast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Donner made a poor attempt at a show of outrage, but guilt was written all over his face, and when Ulysses seized him by the scruff of the neck and unceremoniously rummaged his clothing, the purse was discovered, to the outspoken gratification of the owner.</p><p>\u201cThief!\u201d he cried, shaking his fist. \u201cI been a-following of you all the morning. Damn\u2019 tick-bellied, louse-ridden, dog-eatin\u2019 savage\u2014oh, I do beg pardon, ladies,\u201d he added, bowing to me and Brianna as an afterthought before resuming his denunciation of Donner.</p><p>Brianna glanced at me, eyebrows raised, but I shrugged. There was no way of preserving Donner from the righteous wrath of his victim, even had I really wanted to. At the gentleman\u2019s behest, Ulysses summoned a pair of grooms and a set of manacles\u2014the sight of which made Brianna grow somewhat pale\u2014and Donner was marched off, protesting that he hadn\u2019t done it, he\u2019d been framed, wasn\u2019t him, he was a friend of the ladies, really, man, ask \u2019em! . . . to be conveyed to the gaol in Cross Creek.</p><p>There was a deep silence in the wake of his removal. At last, Ian shook his head as though trying to rid himself of flies, and putting down the palette knife at last, picked up the sketching block, where Brianna had made Donner try to draw the pattern he said the men had walked. A hopeless scrawl of circles and squiggles, it looked like one of Jemmy\u2019s drawings.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of name is Weddigo?\u201d Ian asked, putting it down.</p><p>Brianna had been clutching her pencil so tightly that her knuckles were white. She unfolded her hand and put it down, and I saw that her hands were shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cWendigo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an Ojibway cannibal spirit that lives in the wood. It howls in storms and eats people.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave her a long look.</p><p>\u201cNice fellow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t he, just.\u201d I felt more than a little shaken myself. Apart from the shock of Donner\u2019s appearance and revelations, and then his arrest, small jolts of memory\u2014vivid images of my first meeting with him\u2014kept shooting uncontrollably through my mind, despite my efforts to shut them out. I could taste blood in my mouth, and the stink of unwashed men drowned the scent of flowers from the terrace.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s what one would call a nom de guerre,\u201d I said, with an attempt at nonchalance. \u201cHe can\u2019t have been christened that, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Mama?\u201d Bree was frowning at me. \u201cShall I get something? A glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisky,\u201d Ian and I said in unison, and I laughed, despite the shakiness. By the time it arrived, I was in command of myself again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think will happen to him, Ulysses?\u201d I asked, as he held the tray for me. The butler\u2019s stolidly handsome face showed nothing beyond a mild distaste for the recent visitor; I saw him frown at the scumbled bits of dirt that Donner\u2019s shoes had left on the parquet floor.</p><p>\u201cI suppose they will hang him,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Townsend\u2014that was the gentleman\u2019s name\u2014had ten pound in the purse he stole.\u201d More than enough to merit hanging. The eighteenth century took a dim view of thievery; as little as a pound could incur a capital sentence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Ian, with obvious approval.</p><p>I felt a small lurch of the stomach. I disliked Donner, distrusted him, and to be honest, really didn\u2019t feel that his death would be a great loss to humanity, by and large. But he was a fellow traveler; did that impose any obligation on our part to help him? More importantly, perhaps\u2014did he have any more information that he hadn\u2019t told us yet?</p><p>\u201cMr. Townsend has gone to Campbelton,\u201d the butler added, offering the tray to Ian. \u201cTo ask Mr. Farquard to attend to the case promptly, as he is bound for Halifax, and wishes to give his witness at once.\u201d Farquard Campbell was a justice of the peace\u2014and likely the only thing approaching a judge within the county, since the Circuit Court had ceased to operate.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hang him before tomorrow, though, I don\u2019t suppose,\u201d Brianna said. She didn\u2019t normally drink whisky, but had taken a glass now; the encounter had shaken her, too. I saw she had turned the ring around upon her finger, rubbing the big ruby absentmindedly with her thumb.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Ian, looking at her suspiciously. \u201cYe dinna mean to\u2014\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cNo!\u201d he said in horror at the indecision he saw on my face. \u201cYon fellow\u2019s a thief and a blackguard, and if ye didna see him burning and killing wi\u2019 your own eyes, Auntie, ye ken well enough he did it. For God\u2019s sake, let them hang him and have done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d I said, wavering. The sound of footsteps and voices in the hall saved me answering. Jamie and Duncan had been in Cross Creek; now they were back. I felt an overwhelming flood of relief at sight of Jamie, who loomed up in the doorway, sunburned and ruddy, dusty from riding.</p><p>\u201cHang who?\u201d he inquired cheerfully.</p><p>JAMIE\u2019S OPINION WAS the same as Ian\u2019s; let them hang Donner, and good riddance. He was reluctantly persuaded that either Brianna or I must talk to the man at least once more, though, to be sure there was nothing further he could tell us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to the gaoler,\u201d he said without enthusiasm. \u201cMind, though\u201d\u2014he pointed a monitory finger at me\u2014\u201cneither of ye is to go anywhere near the man, save Ian or I am with ye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think he\u2019d do?\u201d Brianna was ruffled, annoyed at his tone. \u201cHe\u2019s about half my size, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a rattlesnake is smaller yet,\u201d her father replied. \u201cYe wouldna walk into a room with one of those, only because ye outweigh him, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Ian snickered at that, and Brianna gave him an elbow, hard in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jamie said, ignoring them, \u201cI\u2019ve a bit of news. And a letter from Roger Mac,\u201d he said. He pulled it out of his shirt, smiling at Bree. \u201cIf ye\u2019re no too distracted to read it?\u201d</p><p>She lit up like a candle and grabbed it. Ian made a teasing snatch at it, and she slapped his hand away, laughing, and ran out of the room to read it in privacy.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of news?\u201d I asked. Ulysses had left the tray and decanter; I poured a tot into my empty glass and gave it to Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s seen Manfred McGillivray,\u201d he replied. \u201cSl\u00e0inte.\u201d He drained the glass, looking contented.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Where?\u201d Ian looked less than pleased at this news. For myself, I was thrilled.</p><p>\u201cIn a brothel, where else?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, his informant had not been able to supply the exact location of said brothel\u2014having likely been too drunk at the time to know precisely where he was, as Jamie cynically observed\u2014but had been reasonably sure that it was in Cross Creek or Campbelton. Also unfortunately, the sighting was several weeks old. Manfred might well have moved on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start, though,\u201d I said, hopeful. Penicillin was effective, even against more advanced cases of syphilis, and I had some brewing in the winter kitchen, even now. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you, when you go to the gaol. Then after we\u2019ve spoken with Donner, we can go look for the brothel.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s look of contentment lessened appreciably.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna think Manfred would be still there, Auntie,\u201d Ian said, patently amused. \u201cI doubt he\u2019d have the money, for one thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, ha ha,\u201d I said. \u201cHe might have said where he was staying, mightn\u2019t he? Besides, I want to know whether he was showing any symptoms.\u201d In my own time, it might be ten, twenty, or even thirty years after the appearance of the initial chancre before further syphilitic symptoms developed; in this time, though, syphilis was a much more fulminant disease\u2014a victim could die within a year of infection. And Manfred had been gone for more than three months; God knew how long since he had first contracted the infection.</p><p>Jamie looked distinctly unenthused about the idea of searching for brothels; Ian seemed rather more interested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help look,\u201d he volunteered. \u201cFergus can come, too; he kens a great deal about whores\u2014they\u2019d likely talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus? Fergus is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThat was the other bit of news. He\u2019s payin\u2019 his respects to my aunt at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he here, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye heard the talk at the barbecue, aye? About Mr. Simms, the printer, and his troubles? It seems they\u2019ve got worse, and he thinks of selling up, before someone burns his shop to the ground and him in it. It struck me that perhaps it would suit Fergus and Marsali, better than the farming. So I sent word for him to come down, and maybe have a word wi\u2019 Simms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant idea!\u201d I said. \u201cOnly . . . what would Fergus use for money to buy it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie coughed and looked evasive.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I imagine some sort of bargain might be struck. Particularly if Simms is anxious to sell up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, resigned. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I want to know the gory details. But Ian\u2014\u201d I turned to him, fixing him with a beady eye. \u201cFar be it from me to offer you moral advice. But you are not\u2014repeat, not\u2014to be questioning whores in any deeply personal manner. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie!\u201d he said, pretending shock. \u201cThe idea!\u201d But a broad grin spread across his tattooed face.</p><p>56</p><p>TAR AND FEATHERS</p><p>IN THE EVENT, I let Jamie go alone to the gaol to make arrangements for seeing Donner. He had assured me that this would be simpler without my presence, and I had several errands in Cross Creek. Besides the usual salt, sugar, pins, and other household goods needing replenishment, I urgently needed more cinchona bark for Lizzie. The gallberry ointment worked to treat malarial attacks, but was not nearly so effective as Jesuit bark in preventing them.</p><p>The British trade restrictions were having their effect, though. There was, of course, no tea to be found\u2014I had expected that; there had been none for nearly a year\u2014but neither was there any sugar, save at an exorbitant price, and steel pins were not to be found at all.</p><p>Salt, I could get. With a pound of this in my basket, I made my way up from the docks. The day was hot and humid; away from the slight breeze off the river, the air was motionless and thick as treacle. The salt had solidified in its burlap bags, and the merchant had had to chip off lumps of it with a chisel.</p><p>I wondered how Ian and Fergus were coming with their researches; I had a scheme in mind regarding the brothel and its inhabitants, but first, we had to find it.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t mentioned the idea to Jamie. If anything came of it, that would be time enough. A side street offered shade, in the form of a number of large elms that had been planted so as to overhang the street. I stepped into the welcome shadow of one of these, and found myself at the edge of the fashionable district\u2014about ten houses, all told\u2014of Cross Creek. From where I stood, I could see Dr. Fentiman\u2019s fairly modest abode, distinguished by a small hanging shingle decorated with a caduceus. The doctor was not in when I called, but his servant, a neat, plain young woman with badly crossed eyes, admitted me and showed me to the consulting room.</p><p>This was a surprisingly cool and pleasant room, with large windows and a worn canvas cloth on the floor, painted in blue and yellow chequers, and furnished with a desk, two comfortable chairs, and a chaise longue on which patients might recline for examination. He had a microscope standing on the desk, through which I peered with interest. It was a fine one, though not quite so good as my own, I thought with some complacency.</p><p>I was possessed of a strong curiosity about the rest of his equipment, and was debating with myself as to whether it would be an abuse of the doctor\u2019s hospitality to snoop through his cupboards, when the doctor himself arrived, borne on the wings of brandywine.</p><p>He was humming a little tune to himself, and carrying his hat under one arm, his battered medical case in the crook of the other. Seeing me, he dropped these carelessly on the floor and hastened to grasp me by the hand, beaming. He bowed over my hand and pressed moistly fervent lips to my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! My dear lady, I am so pleased to see you! You are in no physical distress, I trust?\u201d</p><p>I was in some danger of being overwhelmed by the fumes of alcohol on his breath, but kept as cordial a countenance as possible, unobtrusively wiping my hand upon my gown, whilst assuring him that I was entirely well, as were all the members of my immediate family.</p><p>\u201cOh, splendid, splendid,\u201d he said, plumping down quite suddenly upon a stool and giving me an enormous grin, revealing tobacco-stained molars. His oversize wig had slid round sideways, causing him to peer out from under it like a dormouse under a tea cozy, but he seemed not to have noticed. \u201cSplendid, splendid, splendid.\u201d</p><p>I took his rather vague wave as invitation and sat down, as well. I had brought a small present in order to sweeten the good doctor, and now removed this from my basket\u2014though in all truth, I rather thought he was so well-marinated as to require little more attention before I broached the subject of my errand.</p><p>He was, however, thrilled with my gift\u2014a gouged-out eyeball, which Young Ian had thoughtfully picked up for me following a fight in Yanceyville, hastily preserved in spirits of wine. Having heard something of Doctor Fentiman\u2019s tastes, I thought he might appreciate it. He did, and went on saying, \u201cSplendid!\u201d at some length.</p><p>Eventually trailing off, he blinked, held the jar up to the light, and turned it round, viewing it with great admiration.</p><p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d he said once more. \u201cIt will have a most particularly honorable place in my collection, I do assure you, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a collection?\u201d I said, affecting great interest. I\u2019d heard about his collection.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, oh, yes! Would you care to see it?\u201d</p><p>There was no possibility of refusal; he was already up and staggering toward a door at the back of his study. This proved to lead into a large closet, the shelves of which held thirty or forty glass containers, filled with alcoholic spirits\u2014and a number of objects which could indeed be described as \u201cinteresting.\u201d</p><p>These ranged from the merely grotesque to the truly startling. One by one, he brought out a big toe sporting a wart the size and color of an edible mushroom, a preserved tongue which had been split\u2014apparently during the owner\u2019s lifetime, as the two halves were quite healed\u2014a cat with six legs, a grossly malformed brain (\u201cRemoved from a hanged murderer,\u201d as he proudly informed me. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u201d I murmured in reply, thinking of Donner and wondering what his brain might look like), and several infants, presumably stillborn, and exhibiting assorted atrocious deformities.</p><p>\u201cNow, this,\u201d he said, lifting down a large glass cylinder in trembling hands, \u201cis quite the prize of my collection. There is a most distinguished physician in Germany, a Herr Doktor Blumenbach, who has a world-renowned collection of skulls, and he has been pursuing me\u2014nay, absolutely pestering me, I assure you!\u2014in an effort to persuade me to part with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d was the defleshed skulls and spinal column of a double-headed infant. It was, in fact, fascinating. It was also something that would cause any woman of childbearing age to swear off sex immediately.</p><p>Grisly as the doctor\u2019s collection was, though, it offered me an excellent opportunity for approaching my true errand.</p><p>\u201cThat is truly amazing,\u201d I said, leaning forward as though to examine the empty orbits of the floating skulls. They were separate and complete, I saw; it was the spinal cord that had divided, so that the skulls hung side by side in the fluid, ghostly white and leaning toward each other so that the rounded heads touched gently, as though sharing some secret, only separating when a movement of the jar caused them momentarily to float apart. \u201cI wonder what causes such a phenomenon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, doubtless some dreadful shock to the mother,\u201d Doctor Fentiman assured me. \u201cWomen in an expectant condition are fearfully vulnerable to any sort of excitement or distress, you know. They must be kept quite sequestered and confined, well away from any injurious influences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut you know, some malformations\u2014that one, for instance?\u2014I believe are the result of syphilis in the mother.\u201d</p><p>It was; I recognized the typical malformed jaw, the narrow skull, and the caved-in appearance of the nose. This child had been preserved with flesh intact, and lay curled placidly in its bottle. By the size and lack of hair, it had likely been premature; I hoped for its own sake that it had not been born alive.</p><p>\u201cShiphi\u2014syphilis,\u201d the doctor repeated, swaying a little. \u201cOh, yes. Yes, yes. I got that particular little creature from a, um . . .\u201d It occurred to him belatedly that syphilis was perhaps not a topic suitable to discuss with a lady. Murderer\u2019s brains and two-headed children, yes, but not venereal disease. There was a jar in the closet that I was reasonably sure contained the scrotum of a Negro male who had suffered from elephantiasis; I noticed he hadn\u2019t shown me that one.</p><p>\u201cFrom a prostitute?\u201d I inquired sympathetically. \u201cYes, I suppose such misfortunes must be common among such women.\u201d</p><p>To my annoyance, he slithered away from the desired topic.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. In fact\u2014\u201d He darted a look over his shoulder, as though fearing to be overheard, then leaned near me and whispered hoarsely, \u201cI received that specimen from a colleague in London, some years ago. It is reputed to be the child of a foreign nobleman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said, taken aback. \u201cHow . . . interesting.\u201d</p><p>At this rather inconvenient point, the servant came in with tea\u2014or rather, with a revolting concoction of roasted acorns and chamomile, stewed in water\u2014and the conversation turned ineluctably toward social trivia. I was afraid that the tea might sober him up before I could inveigle him back in the right direction, but luckily the tea tray also included a decanter of fine claret, which I dispensed liberally.</p><p>I had a fresh try at drawing him back into medical subjects, by leaning over to admire the jars left out on his desk. The one nearest me contained the hand of a person who had had such an advanced case of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture as to render the appendage little more than a knot of constricted fingers. I wished Tom Christie could see it. He had avoided me since his surgery, but so far as I knew, his hand was still functional.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it remarkable, the variety of conditions that the human body displays?\u201d I said.</p><p>He shook his head. He had discovered the state of his wig and turned it round; his wizened countenance beneath it looked like that of a solemn chimpanzee\u2014bar the flush of broken capillaries that lit his nose like a beacon.</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d he echoed. \u201cAnd yet, what is quite as remarkable is the resilience a body may show in the face of quite terrible injury.\u201d</p><p>That was true, but it wasn\u2019t at all the line I wished to work upon.</p><p>\u201cYes, quite. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry not to be able to show you one specimen\u2014it would have been a notable addition to my collection, I assure you! But alas, the gentleman insisted upon taking it with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014what?\u201d Well, after all, I had in my time presented various children with their appendixes or tonsils in a bottle, following surgery. I supposed it wasn\u2019t entirely unreasonable for someone to wish to retain an amputated limb.</p><p>\u201cYes, most astonishing.\u201d He took a meditative sip of claret. \u201cA testicle, it was\u2014I trust you will pardon my mentioning it,\u201d he added belatedly. He hesitated for an instant, but in the end, simply couldn\u2019t resist describing the occurrence. \u201cThe gentleman had suffered a wound to the scrotum, a most unfortunate accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost,\u201d I said, feeling a sudden tingle at the base of my spine. Was this Jocasta\u2019s mysterious visitor? I had been keeping off the claret, in the interests of a clear head, but now poured a tot, feeling it needed. \u201cDid he say how this unfortunate incident transpired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. A hunting accident, he said. But they all say that, don\u2019t they?\u201d He twinkled at me, the end of his nose bright red. \u201cI expect it was a duello. The work of a jealous rival, perhaps!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d A duello? I thought. But most duels of the time were fought with pistols, not swords. It really was good claret, and I felt a little steadier. \u201cYou\u2014er\u2014removed the testicle?\u201d He must have, if he had been contemplating adding it to his ghastly collection.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and was not too far gone to give a small sympathetic shudder at the memory. \u201cThe gun-shot had been seriously neglected; he said it had occurred some days previous. I was obliged to remove the injured testicle, but fortunately preserved the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was pleased about that.\u201d Gun-shot? Surely not, I was thinking. It can\u2019t be . . . and yet . . . \u201cDid this happen quite recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, no.\u201d He tilted back in his chair, eyes crossing slightly with the effort of recall. \u201cIt was in the spring, two years ago\u2014May? Perhaps May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the gentleman named Bonnet, by chance?\u201d I was surprised that my voice sounded quite casual. \u201cI believe I had heard that a Stephen Bonnet was involved in some such . . . accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, he would not give his name. Often patients will not, if the injury is one that might cause public embarrassment. I do not insist in such cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do remember him.\u201d I found that I was sitting on the edge of my chair, claret cup clenched in my fist. With a little effort, I set it down.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d Damn, he was getting sleepy; I could see his lids begin to droop. \u201cA tall gentleman, well-dressed. He had a . . . a most beautiful horse. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit more tea, Doctor Fentiman?\u201d I urged a fresh cup upon him, willing him to stay awake. \u201cDo tell me more about it. The surgery must have been quite delicate?\u201d</p><p>In fact, men never like to hear that the removal of testicles is a simple matter, but it is. Though I would admit that the fact of the patient\u2019s being conscious during the whole procedure had likely added to the difficulty.</p><p>Fentiman regained a bit of his animation, telling me about it.</p><p>\u201c. . . and the ball had gone straight through the testicle; it had left the most perfect hole. . . . You could look quite through it, I assure you.\u201d Plainly he regretted the loss of this interesting specimen, and it was with some difficulty that I got him to tell me what had become of the gentleman to whom it belonged.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was odd. It was the horse, you see . . .\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cLovely animal . . . long hair, like a woman\u2019s, so unusual . . .\u201d</p><p>A Friesian horse. The doctor had recalled that the planter Phillip Wylie was fond of such horses, and had said as much to his patient, suggesting that as the man had no money\u2014and would not be capable of riding comfortably for some time, in any case\u2014he might think of selling his animal to Wylie. The man had agreed to this, and had requested the doctor to make inquiry of Wylie, who was in town for the Court Sessions.</p><p>Doctor Fentiman had obligingly gone out to do so, leaving his patient cozily tucked up on the chaise with a draught of tincture of laudanum.</p><p>Phillip Wylie had professed himself most interested in the horse (\u201cYes, I\u2019ll wager he was,\u201d I said, but the doctor didn\u2019t notice), and had hastened round to see it. The horse was present, but the patient was not, having absconded on foot in the doctor\u2019s absence\u2014taking with him half a dozen silver spoons, an enameled snuffbox, the bottle of laudanum, and six shillings, which happened to be all the money the doctor had in the house.</p><p>\u201cI cannot imagine how he managed it,\u201d Fentiman said, eyes quite round at the thought. \u201cIn such condition!\u201d To his credit, he appeared more distressed at the notion of his patient\u2019s condition than his own loss. He was a terrible drunkard, Fentiman, I thought; I\u2019d never seen him completely sober\u2014but not a bad doctor.</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d he added philosophically, \u201call\u2019s well as ends well, is it not, my dear lady?\u201d</p><p>By which he meant that Phillip Wylie had purchased the horse from him for a price sufficient to more than compensate for his losses, and leave him with a tidy profit.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d I said, wondering just how Jamie would take this news. He had won the stallion\u2014for it must of course be Lucas\u2014from Phillip Wylie in the course of an acrimonious card game at River Run, only to have the horse stolen by Stephen Bonnet a few hours later.</p><p>On the whole, I expected that Jamie would be pleased that the stallion was back in good hands, even if they weren\u2019t his. As for the news about Bonnet . . . \u201cA bad penny always turns up,\u201d had been his cynical opinion, expressed when Bonnet\u2019s body had failed to be discovered after Brianna had shot him.</p><p>Fentiman was openly yawning by now. He blinked, eyes watering, patted about his person in search of a handkerchief, then bent to rummage in his case, which he had dropped on the floor near his chair.</p><p>I had pulled out my own handkerchief and leaned across to hand it to him, when I saw them in the open case.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked, pointing. I could see what they were, of course; what I wanted to know was where he\u2019d got them. They were syringes, two of them, lovely little syringes, made of brass. Each one was composed of two bits: a plunger with curled handles, and a cylindrical barrel, drawn out at the narrowed end into a very long, blunt-tipped needle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014why\u2014that is . . . ah . . .\u201d He was terribly taken aback, and stammered like a schoolboy caught sneaking cigarettes behind the toilets. Then something occurred to him, and he relaxed.</p><p>\u201cEars,\u201d he declared, in ringing tones. \u201cFor cleansing ears. Yes, that is what they are, indubitably. Ear clysters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are they really?\u201d I picked one up; he tried to stop me, but his reflexes were delayed, and he succeeded only in grabbing at the ruffle of my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cHow ingenious,\u201d I said, working the plunger. It was a little stiff, but not bad at all\u2014particularly not when the alternative was a makeshift hypodermic composed of a leather tube with a rattlesnake\u2019s fang attached. Of course a blunt tip wouldn\u2019t do, but it would be a simple matter to cut it to a sharp angle. \u201cWhere did you get them? I should like very much to order one myself.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me in abject horror, jaw agape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014er\u2014I really do not think . . .\u201d he protested feebly. Just then, in a perfect miracle of bad timing, his housemaid appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brennan\u2019s come; it\u2019s his wife\u2019s time,\u201d she said briefly.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Doctor Fentiman leapt to his feet, slammed shut his case, and snatched it up.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, dear Mrs. Fraser . . . must go . . . matter of great urgency\u2014so pleasant to have seen you!\u201d He rushed out, case clutched to his bosom, stepping on his hat in his haste.</p><p>The maid picked up the crushed chapeau with an air of resignation, and punched it indifferently back into shape.</p><p>\u201cWill you be wanting to leave now, ma\u2019am?\u201d she inquired, with an intonation making it clear that I ought to be leaving, whether I wanted to or not.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said, rising. \u201cBut tell me\u201d\u2014I held out the brass syringe on the palm of my hand\u2014\u201cdo you know what this is, and where Doctor Fentiman got it?\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to tell in which direction she was looking, but she bent her head as though to examine it, with no more interest than had it been a two-day old smelt offered her for sale in the market.</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Aye, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s a penis syringe. I b\u2019lieve he had it sent him from Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA, um, penis syringe. I see,\u201d I said, blinking a little.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s for treating of the drip, or the clap. The doctor does a deal of business for the men what goes to Mrs. Silvie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Silvie\u2019s. Ah. And would you know where Mrs. Silvie\u2019s . . . establishment is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind Silas Jameson\u2019s ordinary,\u201d she replied, giving me for the first time a faintly curious look, as though wondering what sort of blockhead didn\u2019t know that. \u201cWill you be needing anything else, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said. \u201cThat will do nicely, thank you!\u201d I made to hand her back the penis syringe, but then was struck by impulse. The doctor had two, after all.</p><p>\u201cGive you a shilling for it,\u201d I said, meeting the eye that seemed most likely to be pointed in my direction.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d she said promptly. She paused for a moment, then added, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to use it on your man, best be sure he\u2019s dead drunk first.\u201d</p><p>MY PRIMARY MISSION was thus accomplished, but now I had a new possibility to explore, before mounting an assault on Mrs. Silvie\u2019s house of ill-repute.</p><p>I had planned to visit a glassmaker and attempt to explain by means of drawings how to make the barrel and plunger for a hypodermic syringe, leaving up to Bree the problem of making a hollow needle and attaching it. Unfortunately, while the single glassblower operating in Cross Creek was capable of producing any manner of everyday bottles, jugs, and cups, a glance at his stock had made it obvious that my requirements were well beyond his capabilities.</p><p>But now I needn\u2019t worry about that! While metal syringes lacked some desirable qualities of glass, they also had an undeniable advantage, insofar as they wouldn\u2019t break\u2014and while a disposable needle was nice, I could simply sterilize the entire item after each use.</p><p>Doctor Fentiman\u2019s syringes had very thick, blunt-tipped needle ends. It would be necessary to heat them, and draw the tips out much further in order to narrow them. But any idiot with a forge could do that, I thought. Then to cut the brass tip at an angle and file the point smooth enough to puncture skin cleanly . . . child\u2019s play, I thought blithely, and narrowly refrained from skipping down the sandy walk. Now, all I required was a good stock of cinchona bark.</p><p>My hopes of obtaining the bark were dashed, though, as soon as I turned into the main street and glimpsed Mr. Bogues\u2019s apothecary\u2019s shop. The door stood open, letting in flies, and the usually immaculate stoop was marred with such a multitude of muddy footprints as to suggest that some hostile army had descended upon the shop.</p><p>The impression of sacking and looting was furthered by the scene inside; most of the shelves were empty, scattered with remnants of dried leaf and broken pottery. The Bogueses\u2019 ten-year-old daughter, Miranda, stood mournful watch over a small collection of jars and bottles and an empty tortoiseshell.</p><p>\u201cMiranda!\u201d I said. \u201cWhatever has happened?\u201d</p><p>She brightened at sight of me, small pink mouth momentarily reversing its downward droop.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! D\u2019you want some horehound? We\u2019ve nearly a pound of that left\u2014and it\u2019s cheap, only three farthings the ounce.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have an ounce,\u201d I said, though in fact I had plenty growing in my own garden. \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><p>The mouth went down again, and the lower lip quivered.</p><p>\u201cMama\u2019s in the back, packing. And Papa\u2019s gone to sell Jack to Mr. Raintree.\u201d</p><p>Jack was the apothecary\u2019s wagon horse, and Miranda\u2019s particular pet. I bit the inside of my lip.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Raintree\u2019s a very kind man,\u201d I said, striving for what comfort there might be. \u201cAnd he has a nice pasture for his horses, and a warm stable; I think Jack might be happy there. He\u2019ll have friends.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, mouth pinched tight, but two fat tears escaped to roll down her cheeks.</p><p>With a quick glance behind me, to assure that no one was coming in, I stepped round the counter, sat down on an upturned keg, and drew her onto my lap, where she melted at once, clinging to me and crying, though making an obvious effort not to be heard in the living quarters behind the shop.</p><p>I patted her and made small soothing noises, feeling an unease beyond mere sympathy for the girl. Clearly the Bogueses were selling up. Why?</p><p>So infrequently as I came down the mountain, I had no idea what Ralston Bogues\u2019s politics might be these days. Not being Scottish, he hadn\u2019t come to the barbecue in Flora MacDonald\u2019s honor. The shop had always been prosperous, though, and the family decently off, judging by the children\u2019s clothes\u2014Miranda and her two little brothers always had shoes. The Bogueses had lived here all of Miranda\u2019s life, at least, and likely longer. For them to be leaving in this manner meant that something serious had happened\u2014or was about to.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d I asked Miranda, who was now sitting on my knee, sniffing and wiping her face on my apron. \u201cPerhaps Mr. Raintree can write to you, to tell you how Jack is faring.\u201d</p><p>She looked a little more hopeful at that.</p><p>\u201cCan he send a letter to England, do you think? It\u2019s a terrible long way.\u201d</p><p>England? It was serious.</p><p>\u201cOh, I should think so,\u201d I said, tucking wisps of hair back under her cap. \u201cMr. Fraser writes a letter every night, to his sister in Scotland\u2014and that\u2019s much further away even than England!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d Looking happier, she scrambled off my lap and smoothed down her dress. \u201cCan I write to Jack, do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Raintree will read the letter to him if you do,\u201d I assured her. \u201cCan you write well, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cPapa says I read and write better than he ever did when he was my age. And in Latin. He taught me to read all the names of the simples, so I could fetch him what he wanted\u2014see that one?\u201d She pointed with some pride to a large china apothecary\u2019s jar, elegantly decorated with blue and gold scrolls. \u201cElectuary Limonensis. And that one is Ipecacuanha!\u201d</p><p>I admired her prowess, thinking that at least I now knew her father\u2019s politics. The Bogueses must be Loyalists, if they were returning to England. I would be sorry to see them go, but knowing what I knew of the immediate future, I was glad that they would be safe. At least Ralston would likely have got a decent price for his shop; a short time hence, Loyalists would have their property confiscated, and be lucky to escape arrest\u2014or worse.</p><p>\u201cRandy? Have you seen Georgie\u2019s shoe? I\u2019ve found one under the chest, but\u2014oh, Mrs. Fraser! Your pardon, ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t know anyone was here.\u201d Melanie Bogues\u2019s sharp glance took in my position behind the counter, her daughter\u2019s pink-rimmed eyes, and the damp spots on my apron, but she said nothing, merely patting Miranda\u2019s shoulder as she passed.</p><p>\u201cMiranda tells me you\u2019re leaving for England,\u201d I said, rising and moving unobtrusively out from behind the counter. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sorry to see you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d She smiled unhappily. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to go, as well. And I\u2019m not looking forward to the voyage, I can tell you!\u201d She spoke with the heartfelt emotion of someone who had made such a voyage before and would strongly prefer to be boiled alive before doing it again.</p><p>I sympathized very much, having done it myself. Doing it with three children, two of them boys under five . . . the imagination boggled.</p><p>I wanted to ask her what had caused them to make such a drastic decision, but couldn\u2019t think how to broach the matter in front of Miranda. Something had happened; that was clear. Melanie was jumpy as a rabbit, and somewhat more harried than even packing up a household containing three children might account for. She kept darting glances over her shoulder, as though fearing something sneaking up on her.</p> <p>\u201cIs Mr. Bogues\u2014\u201d I began, but was interrupted by a shadow falling across the stoop. Melanie started, hand to her chest, and I whirled round to see who had come.</p><p>The doorway was filled by a short, stocky woman, dressed in a very odd combination of garments. For an instant, I thought she was an Indian, for she wore no cap, and her dark hair was braided\u2014but then she came into the shop, and I saw that she was white. Or rather, pink; her heavy face was flushed with sunburn and the tip of her pug nose was bright red.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you is Claire Fraser?\u201d she demanded, looking from me to Melanie Bogues.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said, repressing an instinctive urge to take a step backward. Her manner wasn\u2019t threatening, but she radiated such an air of physical power that I found her rather intimidating. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I spoke from astonishment, rather than rudeness, and she did not seem offended.</p><p>\u201cJezebel Hatfield Morton,\u201d she said, squinting intently at me. \u201cSome geezer at the docks tellt me that you was headin\u2019 here.\u201d In marked contrast to Melanie Bogue\u2019s soft English accent, she had the rough speech I associated with people who had been in the backcountry for three or four generations, speaking to no one in the meantime save raccoons, possums, and one another.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . yes,\u201d I said, seeing no point in denying it. \u201cDid you need help of some kind?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look it; had she been any healthier, she would have burst the seams of the man\u2019s shirt she was wearing. Melanie and Miranda were staring at her, wide-eyed. Whatever danger Melanie had been afraid of, it wasn\u2019t Miss Morton.</p><p>\u201cNot to say help,\u201d she said, moving further into the shop. She tilted her head to one side, examining me with what looked like fascination. \u201cI was thinkin\u2019 you might know where\u2019bouts that skunk Isaiah Morton be, though.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open, and I shut it quickly. Not Miss Morton, then\u2014Mrs. Morton. The first Mrs. Isaiah Morton, that is. Isaiah Morton had fought with Jamie\u2019s militia company in the War of the Regulation, and he had mentioned his first wife\u2014breaking out in a cold sweat as he did so.</p><p>\u201cI . . . ah . . . believe he\u2019s working somewhere upcountry,\u201d I said. \u201cGuilford? Or was it Paleyville?\u201d</p><p>Actually, it was Hillsboro, but that scarcely mattered, since at the moment, he wasn\u2019t in Hillsboro. He was, in fact, in Cross Creek, come to take delivery of a shipment of barrels for his employer, a brewster. I\u2019d seen him at the cooper\u2019s shop barely an hour earlier, in company with the second Mrs. Morton and their infant daughter. Jezebel Hatfield Morton did not look like the sort of person to be civilized about such things.</p><p>She made a low noise in her throat, indicative of disgust.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dang slippery little weasel. But I\u2019ll kotch up to him yet, don\u2019t you trouble none about that.\u201d She spoke with a casual assurance that boded ill for Isaiah.</p><p>I thought silence was the wiser course, but couldn\u2019t stop myself asking, \u201cWhy do you want him?\u201d Isaiah possessed a certain uncouth amiability, but viewed objectively, he scarcely seemed the sort to inflame one woman, let alone two.</p><p>\u201cWant him?\u201d She looked amused at the thought, and rubbed a solid fist under her reddened nose. \u201cI don\u2019t want him. But ain\u2019t no man runs out on me for some whey-faced trollop. Once I kotch up to him, I mean to stave his head in and nail his fly-bit hide to my door.\u201d</p><p>Spoken by another person, this statement might have passed for rhetoric. As spoken by the lady in question, it was an unequivocal declaration of intent. Miranda\u2019s eyes were round as a frog\u2019s, and her mother\u2019s nearly so.</p><p>Jezebel H. Morton squinted at me, and scratched thoughtfully beneath one massive breast, leaving the fabric of her shirt pasted damply to her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI heerd tell as how you saved the little toad-sucker\u2019s life at Alamance. That true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . yes.\u201d I eyed her warily, watching for any offensive movement. She was blocking the door; if she made for me, I would dive across the counter and dash through the door into the Bogueses\u2019 living quarters.</p><p>She was wearing a large pig-sticker of a knife, unsheathed. This was thrust through a knotted wampum belt that was doing double duty, holding up a kilted mass of what I thought might originally have been red flannel petticoats, hacked off at the knee. Her very solid legs were bare, as were her feet. She had a pistol and powder horn slung from the belt, as well, but made no move to reach for any of her weapons, thank God.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d she said dispassionately. \u201cBut then, if he\u2019d died, I\u2019d not have the fun of killin\u2019 him, so I s\u2019pose it\u2019s as well. Don\u2019t worry me none; if\u2019n I don\u2019t find him, one of my brothers will.\u201d</p><p>Business apparently disposed of for the moment, she relaxed a bit, and looked around, noticing for the first time the empty shelves.</p><p>\u201cWhat-all\u2019s goin\u2019 on here?\u201d she demanded, looking interested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re selling up,\u201d Melanie murmured, attempting to shove Miranda safely behind her. \u201cGoing to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d Jezebel looked mildly interested. \u201cWhat happened? They kill your man? Or tar and feather him?\u201d</p><p>Melanie went white.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Her throat moved as she swallowed, and her frightened gaze went toward the door. So that was the threat. I felt suddenly cold, in spite of the sweltering heat.</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, if you care whether they do, maybe you best move on down to Center Street,\u201d she suggested helpfully. \u201cThey\u2019re fixin\u2019 to make roast chicken out of somebody, sure as God made little green apples. You can smell hot tar all over town, and they\u2019s a boiling of folks comin\u2019 forth from the taverns.\u201d</p><p>Melanie and Miranda uttered twin shrieks, and ran for the door, shoving past the unflappable Jezebel. I was moving rapidly in the same direction, and narrowly avoided a collision, as Ralston Bogues stepped through the door, just in time to catch his hysterical wife.</p><p>\u201cRandy, you go mind your brothers,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cBe still, Mellie, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTar,\u201d she panted, clutching him. \u201cShe said\u2014she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d he said, and I saw that his hair dripped and his face shone pale through its sweat. \u201cThey\u2019re not after me. Not yet. It\u2019s the printer.\u201d</p><p>Gently, he disengaged his wife\u2019s hands from his arm, and stepped round the counter, casting a brief glance of curiosity at Jezebel.</p><p>\u201cTake the children, go to Ferguson\u2019s,\u201d he said, and pulled a fowling piece from its hiding place beneath the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll come so soon as I may.\u201d He reached into a drawer for the powder horn and cartridge box.</p><p>\u201cRalston!\u201d Melanie spoke in a whisper, glancing after Miranda\u2019s retreating back, but the entreaty was no less urgent for its lack of volume. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth twitched, but he didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cGo to Ferguson\u2019s,\u201d he repeated, eyes fixed on the cartridge in his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, don\u2019t go! Come with us, come with me!\u201d She seized his arm, frantic.</p><p>He shook her off, and went doggedly about the business of loading the gun.</p><p>\u201cGo, Mellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not!\u201d Urgent, she turned to me. \u201cMrs. Fraser, tell him! Please, tell him it\u2019s a waste\u2014a terrible waste! He mustn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, unsure what to say to either of them, but had no chance to decide.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine Mistress Fraser will think it a waste, Mellie,\u201d Ralston Bogues said, eyes still on his hands. He slung the strap of the cartridge box over his shoulder and cocked the gun. \u201cHer husband is holding them off right now\u2014by himself.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me then, nodded once, and was gone.</p><p>JEZEBEL WAS RIGHT: you could smell tar all over town. This was by no means unusual in the summertime, especially near the warehouse docks, but the hot thick reek now took on an atmosphere of threat, burning in my nostrils. Tar\u2014and fear\u2014aside, I was gasping from the effort to keep up with Ralston Bogues, who was not precisely running, but was moving as fast as it was possible to go without breaking into a lope.</p><p>Jezebel had been right about the people boiling out of taverns, too; the corner of Center Street was choked with an excited crowd. Mostly men, I saw, though there were a few women of the coarser type among them, fishwives and bond servants.</p><p>The apothecary hesitated when he saw them. A few faces turned toward him; one or two plucked at their neighbors\u2019 sleeves, pointing\u2014and with not very friendly expressions on their faces.</p><p>\u201cGet away, Bogues!\u201d one man yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s not your business\u2014not yet!\u201d</p><p>Another stooped, picked up a stone, and hurled it. It clacked harmlessly on the wooden walk, a few feet short of Bogues, but it drew more attention. Bits of the crowd were beginning to turn, surging slowly in our direction.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d said a small, breathless voice behind me. I turned to see Miranda, cap lost and pigtails unraveling down her back, her face the color of beetroot from running.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to think about it. I picked her up and swung her off her feet, toward her father. Taken off guard, he dropped the gun and caught her under the arms.</p><p>A man lunged forward, reaching for the gun, but I swooped down and got it first. I backed away from him, clutching it to my chest, daring him with my eyes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know him, but he knew me; his eyes flicked over me, hesitating, then he glanced back over his shoulder. I could hear Jamie\u2019s voice, and a lot of others, all trying to shout each other down. The breath was still whistling in my chest; I couldn\u2019t make out any words. The tone of it was argument, though; confrontation, not bloodshed. The man wavered, glanced at me, away\u2014then turned and shoved his way back into the gathering crowd.</p><p>Bogues had had the sense to keep hold of his daughter, who had her arms wrapped tightly round his neck, face buried in his shirt. He darted his eyes at me, and made a small gesture, as though to take back the gun. I shook my head and held it tighter. The stock was warm and slick in my hands.</p><p>\u201cTake Miranda home,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014do something.\u201d</p><p>It was loaded and primed. One shot. The best I could do with that was to create a momentary distraction\u2014but that might help.</p><p>I pushed my way through the crowd, the gun pointed carefully down not to spill the powder, half-hidden in my skirts. The smell of tar was suddenly much stronger. A cauldron of the stuff lay overturned in front of the printer\u2019s shop, a black sticky puddle smoking and reeking in the sun.</p><p>Glowing embers and blackened chunks of charcoal were scattered across the street, under everyone\u2019s feet; a solid citizen whom I recognized as Mr. Townsend was kicking the bejesus out of a hastily built fire, thwarting the attempts of a couple of young men to rebuild it.</p><p>I looked for Jamie and found him precisely where Ralston Bogues had said he was\u2014in front of the door to the printer\u2019s shop, clutching a tar-smeared broom and with the light of battle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cThat your man?\u201d Jezebel Morton had caught up, and was peering interestedly over my shoulder. \u201cBig \u2019un, ain\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Tar was spattered all over the front of the shop\u2014and Jamie. A large glob was stuck in his hair, and I could see the flesh of his arm reddened where a long string of hot tar had struck. Despite this, he was grinning. Two more tar-daubed brooms lay on the ground nearby, one broken\u2014almost certainly over someone\u2019s head. At least for the moment, he was having fun.</p><p>I didn\u2019t at once see the printer, Fogarty Simms. Then a frightened face showed briefly at the window, but ducked out of sight as a rock flung from the crowd crashed into the window frame, cracking the glass.</p><p>\u201cCome out, Simms, you slinkin\u2019 coward!\u201d bellowed a man nearby. \u201cOr shall we smoke you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke him! Smoke him!\u201d Enthusiastic shouts came from the crowd, and a young man near me bent, scrabbling after a burning brand scattered from the fire. I stamped viciously on his hand as he grasped it.</p><p>\u201cJesus God!\u201d He let go and fell to his knees, clutching his hand between his thighs, open-mouthed and gasping with pain. \u201cOh, oh, Jesus!\u201d</p><p>I edged away, shouldering my way through the press. Could I get near enough to give Jamie the gun? Or would that make matters worse?</p><p>\u201cGet away from the door, Fraser! We\u2019ve no quarrel with you!\u201d</p><p>I recognized that cultivated voice; it was Neil Forbes, the lawyer. He wasn\u2019t dressed in his usual natty suiting, though; he wore rough homespun. So it wasn\u2019t an impromptu attack\u2014he\u2019d come prepared for dirty work.</p><p>\u201cHey! You speak for yourself, Forbes! I\u2019ve a quarrel with him!\u201d That was a burly man in a butcher\u2019s apron, red-faced and indignant, sporting a swollen and empurpled eye. \u201cLook what he did to me!\u201d He waved a meaty hand at the eye, then at the front of his clothing, where a tar-clotted broom had quite evidently caught him square in the chest. He shook a massive fist at Jamie. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this, Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but I\u2019ll pay ye in the same coin, Buchan!\u201d Jamie feinted, broom held like a lance. Buchan yelped and skittered backward, face comically alarmed, and the crowd burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cCome back, man! Ye want to play savage, ye\u2019ll need a bit more paint!\u201d Buchan had turned to flee, but was blocked by the crowd. Jamie lunged with the broom, smudging him neatly on the seat of his breeches. Buchan leaped in panic at the jab, causing more laughter and hoots of derision as he shoved and stumbled out of range.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of ye want to play savage, too, do ye?\u201d Jamie shouted. He swiped his broom through the steaming puddle and swung it hard in a wide arc before him. Droplets of hot tar flew through the air, and men yelled and pushed to get out of the way, stepping on each other and knocking each other down.</p><p>I was shoved to one side and fetched up hard against a barrel standing in the street. I would have fallen, save for Jezebel, who caught me by the arm and hauled me up, with no apparent effort.</p><p>\u201cYon feller\u2019s right rumbustious,\u201d she said with approval, eyes fixed on Jamie. \u201cI could admire me a man like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, nursing a bruised elbow. \u201cSo could I. Sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Such sentiments appeared not to be universal.</p><p>\u201cGive him up, Fraser, or wear feathers with him! Frigging Tories!\u201d</p><p>The shout came from behind me, and I turned to see that the speaker had come prepared; he clutched a feather pillow in one hand, the end of it already ripped open, so that down feathers flew in spurts with each gesture.</p><p>\u201cTar and feather \u2019em all!\u201d</p><p>I turned again at the shout from above, and looked up in time to see a young man fling wide the shutters in the upper story of the house on the other side of the street. He was trying to stuff a feather bed through the window but was being substantially impeded in this endeavor by the housewife whose property it was. This lady had leaped on his back and was beating him about the head with a spurtle, uttering shrieks of condemnation.</p><p>A young man near me started clucking like a chicken, flapping his elbows\u2014to the intense amusement of his friends, who all began to do it, too, drowning out any attempts at reason\u2014not that there was much of that.</p><p>A chant started up at the far side of the street.</p><p>\u201cTory, Tory, Tory!\u201d</p><p>The tenor of the situation was changing, and not for the better. I half-lifted the fowling piece, unsure what to do, but knowing that I must do something. Another moment, and they\u2019d rush him.</p><p>\u201cGive me the gun, Auntie,\u201d said a soft voice at my shoulder, and I whirled round to find Young Ian there, breathing hard. I gave it to him without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>\u201cReste d\u2019retour!\u201d Jamie shouted in French. \u201cOui, le tout! Stay back, all of you!\u201d He might have been shouting at the crowd, but he was looking at Ian.</p><p>What the devil did he\u2014then I caught sight of Fergus, elbowing viciously to keep his place near the front of the crowd. Young Ian, who had been about to raise the gun, hesitated, holding it close.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, stay back!\u201d I said urgently. \u201cDon\u2019t fire, not yet.\u201d I saw now that a hasty shot might do more harm than good. Look at Bobby Higgins and the Boston Massacre. I didn\u2019t want any massacres taking place in Cross Creek\u2014particularly not with Jamie at the center of them.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2014but I\u2019m no going to let them take him, either,\u201d Ian muttered. \u201cIf they go for him\u2014\u201d He broke off, but his jaw was set, and I could smell the sharp scent of his sweat, even above the reek of tar.</p><p>A momentary distraction had intervened, thank God. Yells from above made half the crowd turn to see what was happening.</p><p>Another man\u2014evidently the householder\u2014had popped up in the window above, jerking the first man back and punching him. Then the struggling pair disappeared from view, and within a few seconds, the sounds of altercation ceased and the woman\u2019s shrieks died away, leaving the feather bed hanging in limp anticli**x, half in and half out of the window.</p><p>The chant of \u201cTory Tory Tory!\u201d had died out during the fascination with the conflict overhead, but was now starting up again, punctuated by bellows for the printer to come out and give himself up.</p><p>\u201cCome out, Simms!\u201d Forbes bellowed. I saw that he had equipped himself with a fresh broom, and was edging closer to the print shop\u2019s door. Jamie saw him, too, and I saw his mouth twist with derision.</p><p>Silas Jameson, the proprietor of a local ordinary, was behind Forbes, crouched like a wrestler, his broad face wreathed in a vicious grin.</p><p>\u201cCome out, Simms!\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhat kind of man takes shelter beneath a Scotsman\u2019s skirts, eh?\u201d</p><p>Jameson\u2019s voice was loud enough that everyone heard that, and most laughed\u2014including Jamie.</p><p>\u201cA wise one!\u201d Jamie shouted back, and shook the end of his plaid at Jameson. \u201cThis tartan\u2019s sheltered many a poor lad in its time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd many a lassie, too, I\u2019ll wager!\u201d shouted some ribald soul in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat, d\u2019ye think I\u2019ve your wife under my plaid?\u201d Jamie was breathing hard, shirt and hair pasted to him with sweat, but still grinning as he seized the hem of his kilt. \u201cYe want to come and have a look for her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there room under there for me, too?\u201d called one of the fishwives promptly.</p><p>Laughter rolled through the crowd. Fickle as any mob, their mood was changing back from threat to entertainment. I took a deep, trembling breath, feeling sweat roll down between my br**sts. He was managing them, but he was walking a razor\u2019s edge.</p><p>If he\u2019d made up his mind to protect Simms\u2014and he had\u2014then no power on earth would make him give the printer up. If the mob wanted Simms\u2014and they did\u2014they\u2019d have to go through Jamie. And they would, I thought, any minute.</p><p>\u201cCome out, Simms!\u201d yelled a voice from the Scottish Lowlands. \u201cYe canny be hidin\u2019 up Fraser\u2019s backside all day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter a printer up my arse than a lawyer!\u201d Jamie shouted back, waving his broom at Forbes in illustration. \u201cThey\u2019re smaller, aye?\u201d</p><p>That made them roar; Forbes was a beefily substantial sort, while Fogarty Simms was a pinched starveling of a man. Forbes went very red in the face, and I saw sly looks being cast in his direction. Forbes was in his forties, never married, and there was talk . . .</p><p>\u201cI wouldna have a lawyer up my backside at all,\u201d Jamie was shouting happily, poking at Forbes with his broom. \u201cHe\u2019d steal your shite and charge ye for a clyster!\u201d</p><p>Forbes\u2019s mouth opened, and his face went purple. He backed up a step, and seemed to be shouting back, but no one could hear his response, drowned as it was by the roar of laughter from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he\u2019d sell it back to ye for night soil!\u201d Jamie bellowed, the instant he could be heard. Neatly reversing his broom, he jabbed Forbes in the belly with the handle.</p><p>The crowd whooped in glee, and Forbes, no kind of a fighter, lost his head and charged Jamie, his own broom held like a shovel. Jamie, who had quite obviously been waiting for some such injudicious move, stepped aside like a dancer, tripped Forbes, and smacked him across the shoulders with the tar-smeared broom, sending him sprawling into the cooling tar puddle, to the raucous delight of the whole street.</p><p>\u201cHere, Auntie, hold this!\u201d The fowling piece was thrust suddenly back into my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Completely taken aback, I whirled round to see Ian moving fast behind the crowd, beckoning to Fergus. In seconds, unnoticed by the crowd\u2014whose attention was riveted on the fallen Forbes\u2014they had reached the house where the feather bed hung from the window.</p><p>Ian stooped and cupped his hands; as though they had rehearsed it for years, Fergus stepped into this improvised stirrup and launched himself upward, swiping at the feather bed with his hook. It caught; he dangled for a moment, grabbing frantically with his sound hand at the hook, to keep it from coming off.</p><p>Ian sprang upward and seized Fergus round the waist, yanking downward. Then the fabric of the bed gave way under their combined weight, Fergus and Ian tumbled to the ground, and a perfect cascade of goose feathers poured out on top of them, only to be caught at once by the thick, damp air and whirled up into a delirious snowstorm that filled the street and plastered the surprised mob with clumps of sticky down.</p><p>The air seemed filled with feathers; they were everywhere, tickling eyes and nose and throat, sticking to hair and clothes and lashes. I wiped a bit of down from a watering eye and stepped hastily back, away from the half-blind people staggering near me, yelling and bumping into one another.</p><p>I had been watching Fergus and Ian, but when the featherstorm struck, I\u2014unlike everyone else in the street\u2014looked back at the print shop, in time to see Jamie reach through the door, seize Fogarty Simms by the arm, and snatch him out of the shop like a winkle on a pin.</p><p>Jamie gave Simms a shove that sent him staggering, then whirled back to snatch up his broom and cover the printer\u2019s escape. Ralston Bogues, who had been lurking in the shadow of a tree, popped out, a club in his hand, and ran after Simms to protect him, glancing back and brandishing the club to discourage pursuers.</p><p>This action had not gone totally unnoticed; though most of the men were distracted, batting and clawing at the bewildering cloud of feathers that surrounded them, a few had seen what was going on, and raised a halloo, yelping like hounds as they tried to push through the crowd in pursuit of the fleeing printer.</p><p>If ever there was a moment . . . I\u2019d shoot above their heads and they\u2019d duck, giving Simms time to get away. I raised the gun with decision, reaching for the trigger.</p><p>The fowling piece was snatched from my grasp so deftly that I didn\u2019t realize for an instant that it was gone, but stood staring in disbelief at my empty hands. Then a bellow came from behind me, loud enough to stun everyone nearby into silence.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah Morton! You gonna die, boy!\u201d</p><p>The fowling piece went off by my ear with a deafening bwoom! and a cloud of soot that blinded me. Choking and coughing, I scrubbed at my face with my apron, recovering sight in time to see the short, pudgy figure of Isaiah Morton a block away, running as fast as his legs would carry him. Jezebel Hatfield Morton was after him in an instant, ruthlessly flattening anyone in her way. She leapt nimbly over a besmeared and befeathered Forbes, who was still on his hands and knees, looking dazed, then pushed through the remnants of the mob and hared down the street, short flannel petticoats flying, moving at a surprising rate of speed for someone of her build. Morton careened round a corner and disappeared, implacable Fury close on his tail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt a trifle dazed myself. My ears were still ringing, but I looked up at a touch on my arm.</p><p>Jamie was squinting down at me, one eye closed, as though unsure he was seeing what he thought he was seeing. He was saying something I couldn\u2019t make out, but the gestures he was making toward my face\u2014coupled with a telltale twitching of the corner of his mouth\u2014made his probable meaning quite clear.</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d I said coldly, my own voice sounding tinny and far off. I swiped at my face again with the apron. \u201cYou should talk!\u201d</p><p>He looked like a piebald snowman, with black splotches of tar on his shirt, and clumps of white goose down clinging to his brows, his hair, and the stubble of his beard. He said something else, but I couldn\u2019t hear him clearly. I shook my head and twisted a finger in my ear, indicating temporary deafness.</p> <p>He smiled, took me by the shoulders, and leaned his head forward until his forehead met mine with a small thunk! I could feel him trembling slightly, but wasn\u2019t sure whether it was laughter or exhaustion. Then he straightened up, kissed my forehead, and took me by the arm.</p><p>Neil Forbes sat in the middle of the street, legs splayed and careful hair disheveled. He was black with tar from the shoulder to the knee on one side. He\u2019d lost a shoe, and helpful parties were trying to pick the feathers off him. Jamie led me in a wide circle round him, nodding pleasantly as we passed.</p><p>Forbes looked up, glowering, and said something muffled, heavy face twisting in dislike. On the whole, I thought it was just as well I couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>IAN AND FERGUS HAD gone off with the majority of the rioters, no doubt to commit mayhem elsewhere. Jamie and I retired to the Sycamore, an inn on River Street, to seek refreshment and make repairs. Jamie\u2019s hilarity gradually subsided as I picked tar and feathers off him, but was significantly quenched by hearing an account of my visit to Dr. Fentiman.</p><p>\u201cYe do what with it?\u201d Jamie had flinched slightly during my recounting of the tale of Stephen Bonnet\u2019s testicle. When I reached a description of the penis syringes, he crossed his legs involuntarily.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you work the needlelike bit down in, of course, and then flush a solution of something like mercuric chloride through the urethra, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the, er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to show you?\u201d I inquired. \u201cI left my basket at the Bogueses\u2019, but I can get it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He leaned forward and planted his elbows firmly on his knees. \u201cD\u2019ye suppose it burns much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think it\u2019s at all pleasant.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered briefly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I shouldna think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really effective, either,\u201d I added thoughtfully. \u201cPity to go through something like that, and not be cured. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He was watching me with the apprehensive air of a man who has just realized that the suspicious-looking parcel sitting next to him is ticking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d he began, and I hurried to finish.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t mind going round to Mrs. Sylvie\u2019s and making the arrangements for me to treat the girls, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Mrs. Sylvie?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThe owner of the local brothel,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cDr. Fentiman\u2019s maid told me about her. Now, I realize that there might be more than one brothel in town, but I think that Mrs. Sylvie must certainly know the competition, if there is any, so she can tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie drew a hand down over his face, pulling down his lower eyelids so that the bloodshot appearance of his eyes was particularly emphasized.</p> <p>\u201cA brothel,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYe want me to go to a brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go with you if you like, of course,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I think you might manage better alone. I\u2019d do it myself,\u201d I added, with some asperity, \u201cbut I think they might not pay any attention to me.\u201d</p><p>He closed one eye, regarding me through the other, which looked as though it had been sandpapered.</p><p>\u201cOh, I rather think they would,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is what ye had in mind when ye insisted on coming to town with me, is it?\u201d He sounded a trifle bitter.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThough I really did need cinchona bark. Besides,\u201d I added logically, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t come, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about Bonnet. Or Lucas, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>He said something in Gaelic, which I interpreted roughly as an indication that he could have lived quite happily in ignorance of either party.</p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re quite accustomed to brothels,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou had a room in one, in Edinburgh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I wasna marrit, then\u2014or rather I was, but I\u2014aye, well, I mean it quite suited me, at the time, to have folk think that I\u2014\u201d He broke off and looked at me pleadingly. \u201cSassenach, d\u2019ye honestly want everyone in Cross Creek to think that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they won\u2019t think that if I go with you, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>At this point, he dropped his head into his hands and massaged his scalp vigorously, presumably under the impression that this would help him figure out some means of thwarting me.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sense of compassion for your fellow man?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want some hapless fellow to be facing a session with Dr. Fentiman\u2019s syringe, just because you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m no required to face it myself,\u201d he assured me, raising his head, \u201cmy fellow man is welcome to the wages of sin, and serve him just right, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m rather inclined to agree,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t only them. It\u2019s the women. Not just the whores; what about all the wives\u2014and the children\u2014of the men who get infected? You can\u2019t let all of them die of the pox, if they can be saved, surely?\u201d</p><p>He had by this time assumed the aspect of a hunted animal, and this line of reasoning did not improve it.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014the penicillin doesna always work,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhat if it doesna work on the whores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut between trying something that might not work\u2014and not trying at all . . .\u201d Seeing him still looking squiggle-eyed, I dropped the appeal to reason and resorted to my best weapon.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Young Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d he replied warily, but I could see that my words had caused an instant vision to spring up in his mind. Ian was not a stranger to brothels\u2014thanks to Jamie, inadvertent and involuntary as the introduction had been.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good lad, Ian,\u201d he said, stoutly. \u201cHe wouldna . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea of the shape of Young Ian\u2019s private life\u2014if he had one. But he was twenty-one, unattached, and so far as I could see, a completely healthy young male of the species. Hence . . .</p><p>I could see Jamie coming reluctantly to the same conclusions. He had been a virgin when I married him, at the age of twenty-three. Young Ian, owing to factors beyond everyone\u2019s control, had been introduced to the ways of the flesh at a substantially earlier age. And that particular innocence could not be regained.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said.</p><p>He picked up the towel, rubbed his hair ferociously with it, then flung it aside, and gathered back the thick, damp tail, reaching for a thong to bind it.</p><p>\u201cIf it were done when \u2019tis done, \u2019twere well it were done quickly,\u201d I said, watching with approval. \u201cI think I\u2019d best come, too, though. Let me fetch my box.\u201d</p><p>He made no response to this, merely setting grimly about the task of making himself presentable. Luckily he hadn\u2019t been wearing his coat or waistcoat during the contretemps in the street, so was able to cover the worst of the damage to his shirt.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said, and I turned to find him regarding me with a bloodshot glint.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll pay for this.\u201d</p><p>MRS. SYLVIE\u2019S ESTABLISHMENT was a perfectly ordinary-looking two-storied house, small and rather shabby. Its shingles were curling up at the ends, giving it a slight air of disheveled surprise, like a woman taken unawares with her hair just out of rollers.</p><p>Jamie made disapproving Scottish noises in his throat at sight of the sagging stoop and overgrown yard, but I assumed that this was merely his way of covering discomfiture.</p><p>I was not quite sure what I had been expecting Mrs. Sylvie to be\u2014the only madam of my acquaintance having been a rather elegant French \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Edinburgh\u2014but the proprietor of Cross Creek\u2019s most popular bawdy house was a woman of about twenty-five, with a face as plain as piecrust, and extremely prominent ears.</p><p>In fact, I had momentarily assumed her to be the maid, and only Jamie\u2019s greeting her politely as \u201cMrs. Sylvie\u201d informed me that the madam herself had answered the door. I gave Jamie a sideways look, wondering just how he came to be acquainted with her, but then looked again and realized that he had noted the good quality of her gown and the large brooch upon her bosom.</p><p>She looked from him to me, and frowned.</p><p>\u201cMay we come in?\u201d I said, and did so, not waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Fraser, and this is my husband,\u201d I said, gesturing toward Jamie, who was looking pink around the ears already.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Mrs. Sylvie said warily. \u201cWell, it\u2019ll be a pound extra, if it\u2019s the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your\u2014oh!\u201d Hot blood flooded my face as I belatedly grasped her meaning. Jamie had got it instantly, and was the color of beetroot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right,\u201d she assured me. \u201cNot the usual, to be sure, but Dottie wouldn\u2019t mind a bit, she being summat partial to women, you see.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a low growling noise, indicating that this was my idea and it was up to me to be carrying it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we didn\u2019t make ourselves clear,\u201d I said, as charmingly as possible. \u201cWe . . . er . . . we merely wish to interview your\u2014\u201d I stopped, groping for an appropriate word. Not \u201cemployees,\u201d surely.</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d Jamie put in tersely.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. Girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do.\u201d Her small bright eyes darted back and forth between us. \u201cMethody, are you? Or Bright Light Baptists? Well, that\u2019ll be two pound, then. For the nuisance.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cCheap at the price,\u201d he observed. \u201cOr is that per girl?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Sylvie\u2019s mouth twitched a little.</p><p>\u201cOh, per girl, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo pound per soul? Aye, well, who would put a price on salvation?\u201d He was openly teasing now, and she\u2014having plainly made out that we were neither potential clients nor door-to-door missionaries\u2014was amused, but taking care not to seem so.</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she replied dryly. \u201cA whore knows the price of everything but the value of nothing\u2014or so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded at this.</p><p>\u201cAye. What\u2019s the price of one of your girls\u2019 lives, then, Mrs. Sylvie?\u201d</p><p>The look of amusement vanished from her eyes, leaving them just as bright, but fiercely wary.</p><p>\u201cDo you threaten me, sir?\u201d She drew herself up tall, and put her hand on a bell that stood on the table near the door. \u201cI have protection, sir, I assure you. You would be well-advised to leave at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wished to damage ye, woman, I should scarcely bring my wife along to watch,\u201d Jamie said mildly. \u201cI\u2019m no so much a pervert as all that.\u201d</p><p>Her hand, tight on the bell\u2019s handle, relaxed a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cMind,\u201d she said, pointing a finger at him, \u201cI don\u2019t deal in such things\u2014never think it\u2014but I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d said Jamie, the teasing tone gone from his voice. \u201cTell me, have ye maybe heard of a Scotsman called Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>Her face changed at that; clearly she had. I was bewildered, but had the sense to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d she said. Her gaze had sharpened. \u201cThat was you, was it?\u201d</p><p>He bowed gravely.</p><p>Mrs. Sylvie\u2019s mouth pursed briefly, then she seemed to notice me again.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I said, giving him an eye. He sedulously avoided my glance.</p><p>Mrs. Sylvie uttered a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cOne of my girls went with a man to the Toad\u201d\u2014naming a low sort of dive near the river, called the Toad and Spoon\u2014\u201cand he dealt badly with her. Then dragged her out to the taproom and offered her to the men there. She said she knew she was dead\u2014you know it is possible to be raped to death?\u201d This last was addressed to me, in a tone that mingled aloofness with challenge.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, very shortly. A brief qualm ran through me and my palms began to sweat.</p><p>\u201cA big Scotchman was there, though, and he took issue with the proposal, apparently. It was him alone, though, against a mob\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour specialty,\u201d I said to Jamie, under my breath, and he coughed.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but he suggested that they deal cards for the girl. Played a game of brag, and won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said politely. Cheating at cards was another of his specialties, but one I tried to discourage his using, convinced that it would get him killed one day. No wonder he hadn\u2019t told me about this particular adventure.</p><p>\u201cSo he picked up Alice, wrapped her in his plaid, and brought her home\u2014left her at the door.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jamie with grudging admiration.</p><p>\u201cSo. Have you come to claim a debt, then? You have my thanks, for what they may be worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great deal, madam,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut no. We\u2019ve come to try to save your girls from worse than drunken raparees.\u201d</p><p>Her thin brows arched high in question.</p><p>\u201cFrom the pox,\u201d I said baldly. Her mouth fell open.</p><p>For all her relative youth, Mrs. Sylvie was a hard customer, and no easy sell. While fear of the pox was a constant factor in the life of a whore, talk of spirochetes cut no ice with her, and my proposition that I inject her staff\u2014there were only three girls, it appeared\u2014with penicillin met with a firm refusal.</p><p>Jamie allowed the wrangling to go on until it became clear we had reached a stone wall. Then he came in on a different tack.</p><p>\u201cMy wife isna proposing such a course only from the goodness of her heart, ken?\u201d he said. By now, we had been invited to sit, in a neat little parlor adorned with gingham curtains, and he leaned forward gingerly, so as not to strain the joints of the delicate chair he was sitting on.</p><p>\u201cThe son of a friend came to my wife, saying he\u2019d contracted the syphilis from a whore in Hillsboro. She saw the sore; there is no question but that the lad is poxed. He panicked, though, before she was able to treat him, and ran. We have been looking for him ever since\u2014and heard just yesterday that he had been seen here, in your establishment.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Sylvie lost control of her face for an instant. It was back in a moment, but there was no mistaking the look of horror.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cA Scotch lad? What did he look like?\u201d</p><p>Jamie exchanged a brief, quizzical glance with me, and described Manfred McGillivray. By the time he had finished, the young madam\u2019s face was white as a sheet.</p><p>\u201cI had him,\u201d she said. \u201cTwice. Oh, Jesus.\u201d She took a couple of deep breaths, though, and rallied.</p><p>\u201cHe was clean, though! I made him show me\u2014I always do.\u201d</p><p>I explained that while the chancre healed, the disease remained in the blood, only to emerge later. After all, had she not known of whores who contracted syphilis, without any exhibition of a previous sore?</p><p>\u201cYes, of course\u2014but they can\u2019t have taken proper care,\u201d she said, jaw set stubbornly. \u201cI always do, and my girls, too. I insist upon it.\u201d</p><p>I could see denial setting in. Rather than admit she might be harboring a deadly infection, she would insist it was not possible, and within moments would have talked herself into believing it and would throw us out.</p><p>Jamie could see it, too.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sylvie,\u201d he said, interrupting her flow of justifications. She looked at him, blinking.</p><p>\u201cHave ye a deck of cards in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2014yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them, then,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cGleek, loo, or brag, your choice.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a long, hard look, her mouth pressed tight. Then it relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cHonest cards?\u201d she asked, and a small gleam showed in her eye. \u201cAnd for what stakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest cards,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIf I win, my wife injects the lot of ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cask of my best whisky.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment longer, eyeing him narrowly, estimating the odds. There was still a blob of tar in his hair, and feathers on his coat, but his eyes were deep blue and guileless. She sighed, and put out a hand.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDID YOU CHEAT?\u201d I asked, grasping his arm to keep from stumbling. It was well after dark by now, and the streets of Cross Creek were not lighted, save by starlight.</p><p>\u201cDidna have to,\u201d he said, and yawned hugely. \u201cShe may be a good whore, but she\u2019s no hand at cards. She should have chosen loo; that\u2019s mostly luck, while brag takes skill. Easier to cheat at loo, though,\u201d he added, blinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly, constitutes a good whore?\u201d I asked curiously. I had never considered the question of qualifications anent that profession, but supposed there must be some, beyond possession of the requisite anatomy and a willingness to make it available.</p><p>He laughed at that, but scratched his head, considering.</p><p>\u201cWell, it helps if she has a genuine liking for men, but doesna take them verra serious. And if she likes to go to bed, that\u2019s as well, too. Ouch.\u201d I had stepped on a rock, and tightening my grip on his arm, had got him on the patch of skin burned by tar earlier in the day.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Is it bad? I have a bit of balm I can put on it, when we get to the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no. Just blisters; it will bide.\u201d He rubbed his arm gingerly, but shrugged off the discomfort, and taking me by the elbow, led me round the corner, toward the main street. We had decided earlier that since we might be late, we would stay at McLanahan\u2019s King\u2019s Inn, rather than make the long drive back to River Run.</p><p>The smell of hot tar still permeated this end of town, and the evening breeze swirled feathers into small drifts at the side of the road; now and then, a down feather floated past my ear like a slow-moving moth.</p><p>\u201cI wonder, are they still picking the feathers off Neil Forbes?\u201d Jamie said, a grin in his voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe his wife will just put a bolster cover on him and use him as a pillow,\u201d I suggested. \u201cNo, wait, he hasn\u2019t got a wife. They\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him a rooster, and put him out in the yard to serve the hens,\u201d Jamie suggested, giggling. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine cock-a-doodle, if no much in the way of a cock.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t drunk\u2014we had drunk weak coffee with Mrs. Sylvie, after the injections\u2014but he was desperately tired; we both were, and suddenly in the state of exhaustion where the lamest joke seems immensely funny, and we staggered, bumping together and laughing at worse and worse jokes until our eyes teared.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jamie said suddenly, drawing a deep, startled breath through his nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s burning?\u201d</p><p>Something substantial; there was a glow in the sky, visible over the roofs of the nearby houses, and the sharp scent of burning wood suddenly overlaid the thicker smell of hot tar. Jamie ran toward the corner of the street, with me hot on his heels.</p><p>It was Mr. Simms\u2019s print shop; well ablaze. Evidently his political enemies, balked of their prey, had decided to vent their animosity on his premises.</p><p>A knot of men was milling in the street, much as they had earlier in the day. Again, there were calls of \u201cTory!\u201d and a few were brandishing torches. More men were running down the street toward the scene of the fire, shouting. I caught a bellow of \u201cGoddamn Whigs!\u201d and then the two groups collided in a flurry of shoving and punching.</p><p>Jamie grabbed my arm and propelled me back the way we had come, out of sight around the corner. My heart was pounding, and I was short of breath; we ducked under a tree and stood panting.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, after a short silence, filled with the shouts of the riot, \u201cI suppose Fergus will have to find a different occupation. There\u2019s an apothecary\u2019s shop going cheap, I know.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a small sound, not quite a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d do better to go into partnership wi\u2019 Mrs. Sylvie,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a business not subject to politics. Come on, Sassenach\u2014we\u2019ll go the long way round.\u201d</p><p>When at length we reached the inn, we found Young Ian fidgeting on the porch, watching out for us.</p><p>\u201cWhere in the name of Bride have you been?\u201d he demanded severely, in a manner that made me think suddenly of his mother. \u201cWe\u2019ve been combin\u2019 the town for ye, Uncle Jamie, and Fergus sure ye\u2019d been caught up in the collieshangie yonder and maimed or killed.\u201d He nodded toward the print shop; the blaze was beginning to die, though there was still enough light from it to see his face, set in a disapproving frown.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing good deeds,\u201d Jamie assured him piously. \u201cVisiting the sick, as Christ commands us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Ian responded, with considerable cynicism. \u201cHe said ye should visit those in prison, too. Too bad ye didna start wi\u2019 that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYon bugger Donner\u2019s escaped, that\u2019s for why,\u201d Ian informed him, seeming to take a grim pleasure in imparting bad news. \u201cDuring the fight this afternoon. The gaoler came to join in the fun, and left the door on the latch; the bugger just walked out and awa\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Jamie inhaled deeply, then let his breath out slowly, coughing slightly from the smoke.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re down by one print shop and one thief\u2014but four whores to the good. D\u2019ye think that a fair exchange, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhores?\u201d Ian exclaimed, startled. \u201cWhat whores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sylvie\u2019s,\u201d I said, peering at him. He looked shifty, though perhaps it was only the light. \u201cIan! You didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course he did, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, resigned. \u201cLook at him.\u201d A guilty expression was spreading over Ian\u2019s features like an oil slick on water, easy to make out, even by the flickering, ruddy light of the dying fire.</p><p>\u201cI found out about Manfred,\u201d Ian offered hastily. \u201cHe went downriver, meaning to find a ship in Wilmington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we found that out, too,\u201d I said a little testily. \u201cWho was it? Mrs. Sylvie or one of the girls?\u201d</p><p>His large Adam\u2019s apple bobbed nervously.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sylvie,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cFortunately, I have some penicillin left\u2014and a nice, dull syringe. Inside with you, Ian, you abandoned wretch, and down with your breeks.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. McLanahan, emerging onto the porch to inquire whether we would like a bit of late supper, overheard this and gave me a startled look, but I was well past caring.</p><p>Sometime later, we lay at last in the haven of a clean bed, safe from the upheavals and turmoils of the day. I had pried the window open, and the faintest of breezes disturbed the heaviness of the thick, hot air. Several soft gray flecks drifted in, feathers or bits of ash, spiraling like snowflakes toward the floor.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s arm lay across me, and I could make out the soft, glaucous shapes of the blisters that covered most of his forearm. The air was harsh with burning, but the smell of tar lay like an abiding threat beneath. The men who had burned Simms\u2019s shop\u2014and come so close to burning Simms, and likely Jamie, as well\u2014were rebels in the making, men who would be called patriots.</p><p>\u201cI can hear ye thinking, Sassenach,\u201d he said. He sounded peaceful, on the verge of sleep. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of tar and feathers,\u201d I said softly, and very gently touched his arm. \u201cJamie\u2014it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answered just as softly.</p><p>Some men went by in the street outside, singing drunkenly, with torches; the flickering light flowed across the ceiling and was gone. I could feel Jamie watch it go, listening to the raucous voices as they faded down the street, but he said nothing, and after a bit, the big body that cradled me began to relax, sinking once again toward sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I whispered, not sure whether he could still hear me. He could.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that ye\u2019d make a really good whore, Sassenach, were ye at all promiscuous,\u201d he replied drowsily.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, quite startled.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m glad ye\u2019re not,\u201d he added, and began to snore.</p><p>57</p><p>THE MINISTER\u2019S RETURN</p><p>September 4, 1774</p><p>ROGER STEERED CLEAR OF Coopersville on his way home. It wasn\u2019t that he feared Ute McGillivray\u2019s wrath, but he didn\u2019t want to tarnish the happiness of his homecoming with coldness nor confrontation. Instead, he took the long way round, winding his way gradually up the steep slope toward the Ridge, pushing through overgrown parts where the forest had taken back the path, and fording small streams.</p><p>His mule splashed out of the last of these at the base of the trail, shaking itself and scattering droplets from its belly. Pausing to wipe sweat from his face, he spotted a movement on a large stone by the bank. Aidan, fishing, affecting not to have seen him.</p><p>Roger reined Clarence up alongside and watched for a moment, saying nothing. Then he asked, \u201cAre they biting well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolerable,\u201d Aidan replied, squinting hard at his line. Then he looked up, a huge grin splitting his face from ear to ear, and flinging down his pole, sprang up, reaching with both hands, so that Roger could grasp his skinny wrists and swing him up onto the saddle in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re back!\u201d he exclaimed, throwing his arms about Roger and burying his face happily in Roger\u2019s chest. \u201cI waited for ye. Are ye a real minister now, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmost. How\u2019d ye know I\u2019d be along today?\u201d</p><p>Aidan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been waitin\u2019 the best part of a week, have I no?\u201d He looked up into Roger\u2019s face, round-eyed and quizzical. \u201cYe dinna look any different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Roger assured him, smiling. \u201cHow\u2019s the belly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrime. Ye want to see my scar?\u201d He leaned back, pulling up his ratty shirttail to display a neat red four-inch weal across the pallid skin.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d Roger approved. \u201cTaking care of your Mam and wee Orrie, then, now ye\u2019re mended, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Aidan puffed his narrow chest. \u201cI brought home six trout for supper last night, and the biggest one the size of me arm!\u201d He stuck out a forearm in illustration.</p><p>\u201cAh, get on wi\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, then!\u201d Aidan said indignantly, then twigged that he was being teased, and grinned.</p><p>Clarence was becoming restive, wanting home, and turned in little circles, stamping his feet and twitching at the reins.</p><p>\u201cBest go. Ye want to ride up wi\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Aidan looked tempted, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNah, then. I promised Mrs. Ogilvie as I should come tell her, the minute ye came.\u201d</p><p>Roger was surprised at that.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Why\u2019s that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a wean last week, what she wants ye to baptize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His heart rose a little at that, and the bubble of happiness he carried inside him seemed to expand a little. His first christening! Or rather\u2014his first official baptism, he thought, with a small pang at the memory of the small O\u2019Brian girl he had buried without a name. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do it until after his ordination, but it was something to look forward to.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll be glad to christen the wean,\u201d he said, lowering Aidan to the ground. \u201cHave her send to tell me when. And dinna forget your wee fish!\u201d he called.</p><p>Aidan grabbed up his pole and the string of silvery fish\u2014none of them longer than the length of a hand\u2014and plunged off into the wood, leaving Roger to turn Clarence\u2019s head toward home.</p> <p>He smelled smoke from a good way down the trail. Stronger than chimney smoke. With all the talk he had heard on his way, regarding the recent events in Cross Creek, he couldn\u2019t help a small feeling of uneasiness, and urged Clarence on with a nudge of the heels. Clarence, scenting home even through the smoke, took the hint with alacrity, and trotted briskly up the steep incline.</p><p>The smell of smoke grew stronger, mixed with an odd musty sort of scent that seemed vaguely familiar. A visible haze grew among the trees, and when they burst out of the undergrowth into the clearing, he was nearly standing in his stirrups with agitation.</p><p>The cabin stood, weathered and solid, and relief dropped him back in the saddle with a force that made Clarence grunt in protest. Smoke rose around the house in thick swirls, though, and the figure of Brianna, swathed like a Muslim with a scarf around her head and face, was dimly visible in the midst of it. He dismounted, took a breath to call out to her, and immediately suffered a coughing fit. The damned groundhog kiln was open, belching smoke like hell\u2019s chimney, and now he recognized the musty scent\u2014scorched earth.</p><p>\u201cRoger! Roger!\u201d She\u2019d seen him, and came running, skirts and scarf ends flying, leaping a stack of cut turves like a mountain goat to hurl herself into his arms.</p><p>He grabbed her and held on, thinking that nothing in life had ever felt better lid weight of her against him and the taste of her mouth, in spite of the fact that she\u2019d plainly eaten onions for lunch.</p> <p>She emerged beaming and wet-eyed from the embrace, long enough to say, \u201cI love you!\u201d then grabbed his face and kissed him again. \u201cI missed you. When did you shave last? I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days ago, when I left Charlotte. I love you, too. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Well, actually no. Jemmy fell out of a tree and knocked out a tooth, but it was a baby tooth and Mama says she doesn\u2019t think it will hurt the permanent one coming in. And Ian got exposed to syphilis, maybe, and we\u2019re all disgusted with him, and Da was nearly tarred and feathered in Cross Creek, and we met Flora MacDonald, and Mama stuck a needle in Aunt Jocasta\u2019s eye, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugh!\u201d Roger said in instinctive revulsion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wouldn\u2019t burst. And I got paid six pounds in painting commissions!\u201d she concluded triumphantly. \u201cI bought some fine wire and silk to make paper screens with, and enough wool for a winter cloak for you. It\u2019s green. The biggest thing, though, is we met another\u2014well, I\u2019ll tell you about that later; it\u2019s complicated. How did it go with the Presbyterians? Is it all right? Are you a minister?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, trying to decide which part of this cataract to respond to, and ended up choosing the last bit, only because he could remember it.</p> <p>\u201cSort of. Have you been taking lessons in incoherence from Mrs. Bug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sort of a minister? Wait\u2014tell me in a minute, I have to open it up some more.\u201d</p><p>With that, she was flitting back across the broken ground toward the gaping hole of the kiln. The tall clay-brick chimney stack rose at one end, looking like a headstone. The scorched turves that had covered it in operation were scattered round it, and the general impression was that of an enormous, smoking grave from which something large, hot, and doubtless demonic had just arisen. Had he been Catholic, he would have crossed himself.</p><p>As it was, he advanced carefully toward the edge, where Brianna was kneeling, reaching across with her shovel to remove another layer of turves from the willow-work frame that arched across the top of the pit.</p><p>Looking down through a roiling haze of smoke, he could see irregularly shaped objects, lying on the earthen shelves that lined the pit. A few he could make out as being bowls or platters. Most of them, though, were vaguely tubular objects, two or three feet long, tapered and rounded at one end, the other slightly flared. They were a dark pinkish color, streaked and darkened with smoke, and looked like nothing so much as a collection of giant barbecued phalluses, a notion that he found nearly as disturbing as the story of Jocasta\u2019s eyeball.</p><p>\u201cPipes,\u201d Brianna said proudly, pointing her shovel at one of these objects. \u201cFor water. Look\u2014they\u2019re perfect! Or they will be, if they don\u2019t crack while they\u2019re cooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific,\u201d Roger said, with a decent show of enthusiasm. \u201cHey\u2014I brought ye a present.\u201d Reaching into the side pocket of his coat, he brought out an orange, which she seized with a cry of delight, though she paused for an instant before digging her thumb into the peel.</p><p>\u201cNo, you eat it; I\u2019ve got another for Jem,\u201d he assured her.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said again, fervently, juice running down her chin. \u201cWhat about the Presbyterians? What did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, basically, it\u2019s all right. I have got the university degree, and enough Greek and Latin to impress them. The Hebrew was a bit lacking, but if I mug that up in the meantime\u2014Reverend Caldwell gave me a book.\u201d He patted the side of his coat.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can just see you preaching in Hebrew to the Crombies and Buchanans,\u201d she said grinning. \u201cSo? What else?\u201d</p><p>There was a fleck of orange pulp stuck to her lip, and he bent on impulse and kissed it off, the tiny burst of sweetness rich and tart on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWell, they examined me as to doctrine and understanding, and we talked a great deal; prayed together for discernment.\u201d He felt somewhat shy talking to her about it. It had been a remarkable experience, like returning to a home he\u2019d never known he\u2019d missed. To confess his calling had been joyful; to do it among people who understood and shared it . . .</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m provisionally a minister of the Word,\u201d he said, looking down at the toes of his boots. \u201cI\u2019ll need to be ordained before I can administer sacraments like marriage and baptism, but that will have to wait until there\u2019a Presbytery Session held somewhere. In the meantime, I can preach, teach, and bury.\u201d</p><p>She was looking at him, smiling, but a little wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy?\u201d she said, and he nodded, unable to speak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cVery happy,\u201d he said at last, his voice hardly audible.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said softly, and smiled a little more genuinely. \u201cI understand. So now you\u2019re sort of handfast with God, is that it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and felt his throat ease. God, he\u2019d have to do something about that; he couldn\u2019t be preaching drunk every Sunday. Talk of giving scandal to the faithful . . .</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it. But I\u2019m properly married to you\u2014I\u2019ll not forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t.\u201d Her smile now was wholehearted. \u201cSince we are married . . .\u201d She gave him a very direct look, one that went through him like a mild electric shock. \u201cJem\u2019s at Marsali\u2019s, playing with Germain. And I\u2019ve never made love to a minister before. It seems kind of wicked and depraved, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, but it didn\u2019t help; he still felt giddy and light-headed, doubtless from the smoke.</p><p>\u201cBehold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant,\u201d he said, \u201cand our bed is green. The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.\u201d He reached out and touched her, gently.</p><p>\u201cThy two br**sts are like two young roes that are twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the Bible,\u201d he assured her gravely. \u201cIt must be so, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about my navel,\u201d she said, but before he could, he saw a small form bounding out of the woods and haring toward them. Aidan, now fishless and panting.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Ogil . . . vie says . . . come now!\u201d he blurted. He gasped a little, recovering enough breath for the rest of the message. \u201cThe wean\u2014she\u2019s poorly, and they want her christened, in case she should die.\u201d</p><p>Roger clapped a hand to his other side; The Book of Common Worship that they\u2019d given him in Charlotte was a small, reassuring weight in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d Brianna was looking at him worriedly. \u201cCatholics can\u2014I mean, a lay person can baptize somebody if it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in that case\u2014yes,\u201d he said, more breathless than he\u2019d been a moment before. He glanced at Brianna, smudged with soot and dirt, her garments reeking of smoke and baked clay rather than myrrh and aloes.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want to come?\u201d He urgently wanted her to say yes.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world,\u201d she assured him, and discarding the filthy scarf, shook out her hair, bright as banners on the wind.</p><p>IT WAS THE OGILVIES\u2019 first child, a tiny girl whom Brianna\u2014with the experience of long motherhood\u2014diagnosed as suffering from a vicious colic, but basically in good health. The frighteningly young parents\u2014they both looked about fifteen\u2014were pathetically grateful for everything: Brianna\u2019s reassurances and advice, her offer to have Claire visit (for they were much too scared to think of approaching the laird\u2019s wife themselves, leave alone the stories they had heard of her) with medicine and food, and most of all, for Roger\u2019s coming to baptize the baby.</p><p>That a real minister\u2014for they could not be convinced otherwise\u2014should appear in this wilderness, and condescend to come confer the blessing of God upon their child\u2014they were overwhelmed by their good fortune.</p><p>Roger and Brianna stayed for some time, and left as the sun was going down, glowing with the faintly self-conscious pleasure of doing good.</p><p>\u201cPoor things,\u201d Brianna said, voice trembling between sympathy and amusement.</p><p>\u201cPoor wee things,\u201d Roger agreed, sharing her sentiments. The christening had gone beautifully; even the screaming, purple-faced infant had suspended operations long enough for him to pour the water on her bald head and claim heaven\u2019s protection for her soul. He felt the greatest joy in it, and immense humility at having been allowed to perform the ceremony. There was only the one thing\u2014and his feelings were still confused between embarrassed pride and deep dismay.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2014\u201d Brianna said, and stopped, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI tried to stop them,\u201d he said, trying to control his voice. \u201cI did try\u2014you\u2019re my witness. Elizabeth, I said. Mairi. Elspeth, perhaps. You heard me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now,\u201d she said, and her voice trembled. \u201cI think Rogerina is a perfectly beautiful name.\u201d Then she lost control, sat down in the grass, and laughed like a hyena.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, the poor wee lassie,\u201d he said, trying\u2014and failing\u2014not to laugh himself. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Thomasina, and even Jamesina, but . . . oh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll call her Ina for short,\u201d Brianna suggested, snuffling and wiping her face on her apron. \u201cOr they can spell it backward\u2014Aniregor\u2014and call her Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a great comfort,\u201d Roger said dryly, and reached down to haul her to her feet.</p><p>She leaned against him and put her arms round him, still vibrating with laughter. She smelled of oranges and burning, and the light of the setting sun rippled in her hair.</p><p>Finally, she stopped, and lifted her head from his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI am my beloved\u2019s, and my beloved is mine,\u201d she said, and kissed him. \u201cYou did good, Reverend. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>PART EIGHT</p><p>The Call</p><p>58</p><p>LOVE ONE ANOTHER</p><p>ROGER TOOK THE DEEPEST breath he could, and shouted as loudly as he could. Which was not very damn loud. Again. And again.</p><p>It hurt. It was aggravating, too; the feeble, choked sound of it made him want to shut up and never open his mouth again. He breathed, shut his eyes, and screamed with all his might, or tried to.</p><p>A searing flash of pain shot down inside his throat on the right, and he broke off, gasping. All right. He breathed gingerly for a moment, swallowing, then did it again.</p><p>Jesus, that hurt.</p><p>He rubbed a sleeve across his watering eyes and braced himself for another go. As he inflated his chest, fists curling, he heard voices, and let the breath out.</p><p>The voices were calling to each other, not far from him, but the wind was away and he couldn\u2019t make out the words. Likely hunters, though. It was a fine fall day, with air like blue wine and the forest restless with dappled light.</p><p>The leaves had just begun to turn, but some were already falling, a silent, constant flicker at the edge of vision. Any movement could look like game in such surroundings, he knew that well. He drew breath to call out, hesitated, and said, \u201cShit,\u201d under his breath. Great. He\u2019d rather be shot in mistake for a deer than embarrass himself by calling out.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d he said to himself, drew breath, and shouted, \u201cHalloooo!\u201d at the top of his voice\u2014reedy and without volume as it was. Again. Again. And yet again. By the fifth time, he was beginning to think he\u2019d rather be shot than go on trying to make them hear him, but at last a faint \u201cHalloooo!\u201d drifted back to him on the crisp, light air.</p><p>He stopped, relieved, and coughed, surprised not to be bringing up blood; his throat felt like raw meat. But he essayed a quick hum, then, cautiously, a rising arpeggio. An octave. Just barely, and it was a strain that sent shooting pains through his larynx\u2014but a full octave. The first time he\u2019d managed that much of a range in pitch since the injury.</p><p>Encouraged by this small evidence of progress, he greeted the hunters cheerfully when they came in view: Allan Christie and Ian Murray, both with long rifles in hand.</p><p>\u201cPreacher MacKenzie!\u201d Allan greeted him, grinning, like an incongruously friendly owl. \u201cWhat are you doing out here all on your owney-o? Rehearsing your first sermon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes,\u201d Roger said pleasantly. It was true, in a way\u2014and there was no other good explanation for what he was doing out in the woods by himself, lacking weapons, snare, or fishing pole.</p><p>\u201cWell, best make it good,\u201d Allan said, wagging his head. \u201cEveryone will be coming. Da\u2019s had Malva hard at it from dawn to dusk, sweeping and cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? Well, do tell her I appreciate it, will ye?\u201d After a good deal of thought, he\u2019d asked Thomas Christie whether the Sunday services might be held in the schoolmaster\u2019s home. It was no more than a rude cabin, like most on the Ridge, but since lessons were held there, the main room was somewhat more commodious than the average. And while Jamie Fraser would certainly have allowed the use of the Big House, Roger felt that his congregation\u2014what a daunting word\u2014might well be uneasy at holding their services in the house of a Papist, accommodating and tolerant though said Papist might be.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re coming, are ye not?\u201d Allan was asking Ian. Ian looked surprised at the invitation, and rubbed an uncertain knuckle beneath his nose.</p><p>\u201cOch, well, but I was baptized Romish, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye\u2019re a Christian, at least?\u201d Allan said with some impatience. \u201cOr no? Some folk do say as how ye turned pagan, with the Indians, and didna turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Ian spoke mildly, but Roger saw his face tighten a little at that. He noticed with interest that Ian didn\u2019t answer the question, though, instead asking him, \u201cWill your wife come to hear ye, cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d he said, mentally crossing his fingers against the day, \u201cand wee Jem, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Bree had asked him, fixing him with a look of rapt intensity, chin slightly lifted, lips just a fraction of an inch apart. \u201cJackie Kennedy. That about right, do you think, or shall I aim for Queen Elizabeth reviewing the troops?\u201d Her lips compressed, the chin drew in a bit, and her mobile face altered from rapt attention to dignified approbation.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mrs. Kennedy, by all means,\u201d he\u2019d assured her. He\u2019d be pleased if she kept a straight face, let alone anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I\u2019ll come along then\u2014if ye dinna think anyone would take it amiss,\u201d Ian added formally to Allan, who dismissed the notion with a hospitable flap of the hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, everyone will be there,\u201d he repeated. The notion made Roger\u2019s stomach contract slightly.</p><p>\u201cOut after deer, are ye?\u201d he asked with a nod toward the rifles, in hopes of turning the conversation toward something other than his own impending debut as a preacher.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Allan answered, \u201cbut then we heard a painter screech, off this way.\u201d He nodded, indicating the wood just around them. \u201cIan said if there\u2019s a painter about, the deer will be long gone.\u201d</p><p>Roger shot a narrow glance at Ian, whose unnaturally blank expression told him more than he wanted to know. Allan Christie, born and raised in Edinburgh, might not know a panther\u2019s scream from a man\u2019s, but Ian most assuredly did.</p><p>\u201cToo bad if it\u2019s frightened away the game,\u201d he said, lifting one brow at Ian. \u201cCome on, then; I\u2019ll walk back with ye.\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D CHOSEN \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself\u201d as the text for his first sermon. \u201cAn oldie but a goodie,\u201d as he\u2019d told Brianna, causing her to fizz slightly. And having heard at least a hundred variations on that theme, he was reasonably sure of having sufficient material to go on for the requisite thirty or forty minutes.</p><p>A standard church service was a great deal longer\u2014several readings of psalms, discussion of the lesson of the day, intercessions for members of the congregation\u2014but his voice wouldn\u2019t take that yet. He was going to have to work up to the full-bore service, which could easily run three hours. He\u2019d arrange with Tom Christie, who was an elder, to do the readings and the earliest parayers, to start with. Then they\u2019d see how things went.</p><p>Brianna was sitting modestly off to one side now, watching him\u2014not like Jackie Kennedy, thank God, but with a hidden smile that warmed her eyes whenever he met her gaze.</p><p>He\u2019d brought notes, in case he should dry up or inspiration fail, but found that he didn\u2019t need them. He\u2019d had a moment\u2019s breathlessness, when Tom Christie, who had read the lesson, snapped shut his Bible and looked significantly at him\u2014but once launched, he felt quite at home; it was a lot like lecturing at university, though God knew the congregation was more attentive by far than his university students usually were. They didn\u2019t interrupt with questions or argue with him, either\u2014at least not while he was talking.</p><p>He was intensely conscious for the first few moments of his surroundings: the faint fug of bodies and last night\u2019s fried onions in the air, the scuffed boards of the floor, scrubbed and smelling of lye soap, and the close press of people, ranged on benches, but so many that they crammed into every bit of standing space, as well. Within a few minutes, though, he lost all sense of anything beyond the faces in front of him.</p><p>Allan Christie hadn\u2019t exaggerated; everyone had come. It was nearly as crowded as it had been during his last public appearance, presiding at old Mrs. Wilson\u2019s untimely resurrection.</p><p>He wondered how much that occasion had to do with his present popularity. A few people were watching him covertly, with a faint air of expectation, as though he might turn water into wine for an encore, but for the most part, they appeared satisfied with the preaching. His voice was hoarse, but loud enough, thank God.</p><p>He believed in what he was saying; after the start he found himself talking more easily, and without the need of concentrating on his speech was able to glance from one person to another, making it seem he spoke to each one personally\u2014meanwhile making fleeting observations in the back of his mind.</p><p>Marsali and Fergus hadn\u2019t come\u2014no surprise there\u2014but Germain was present; he sat with Jem and Aidan McCallum next to Brianna. All three boys had poked each other excitedly and pointed at him when he began to speak, but Brianna had quelled this behavior with some muttered threat of sufficient force to reduce them to simple squirming. Aidan\u2019s mother sat on his other side, looking at Roger with a sort of open adoration that made him uneasy.</p><p>The Christies had the place of honor in the center of the first bench: Malva Christie, demure in a lacy cap, her brother sitting protectively on one side, her father on the other, apparently unaware of the occasional looks shot her way by some of the young men.</p><p>Rather to Roger\u2019s surprise, Jamie and Claire had come, as well, though they stood at the very back. His father-in-law was calmly impassive, but Claire\u2019s face was an open book; she clearly found the proceedings amusing.</p><p>\u201c. . . and if we are truly considering the love of Christ as it is . . .\u201d It was instinct, honed by innumerable lectures, that made him aware that something was amiss. There was some slight disturbance in the far corner, where several half-grown lads had congregated. A couple of the numerous McAfee boys, and Jacky Lachlan, widely known as a limb of Satan.</p><p>No more than a nudge, the glint of an eye, some sense of subterranean excitement. But he sensed it, and kept glancing back at that corner with a narrowed eye, in hopes of keeping them subdued. And so happened to be looking when the serpent slithered out between Mrs. Crombie\u2019s shoes. It was a largish king snake, brightly striped with red, yellow, and black, and it seemed fairly calm, all things considered.</p><p>\u201cNow, ye may say, \u2018Who\u2019s my neighbor, then?\u2019 And a good question, coming to live in a place where half the folk ye meet are strangers\u2014and plenty of them more than a bit strange, too.\u201d</p><p>A titter of appreciation ran through the congregation at that. The snake was casting about in a leisurely sort of way, head raised and tongue flickering with interest as it tested the air. It must be a tame snake; it wasn\u2019t bothered by the crush of people.</p><p>The reverse was not true; snakes were rare in Scotland, and most of the immigrants were nervous of them. Beyond the natural association with the devil, most folk couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t distinguish a poison snake from any other, since the only Scottish snake, the adder, was venomous. They\u2019d have fits, Roger thought grimly, were they to look down and see what was gliding silently along the floorboards by their feet.</p><p>A strangled giggle, cut short, rose from the corner of guilty parties, and several heads in the congregation turned, uttering a censorious \u201cShoosh!\u201d in unison.</p><p>\u201c. . . when I was hungry, ye gave me to eat; when I was thirsty, ye gave me to drink. And who d\u2019ye ken here who would ever turn away even . . . even a Sassenach, say, who came to your door hungry?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of amusement, and slightly scandalized glances at Claire, who was rather pink, but with suppressed laughter, he thought, not offense.</p><p>A quick glance down; the snake, having paused for a rest, was on the move again, snooving its way gently round the end of a bench. A sudden movement caught Roger\u2019s eye; Jamie had seen the snake, and jerked. Now he was standing rigid, eyeing it as though it were a bomb.</p><p>Roger had been sending up brief prayers, in the interstices of his sermon, suggesting that heavenly benevolence might see fit to shoo the snake quietly out the open door at the back. He intensified these prayers, at the same time unobtrusively unbuttoning his coat to allow for freer action.</p><p>If the damned thing came toward the front of the room instead of the back, he\u2019d have to dive forward and try to catch it before it got out in full sight of everyone. That would cause a disturbance, but nothing to what might happen if . . .</p><p>\u201c. . . now ye\u2019ll have noticed what Jesus said, when He spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well . . .\u201d</p><p>The snake was still wrapped halfway round the bench leg, making up its mind. It was no more than three feet from his father-in-law. Jamie was watching it like a hawk, and a visible gloss of sweat had appeared on his brow. Roger was aware that his father-in-law had a fixed dislike of snakes\u2014and no wonder, given that a big rattler had nearly killed him three years before.</p><p>Too far now for Roger to reach the thing; there were three benches of bodies between him and the snake. Bree, who could have dealt with it, was right away on the far side of the room. No help for it, he decided, with an inward sigh of resignation. He\u2019d have to stop the proceedings, and in a very calm voice, call upon someone dependable\u2014who? He cast hastily round, and spotted Ian Murray, who was within reach, thank God, to grasp the thing and take it out.</p><p>He was opening his mouth to do just this, in fact, when the snake, bored with the scenery in its view, slid rapidly round the bench and headed straight along the back row.</p><p>Roger\u2019s eye was on the snake, so he was as surprised as anyone\u2014including the snake, no doubt\u2014when Jamie suddenly stooped and snatched it from the floor, whipping the startled serpent under his plaid.</p><p>Jamie was a large man, and the stir of his movement made several people look over their shoulders to see what had happened. He shifted, coughed, and endeavored to look passionately interested in Roger\u2019s sermon. Seeing that there was nothing to look at, everyone turned back, settling themselves more comfortably.</p><p>\u201c. . . Now, we come across the Samaritans again, do we not, in the story of the Good Samaritan? Ye\u2019ll most of ye ken that one, but for the weans who may not have heard it yet\u2014\u201d Roger smiled at Jem, Germain, and Aidan, who all wriggled like worms and made small, ecstatic squeaks at the thrill of being singled out.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he could see Jamie, standing frozen and pale as his best linen sark. Something was moving about inside said sark, and the barest hint of bright scales showed in his clenched hand\u2014the snake was evidently trying to escape up his arm, being restrained from popping through the neck of the shirt only by Jamie\u2019s desperate grip on its tail.</p><p>Jamie was sweating badly; so was Roger. He saw Brianna frown a little at him.</p><p>\u201c. . . and so the Samaritan told the innkeeper to mind the poor fellow, bind up his wounds, and feed him, and he\u2019d stop to settle the account on his way back from his business. So . . .\u201d</p><p>Roger saw Claire lean close to Jamie, whispering something. His father-in-law shook his head. At a guess, Claire had noticed the snake\u2014she could scarcely fail to\u2014and was urging Jamie to go outside with it, but Jamie was nobly refusing, not wanting to further disrupt the sermon, as he couldn\u2019t go out without pushing past a number of other standees.</p><p>Roger paused to wipe his face with the large handkerchief Brianna had provided for the purpose, and under cover of this, saw Claire reach into the slit of her skirt and draw out a large calico pocket.</p><p>She appeared to be arguing with Jamie in a whisper; he was shaking his head, looking like the Spartan with the fox at his vitals.</p><p>Then the snake\u2019s head appeared suddenly under Jamie\u2019s chin, tongue flicking, and Jamie\u2019s eyes went wide. Claire stood instantly on tiptoe, seized it by the neck, and whipping the astonished reptile out of her husband\u2019s shirt like a length of rope, crammed the writhing ball headfirst into her pocket and jerked shut the drawstring.</p><p>\u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d Roger blurted, to which the congregation obligingly chorused \u201cAmen!\u201d though looking a little puzzled at the interjection.</p><p>The man next to Claire, who had witnessed this rapid sequence of events, stared at her bug-eyed. She stuffed the pocket\u2014now heaving with marked agitation\u2014back into her skirt, dropped her shawl over it, and giving the gentleman beside her a \u201cWhat are you looking at, mate?\u201d sort of stare, faced front and adopted a look of pious concentration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger made it somehow to the end, sufficiently relieved at having the snake in custody that even leading the final hymn\u2014an interminable back-and-forth \u201cline hymn\u201d in which he was obliged to chant each line, this echoed by the congregation\u2014didn\u2019t disconcert him too much, though he had almost no voice left and what there was creaked like an unoiled hinge.</p><p>His shirt was clinging to him and the cool air outside was a balm as he stood shaking hands, bowing, accepting the kind words of his flock.</p><p>\u201cA grand sermon, Mr. MacKenzie, grand!\u201d Mrs. Gwilty assured him. She nudged the wizened gentleman who accompanied her, who might be either her husband or her father-in-law. \u201cWas it no the grand sermon, then, Mr. Gwilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d said the wizened gentleman judiciously. \u201cNo bad, no bad. Bit short, and ye left out the fine story aboot the harlot, but nay doot ye\u2019ll get the way of it in time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNay doubt,\u201d Roger said, nodding and smiling, wondering, What harlot? \u201cThank ye for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wouldna have missed it for the world,\u201d the next lady informed him. \u201cThough the singing wasna quite what one might have hoped for, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. Perhaps next time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did care for Psalm 109, it\u2019s that dreary. Next time, perhaps ye\u2019ll give us one o\u2019 the mair sprightly ones, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I expect\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaddyDaddyDaddy!\u201d Jem cannoned into his legs, clutching him affectionately round the thighs and nearly knocking him over.</p><p>\u201cNice job,\u201d said Brianna, looking amused. \u201cWhat was going on in the back of the room? You kept looking back there, but I couldn\u2019t see anything, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine sermon, sir, fine sermon!\u201d The older Mr. Ogilvie bowed to him, then walked off, his wife\u2019s hand in his arm, saying to her, \u201cThe puir lad canna carry a tune in his shoe, but the preaching wasna sae bad, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>Germain and Aidan joined Jemmy, all trying to hug him at once, and he did his best to encompass them, smile at everyone, and nod agreeably to suggestions that he speak louder, preach in the Gaelic, refrain from Latin (what Latin?) and Popish references, try to look more sober, try to look happier, try not to twitch, and put in more stories.</p><p>Jamie came out, and gravely shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cVerra nice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Roger struggled to find words. \u201cYou\u2014well. Thanks,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cGreater love hath no man,\u201d Claire observed, smiling at him from behind Jamie\u2019s elbow. The wind lifted her shawl, and he could see the side of her skirt moving oddly.</p><p>Jamie made a small amused sound.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Ye might drop by, maybe, and have a word wi\u2019 Rab McAfee and Isaiah Lachlan\u2014perhaps a short sermon on the text, \u2018He who loveth his son chasteneth him betimes?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcAfee and Lachlan. Aye, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Or perhaps he\u2019d just get the McAfees and Jacky Lachlan alone and see to the chastening himself.</p><p>He saw off the last of the congregation, took his leave of Tom Christie and his family with thanks, and headed for home and luncheon, his own family in tow. Normally, there would be another service in the afternoon, but he wasn\u2019t up to that yet.</p><p>Old Mrs. Abernathy was a little way before them on the path, being assisted by her friend, the slightly less-ancient Mrs. Coinneach.</p><p>\u201cA nice-looking lad,\u201d Mrs. Abernathy was remarking, her cracked old voice floating back on the crisp fall air. \u201cBut nervous, och! Sweating rivers, did ye see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, shy, I suppose,\u201d Mrs. Coinneach replied comfortably. \u201cI expect he\u2019ll settle, though, in time.\u201d</p><p>ROGER LAY IN BED, savoring the lingering sense of the day\u2019s accomplishments, the relief of disasters averted, and the sight of his wife, the light from the embers glowing through the thin linen of her shift as she knelt by the hearth, touching her skin and the ends of her hair with light, so that she looked illuminated from within.</p><p>The fire banked for the night, she rose and peered at Jemmy, curled up in his trundle and looking deceptively angelic, before coming to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou look contemplative,\u201d she said, smiling as she climbed onto the mattress. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to think what on earth I might have said that Mr. MacNeill could possibly have thought was Latin, let alone a Catholic reference,\u201d he replied, companionably making room for her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t start singing \u2018Ave Maria\u2019 or anything,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI would have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d he said, and coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t mention the singing, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get better,\u201d she said firmly, and turned, pushing and squirming, to make a nest for herself. The mattress was stuffed with wool, much more comfortable\u2014and a hell of a lot quieter\u2014than corn shucks, but very prone to lumps and odd hollows.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe,\u201d he said, though thinking, Maybe. But it will never be what it was. No point in thinking of that, though; he\u2019d grieved as much as he meant to. It was time to make the best of things and get on.</p><p>Comfortable at last, she turned to him, sighing in contentment as her body seemed to melt momentarily and remold itself around him\u2014one of her many small, miraculous talents. She had put her hair in a thick plait for sleeping, and he ran his hand down its length, recalling the snake with a brief shudder. He wondered what Claire had done with it. Likely set it free in her garden to eat mice, pragmatist that she was.</p><p>\u201cDid you figure out which harlot story it was you left out?\u201d Brianna murmured, moving her h*ps against his in a casual but definitely nonaccidental sort of way.</p><p>\u201cNo. There are a terrible lot of harlots in the Bible.\u201d He took the tip of her ear very gently between his teeth and she drew a deep, sudden breath.</p><p>\u201cWhassa harlot?\u201d said a small, sleepy voice from the trundle.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, mate\u2014I\u2019ll tell ye in the morning,\u201d Roger called, and slid a hand down over Brianna\u2019s very round, very solid, very warm hip.</p><p>Jemmy would almost certainly be asleep in seconds, but they contented themselves with small, secret touches beneath the bedclothes, waiting to be sure he was soundly asleep. He slept like the dead, once firmly in dreamland, but had more than once roused from the drowsy foreshore at very awkward moments, disturbed by his parents\u2019 unseemly noises.</p><p>\u201cIs it like you thought it would be?\u201d Bree asked, putting a thoughtful thumb on his nipple and rotating it.</p><p>\u201cIs what\u2014oh, the preaching. Well, bar the snake . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just that\u2014the whole thing. Do you think . . .\u201d Her eyes searched his, and he tried to keep his mind on what she was saying, rather than what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d His hand clamped over hers, and he took a deep breath. \u201cYeah. Ye mean am I still sure? I am; I wouldna have done such a thing if I weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014Daddy\u2014always said it was a great blessing to have a calling, to know that you were meant to be something in particular. Do you think you\u2019ve always had a\u2014a calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for a time, I had the fixed notion that I was meant to be a deep-sea diver,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh; I mean it. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She looked surprised, then pursed her lips, thinking. \u201cWell, I went to a Catholic school, so we were all urged to think about becoming priests or nuns\u2014but I was pretty sure I didn\u2019t have a religious vocation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, with a fervency that made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd then for quite a while, I thought I should be a historian\u2014that I wanted to be one. And it was interesting,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI could do it. But\u2014what I really wanted was to build things. To make things.\u201d She pulled her hand out from under his and waggled her fingers, long and graceful. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a calling, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ye not think motherhood is a calling, of sorts?\u201d He was on delicate ground here. She was several days late, but neither of them had mentioned it\u2014or was going to, yet.</p><p>She cast a quick glance over her shoulder at the trundle bed, and made a small grimace, whose import he couldn\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cCan you call something that\u2019s accidental for most people a calling?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important\u2014but shouldn\u2019t there be some choice involved?\u201d</p><p>Choice. Well, Jem had been thoroughly an accident, but this one\u2014if there was one\u2014they\u2019d chosen, all right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He smoothed the long rope of her braid against her spine, and she pressed closer in reflex. He thought she felt somehow riper than usual; something about the feel of her br**sts. Softer. Bigger.</p><p>\u201cJem\u2019s asleep,\u201d she said softly, and he heard the surprisingly deep, slow breathing from the trundle. She put her hand back on his chest, the other somewhat lower.</p><p>A little later, drifting toward dreamland himself, he heard her say something, and tried to rouse enough to ask her what it was, but managed only a small interrogative \u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought I do have a calling,\u201d she repeated, looking upward at the shadows in the beamed ceiling. \u201cSomething I was meant to do. But I don\u2019t know yet what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye definitely weren\u2019t meant to be a nun,\u201d he said drowsily. \u201cBeyond that\u2014I couldna say.\u201d</p><p>THE MAN\u2019S FACE was in darkness. He saw an eye, a wet shine, and his heart beat in fear. The bodhrana were talking.</p><p>There was wood in his hand, a tipper, a club\u2014it seemed to change in size, immense, yet he handled it lightly, part of his hand, it beat the drumhead, beat in the head of the man whose eyes turned toward him, shining with terror.</p><p>Some animal was with him, something large and half-seen, brushing eager past his thighs into the dark, urgent for blood, and he after it, hunting.</p><p>The club came down, and down, and upanddown, upanddown, upanddown with the waggle of his wrist, the bodhran live and talking in his bones, the thud that shivered through his arm, a skull breaking inward with a wet, soft sound.</p><p>Joined for that instant, joined closer than man and wife, hearts one, terror and bloodlust both yielding to that soft, wet thud and the empty night. The body fell, and he felt it go away from him, a rending loss, felt earth and pine needles rough against his cheek as he fell.</p><p>The eyes shone wet and empty, and the face slack-lipped in firelight, one he knew, but he knew not the name of the dead, and the animal was breathing in the night behind him, hot breath on his nape. Everything was burning: grass, trees, sky.</p><p>The bodhrana were talking in his bones, but he could not make it out what they said, and he beat the ground, the soft limp body, the burning tree in a rage that made sparks fly, to make the drums leave his blood, speak clearly. Then the tipper flew free, his hand struck the tree and burst into flame.</p><p>He woke with his hand on fire, gasping. He brought his knuckles to his mouth by instinct, tasting silver blood. His heart was hammering so that he could scarcely breathe, and he fought the notion, trying to slow his heart, keep breathing, keep panic at bay, stop his throat closing up and strangling him.</p><p>The pain in his hand helped, distracting him from the thought of suffocation. He\u2019d thrown a punch in his sleep, and hit the log wall of the cabin square. Jesus, it felt like his knuckles had burst. He pressed the heel of his other hand against them, hard, gritting his teeth.</p><p>Rolled onto his side and saw the wet shine of eyes in the ghost of firelight and would have screamed, if he\u2019d had any breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Roger?\u201d Brianna whispered, voice urgent. Her hand touched his shoulder, his back, the curve of his brow, quickly seeking injury.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, fighting for breath. \u201cBad . . . dream.\u201d He wasn\u2019t dreaming of suffocation; his chest was tight, every breath a conscious effort.</p><p>She threw back the covers and rose in a rustle of sheets, pulling him up.</p><p>\u201cSit up,\u201d she said, low-voiced. \u201cWake all the way up. Breathe slow; I\u2019ll make you some tea\u2014well, something hot, at least.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t any breath to protest. The scar on his throat was a vise. The first agony in his hand had subsided; now it began to throb in time to his heart\u2014fine, that was all he needed. He fought back the dream, the sense of drums beating in his bones, and in the struggle, found his breath start to ease. By the time Brianna brought him a mug of hot water poured over something foul-smelling, he was breathing almost normally.</p><p>He declined to drink whatever it was, whereupon she thriftily used it to bathe his scraped knuckles instead.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me about the dream?\u201d She was heavy-eyed, still yearning for sleep, but willing to listen.</p><p>He hesitated, but he could feel the dream hovering in the night-still air, just behind him; to keep silent and lie back in the dark was to invite its return. And perhaps she should know what the dream had told him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a muddle, but to do with the fight\u2014when we went to bring Claire back. The man\u2014the one I killed\u2014\u201d The word stuck in his throat like a bur, but he got it out. \u201cI was smashing in his head, and he fell, and I saw his face again. And suddenly I realized I\u2019d seen him before; I\u2014I know who he was.\u201d The faint horror of knowing the man showed in his voice, and her heavy lashes rose, her eyes suddenly alert.</p><p>Her hand covered his injured knuckles, lightly, questioning.</p><p>\u201cDo ye recall a wretched little thieftaker named Harley Boble? We met him, just the once, at the Gathering at Mount Helicon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. Him? You\u2019re sure? It was dark, you said, and all confused\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I didn\u2019t know, when I hit him, but I saw his face when he fell\u2014the grass was on fire, I saw it clearly\u2014and I saw it again, just now, in the dream, and the name was in my mind when I woke up.\u201d He flexed his hand slowly, grimacing. \u201cIt seems a lot worse, somehow, to kill someone ye know.\u201d And the knowledge of having killed a stranger was quite bad enough. It obliged him to think of himself as one capable of murder.</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t know him, at the time,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cDidn\u2019t recognize him, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s true.\u201d It was, but didn\u2019t help. The fire was smoored for the night, and the room was chilly; he noticed the gooseflesh on her bare forearms, the gold hairs rising. \u201cYou\u2019re cold; let\u2019s go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>The bed still held a faint warmth, and it was unutterable comfort to have her curl close to his back, the heat of her body penetrating his bone-deep chill. His hand still throbbed, but the pain had dulled to a negligible ache. Her arm settled firmly round him, a loose fist curled under his chin. He bent his head to kiss her own knuckles, smooth and hard and round, felt her warm breath on his neck, and had the oddest momentary recollection of the animal in his dream.</p><p>\u201cBree . . . I did mean to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, and tightened her arm around him, as though to save him falling.</p><p>59</p><p>FROGGY GOES A-COURTING</p><p>From Lord John Grey</p><p>Mount Josiah Plantation</p><p>My dear Friend,</p><p>I write in some Perturbation of Spirit.</p><p>You will recall Mr. Josiah Quincy, I am sure. I should not have provided him with a Letter of Introduction to you, had I had any Notion of the eventual Outcome of his Efforts. For I am sure that it is by his Action that your Name is associated with the so-called Committee of Correspondence in North Carolina. A Friend, knowing of my Acquaintance with you, showed me a Missive yesterday, purporting to originate from this Body, and containing a List of its presumed Recipients. Your Name was among these, and the Sight of it in such Company caused me such Concern as to compel me to write at once to inform you of the Matter.</p><p>I should have burned the Missive at once, was it not apparent that it was only one of several Copies. The Others are doubtless in transit through various of the Colonies. You must move at once to disassociate yourself from any such Body, and take Pains that your Name does not appear in Future in such Contexts.</p><p>For be warned: the Mail is not safe. I have received more than one official Document\u2014even some bearing royal Seals!\u2014that not only show Signs of having been opened, but that in some Cases are blatantly marked with the Initials or Signatures of those Men who have intercepted and inspected them. Such Inspection may be imposed either by Whig or Tory, there is no telling, and I hear that Governor Martin himself is now having his Mail directed to his Brother in New York, thus to be brought to him by private Messenger\u2014one of these was a recent Guest at my table\u2014as he cannot trust its secure Delivery within North Carolina.</p><p>I can only hope that no incriminating Document containing your Name falls into the Hands of Persons with the Power to arrest or instigate other Proceedings against the Speakers of such Sedition as appears in it. I apologize most sincerely, if my Inadvertence in introducing Mr. Quincy should in any way have endangered or inconvenienced you, and I will, I assure you, lend my every Effort to correct the Situation so far as may be in my Power.</p><p>Meanwhile, I offer you the Services of Mr. Higgins, should you require secure Delivery of any Document, not merely Letters addressed to myself. He is completely trustworthy, and I will send him regularly to you, in case you may require him.</p><p>Still, I am in Hopes that the Situation overall may yet be retrieved. I think those Hotheads who urge Rebellion must be for the most Part ignorant of the Nature of War, or surely they would not risk its Terrors and Hardships, nor yet think lightly of shedding Blood or the Sacrifice of their own Lives for the sake of so Small a Disagreement with their Parent.</p><p>Feeling in London at present is that the Matter will amount to no more than \u201ca few bloody Noses,\u201d as Lord North puts it, and I trust it may be so.</p><p>This News has also a personal Aspect; my son William has purchased a Lieutenant\u2019s Commission, and will join his Regiment almost immediately. I am of course proud of him\u2014and yet, knowing the Dangers and Hardships of a Soldier\u2019s Life, I confess that I should have preferred him to adopt another Course, either devoting himself to the Conduct of his considerable Estates, or, if he felt this too tame a Life, perhaps entering the Realm of Politics or Commerce\u2014for he has much natural Ability to add to the Power of his Resources, and might well achieve some Influence in such Spheres.</p><p>Those Resources are of course still within my Control, until William shall attain his Majority. But I could not gainsay him, so exigent was his Desire\u2014and so vivid my Memories of myself at that Age, and my Determination to serve. It may be that he will have his Fill of Soldiering quickly, and adopt another Course. And I will admit that the military Life has many Virtues to recommend it, stern as these Virtues may sometimes be.</p><p>On a less alarming Note\u2014</p><p>I find myself returned unexpectedly to the Role of Diplomat. Not, I hasten to add, on behalf of His Majesty, but rather on behalf of Robert Higgins, who begs that I will employ what small Influence I possess in advancing his Prospects for Marriage.</p><p>I have found Mr. Higgins a good and faithful Servant, and am pleased to offer what Assistance I may; I hope you will find yourself similarly disposed, for as you will see, your Advice and Counsel is most urgently desired and, in fact, quite indispensable.</p><p>There is some small Delicacy involved in this Matter, and upon this Point, I would beg your Consideration; your Discretion I of course trust implicitly. It would appear that Mr. Higgins has formed some Attachment to two young Ladies, both resident on Fraser\u2019s Ridge. I have pointed out to him the Difficulty of fighting on two Fronts, as it were, and advised him to concentrate his Forces so as to provide the best chance of Success in his Attack upon a single Object\u2014with, perhaps, the Possibility of falling back to regroup, should his initial Essay fail.</p><p>The two Ladies in question are Miss Wemyss and Miss Christie, both possessed of Beauty and Charm in Abundance, according to Mr. Higgins, who is most eloquent in their Praises. Pressed to choose between them, Mr. Higgins protested that he could not\u2014but after some little Discussion on the matter, has at length settled upon Miss Wemyss as his first Choice.</p><p>This is a practical Decision, and the Reasons for his Choice concern not only the Lady\u2019s undoubted Attractions, but a more mundane Consideration: viz, that the Lady and her Father are both Bond Servants, indentured to you. I am, by Reason of Mr. Higgins\u2019s devoted Service, offering to purchase both Indentures, should this be agreeable to you, upon Miss Wemyss\u2019s Agreement to wed Mr. Higgins.</p><p>I should not wish to deprive you thus of two valued Servants, but Mr. Higgins feels that Miss Wemyss will not wish to leave her Father. By the same Token, he hopes that my offering to free Father and Daughter from Servitude (for I have agreed that I would do so, provided that Mr. Higgins\u2019s Employment with me shall continue) would be sufficient Inducement to overcome any Objections which Mr. Wemyss might present on Account of Mr. Higgins\u2019s lack of Connexions and personal Property, or such other small Impediments to the Marriage as might present themselves.</p><p>I collect that Miss Christie, while equally attractive, has a Father who may be somewhat more difficult of Persuasion, and her social Situation is somewhat higher than that of Miss Wemyss. Still, should Miss Wemyss or her father decline Mr. Higgins\u2019s Offer, I will do my Best, with your Assistance, to devise some Inducement that might appeal to Mr. Christie.</p><p>What think you of this Plan of Attack? I beg you to consider the Prospects carefully, and if you feel that the Proposal might be received favorably, to broach the Matter to Mr. Wemyss and his Daughter\u2014if possible, with such Discretion as not to prejudice a secondary Expedition, should that prove necessary.</p><p>Mr. Higgins is most sensible of his inferior Position, viewed as a potential Groom, and thus most conscious of the Favor he seeks, as is</p><p>Your most humble and obedient Servant,</p><p>John Grey</p><p>\u201c. . . such other small Impediments to the Marriage as might present themselves,\u201d I read, over Jamie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLike being a convicted murderer with a brand on his cheek, no family, and no money, do you think he means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, like that,\u201d Jamie agreed, straightening out the sheets of paper and tapping the edges straight. He was clearly amused by Lord John\u2019s letter, but his brows had drawn together, though I didn\u2019t know whether this was a sign of concern over Lord John\u2019s news about Willie, or merely concentration on the delicate question of Bobby Higgins\u2019s proposal.</p><p>The latter, evidently, for he glanced upward, toward the room that Lizzie and her father shared. No sound of movement came through the ceiling, though I\u2019d seen Joseph go upstairs a little earlier.</p><p>\u201cAsleep?\u201d Jamie asked, eyebrows raised. He looked involuntarily at the window. It was mid-afternoon, and the yard was cheerfully awash in mellow light.</p><p>\u201cCommon symptom of depression,\u201d I said, with a small shrug. Mr. Wemyss had taken the dissolution of Lizzie\u2019s betrothal hard\u2014much more so than had his daughter. Frail-looking to begin with, he had noticeably lost weight, and had withdrawn into himself, speaking only when spoken to, and becoming increasingly hard to rouse from sleep in the mornings.</p><p>Jamie struggled momentarily with the concept of depression, then dismissed it with a brief shake of the head. He tapped the stiff fingers of his right hand thoughtfully on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye think, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s a lovely young man,\u201d I said dubiously. \u201cAnd Lizzie obviously likes him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if the Wemysses were still indentured, Bobby\u2019s proposal would likely have some appeal,\u201d Jamie agreed. \u201cBut they\u2019re not.\u201d He had given Joseph Wemyss his papers of indenture some years earlier, and Brianna had hastily freed Lizzie from her own bond nearly as soon as it was made. That was not a matter of public knowledge, though, since Joseph\u2019s presumed status as a bondsman protected him from service in the militia. Likewise, as a bondmaid, Lizzie benefited from Jamie\u2019s overt protection, as she was considered his property; no one would dare to trouble her or treat her with open disrespect.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019d be willing to engage them as paid servants,\u201d I suggested. \u201cTheir combined salary would likely be a good deal less than the price of two indentures.\u201d We paid Joseph, but his salary was only three pounds a year, though with room, board, and clothing supplied.</p><p>\u201cI will suggest as much,\u201d Jamie said, but with an air of dubiousness. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to speak with Joseph.\u201d He glanced upward once more, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Malva . . .\u201d I said, glancing across the hall and lowering my voice. She was in the surgery, straining liquid from the bowls of mold that provided our supply of penicillin. I had promised to send more to Mrs. Sylvie, with a syringe; I hoped she would use it.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Tom Christie would be receptive, if Joseph isn\u2019t? I think both girls are rather partial to Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a mildly derisive noise at the thought.</p><p>\u201cTom Christie marry his daughter to a murderer, and a penniless murderer at that? John Grey doesna ken the man at all, or he wouldna be suggesting such a thing. Christie\u2019s proud as Nebuchadnezzar, if not more so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, as proud as all that, is he?\u201d I said, amused despite myself. \u201cWho do you think he would find suitable, here in the wilderness?\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted one shoulder in a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHe hasna honored me with his confidences in the matter,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThough he doesna let his daughter walk out wi\u2019 any of the young lads hereabouts; I imagine none seems worthy to him. I shouldna be surprised at all, if he were to contrive some means of sending her to Edenton or New Bern to make a match, and he can contrive a way to do it. Roger Mac says he\u2019s mentioned such a course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He\u2019s getting quite thick with Roger these days, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>A reluctant smile crossed his face at that.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. Roger Mac takes the welfare of his flock to heart\u2014with an eye to his own, nay doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He eyed me for a moment, evidently judging my capacity for keeping secrets.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, ye mustna mention it to Brianna, but Roger Mac has it in mind to make a match between Tom Christie and Amy McCallum.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, but then considered. It wasn\u2019t really a bad idea, though not one that would have occurred to me. Granted, Tom was likely more than twenty-five years older than Amy McCallum, but he was still healthy and strong enough to provide for her and her sons. And she plainly needed a provider. Whether she and Malva could share a house was another question; Malva had had the running of her father\u2019s house since she could manage it. She was amiable, certainly, but I rather thought she had as much pride as her father, and wouldn\u2019t take kindly to being supplanted.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I said dubiously. \u201cPerhaps. What do you mean about Roger\u2019s own welfare, though?\u201d</p><p>Jamie raised one thick eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHave ye not seen the way the widow McCallum looks at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, taken aback. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have, and so has Brianna. She bides her time for the moment\u2014but mark my words, Sassenach: if wee Roger doesna see the widow safely marrit soon, he\u2019ll find hell nay hotter than his own hearth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now. Roger isn\u2019t looking back at Mrs. McCallum, is he?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, he is not,\u201d Jamie said judiciously, \u201cand that\u2019s why he\u2019s still in possession of his balls. But if ye think my daughter is one to stand\u2014\u201d</p><p>We had been speaking in low voices and, at the sound of the surgery door opening, stopped abruptly. Malva poked her head into the study, her cheeks flushed and wispy tendrils of dark hair floating round her face. She looked like a Dresden figurine, despite the stains on her apron, and I saw Jamie smile at her look of eager freshness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, Mrs. Fraser, I\u2019ve strained off all the liquid and bottled it\u2014ye did say that we must feed the slops left over to the pig at once . . . did ye mean the big white sow that lives under the house?\u201d She looked rather doubtful at the prospect, and no wonder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and do it,\u201d I said, rising. \u201cThank you, dear. You go along to the kitchen and ask Mrs. Bug for a bit of bread and honey before you go home, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She curtsied and went off toward the kitchen; I could hear Young Ian\u2019s voice, teasing Mrs. Bug, and saw Malva stop for an instant to pat her cap, twirl a wisp of hair around her finger to make it curl against her cheek, and straighten her slender back before going in.</p><p>\u201cWell, Tom Christie may propose all he likes,\u201d I murmured to Jamie, who had come out into the hall with me and seen her go, \u201cbut yours isn\u2019t the only daughter with a mind of her own and strong opinions.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a small, dismissive grunt and went back to his study, while I continued across the hall, to find a large basin of soggy garbage, the remnants of the latest batch of penicillin-making, neatly collected and standing on the counter.</p><p>Opening the window at the side of the house, I peered out and down. Four feet below was the mound of dirt that marked the white sow\u2019s den beneath the foundation.</p><p>\u201cPig?\u201d I said, leaning out. \u201cAre you at home?\u201d The chestnuts were ripe and falling from the trees; she might well be out in the wood, gorging herself on chestnut mast. But no; there were hoofmarks in the soft soil, leading in, and the sound of stertorous breathing was audible below.</p><p>\u201cPig!\u201d I said, louder and more peremptorily. Hearing the stirring and scraping of an enormous bulk beneath the floorboards, I leaned out and dropped the wooden basin neatly into the soft dirt, spilling only a little of its contents.</p><p>The thump of its landing was followed at once by the protrusion of an immense white-bristled head, equipped with a large and snuffling pink nose, and followed by shoulders the width of a hogshead of tobacco. With eager grunts, the rest of the sow\u2019s great body followed, and she fell upon the treat at once, curly tail coiled tightly with delight.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well, just you remember who\u2019s the source from whom all blessing flows,\u201d I told her, and withdrew, taking pains to shut the window. The sill showed considerable splintering and gouging\u2014the result of leaving the slop basin too long on the counter; the sow was an impatient sort, who was quite willing to try to come into the house and claim her due, if it wasn\u2019t forthcoming promptly enough to suit.</p><p>While partly occupied with the pig, my mind had not yet left the question of Bobby Higgins\u2019s proposal, with all its potential complications. To say nothing of Malva. Granted, she was undoubtedly sensible of Bobby\u2019s blue eyes; he was a very handsome young man. But she wasn\u2019t insensible to Young Ian\u2019s charms, either, less striking as they might be.</p><p>And what would Tom Christie\u2019s opinion of Ian as a son-in-law be, I wondered. He wasn\u2019t quite penniless; he had ten acres of mostly uncleared land, though no income to speak of. Were tribal tattoos more socially acceptable than a murderer\u2019s brand? Probably\u2014but then, Bobby was a Protestant, while Ian was at least nominally Catholic.</p><p>Still, he was Jamie\u2019s nephew\u2014a fact that might cut both ways. Christie was intensely jealous of Jamie; I knew that. Would he see an alliance between his family and ours as a benefit, or as something to be avoided at all costs?</p><p>Of course, if Roger succeeded in getting him to marry Amy McCallum, that might distract his mind a bit. Brianna hadn\u2019t said anything to me about the widow\u2014but now that I thought back, I realized that the fact that she hadn\u2019t said anything might be an indication of suppressed feeling.</p><p>I could hear voices and laughter from the kitchen; obviously, everyone was having fun. I thought to go and join them, but glancing into Jamie\u2019s study, saw that he was standing by his desk, hands clasped behind him, looking down at Lord John\u2019s letter, a small frown of abstraction on his face.</p> <p>His thoughts weren\u2019t with his daughter, I thought, with a small, queer pang\u2014but with his son.</p><p>I came into the study and put my arm round his back, leaning my head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought, perhaps, of trying to convince Lord John?\u201d I said, a little hesitantly. \u201cThat the Americans may possibly have a point, I mean\u2014convert him to your way of thinking.\u201d Lord John himself would not be fighting in the coming conflict; Willie well might, and on the wrong side. Granted, fighting on either side was likely to be as dangerous\u2014but the fact remained that the Americans would win, and the only conceivable way of swaying Willie was through his putative father, whose opinions he respected.</p><p>Jamie snorted, but put an arm around me.</p><p>\u201cJohn? D\u2019ye recall what I told ye about Highlanders, when Arch Bug came to me wi\u2019 his wee ax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey live by their oath; they will die by it, too.\u201d</p><p>I shivered a little, and pressed closer, finding some comfort in his solidness. He was right; I had seen it myself, that brutal tribal fealty\u2014and yet it was so hard to grasp, even when I saw it right under my nose.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He nodded at the letter, his eyes still fixed on it.</p><p>\u201cHe is the same. Not all Englishmen are\u2014but he is.\u201d He looked down at me, ruefulness tinged with begrudging respect. \u201cHe is the King\u2019s man. It wouldna matter if the Angel Gabriel appeared before him and told him what will pass; he wouldna abandon his oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d I said, emboldened. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>His brows went up in surprise, and I went on, hesitating as I groped for words.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I do know what you mean; he\u2019s an honorable man. But that\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t think he is sworn to the King\u2014not in the same way Colum\u2019s men swore to him, nor the way your men from Lallybroch swore to you. What matters to him\u2014what he\u2019d sell his life for\u2014it\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aye\u2014it is,\u201d he said slowly, brows knit in concentration. \u201cBut for a soldier, such as he is, honor lies in his duty, no? And that comes from his fealty to the King, surely?\u201d</p><p>I straightened and rubbed a finger beneath my nose, trying to put into words what I thought.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s not quite what I mean. It\u2019s the idea that matters to him. He follows an ideal, not a man. Of all the people you know, he may be the only one who would understand\u2014this will be a war fought about ideals; maybe the first.\u201d</p><p>He closed one eye and regarded me quizzically out of the other.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve been talking to Roger Mac. Ye\u2019ll never have thought that on your own, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you have, too,\u201d I said, not bothering to refute the implied insult. Besides, he was right. \u201cSo you understand?\u201d</p><p>He made a small Scottish noise, indicating dubious agreement.</p><p>\u201cI did ask him what about the Crusades, did he not think that was fought for an ideal? And he was obliged to admit that ideals were involved, at least\u2014though even there he said it was money and politics, and I said it always was, and surely it would be now, as well. But, aye, I understand,\u201d he added hastily, seeing my nostrils flare. \u201cBut with regard to John Grey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith regard to John Grey,\u201d I said, \u201cyou do have a chance of convincing him, because he\u2019s both rational and idealistic. You\u2019d have to convince him that honor doesn\u2019t lie in following the King\u2014but in the ideal of freedom. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>He made another Scottish noise, this one deep-chested and filled with uneasy doubt. And finally, I realized.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t doing it for the sake of ideals, are you? Not for the sake of\u2014of liberty. Freedom, self-determination, all that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNor yet for the sake of being on the winning side\u2014for once. Though I expect that will be a novel experience.\u201d He gave me a sudden rueful smile, and, caught by surprise, I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy, then?\u201d I asked, more gently.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cFor Brianna and the wee lad. For my family. For the future. And if that is not an ideal, I\u2019ve never heard of one.\u201d</p><p>JAMIE DID HIS BEST in the office of ambassador, but the effect of Bobby\u2019s brand proved insuperable. While admitting that Bobby was a nice young man, Mr. Wemyss was unable to countenance the notion of marrying his daughter to a murderer, no matter what the circumstances that had led to his conviction.</p><p>\u201cFolk would take against him, sir, ye ken that fine,\u201d he said, shaking his head in response to Jamie\u2019s arguments. \u201cThey dinna stop to ask the why and wherefore, if a man\u2019s condemned. His eye\u2014he did nothing, I am sure, to provoke such a savage attack. How could I expose my dear Elizabeth to the possibility of such reprisals? Even if she should escape herself, what of her fate\u2014and that of her children\u2014if he is knocked over in the street one day?\u201d He wrung his hands at the thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd if he should one day lose his Lordship\u2019s patronage, he could not look for decent employment elsewhere, not with yon mark of shame upon his face. They would be beggared. I have been left in such straits myself, sir\u2014and would not for the world risk my daughter\u2019s sharing such a fate again.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cAye. I understand, Joseph. A pity, but I canna say as ye\u2019re wrong. For what the observation be worth, I dinna believe that Lord John would cast him off, though.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss merely shook his head, looking pale and unhappy.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Jamie pushed himself back from his desk. \u201cI\u2019ll have him in, and ye can give him your decision.\u201d I rose, as well, and Mr. Wemyss sprang up in panic.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir! Ye will not leave me alone with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I scarcely think he\u2019ll try to knock ye down or pull your nose, Joseph,\u201d Jamie said mildly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Wemyss said dubiously. \u201cNooo . . . I suppose not. But still, I should take it very kindly if you would\u2014would remain while I speak with him? And you, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d He turned pleading eyes upon me. I looked at Jamie, who nodded in resignation.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go and fetch him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI AM SORRY, SIR.\u201d Joseph Wemyss was nearly as unhappy as Bobby Higgins. Small in stature and shy in manner, he was unaccustomed to conducting interviews, and kept glancing at Jamie for moral support, before returning his attention to his daughter\u2019s importunate suitor.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he repeated, meeting Bobby\u2019s eyes with a sort of helpless sincerity. \u201cI like ye, young man, and so does Elizabeth, I am sure. But her welfare, her happiness, is my responsibility. And I cannot think . . . I really do not suppose . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be kind to her,\u201d Bobby said anxiously. \u201cYou know I should, zur. She should have a new gown once a year, and I should sell anything I have to keep her in shoes!\u201d He, too, glanced at Jamie, presumably in hopes of reinforcement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Wemyss has the highest regard for your intentions, Bobby,\u201d Jamie said as gently as possible. \u201cBut he\u2019s right, aye? It is his duty to make the best match he can for wee Lizzie. And perhaps . . .\u201d</p><p>Bobby swallowed hard. He had groomed himself to the nines for this interview, and wore a starched neckcloth that threatened to choke him, with his livery coat, a pair of clean woolen breeches, and a pair of carefully preserved silk stockings, neatly darned in only a few places.</p><p>\u201cI know I ha\u2019n\u2019t got a great deal of money,\u201d he said. \u201cNor property. But I have got a good situation, zur! Lord John pays me ten pound a year, and has been so kind as to say I may build a small cottage on his grounds, and \u2019til it is ready, we might have quarters in his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, so ye said.\u201d Mr. Wemyss looked increasingly wretched. He kept looking away from Bobby, perhaps in part from natural shyness and unwillingness to refuse him eye-to-eye\u2014but also, I was sure, to avoid seeming to look at the brand upon his cheek.</p><p>The discussion went on for a bit, but to no effect, as Mr. Wemyss could not bring himself to tell Bobby the real reason for his refusal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014well, I will think further.\u201d Mr. Wemyss, unable to bear the tension any longer, got abruptly to his feet and nearly ran out of the room\u2014forcing himself to a stop at the door, though, to turn and say, \u201cMind, I do not think I shall change my mind!\u201d before disappearing.</p><p>Bobby looked after him, nonplused, then turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cHave I hopes, zur? I know you will be honest.\u201d</p><p>It was a pathetic plea, and Jamie himself glanced away from those large blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do not think so,\u201d he said. It was said kindly, but definitely, and Bobby sagged a little. He had slicked down his wavy hair with water; now dried, tiny curls were popping up from the thick mass, and he looked absurdly like a newborn lamb that has just had its tail docked, shocked and dismayed.</p><p>\u201cDoes she\u2014do ye know, zur, or ma\u2019am\u201d\u2014turning to me\u2014\u201care Miss Elizabeth\u2019s affections given elsewhere? For if that was to be the case, sure I would bide. But if not . . .\u201d He hesitated, glancing toward the door where Joseph had so abruptly disappeared.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think I might have some chance of overcoming her father\u2019s objections? Perhaps\u2014perhaps if I was to find some way of coming by a bit o\u2019 money . . . or if it was to be a question of religion . . .\u201d He looked a little pale at this, but squared his shoulders resolutely. \u201cI\u2014I think I should be willing to be baptized Romish and he required it. I meant to tell him so, but forgot. Would ye maybe say so to him, zur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye . . . aye, I will,\u201d Jamie said reluctantly. \u201cYe\u2019ve quite made up your mind as it\u2019s Lizzie, then, have ye? Not Malva?\u201d</p><p>Bobby was taken back by that.</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, zur\u2014I\u2019m that fond of them both, I\u2019m sure I should be happy with either one. But\u2014well, truth to tell, I be mortal feared of Mr. Christie,\u201d he confessed, blushing. \u201cAnd I think he don\u2019t like you, zur, while Mr. Wemyss does. If you could . . . speak for me, zur? Please?\u201d</p><p>In the end, even Jamie was not proof against this guileless begging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut I promise ye nothing, Bobby. How long will ye stay now, before ye go back to Lord John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Lordship\u2019s given me a week for my wooing, zur,\u201d Bobby said, looking much happier. \u201cBut I suppose ye\u2019ll be going yourself tomorrow or next day?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cGoing where?\u201d</p><p>Bobby looked surprised in turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . I don\u2019t rightly know, zur. But I thought you must.\u201d</p><p>After a bit more cross-talk, we succeeded in disentangling the tale. He had, it seemed, fallen in with a small group of travelers on the road, farmers driving a herd of pigs to market. Given the nature of pigs as traveling companions, he hadn\u2019t stayed with them for more than one night, but over supper, in the course of casual talk, had heard them make reference to a meeting of sorts and speculate as to who might come to it.</p><p>\u201cYour name was mentioned, zur\u2014\u2018James Fraser,\u2019 they said, and they mentioned the Ridge, too, so as I was sure \u2019twas you they meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of meeting was it?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cAnd where?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, helpless.</p><p>\u201cTook no notice, ma\u2019am. Only they said \u2019twas Monday next.\u201d</p><p>Neither did he recall the names of his hosts, having been too much occupied in trying to eat without being overcome by the presence of the pigs. He was plainly too occupied at the moment with the results of his unsuccessful courtship to give much mind to the details, and after a few questions and confused answers, Jamie sent him off.</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea\u2014\u201d I began, but then saw that his brows were furrowed; he obviously did.</p><p>\u201cThe meeting to choose delegates for a Continental Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be that.\u201d</p><p>He had had word after Flora MacDonald\u2019s barbecue that the initial meeting place and time were to be abandoned, the organizers fearing interference. A new place and time would be established, John Ashe had told him\u2014word would be sent.</p><p>But that was before the contretemps in downtown Cross Creek.</p><p>\u201cI suppose a note might have gone astray,\u201d I suggested, but the suggestion was a feeble one.</p><p>\u201cOne might,\u201d he agreed. \u201cNot six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard nothing, I wrote myself, to the six men I know personally within the Committee of Correspondence. No answer from any of them.\u201d His stiff finger tapped once against his leg, but he noticed, and stilled it.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t trust you,\u201d I said, after a moment\u2019s silence, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLittle wonder, I suppose, after I rescued Simms and tarred Neil Forbes in the public street.\u201d Despite himself, a small smile flitted across his face at the memory. \u201cAnd poor wee Bobby didna help, I expect; he would have told them he carried letters betwixt me and Lord John.\u201d</p><p>That was probably true. Friendly and garrulous, Bobby was capable of keeping a confidence\u2014but only if you told him explicitly which confidence to keep. Otherwise, anyone who shared a meal with him would know all his business by the time the pudding came.</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything else to find out? Where the meeting is, I mean?\u201d</p><p>He blew out his breath in mild frustration.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe. But if I did, and went there\u2014there\u2019s a great chance they would put me out. If not worse. I think the risk of such a breach isna worth it.\u201d He glanced at me, with a wry expression. \u201cI suppose I should have let them roast the printer.\u201d</p><p>I disregarded that, and came to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think of something else,\u201d I said, trying to be encouraging.</p><p>The big hour candle stood on his desk, half-burned, and he touched it. No one seemed ever to notice that the candle was never consumed.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps . . .\u201d he said meditatively. \u201cI may find a way. Though I should hate to take another for the purpose.\u201d</p><p>Another gem, he meant.</p><p>I swallowed a small lump in my throat at the thought. There were two left. One each, if Roger, or Bree, and Jemmy\u2014but I choked that thought off firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it profit a man to gain the world,\u201d I quoted, \u201cif he lose his soul? It won\u2019t do us any good to be secretly rich, if you get tarred and feathered.\u201d I didn\u2019t like that thought any better, but it wasn\u2019t one I could avoid.</p><p>He glanced at his forearm; he had rolled up his sleeves for writing, and the fading burn still showed, a faint pink track among the sunbleached hairs. He sighed, went round his desk, and picked a quill from the jar.</p><p>\u201cAye. Perhaps I\u2019d best write a few more letters.\u201d</p><p>60</p><p>THE PALE HORSEMAN RIDES</p><p>ON THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER, Roger preached a sermon on the text, God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. On the twenty-first of September, one of those weak things set out to prove the point.</p><p>Padraic and Hortense MacNeill and their children hadn\u2019t come to church. They always did, and their absence aroused comment\u2014enough that Roger asked Brianna next morning if she might walk round and visit, to see that there was nothing wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go myself,\u201d he said, scraping the bottom of his porridge bowl, \u201cbut I\u2019ve promised to ride with John MacAfee and his father to Brownsville; he means to offer for a girl there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he mean you to make them handfast on the spot if she says yes?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr are you just there to keep assorted Browns from assassinating him?\u201d There had been no open violence since we had returned Lionel Brown\u2019s body, but there were occasional small clashes, when a party from Brownsville happened to meet men from the Ridge now and then in public.</p><p>\u201cThe latter,\u201d Roger said with a small grimace. \u201cThough I\u2019ve some hopes that a marriage or two betwixt the Ridge and Brownsville might help to mend matters, over time.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, reading a newspaper from the most recent batch, looked up at that.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Well, it\u2019s a thought. Doesna always work out just so, though.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMy uncle Colum thought to mend just such a matter wi\u2019 the Grants, by marrying my mother to the Grant. Unfortunately,\u201d he added, turning over a page, \u201cmy mother wasna inclined to cooperate. She snubbed Malcolm Grant, stabbed my uncle Dougal, and eloped wi\u2019 my father, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brianna hadn\u2019t heard that particular story; she looked enchanted. Roger gave her a sidelong glance, and coughed, ostentatiously removing the sharp knife with which she\u2019d been cutting up sausages.</p><p>\u201cWell, be that as it may,\u201d he said, pushing back from the table, knife in hand. \u201cIf ye wouldn\u2019t mind having a look-in on Padraic\u2019s family, just to see they\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>In the event, Lizzie and I came along with Brianna, meaning to call on Marsali and Fergus, whose cabin was a little way beyond the MacNeills\u2019. We met Marsali on the way, though, coming back from the whisky spring, and so there were four of us when we came to the MacNeills\u2019 cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are there so many flies, of a sudden?\u201d Lizzie slapped at a large bluebottle that had landed on her arm, then waved at two more, circling round her face.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s dead nearby,\u201d Marsali said, lifting her nose to sniff the air. \u201cIn the wood, maybe. Hear the crows?\u201d</p><p>There were crows, cawing in the treetops nearby; looking up, I saw more circling, black spots against the brilliant sky.</p><p>\u201cNot in the wood,\u201d Bree said, her voice suddenly strained. She was looking toward the cabin. The door was tightly shut, and a mass of flies milled over the hide-covered window. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>The smell in the cabin was unspeakable. I saw the girls gasp and clamp their mouths tight shut, as the door swung open. Unfortunately, it was necessary to breathe. I did so, very shallowly, as I moved across the dark room and ripped down the hide that had been tightly nailed across the window.</p><p>\u201cLeave the door open,\u201d I said, ignoring a faint moan of complaint from the bed at the influx of light. \u201cLizzie\u2014go and start a smudge fire near the door and another outside the window. Start it with grass and kindling, then add something\u2014damp wood, moss, wet leaves\u2014to make it smoke.\u201d</p><p>Flies had begun to come in within seconds of my opening the window, and were whizzing past my face\u2014deerflies, bluebottles, gnats. Drawn by the smell, they had been clustered on the sun-warmed logs outside, seeking entrance, avid for food, desperate to lay their eggs.</p><p>The room would be a buzzing hell in minutes\u2014but we needed light and air, and would just have to deal with the flies as best we might. I pulled off my kerchief and folded it into a makeshift flyswatter, slapping to and fro with it as I turned to the bed.</p><p>Hortense and the two children were there. All nak*d, their pallid limbs glimmering with the sweat of the sealed cabin. They were clammy white where the sunlight struck, legs and bodies streaked with reddish-brown. I hoped that it was only diarrhea, and not blood.</p><p>Someone had moaned; someone moved. Not dead then, thank God. The bedcoverings had been thrown to the floor in a tangled heap\u2014that was fortunate, as they were still mostly clean. I thought we had better burn the straw mattress, as soon as we got them off it.</p><p>\u201cDo not put your fingers in your mouth,\u201d I murmured to Bree, as we began to work, sorting the feebly twitching heap of humanity into its component parts.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding,\u201d she said, speaking through her teeth while smiling at a pale-faced child of five or six, who lay half-curled in the exhausted aftermath of a diarrhetic attack. She worked her hands under the little girl\u2019s armpits. \u201cCome on, lovey, let me lift you.\u201d</p><p>The child was too weak to make any protest at being moved; her arms and legs hung limp as string. Her sister\u2019s state was even more alarming; no more than a year old, the baby didn\u2019t move at all, and her eyes were sunk deep, a sign of severe dehydration. I picked up the tiny hand and gently pinched the skin between thumb and forefinger. It stayed for a moment, a tiny peak of grayish skin, then slowly, slowly, began to disappear.</p><p>\u201cBloody f**king hell,\u201d I said softly to myself and bent swiftly to listen, hand on the child\u2019s chest. She wasn\u2019t dead\u2014I could barely feel the bump of her heart\u2014but wasn\u2019t far from it. If she were too far gone to suck or drink, there was nothing that would save her.</p><p>Even as the thought passed through my mind, I was rising, looking about the cabin. No water; a hollowed gourd lay on its side by the bed, empty. How long had they been like this, with nothing to drink?</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d I said, my voice level but urgent. \u201cGo and get some water\u2014quickly.\u201d</p><p>She had laid the older child on the floor, and was wiping the filth from her body; she glanced up, though, and the sight of my face made her drop the rag she was using and stand up at once. She grabbed the kettle I thrust into her hand and vanished; I heard her footsteps, running across the dooryard.</p><p>The flies were settling on Hortense\u2019s face; I flapped the kerchief close to shoo them away. The cloth skimmed her nose, but her slack features barely twitched. She was breathing; I could see her belly, distended with gas, moving slightly.</p><p>Where was Padraic? Hunting, perhaps.</p><p>I caught a whiff of something under the overwhelming stench of voided bowels and leaned over, sniffing. A sweet, pungently fermented scent, like rotted apples. I put a hand under Hortense\u2019s shoulder and pulled, rolling her toward me. There was a bottle\u2014empty\u2014under her body. A whiff of it was enough to tell me what it had contained.</p><p>\u201cBloody, bloody f**king hell,\u201d I said, under my breath. Desperately ill and with no water to hand, she had drunk applejack, either to quench her thirst or to soothe the pain of the cramps. A logical thing to do\u2014save that alcohol was a diuretic. It would leach even more water from a body that was already seriously dehydrated, to say nothing of further irritating a gastrointestinal tract that scarcely needed it.</p><p>Bloody Christ, had she given it to the children, too?</p><p>I stooped to the elder child. She was limp as a ragdoll, head lolling on her shoulders, but there was still some resilience to her flesh. A pinch of the hand; the skin stayed peaked, but returned to normal faster than the baby\u2019s had.</p><p>Her eyes had opened when I pinched her hand. That was good. I smiled at her, and brushed the gathering flies away from her half-open mouth. The soft pink membranes were dry and sticky-looking.</p><p>\u201cHallo, darling,\u201d I said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry now. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>And was that going to help? I wondered. Damn it all; if only I had been a day earlier!</p><p>I heard Bree\u2019s hurrying steps and met her at the door.</p><p>\u201cI need\u2014\u201d I began, but she interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacNeill\u2019s in the woods!\u201d she said. \u201cI found him on the way to the spring. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The kettle in her hands was still empty. I seized it with a cry of exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWater! I need water!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014Mr. MacNeill, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I thrust the kettle back into her hands and shoved past her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him,\u201d I said. \u201cGet water! Give it to them\u2014the baby first! Make Lizzie help you\u2014the fires can wait! Run!\u201d</p><p>I heard the flies first, a buzzing noise that made my skin crawl with revulsion. Out in the open, they had found him quickly, attracted by the smell. I took a hasty gulp of air and shoved through the buckbrush to where Padraic lay, collapsed in the grass beneath a sycamore.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dead. I saw that at once; the flies were a cloud, not a blanket\u2014hovering, lighting, flicking away again as he twitched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lay curled on the ground, wearing only a shirt, a water jug lying near his head. I knelt by him, peering as I touched him. His shirt and legs were stained, as was the grass where he lay. The excrement was very watery\u2014most had soaked into the soil by now\u2014but there was some solid matter. He\u2019d been stricken later than Hortense and the children, then; his guts hadn\u2019t been griping long, or there would be mostly water, tinged with blood.</p><p>\u201cPadraic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Claire, thank the Lord ye\u2019ve come.\u201d His voice was so hoarse I could scarcely make out words. \u201cMy bairnies. Have ye got my bairnies safe?\u201d</p><p>He raised himself on one elbow, shaking, sweat plastering strands of gray hair to his cheeks. His eyes cracked open, trying to see me, but they were swelled to mere slits by the bites of deerflies.</p> <p>\u201cI have them.\u201d I put a hand on him at once, squeezing to force reassurance into him. \u201cLie down, Padraic. Wait a moment while I tend them, then I\u2019ll see to you.\u201d He was very ill, but not in immediate danger; the children were.</p><p>\u201cDinna mind me,\u201d Padraic muttered. \u201cDinna . . . mind . . .\u201d He swayed, brushed at the flies that crawled on his face and chest, then groaned as cramp seized his belly again, doubling as though some massive hand had crushed him in its grip.</p><p>I was already running back to the house. There were splashes of water in the dust of the path\u2014good, Brianna had come this way, hurrying.</p><p>Amoebic dysentery? Food poisoning? Typhoid? Typhus? Cholera\u2014please God, not that. All of those, and a lot more, were currently lumped together simply as \u201cthe bloody flux\u201d in this time, and for obvious reasons. Not that it mattered in the short term.</p><p>The immediate danger of all the diarrhetic diseases was simple dehydration. In the effort to expel whatever microbial invader was irritating the gut, the gastrointestinal tract simply flushed itself repeatedly, depleting the body of the water necessary to circulate blood, to eliminate wastes, to cool the body by means of sweat, to maintain the brain and membranes\u2014the water necessary to maintain life.</p> <p>If one could keep a patient sufficiently hydrated by means of intravenous saline and glucose infusions, then the gut would, most likely, heal itself eventually and the patient would recover. Without intravenous intervention, the only possibility was to administer fluids by mouth, or rectum as quickly and as constantly as possible, for as long as it took. If one could.</p><p>If the patient couldn\u2019t keep down even water\u2014I didn\u2019t think the MacNeills were vomiting; I didn\u2019t recall that smell among the others in the cabin. Probably not cholera, then; that was something.</p><p>Brianna sat on the floor by the elder child, the little girl\u2019s head in her lap, pressing a cup against her mouth. Lizzie knelt by the hearth, face red with exertion as she kindled the fire. The flies were settling on the motionless body of the woman on the bed, and Marsali crouched over the limp form of the baby on her lap, frantically trying to rouse it to drink.</p><p>Spilled water streaked her skirt. I could see the tiny head lolled back on her lap, water dribbling down a slack and horribly flattened cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d Marsali was saying, over and over. \u201cShe can\u2019t, she can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Disregarding my own advice about fingers, I ruthlessly thrust an index finger into the baby\u2019s mouth, prodding the palate for a gag reflex. It was there; the baby choked on the water in its mouth and gasped, and I felt the tongue close hard against my finger for an instant.</p> <p>Sucking. She was an infant, still breastfed\u2014and suckling is the first of the instincts for survival. I whirled to look at the woman, but a glance at her flat br**sts and sunken n**ples was enough; even so, I grabbed one breast, squeezing my fingers toward the nipple. Again, again\u2014no, no droplets of milk showed on the brownish n**ples, and the breast tissue was flabby in my hand. No water, no milk.</p><p>Marsali, grasping what I was about, seized the neck of her blouse and ripped it down, pressing the child to her own bared breast. The tiny legs were limp against her dress, toes bruised and curled like wilted petals.</p><p>I was tipping back Hortense\u2019s face, dribbling water into her open mouth. From the corner of my eye, I saw Marsali rhythmically squeezing her breast with one hand, an urgent massage to make the milk let down, even as my own fingers moved in an echo of the motion, massaging the unconscious woman\u2019s throat, urging her to swallow.</p><p>Her flesh was slick with sweat, but most of it was mine. Trickles of perspiration were running down my back, tickling between my buttocks. I could smell myself, a strange metallic scent, like hot copper.</p><p>The throat moved in sudden peristalsis, and I took my hand away. Hortense choked and coughed, then her head rolled to the side and her stomach heaved, sending its meager contents rocketing back up. I wiped the trace of vomit from her lips, and pressed the cup to her mouth again. Her lips didn\u2019t move; the water filled her mouth and dribbled down her face and neck.</p><p>Among the buzzing of the flies, I heard Lizzie\u2019s voice behind me, calm but abstracted, as though she spoke from a long way off.</p><p>\u201cCan ye stop cursing, ma\u2019am? It\u2019s only that the weans can hear ye.\u201d</p><p>I jerked round at her, only then realizing that I had in fact been repeating \u201cBloody f**king hell!\u201d out loud, over and over as I worked.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry.\u201d And turned back to Hortense.</p><p>I got some water down her now and then, but not enough. Not nearly enough, given that her bowels were still trying to rid themselves of whatever troubled them. Bloody flux.</p><p>Lizzie was praying.</p><p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee . . .\u201d</p><p>Brianna was murmuring something under her breath, urgent sounds of maternal encouragement.</p><p>\u201cBlessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus . . .\u201d</p><p>My thumb was on the pulse of the carotid artery. I felt it bump, skip, and go on, jerking along like a cart with a missing wheel. Her heart was beginning to fail, arrhythmic.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God . . .\u201d</p><p>I slammed my fist down on the center of her chest, and then again, and again, hard enough that the bed and the pale splayed body quivered under the blows. Flies rose in alarm from the soaked straw, buzzing.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Marsali softly behind me. \u201cOh, no, no, please.\u201d I had heard that tone of disbelief before, of protest and appeal denied\u2014and knew what had happened.</p><p>\u201cPray for us sinners . . .\u201d</p><p>As though she, too, had heard, Hortense\u2019s head rolled suddenly to one side, and her eyes sprang open, staring toward the place where Marsali sat, though I thought she saw nothing. Then the eyes closed and she doubled suddenly, onto one side, legs drawn up nearly to her chin. Her head wrenched back, body tight in spasm, and then she suddenly relaxed. She would not let her child go alone. Bloody flux.</p><p>\u2018Now and at the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary, full of grace . . .\u201d</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s soft voice went on mechanically, repeating her words of prayer as mindlessly as I had said mine earlier. I held Hortense\u2019s wrist, checking for the pulse, but it was mere formality. Marsali curled over the tiny body in grief, rocking it against her breast. Milk dripped from the swollen nipple, coming slowly, then faster, falling like white rain on the small still face, futilely eager to nourish and sustain.</p><p>The air was still stifling, still thick with odor and flies and the sound of Lizzie\u2019s prayers\u2014but the cabin seemed empty, and curiously silent.</p><p>There was a shuffling noise outside; the sound of something being dragged, a grunt of pain and dreadful exertion. Then the soft sound of falling, a gasp of breath. Padraic had made it back to his own doorstep. Brianna looked to the door, but she still held the older girl in her arms, still alive.</p><p>I set down the limp hand that I held, carefully, and went to help.</p><p>61</p><p>A NOISOME PESTILENCE</p><p>THE DAYS WERE GROWING SHORTER, but light still came early. The windows at the front of the house faced east, and the rising sun glowed on the scrubbed white oak of my surgery floor. I could see the brilliant bar of light advancing across the hand-hewn boards; had I had an actual timepiece, I could have calibrated the floor like a sundial, marking the seams between the boards in minutes.</p><p>As it was, I marked them in heartbeats, waiting through the moments until the sun should have reached the counter where my microscope stood ready, slides and beaker beside it.</p><p>I heard soft footsteps in the corridor, and Jamie pushed the door open with his shoulder, a pewter mug of something hot held in each hand, wrapped with rags against the heat.</p><p>\u201cCiamar a tha thu, mo chridhe,\u201d he said softly, and handed one to me, brushing a kiss across my forehead. \u201cHow is it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be worse.\u201d I gave him a smile of gratitude, though it was interrupted by a yawn. I didn\u2019t need to tell him that Padraic and his elder daughter still lived; he would have known at once by my face if anything dire had happened. In fact, bar any complications, I thought both would recover; I had stayed with them all night, rousing them hourly to drink a concoction of honeyed water, mixed with a little salt, alternating with a strong infusion of peppermint leaf and dogwood bark to calm the bowels.</p><p>I lifted the mug\u2014goosefoot tea\u2014closing my eyes as I inhaled the faint, bitter perfume, and feeling the tight muscles of my neck and shoulders relax in anticipation.</p><p>He had seen me twist my head to ease my neck; Jamie\u2019s hand came down on my nape, large and wonderfully warm from holding the hot tea. I gave a small moan of ecstasy at the touch, and he laughed low in his throat, massaging my sore muscles.</p><p>\u201cShould ye not be abed, Sassenach? Ye\u2019ll not have slept at all the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I did . . . a bit.\u201d I had dozed fitfully, sitting up by the open window, roused periodically by the startling touch on my face of the moths that flew in, drawn to the light of my candle. Mrs. Bug had come at dawn, though, fresh and starched, ready to take over the heavy nursing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go lie down in a bit,\u201d I promised. \u201cBut I wanted to have a quick look first.\u201d I waved vaguely toward my microscope, which stood assembled and ready on the table. Next to it were several small glass bottles, plugged with twists of cloth, each containing a brownish liquid. Jamie frowned at them.</p><p>\u201cLook? At what?\u201d he said. He lifted his long, straight nose, sniffing suspiciously. \u201cIs that shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said, not bothering to stifle a jaw-cracking yawn. I had\u2014as discreetly as possible\u2014collected samples from Hortense and the baby and, later, from my living patients, as well. Jamie eyed them.</p><p>\u201cExactly what,\u201d he inquired cautiously, \u201care ye looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd in fact, I may not find anything\u2014or anything I can recognize. But it\u2019s possible that it was either an amoeba or a bacillus that made the MacNeills sick\u2014and I think I would recognize an amoeba; they\u2019re quite big. Relatively speaking,\u201d I added hastily.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d His ruddy brows drew together, then lifted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>That was a better question than he knew.</p><p>\u201cWell, partly for the sake of curiosity,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut also, if I do find a causative organism that I can recognize, I\u2019ll know a bit more about the disease\u2014how long it lasts, for instance, and whether there are any complications to look out for specially. And how contagious it is.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, cup half-raised to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs it one you can catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThough I\u2019m fairly sure it is. I\u2019ve been vaccinated against typhus and typhoid\u2014but this doesn\u2019t look like either one of those. And there are no vaccines for dysentery or Giardia poisoning.\u201d</p><p>The brows drew together and stayed that way, knotted as he sipped his tea. His fingers gave my neck a final squeeze and dropped away.</p><p>I sipped cautiously at my own tea, sighing in pleasure as it gently scalded my throat and ran hot and comforting down into my stomach. Jamie lounged on his stool, long legs thrust out. He glanced down into the steaming cup between his hands.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think this tea is hot, Sassenach?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I raised my own brows at that. Both cups were still wrapped in rags, and I could feel the heat seeping through to my palms.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He lifted the mug and took a mouthful of tea, which he held for a moment before swallowing; I could see the long muscles move in his throat.</p><p>\u201cBrianna came into the kitchen whilst I was brewing the pot,\u201d he said. \u201cShe took down the basin, and the pannikin of soap\u2014and then she took a dipper of water steaming from the kettle, and poured it over her hands, one and then the other.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cThe water was boiling when I took it off the fire a moment before.\u201d</p><p>The mouthful of tea I had taken went down crooked, and I coughed.</p><p>\u201cDid she burn herself?\u201d I said, when I had got my breath back.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d he said, rather grimly. \u201cShe scrubbed herself from fingertips to elbows, and I saw the blister on the side of her hand where the water fell.\u201d He paused for a moment, and his eyes met mine over the mugs, dark blue with worry.</p><p>I took another sip of my un-honeyed tea. The room was cool enough, just past dawn, that my hot breath made tiny wisps of steam as I sighed.</p><p>\u201cPadraic\u2019s baby died in Marsali\u2019s arms,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cShe held the other child. She knows it\u2019s contagious.\u201d And knowing, could not touch or pick up her own child without doing her best to wash away her fear.</p><p>Jamie moved uneasily.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he began. \u201cBut still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d I said, and put a hand on his wrist, as much for my own comfort as his.</p><p>The transient coolness of the morning air touched face and mind alike, dispelling the warm tangle of dreams. The grass and trees were still lit with a chilly dawn glow, blue-shadowed and mysterious, and Jamie seemed a solid point of reference, fixed in the shifting light.</p><p>\u201cDifferent,\u201d I repeated. \u201cFor her, I mean.\u201d I took a breath of the sweet morning air, smelling of wet grass and morning glories.</p><p>\u201cI was born at the end of a war\u2014the Great War, they called it, because the world had never seen anything like it. I told you about it.\u201d My voice held a slight question, and he nodded, eyes fixed on mine, listening.</p><p>\u201cThe year after I was born,\u201d I said, \u201cthere was a great epidemic of influenza. All over the world. People died in hundreds and thousands; whole villages disappeared in the space of a week. And then came the other, my war.\u201d</p><p>The words were quite unconscious, but hearing them, I felt the corner of my mouth twitch with irony. Jamie saw it and a faint smile touched his own lips. He knew what I meant\u2014that odd sense of pride that comes of living through a terrible conflict, leaving one with a peculiar feeling of possession. His wrist turned, his fingers wrapping tight around my own.</p><p>\u201cAnd she has never seen plague or war,\u201d he said, beginning to understand. \u201cNever?\u201d His voice held something odd. Nearly incomprehensible, to a man born a warrior, brought up to fight as soon as he could lift a sword; born to the idea that he must\u2014he would\u2014defend himself and his family by violence. An incomprehensible notion\u2014but a rather wonderful one.</p><p>\u201cOnly as pictures. Films, I mean. Television.\u201d That one he would never understand, and I could not explain. The way in which such pictures focused on war itself; bombs and planes and submarines, and the thrilling urgency of blood shed on purpose; a sense of nobility in deliberate death.</p><p>He knew what battlefields were really like\u2014battlefields, and what came after them.</p><p>\u201cThe men who fought in those wars\u2014and the women\u2014they didn\u2019t die of the killing, most of them. They died like this\u2014\u201d A lift of my mug toward the open window, toward the peaceful mountains, the distant hollow where Padraic MacNeill\u2019s cabin lay hidden. \u201cThey died of illness and neglect, because there wasn\u2019t any way to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have seen that,\u201d he said softly, with a glance at the stoppered bottles. \u201cPlague and ague run rampant in a city, half a regiment dead of flux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have.\u201d</p><p>Butterflies were rising among the flowers in the dooryard, cabbage whites and sulfur yellows, here and there the great, lazy sail of a late tiger swallowtail out of the shadow of the wood. My thumb still rested on his wrist, feeling his heartbeat, slow and powerful.</p><p>\u201cBrianna was born seven years after penicillin came into common use. She was born in America\u2014not this one\u201d\u2014I nodded toward the window again\u2014\u201cbut that one, that will be. There, it isn\u2019t usual for lots of people to die of contagious illness.\u201d I glanced at him. The light had reached his waist, and glowed on the metal cup in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first person you knew of who had died?\u201d</p><p>His face went blank with surprise, then sharpened, thinking. After a moment, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy brother was the first who was important, but I kent others before him, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember, either.\u201d My parents, of course; their deaths had been personal\u2014but born in England, I had lived in the shadow of cenotaphs and memorials, and people just beyond the bounds of my own family died regularly; I had a sudden vivid memory, of my father putting on a homburg and dark coat to go to the baker\u2019s wife\u2019s funeral. Mrs. Briggs, her name had been. But she hadn\u2019t been the first; I knew already about death and funerals. How old had I been then\u2014four, perhaps?</p><p>I was very tired. My eyes felt grainy from lack of sleep, and the delicate early light was brightening to full sun.</p><p>\u201cI think Frank\u2019s was the first death Brianna ever experienced personally. Maybe there were others; I can\u2019t be sure. But the point is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the point.\u201d He reached to take the empty cup from my hand, and set it on the counter, then drained his own and set it down, too.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s no herself she fears for, aye?\u201d he asked, his eyes penetrating. \u201cIt\u2019s the wean.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. She would have known, of course, in an academic sort of way, that such things were possible. But to have a child die suddenly before you, from something like a simple case of diarrhea . . .</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good mother,\u201d I said, and yawned suddenly. She was. But it would never have struck her in any visceral way that something so negligible as a germ could suddenly snatch away her child. Not until yesterday.</p><p>Jamie stood up suddenly, and pulled me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will wait.\u201d He nodded at the microscope. \u201cI\u2019ve never known shit spoil with keeping.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and collapsed slowly against him, my cheek pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d Still, I didn\u2019t push away. He held me, and we watched the sunlight grow, creeping slowly up the wall.</p><p>62</p><p>AMOEBA</p><p>I TURNED THE MIRROR OF the microscope a fraction of an inch further, to get as much light as I could.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d I stepped back, motioning Malva to come and look. \u201cDo you see it? The big, clear thing in the middle, lobed, with the little flecks in it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, squinting one-eyed into the ocular, then drew in her breath in a gasp of triumph.</p><p>\u201cI see it plain! Like a currant pudding someone\u2019s dropped on the floor, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said, smiling at her description in spite of the general seriousness of our investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s an amoeba\u2014one of the bigger sorts of microorganisms. And I very much think it\u2019s our villain.\u201d</p><p>We were looking at slides made from the stool samples I had retrieved from all the sick so far\u2014for Padraic\u2019s family was not the only one affected. There were three families with at least one person ill with a vicious bloody flux\u2014and in all of the samples I had looked at so far, I had found this amoebic stranger.</p><p>\u201cIs it really?\u201d Malva had looked up when I spoke, but now returned to the eyepiece, absorbed. \u201cHowever can something so small cause such a stramash in something so big as a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is an explanation,\u201d I said, swishing another slide gently through the dye bath and setting it to dry. \u201cBut it would take me a bit of time to tell you, all about cells\u2014you remember, I showed you the cells from the lining of your mouth?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, frowning slightly, and ran her tongue along inside her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWell, the body makes all kinds of different cells, and there are special kinds of cells whose business it is to fight bacteria\u2014the small, roundish sorts of things, you remember those?\u201d I gestured at the slide, which being fecal matter, had the usual vast quantities of Escherichia coli and the like.</p><p>\u201cBut there are millions of different sorts, and sometimes a microorganism comes along that the special cells aren\u2019t able to deal with. You know\u2014I showed you the Plasmodium in Lizzie\u2019s blood?\u201d I nodded toward the stoppered vial on the counter; I had taken blood from Lizzie only a day or two before, and shown the malarial parasites in the cells to Malva. \u201cAnd I do think that this amoeba of ours may well be one like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Will we give the sick folk the penicillin, then?\u201d I smiled a little at the eager \u201cwe,\u201d though there was little enough to smile at in the situation overall.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid penicillin isn\u2019t effective against amoebic dysentery\u2014that\u2019s what you call a very bad flux, a dysentery. No, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve nothing much to be going on with save herbs.\u201d I opened the cupboard and ran an eye over the ranks of bottles and gauze-wrapped bundles, puzzling.</p><p>\u201cWormwood, for a start.\u201d I took the jar down and handed it to Malva, who had come to stand beside me, looking with interest into the mysteries of the cupboard. \u201cGarlic, that\u2019s generally useful for infections of the digestive tract\u2014but it makes quite a good poultice for skin things, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about onions? My grannie would steam an onion, and put it to my ear, when I was a wee bairn and had the earache. It smelt something dreadful, but it did work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt. Run out to the pantry, then, and fetch . . . oh, three big ones, and several heads of garlic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, at once, ma\u2019am!\u201d She set down the wormwood and dashed out, sandals flapping. I turned back to the shelves, trying to calm my own sense of urgency.</p><p>I was torn between the urge to be with the sick, nursing them, and the need to make medicines that might be of help. But there were other people who could do the nursing, and no one but me who knew enough to try to compound an antiparasitic remedy.</p><p>Wormwood, garlic . . . agrimony. And gentian. Anything with a very high content of copper or sulfur\u2014oh, rhubarb. We were past the growing season, but I\u2019d had a fine crop and had put up several dozen bottles of the boiled pulp and syrup, as Mrs. Bug liked it for pies, and it provided some vitamin C for the winter months. That would make a splendid base for the medicine. Add perhaps slippery elm, for its soothing effects on the intestinal tract\u2014though such effects were likely to be so slight as to be unnoticeable against the ravages of such a virulent onslaught.</p><p>I began pounding wormwood and agrimony in my mortar, meanwhile wondering where the bloody hell the thing had come from. Amoebic dysentery was normally a disease of the tropics, though God knew, I\u2019d seen any number of peculiar tropical diseases on the coast, brought in with the slave and sugar trade from the Indies\u2014and not a few further inland, too, since any such disease that wasn\u2019t instantly fatal tended to become chronic and move along with its victim.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible that one of the fisher-folk had contracted it during the journey from the coast, and while being one of the fortunate persons who suffered only a mild infection, was now carrying the encysted form of the amoeba around in his or her digestive tract, all ready to shed infective cysts right and left.</p><p>Why this sudden outbreak? Dysentery was almost always spread via contaminated food or water. What\u2014</p><p>\u201cHere, ma\u2019am.\u201d Malva was back, breathless from her hurry, several large brown onions in hand, crackling and glossy, and a dozen garlic heads bundled in her apron. I set her to slicing them up, and had the happy inspiration of telling her to stew them in honey. I didn\u2019t know whether the antibacterial effect of honey would be likewise effective against an amoeba, but it couldn\u2019t hurt\u2014and might conceivably make the mixture a little more palatable; it was shaping up to be more than a trifle eye-watering, between the onions, the garlic, and the rhubarb.</p><p>\u201cPhew! What are you guys doing in here?\u201d I looked up from my macerating to see Brianna in the door, looking deeply suspicious, nose wrinkled against the smell.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . .\u201d I\u2019d become habituated to it myself, but in fact, the air in the surgery was fairly thick with the smell of fecal samples, now augmented by waves of onion fumes. Malva looked up, eyes streaming, and sniffed, wiping her nose on her apron.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re magking bedicine,\u201d she informed Bree, with considerable dignity.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone else fallen sick?\u201d I asked anxiously, but she shook her head and edged into the room, fastidiously avoiding the counter where I had been making slides of fecal material.</p><p>\u201cNo, not that I\u2019ve heard. I took some food over to the McLachlans\u2019 this morning, and they said only the two little ones had it. Mrs. Coinneach said she\u2019d had diarrhea a couple of days ago, but not bad, and she\u2019s all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving the little ones honey water?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a small frown between her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI saw them. They look pretty sick, but nothing like the MacNeills.\u201d She looked rather sick herself, at the memory, but shook it off, turning to the high cupboard.</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow a little sulfuric acid, Mama?\u201d She\u2019d brought an earthenware cup with her, and the sight of it made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cOrdinary people borrow a cup of sugar,\u201d I told her, nodding at it. \u201cOf course. Be careful with it, though\u2014you\u2019d best put it in one of those vials with a waxed cork. You do not want to chance tripping and spilling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely don\u2019t,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI only need a few drops, though; I\u2019m going to dilute it down pretty far. I\u2019m making paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaper?\u201d Malva blinked, red-eyed, and sniffed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you squish up anything fibrous you can get your hands on,\u201d Bree told her, making squishing motions with both hands in illustrations. \u201cOld bits of used paper, old rags of cloth, bits of yarn or thread, some of the softer sorts of leaves or flowers. Then you soak the mash for days and days in water and\u2014if you happen to have some\u2014dilute sulfuric acid.\u201d One long finger tapped the square bottle affectionately.</p><p>\u201cThen once the mash is all digested down to a sort of pulp, you can spread a thin layer of it on screens, press out the water, let it dry, and hey-presto, paper!\u201d</p><p>I could see Malva mouthing \u201chey-presto\u201d to herself, and turned away a little, so she couldn\u2019t see me smile. Brianna uncorked the big square bottle of acid and, very carefully, poured a few drops into her cup. Immediately, the hot smell of sulfur rose like a demon amidst the miasma of feces and onions.</p><p>Malva stiffened, eyes still streaming but wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSulfuric acid,\u201d Bree said, looking at her curiously.</p><p>\u201cVitriol,\u201d I amended. \u201cHave you seen\u2014er, smelled it before?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, put the sliced onions into a pot, and put the lid neatly on.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have.\u201d She came to look at the green glass bottle, dabbing at her eyes. \u201cMy mother\u2014she died when I was young\u2014she had some of that. I remember the smell of it, and how she\u2019d say as I mustn\u2019t touch it, ever. Brimstone, folk called the smell\u2014a whiff o\u2019 brimstone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally? I wonder what she used it for.\u201d I did wonder, and with a certain sense of unease. An alchemist or an apothecary might have the stuff; the only reason that I knew of for a common citizen to keep it was as a means of aggression\u2014to throw at someone.</p><p>But Malva only shook her head, and turning, went back to the onions and garlic. I\u2019d caught the look on her face, though; a queer expression of hostility and longing that rang a small, unsuspected bell somewhere inside me.</p><p>Longing for a mother long dead\u2014and the fury of a small girl, abandoned. Bewildered and alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brianna was watching my face, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, and put a hand on her arm, just to feel the strength and joy of her presence, the years of her growth. Tears stung my eyes, but that could be put down to onions. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>I WAS GETTING TERRIBLY tired of funerals. This was the third, in as many days. We had buried Hortense and the baby together, then the older Mrs. Ogilvie. Now it was another child, one of Mrs. MacAfee\u2019s twins. The other twin, a boy, stood by his sister\u2019s grave, in a shock so profound that he looked like a walking ghost himself, though the disease hadn\u2019t touched him.</p><p>We were later than intended\u2014the coffin hadn\u2019t been quite ready\u2014and the night was rising around us. All the gold of the autumn leaves had faded into ash, and white mist was curling through the dark wet trunks of the pines. One could hardly imagine a more desolate scene\u2014and yet it was in a way more fitting than the bright sunshine and fresh breeze that had blown when we buried Hortense and little Angelica.</p><p>\u201cThe Lord is my shepherd. He leadeth me beside\u2014\u201d Roger\u2019s voice cracked painfully, but no one seemed to notice. He struggled for a moment, swallowing hard, and went on, doggedly. He held the little green Bible in his hands, but wasn\u2019t looking at it; he was speaking from memory, and his eyes went from Mr. MacDuff, standing alone, for his wife and his sister were both sick, to the little boy beside him\u2014a little boy about Jemmy\u2019s age.</p><p>\u201cThough I walk . . . though I walk through the valley of death, I shall . . . shall fear no evil\u2014\u201d His voice was trembling audibly, and I saw that tears were running down his face. I looked for Bree; she was standing a little way behind the mourners, Jem half-swaddled in the folds of her dark cloak. The hood of it was drawn up, but her face was visible, pale in the gloaming, Our Lady of Sorrows.</p> <p>Even Major MacDonald\u2019s red coat was muted, charcoal-gray in the last vestiges of light. He had arrived in the afternoon, and helped to carry up the little coffin; he stood now, hat somberly tucked beneath his arm, wigged head bowed, his face invisible. He, too, had a child\u2014a daughter, somewhere back in Scotland with her mother.</p><p>I swayed a little, and felt Jamie\u2019s hand under my elbow. I had been without sleep for most of the last three days, and had taken precious little food. I didn\u2019t feel either hungry or tired, though; I felt remote and unreal, as though the wind blew through me.</p><p>The father uttered a cry of inconsolable grief, and sank suddenly down upon the heap of dirt thrown up by the grave. I felt Jamie\u2019s muscles contract in instinctive compassion toward him, and pulled away a little, murmuring, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>I saw him cross swiftly to Mr. MacAfee, bend to whisper to him, put an arm around him. Roger had stopped talking.</p><p>My thoughts would not obey me. Try as I might to fix them on the proceedings, they strayed away. My arms ached; I had been pounding herbs, lifting patients, carrying water . . . I felt as though I were doing all these things over and over, could feel the repetitive thud of pestle in mortar, the dragging weight of fainting bodies. I was seeing in vivid memory the slides of Entameba, greedy pseudopodia flowing in slow-motion appetite. Water, I heard water flowing; it lived in water, though only the cystic form was infective. It was passed on by means of water. I thought that very clearly.</p><p>Then I was lying on the ground, with no memory of falling, no memory of ever being upright, the smell of fresh, damp dirt and fresh, damp wood strong in my nose, and a vague thought of worms. There was a flutter of motion before my eyes; the small green Bible had fallen and lay on the dirt in front of my face, the wind turning over its pages, one by one by one in a ghostly game of sortes Virgilianae\u2014where would it stop? I wondered dimly.</p> <p>There were hands and voices, but I could not pay attention. A great amoeba floated majestically in darkness before me, pseudopodia flowing slowly, slowly, in welcoming embrace.</p><p>63</p><p>MOMENT OF DECISION</p><p>FEVER ROLLED ACROSS MY MIND like a thunderstorm, jagged forks of pain crackling through my body in bursts of brilliance, each a lightning bolt that glowed for a vivid moment along some nerve or plexus, lighting up the hidden hollows of my joints, burning down the length of muscle fibers. A merciless brilliance, it struck again, and again, the fiery sword of a destroying angel who gave no quarter.</p><p>I seldom knew whether my eyes were open or closed, nor whether I woke or slept. I saw nothing but a roiling gray, turbulent and shot with red. The redness pulsed in veins and patches, shrouded in the cloud. I seized upon one crimson vein and followed its path, clinging to the track of its sullen glow amid the buffeting of thunder. The thunder grew louder as I penetrated deeper and deeper into the murk that boiled around me, becoming hideously regular, like the beating of a kettledrum, so that my ears rang with it, and I felt myself a hollow skin, tight-stretched, vibrating with each crash of sound.</p><p>The source of it was now before me, throbbing so loudly that I felt I must shout, only to hear some other sound\u2014but though I felt my lips draw back and my throat swell with effort, I heard nothing but the pounding. In desperation, I thrust my hands\u2014if they were my hands\u2014through the misty gray and seized some warm, moist object, very slippery, that throbbed, convulsing in my hands.</p><p>I looked down and knew it all at once to be my own heart.</p><p>I dropped it in horror, and it crawled away in a trail of reddish slime, shuddering with effort, the valves all opening and closing like the mouths of suffocating fish, each popping open with a hollow click, closing again with a small, meaty thud.</p> <p>Faces sometimes appeared in the clouds. Some seemed familiar, though I could put no name to them. Others were the faces of strangers, the half-seen, unknown faces that flit sometimes through the mind on the verge of sleep. These looked at me with curiosity or indifference\u2014then turned away.</p><p>The others, the ones I knew, bore looks of sympathy or worry; they would seek to fix my gaze with theirs, but my glance slid guiltily off, giddily away, unable to gain traction. Their lips moved, and I knew they spoke to me, but I heard nothing, their words drowned by the silent thunder of my storm.</p><p>I FELT QUITE ODD\u2014 but, for the first time in uncountable days, not ill. The fever clouds had rolled back; still grumbling softly somewhere near, but for the moment, gone from sight. My eyes were clear; I could see the raw wood in the beams overhead.</p><p>In fact, I saw the wood with such clarity that I was struck with awe at the beauty of it. The loops and whorls of the polished grain seemed at once static and alive with grace, the colors of it shimmering with smoke and the essence of the earth, so that I could see how the beam was transformed and yet held still the spirit of the tree.</p><p>I was so entranced by this that I reached out my hand to touch it\u2014and did. My fingers brushed the wood with delight at the cool surface and the grooves of the axmarks, wing-shaped and regular as a flight of geese along the beam. I could hear the beating of powerful wings, and at the same time, feel the flex and swing of my shoulders, the vibration of joy through my forearms as the ax fell on the wood. As I explored this fascinating sensation, it occurred to me, dimly, that the beam was eight feet above the bed.</p><p>I turned\u2014with no sense whatever of effort\u2014and saw that I lay upon the bed below.</p><p>I lay on my back, the quilts rumpled and scattered, as though I had tried at some point to throw them off but lacked the strength to do so. The air in the room was strangely still, and the blocks of color in the fabric glowed through it like jewels at the bottom of the sea, rich but muted.</p><p>By contrast, my skin was the color of pearls, bloodless pale and shimmering. And then I saw that this was because I was so thin that the skin of face and limb pressed hard upon the bone, and it was the gleam of bone and cartilage below that gave that luster to my face, smooth hardness shining through transparent skin.</p><p>And such bones as they were! I was filled with wonder at the marvel of their shaping. My eyes followed the delicacy of the arching ribs, the heartbreaking beauty of the sculptured skull with a sense of awed astonishment.</p><p>My hair was tumbled, matted, and snarled . . . and yet I felt myself drawn to it, tracing its curves with eye and . . . finger? For I had no consciousness of moving, and yet I felt the softness of the strands, the cool silk of brown and the springing vibrancy of silver, heard the hairs chime softly past each other, a rustle of notes cascading like a harp\u2019s.</p><p>My God, I said, and heard the words, though no sound stirred the air, you are so lovely!</p><p>My eyes were open. I looked deep and met a gaze of amber and soft gold. The eyes looked through me, to something far beyond\u2014and yet they saw me, too. I saw the pupils dilate slightly, and felt the warmth of their darkness embrace me with knowledge and acceptance. Yes, said those knowing eyes. I know you. Let us go. I felt a sense of great peace, and the air around me stirred, like wind rushing through feathers.</p><p>Then some sound turned me toward the window and I saw the man who stood there. I had no name for him, and yet I loved him. He stood with his back turned to the bed, arms braced on the sill, and his head sunk on his chest, so the dawn light glowed red on his hair and traced his arms with gold. A spasm of grief shook him; I felt it, like the temblors of a distant quake.</p><p>Someone moved near him. A dark-haired woman, a girl. She came close, touched his back, murmuring something to him. I saw the way she looked at him, the tender inclination of her head, the intimacy of her body swaying toward him.</p><p>No, I thought, with great calm. That won\u2019t do.</p><p>I looked once more at myself lying on the bed, and with a feeling that was at once firm decision and incalculable regret, I took another breath.</p><p>64</p><p>I AM THE RESURRECTION,</p><p>PART 2</p><p>I STILL SLEPT FOR LONG PERIODS, waking only briefly to take nourishment. Now the fever dreams were gone, though, and sleep was a lake of deep black water, where I breathed oblivion and drifted past the waving waterweed, mindless as a fish.</p><p>I would float sometimes just below the surface, aware of people and things in the air-breathing world, but incapable of joining them. Voices spoke near me, muffled and meaningless. Now and then some phrase would penetrate the clear liquid around me and float into my head, where it would hang like a tiny jellyfish, round and transparent, yet pulsating with some mysterious inner meaning, its words a drifting net.</p><p>Each phrase hung for a time in my purview, folding and unfolding in its curious rhythms, and then drifted quietly up and away, leaving silence.</p><p>And in between the small jellyfish came open spaces of clear water, some filled with radiant light, some the darkness of utter peace. I drifted upward and downward, suspended between the surface and the depths, at the whim of unknown currents.</p><p>\u201cPhysician, look.\u201d Fizz. A stirring there, some dormant spore of consciousness, disturbed by carbonation, splits and blooms. Then a stab as sharp as metal, Who is calling me? \u201cPhysician, look.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>It was no great shock, for the room was filled with twilight, still light, like being underwater, and I had no sense of disruption.</p><p>\u201cO Lord Jesus Christ, Thou great Physician: Look with Thy gracious favor upon this Thy servant; give wisdom and discretion to those who minister to her in her sickness; bless all the means used for her recovery . . .\u201d</p><p>The words flowed past me in a whispering stream, cool on my skin. There was a man before me, dark head bent over a book. The light in the room embraced him and he seemed part of it.</p><p>\u201cStretch forth Thy hand,\u201d he whispered to the pages, in a voice that cracked and broke, \u201cand according to Thy will, restore her to health and strength, that she may live to praise Thee for Thy goodness and Thy grace; to the glory of Thy holy name. Amen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d I said, groping for his name. My own voice was hoarse from disuse; speaking was an intolerable effort.</p><p>His eyes were closed in prayer; they sprang open, unbelieving, and I thought how vivid they were, the green of wet serpentine and summer leaves.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d His voice cracked like a teenaged boy\u2019s, and he dropped the book.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, feeling the dreamlike sense of submergence threatening to engulf me again. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>I COULD LIFT A HAND for a moment or two, but was too weak even to lift my head, let alone sit up. Roger helpfully dragged me semi-upright against piled pillows, and put his hand at the back of my head to prevent wobbling, holding a cup of water to my dry lips. It was the odd feel of his hand on the bare skin of my neck that began a dim process of realization. Then I felt the warmth of his hand, vivid and immediate, at the back of my head, and jerked like a gaffed salmon, sending the cup flying.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d I spluttered, clutching my head, too shocked to formulate a complete sentence, and oblivious to the cold water soaking through the sheets. \u201cWHAT?!\u201d</p><p>Roger looked nearly as shocked as I felt. He swallowed, searching for words. \u201cI . . . I . . . I thought you knew,\u201d he stammered, voice breaking. \u201cDidn\u2019t you . . . ? I mean . . . I thought . . . look, it\u2019ll grow!\u201d</p><p>I could feel my mouth working, vainly trying different shapes that might approximate words, but there was no connection between tongue and brain\u2014there was room for nothing but the realization that the accustomed soft, heavy weight of my hair was gone, replaced by a fuzz of bristles.</p><p>\u201cMalva and Mrs. Bug cut it off, day before yesterday,\u201d Roger said, all in a rush. \u201cThey\u2014we weren\u2019t here, Bree nor I, we wouldn\u2019t have let them, of course we wouldn\u2019t\u2014but they thought it\u2019s what you do for someone with a terrible fever, it is what people do now. Bree was furious with them, but they thought\u2014they truly thought they were helping save your life\u2014oh, God, Claire, don\u2019t look like that, please!\u201d</p><p>His face had disappeared in a starburst of light, a curtain of shimmering water suddenly coming down to protect me from the gaze of the world.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t conscious of crying, at all. Grief simply burst from me, like wine spraying from a wineskin stabbed with a knife. Purple-red as bone marrow, splattering and dripping everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch Jamie!\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I seized him by the sleeve, with more strength than I would have imagined I possessed. \u201cGod, no! I don\u2019t want him to see me like this!\u201d</p><p>His momentary silence told me, but I kept stubborn hold of his sleeve, unable to think how else to prevent the unthinkable. I blinked, water sliding over my face like a stream over rock, and Roger wavered once more into visibility, blurred around the edges.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . er . . . he\u2019s seen you,\u201d Roger said gruffly. He looked down, not wanting to meet my eyes. \u201cIt. Already. I mean\u2014\u201d He waved a hand vaguely in the vicinity of his own black locks. \u201cHe saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d This was nearly as much a shock as the initial discovery. \u201cWhat\u2014what did he say?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and looked back up, like someone fearing to see a Gorgon. Or the anti-Gorgon, I thought bitterly.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Roger said quite gently, and put a hand on my arm. \u201cHe\u2014he just cried.\u201d</p><p>I was still crying, too, but in a more orthodox fashion now. Less of the gasping note. The sense of bone-deep cold had passed, and my limbs felt warm now, though I still felt a disconcertingly chilly breeze on my scalp. My heart was slowing again, and a faint sense that I was standing outside my body came over me.</p><p>Shock? I thought, dimly surprised as the word formed itself in my mind, rubbery and melting. I supposed that one could suffer true physical shock as the result of emotional wounds\u2014of course one could, I knew that. . . .</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d I became aware that Roger was calling my name with increasing urgency, and shaking my arm. With immense effort, I brought my eyes to focus on him. He was looking truly alarmed, and I wondered, vaguely, whether I had started to die again. But no\u2014it was too late for that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed\u2014with relief, I thought.</p><p>\u201cYou looked funny for a moment.\u201d His voice was cracked and husky; he sounded as though it hurt him to talk. \u201cI thought\u2014d\u2019ye want another drink of water?\u201d</p><p>The suggestion seemed so incongruous that I nearly laughed. But I was terribly thirsty\u2014and all at once, a cup of cold water seemed the most desirable thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The tears continued to flow down my face, but now seemed almost soothing. I made no attempt to stop them\u2014that seemed much too difficult\u2014but blotted my face with a corner of the damp sheet.</p><p>It was beginning to dawn on me that I might not have made the wisest\u2014or at least not the easiest\u2014choice, when I decided not to die. Things outside the limits and concerns of my own body were starting to come back. Troubles, difficulties, dangers . . . sorrow. Dark, frightening things, like a swarm of bats. I didn\u2019t want to look too closely at the images that lay in a disorderly pile at the bottom of my brain\u2014things I had jettisoned in the struggle to stay afloat.</p><p>But if I had come back, I had come back to be what I was\u2014and I was a doctor.</p><p>\u201cThe . . . sickness.\u201d I blotted the last of the tears and let Roger wrap his hands around mine, helping me to hold the new cup. \u201cIs it still\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He spoke gently, and guided the rim of the cup to my lips. What was it? I wondered vaguely. Water, but with something in it\u2014mint and something stronger, more bitter . . . angelica?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stopped.\u201d Roger held the cup, letting me sip slowly. \u201cNo one\u2019s fallen sick in the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week?\u201d I bobbled the cup, spilling a little down my chin. \u201cHow long have I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about that.\u201d He cleared his throat. Roger\u2019s eyes were intent on the cup; he skimmed a thumb lightly along my chin, removing the drops I had spilled. \u201cYou were among the last to fall sick.\u201d</p><p>I took a long breath, then drank a bit more. The liquid had a soft, sweet taste, too, floating over the bitter tang . . . honey. My mind located the word and I felt a sense of relief at having located this small missing piece of reality.</p><p>I knew from his manner that some of the sick had died, but asked no more for the moment. Deciding to live was one thing. Rejoining the world of the living was a struggle that would take strength I didn\u2019t have right now. I had pulled up my roots, and lay like a wilted plant; sinking them back into the earth was beyond me for the moment.</p><p>The knowledge that people I knew\u2014perhaps had loved\u2014had died seemed an equal grief to the loss of my hair\u2014and either was more than I could cope with.</p><p>I drank two further cups of honey-sweetened water, despite the underlying bitterness, then lay back with a sigh, my stomach feeling like a small, cold balloon.</p><p>\u201cYe want to take a bit of rest,\u201d Roger advised me, putting down the cup on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch Brianna, aye? But you sleep if ye want to.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t strength to nod, but managed a twitch of the lips that seemed to pass muster as a smile. I reached up a trembling hand and brushed it gingerly over the top of my shorn head. Roger flinched, very slightly.</p><p>He rose, and I saw how thin and strained he looked\u2014he would have been helping tend the sick all week, I supposed, not only me. And bury the dead. He was licensed to conduct funerals.</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d It was a terrible effort to speak; so terribly hard to find the words, separate them from the tangle in my head. \u201cHave you eaten anything recently?\u201d</p><p>His face changed then, a look of relief lightening the lines of strain and worry.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, cleared his throat again, and smiled. \u201cNot since last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well,\u201d I said, and lifted one hand, heavy as lead. \u201cDo. Get something. Won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will.\u201d Instead of leaving, though, he hesitated, then took several rapid strides back, bent over the bed, and seizing my face between his palms, kissed me on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said fiercely, and with a final squeeze of my cheeks, left.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said faintly, but the only answer was the bellying of the curtain as the breeze came in, scented with apples.</p><p>IN POINT OF FACT, I looked like a skeleton with a particularly unflattering crew cut, as I learned when I finally gained sufficient strength as to force Jamie to bring me a looking glass.</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose ye\u2019d think of wearing a cap?\u201d he suggested, diffidently fingering a muslin specimen that Marsali had brought me. \u201cOnly until it grows out a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I bloody would.\u201d</p><p>I had some difficulty in saying this, shocked as I was by the horrifying vision in the glass. In fact, I had a strong impulse to seize the cap from his hands, put it on and pull it down to my shoulders.</p><p>I had rejected earlier offers of a cap from Mrs. Bug\u2014who had been volubly congratulating herself on my survival as the obvious result of her fever treatment\u2014and from Marsali, Malva, and every other woman who\u2019d come to visit me.</p><p>This was simple contrariness on my part; the sight of my unrestrained hair outraged their Scottish sense of what was proper in a woman, and they\u2019d been trying\u2014with varying degrees of subtlety\u2014to force me into a cap for years. I was damned if I\u2019d let circumstance accomplish it for them.</p><p>Having now seen myself in a mirror, I felt somewhat less adamant about it. And my scalped head did feel a bit chilly. On the other hand, I realized that if I were to give in, Jamie would be terribly alarmed\u2014and I thought I\u2019d frightened him quite enough, judging by the hollow look of his face and the deep smudges under his eyes.</p><p>As it was, his face had lightened considerably when I rejected the cap he was holding, and he tossed it aside.</p><p>I carefully turned the looking glass over and set it on the counterpane, repressing a sigh.</p><p>\u201cAlways good for a laugh, I suppose, seeing the expressions on people\u2019s faces when they catch sight of me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at me, the corner of his mouth twitching.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re verra beautiful, Sassenach,\u201d he said gently. Then he burst out laughing, snorting through his nose and wheezing. I raised one eyebrow at him, picked up the glass and looked again\u2014which made him laugh harder.</p><p>I leaned back against the pillows, feeling a bit better. The fever had quite gone, but I still felt wraithlike and weak, barely able to sit up unassisted, and I fell asleep almost without warning, after the least exertion.</p><p>Jamie, still snorting, took my hand, raised it to his mouth, and kissed it. The sudden warm immediacy of the touch rippled the fair hairs of my forearm, and my fingers closed involuntarily on his.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said very softly, his shoulders still trembling with laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, suddenly feeling quite a lot better. \u201cWell, then. I love you, too. And it will grow, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it will.\u201d He kissed my hand again, and set it gently on the quilt. \u201cHave ye eaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d I said, with what forbearance I could muster. \u201cI\u2019ll have more later.\u201d</p><p>I had realized many years before why \u201cpatients\u201d are called that; it\u2019s because a sick person is generally incapacitated, and thus obliged to put up with any amount of harassment and annoyance from persons who are not sick.</p><p>The fever had broken and I had regained consciousness two days before; since then, the invariable response of everyone who saw me was to gasp at my appearance, urge me to wear a cap\u2014and then try to force food down my throat. Jamie, more sensitive to my tones of voice than were Mrs. Bug, Malva, Brianna, or Marsali, wisely desisted after a quick glance at the tray by the bed to see that I actually had eaten something.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s happened,\u201d I said, settling and bracing myself. \u201cWho\u2019s been ill? How are they? And who\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cWho\u2019s died?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me, obviously trying to guess whether I would faint, die, or leap out of bed if he told me.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re sure ye feel well enough, Sassenach?\u201d he asked dubiously. \u201cIt\u2019s news that wilna spoil with keeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have to hear sooner or later, don\u2019t I? And knowing is better than worrying about what I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking the point, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAye, then. Padraic and his daughter are well on the mend. Evan\u2014he\u2019s lost his youngest, wee Bobby, and Grace is still ill, but Hugh and Caitlin didna fall sick at all.\u201d He swallowed, and went on. \u201cThree of the fisher-folk have died; there\u2019s maybe a dozen still ailing, but most are on the mend.\u201d He knit his brows, considering. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s Tom Christie. He\u2019s still bad, I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? Malva didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d But then, Malva had refused to tell me anything when I\u2019d asked earlier, insisting that I must just rest, and not worry myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Allan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s fine,\u201d Jamie assured me.</p><p>\u201cHow long has Tom been sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken. The lass can tell ye.\u201d</p><p>I nodded\u2014a mistake, as the light-headedness had not left me yet, and I was obliged to shut my eyes and let my head fall back, illuminated patterns flashing behind my lids.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very odd,\u201d I said, a little breathlessly, hearing Jamie start up in response to my small collapse. \u201cWhen I close my eyes, often I see stars\u2014but not like stars in the sky. They look just like the stars on the lining of a doll\u2019s suitcase\u2014a portmanteau, I mean\u2014that I had as a child. Why do you suppose that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI havena got the slightest idea.\u201d There was a rustle as he sat back down on the stool. \u201cYe\u2019re no still delirious, are ye?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t think so. Was I delirious?\u201d Breathing deeply and carefully, I opened my eyes and gave him my best attempt at a smile.</p><p>\u201cYe were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know what I said?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but I may tell ye sometime, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I considered closing my eyes and floating off to sleep, rather than contemplate future embarrassments, but rallied. If I was going to live\u2014and I was\u2014I needed to gather up the strands of life that tethered me to the earth, and reattach them.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s family, and Marsali\u2019s\u2014they\u2019re all right?\u201d I asked only for form\u2019s sake; both Bree and Marsali had come to hover anxiously over my prostrate form, and while neither one would tell me anything they thought might upset me in my weakened condition, I was reasonably sure that neither one could have kept it secret if the children were seriously ill.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said slowly, \u201caye, they\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, picking up the hesitation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d he repeated quickly. \u201cNone of them has fallen ill at all.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a cold look, though careful not to move too much while doing it.</p><p>\u201cYou may as well tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it out of Mrs. Bug if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As though mention of her name had invoked her, I heard the distinctive thump of Mrs. Bug\u2019s clogs on the stair, approaching. She was moving more slowly than usual, and with a care suggesting that she was laden with something.</p><p>This proved to be true; she negotiated sideways through the door, beaming, a loaded tray in one hand, the other wrapped round Henri-Christian, who clung to her, monkeylike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought ye a wee bit to eat, a leannan,\u201d she said briskly, nudging the barely touched bowl of parritch and plate of cold toast aside to make room for the fresh provisions. \u201cYe\u2019re no catching, are ye?\u201d</p><p>Barely waiting for my shake of the head, she leaned over the bed and gently decanted Henri-Christian into my arms. Undiscriminatingly friendly as always, he butted his head under my chin, nuzzled into my chest, and began mouthing my knuckles, his sharp little baby teeth making small dents in my skin.</p><p>\u201cHallo, what\u2019s happened here?\u201d I frowned, smoothing the soft brown licks of baby hair off his rounded brow, where the yellowing stain of an ugly bruise showed at his hairline.</p><p>\u201cThe spawn of the de\u2019il tried to kill the poor wean,\u201d Mrs. Bug informed me, mouth pulled tight. \u201cAnd would have done, too, save for Roger Mac, bless him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? Which spawn was this?\u201d I asked, familiar with Mrs. Bug\u2019s methods of description.</p><p>\u201cSome of the fishers\u2019 weans,\u201d Jamie said. He put out a finger and touched Henri-Christian\u2019s nose, snatched it away as the baby grabbed for it, then touched his nose again. Henri-Christian giggled and grabbed his own nose, entranced by the game.</p><p>\u201cThe wicked creatures tried to drown him,\u201d Mrs. Bug amplified. \u201cStole the puir wee laddie in his basket and set him adrift in the creek!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think they meant to drown him,\u201d Jamie said mildly, still absorbed in the game. \u201cIf so, they wouldna have troubled wi\u2019 the basket, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d was Mrs. Bug\u2019s response to this piece of logic. \u201cThey didna mean to do him any good,\u201d she added darkly.</p> <p>I had been taking a quick inventory of Henri-Christian\u2019s physique, finding several more healing bruises, a small scabbed cut on one heel, and a scraped knee.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been bumped about a bit, haven\u2019t you?\u201d I said to him.</p><p>\u201cUmp. Heeheehee!\u201d said Henri-Christian, vastly entertained by my explorations.</p><p>\u201cRoger saved him?\u201d I asked, glancing up at Jamie.</p><p>He nodded, one side of his mouth turning up a little.</p><p>\u201cAye. I didna ken what was going on, \u2019til wee Joanie rushed up to me, shouting as they\u2019d taken her brother\u2014but I got there in time to see the end of the matter.\u201d</p> <p>The boys had set the baby\u2019s basket afloat in the trout pool, a wide, deep spot in the creek, where the water was fairly quiet. Made of stoutly woven reeds, the basket had floated\u2014long enough for the current to push it toward the outfall from the pool, where the water ran swiftly through a stretch of rocks, before plunging over a three-foot fall, down into a tumbling churn of water and boulders.</p><p>Roger had been building a rail fence, within earshot of the creek. Hearing boys shouting and F\u00e9licit\u00e9\u2019s steam-whistle shrieks, he had dropped the rail he was holding and rushed down the hill, thinking that she was being tormented.</p><p>Instead, he had burst from the trees just in time to see Henri-Christian, in his basket, tip slowly over the edge of the outfall and start bumping crazily from rock to rock, spinning in the current and taking on water.</p><p>Running down the bank and launching himself in a flat dive, Roger had landed full-length in the creek just below the fall, in time for Henri-Christian, bawling with terror, to drop from his sodden basket, plummet down the fall, and land on Roger, who grabbed him.</p><p>\u201cI was just in time to see it,\u201d Jamie informed me, grinning at the memory. \u201cAnd then to see Roger Mac rise out o\u2019 the water like a triton, wi\u2019 duckweed streaming from his hair, blood runnin\u2019 from his nose, and the wee lad clutched tight in his arms. A terrible sight, he was.\u201d</p><p>The miscreant boys had followed the basket\u2019s career, yelling along the banks, but were now struck dumb. One of them moved to flee, the others starting up like a flight of pigeons, but Roger had pointed an awful finger at them and bellowed, \u201cSheas!\u201d in a voice loud enough to be heard over the racket of the creek.</p><p>Such was the force of his presence, they did stay, frozen in terror.</p><p>Holding them with his glare, Roger had waded almost to the shore. There, he squatted and cupped a handful of water, which he poured over the head of the shrieking baby\u2014who promptly quit shrieking.</p> <p>\u201cI baptize thee, Henri-Christian,\u201d Roger had bellowed, in his hoarse, cracked voice. \u201cIn the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost! D\u2019ye hear me, wee bastards? His name is Christian! He belongs to the Lord! Trouble him again, ye lot of scabs, and Satan will pop up and drag ye straight down screaming\u2014TO HELL!\u201d</p><p>He stabbed an accusing finger once more at the boys, who this time did break and run, scampering wildly into the brush, pushing and falling in their urge to escape.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said, torn between laughter and dismay. I looked down at Henri-Christian, who had lately discovered the joys of thumb-sucking and was absorbed in further study of the art. \u201cThat must have been impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt impressed me, to be sure,\u201d Jamie said, still grinning. \u201cI\u2019d no notion Roger Mac had it in him to preach hellfire and damnation like that. The lad\u2019s a great roar to him, cracked voice and all. He\u2019d have a good audience, did he do it for a Gathering, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains what happened to his voice,\u201d I said. \u201cI wondered. Do you think it was only mischief, though? Them putting the baby in the creek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was mischief, sure enough,\u201d he said, and cupped a big hand gently round Henri-Christian\u2019s head. \u201cNot just boys\u2019 mischief, though.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had caught one of the fleeing boys as they hurtled past him, grabbing him by the neck and quite literally scaring the piss out of the lad. Walking the boy firmly into the wood, he\u2019d pinned him hard against a tree and demanded to know the meaning of this attempted murder.</p><p>Trembling and blubbering, the boy had tried to excuse it, saying that they hadn\u2019t meant any harm to the wean, truly! They\u2019d only wanted to see him float\u2014for their parents all said he was demon-born, and everyone kent that those born of Satan floated, because the water would reject their wickedness. They\u2019d taken the baby in his basket and put that into the water, because they were afraid to touch him, fearing his flesh would burn them.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d burn him myself,\u201d Jamie said with a certain grimness, \u201cand did.\u201d He\u2019d then dismissed the smarting lad, with instructions to go home, change his breeks, and inform his confederates that they were expected in Jamie\u2019s study before supper to receive their own share of retribution\u2014or else Himself would be coming round to their houses after supper, to thrash them before their parents\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid they come?\u201d I asked, fascinated.</p><p>He gave me a look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cOf course. They took their medicine, and then we went to the kitchen and had bread and honey. I\u2019d told Marsali to bring the wee lad, and after we\u2019d eaten, I took him on my knee, and had them all come and touch him, just to see.\u201d</p><p>He smiled lopsidedly.</p><p>\u201cOne of the lads asked me was it true, what Mr. Roger said, about the wean belonging to the Lord? I told him I certainly wouldna argue with Mr. Roger about that\u2014but whoever else he belonged to, Henri-Christian belongs to me, as well, and best they should remember it.\u201d</p><p>His finger trailed slowly down Henri-Christian\u2019s round, smooth cheek. The baby was nearly asleep now, heavy eyelids closing, a tiny, glistening thumb half in, half out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that,\u201d I said softly, so as not to wake him. He\u2019d grown much warmer, as sleeping babies did, and heavy in the curve of my arm. Jamie saw that I was having difficulty holding him, and took him from me, handing him back to Mrs. Bug, who had been bustling quietly round the room, tidying, all the while listening with approval to Jamie\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2019twas something to see,\u201d she assured me in a whisper, patting Henri-Christian\u2019s back as she took him. \u201cAnd the lads all poking their fingers out to touch the bairnie\u2019s wee belly, gingerlike, as if they meant to prod a hot potato, and him squirmin\u2019 and giggling like a worm wi\u2019 the fits. The wicked little gomerels\u2019 eyes were big as sixpences!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they were,\u201d I said, amused.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d I remarked sotto voce to Jamie as she left with the baby, \u201cif their parents think he\u2019s demon-born, and you\u2019re his grandfather . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re his grannie, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cIt might be you. But aye, I\u2019d prefer not to have them dwell on that aspect of the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThough\u2014do any of them know, do you think, that Marsali isn\u2019t your daughter by blood? They must know about Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldna much matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think wee Henri\u2019s a changeling, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople talk,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cAre ye feeling well in yourself, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>Relieved of the baby\u2019s weight, I had put back the covers a bit to let in air. Jamie stared at me in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I can count all your ribs! Right through your shift!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the experience while you can,\u201d I advised him tartly, though I felt a sharp pang of hurt. He seemed to sense this, for he took my hand, tracing the lines of the deep blue veins that ran across the back of it.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,\u201d he said, more gently. \u201cI didna mean it that way. Here, Mrs. Bug\u2019s brought ye something tasty, I expect.\u201d He lifted the lid off a small covered dish, frowned at the substance in it, then stuck a cautious finger in and licked it.</p><p>\u201cMaple pudding,\u201d he announced, looking happy.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I had no appetite at all yet, but maple pudding sounded at least innocuous, and I made no objection as he scooped up a spoonful, guiding it toward my mouth with the concentration of a man flying an airliner.</p><p>\u201cI can feed myself, you kn\u2014\u201d He slipped the spoon between my lips, and I resignedly sucked the pudding off it. Amazing revelations of creamy sweetness immediately exploded in my mouth, and I closed my eyes in minor ecstasy, recalling.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what good food tastes like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew ye hadn\u2019t been eating,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cHere, have more.\u201d</p><p>I insisted upon taking the spoon myself, and managed half the dish; Jamie ate the other half, at my urging.</p><p>\u201cYou may not be as thin as I am,\u201d I said, turning my hand over and grimacing at the sight of my protruding wrist bones, \u201cbut you haven\u2019t been eating a lot, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d He scraped the spoon carefully round the bowl, retrieving the last bits of pudding, and sucked the spoon clean. \u201cIt\u2019s been . . . busy.\u201d</p><p>I watched him narrowly. He was being patently cheerful, but my rusty sensibilities were beginning to come back. For some unknowable span of time, I\u2019d had neither energy nor attention for anything that lay outside the fever-racked shell of my body; now I was seeing the small familiarities of Jamie\u2019s body, voice and manner, and becoming reattuned to him, like a slack violin string being tightened in the presence of a tuning fork.</p><p>I could feel the vibration of some strain in him, and I was beginning to think it wasn\u2019t all due to my recent near-demise.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He raised his eyebrows in question, but I knew him too well for that. The question alone gave me confidence that I was right.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d I asked, with what patience I could muster. \u201cIs it Brown again? Have you got news of Stephen Bonnet? Or Donner? Or has the white sow eaten one of the children and choked to death?\u201d</p><p>That made him smile, at least, though only for a moment.</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe went for MacDonald, when he called a few days ago, but he made it onto the porch in time. Verra agile the Major is, for a man of his age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s younger than you are,\u201d I objected.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m agile, too,\u201d he said logically. \u201cThe sow hasna got me yet, has she?\u201d</p><p>I felt a qualm of unease at his mention of the Major, but it wasn\u2019t news of political unrest or military rumblings that was troubling Jamie; he would have told me that at once. I narrowed my eyes at him again, but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cI am thinking I must send them away,\u201d he said quietly, and took my hand again.</p><p>\u201cSend who away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus and Marsali and the weans.\u201d</p><p>I felt a sharp, sudden jolt, as though someone had struck me just below the breastbone, and found it suddenly difficult to draw breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? And\u2014and where?\u201d I managed to ask.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb lightly over my knuckles, back and forth, his eyes focused on the small motion.</p><p>\u201cFergus tried to kill himself, three days ago,\u201d he said very quietly.</p><p>My hand gripped his convulsively.</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d I whispered. He nodded, and I saw that he was unable to speak for the moment; his teeth were set in his lower lip.</p><p>Now it was I who took his hand in both of mine, feeling coldness seep through my flesh. I wanted to deny it, reject the notion utterly\u2014but couldn\u2019t. It sat there between us, an ugly thing like a poisonous toad that neither of us wished to touch.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I said at last. My voice seemed to echo in the room. I wanted to say, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d but I knew he was.</p><p>\u201cWith a knife,\u201d he replied literally. The corner of his mouth twitched again, but not with humor. \u201cHe said he would have hanged himself, but he couldna tie the rope with one hand. Lucky, that.\u201d</p><p>The pudding had formed a small, hard ball, like rubber, that lay in the bottom of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . found him? Or was it Marsali?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe doesna ken. Or rather, I expect she does, but she\u2019s no admitting it\u2014to either of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t have been badly wounded, then, or she\u2019d have to know for sure.\u201d My chest still hurt, but the words were coming more easily.</p><p>\u201cNo. I saw him go past, whilst I was scraping a deer\u2019s hide up on the hill. He didna see me, and I didna call out\u2014I dinna ken what it was that struck me queer about him . . . but something did. I went on wi\u2019 my work for a bit\u2014I didna want to go far from the house, in case\u2014but it niggled at me.\u201d He let go of my hand and rubbed his knuckles underneath his nose.</p><p>\u201cI couldna seem to let go of the thought that something was amiss, and finally I put down my work and went after him, thinking myself all kinds of a fool for it.\u201d</p><p>Fergus had headed over the end of the Ridge, and down the wooded slope that led to the White Spring. This was the most remote and secluded of the three springs on the Ridge, called \u201cwhite\u201d because of the large pale boulder that stood near the head of the pool.</p><p>Jamie had come down through the trees in time to see Fergus lie down by the spring, sleeve rolled up and coat folded beneath his head, and submerge his handless left arm in the water.</p><p>\u201cI should maybe ha\u2019 shouted then,\u201d he said, rubbing a distracted hand through his hair. \u201cBut I couldna really believe it, ken?\u201d</p><p>Then Fergus had taken a small boning knife in his right hand, reached down into the pool, and neatly opened the veins of his left elbow, blood blooming in a soft, dark cloud around the whiteness of his arm.</p><p>\u201cI shouted then,\u201d Jamie said. He closed his eyes, and scrubbed his hands hard over his face, as though trying to erase the memory of it.</p><p>He had run down the hill, grabbed Fergus, jerked him to his feet, and hit him.</p><p>\u201cYou hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky I didna break his neck, the wee bastard.\u201d Color had begun to rise in his face as he talked, and he pressed his lips tight together.</p><p>\u201cWas this after the boys took Henri-Christian?\u201d I asked, my memory of the conversation in the stable with Fergus vividly in mind. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken what ye mean,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cAnd it was the day after the lads put Henri-Christian in the creek, aye. It wasna only that, though\u2014not only all the trouble over the wee laddie being a dwarf, I mean.\u201d He glanced at me, his face troubled.</p><p>\u201cWe talked. After I\u2019d bound up his arm and brought him round. He said he\u2019d been thinking of it for some time; the thing wi\u2019 the bairn only pushed him into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . how could he?\u201d I said, distressed. \u201cTo leave Marsali, and the children\u2014how?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked down, hands braced on his knees, and sighed. The window was open, and a soft breeze came in, lifting the hairs on the crown of his head like tiny flames.</p><p>\u201cHe thought they would do better without him,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cIf he was dead, Marsali could wed again\u2014find a man who could care for her and the weans. Provide for them. Protect wee Henri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks\u2014thought\u2014he couldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced sharply at me.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said, \u201che kens damn well he can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I drew breath to protest this, but bit my lip instead, finding no immediate rebuttal.</p><p>Jamie stood up and moved restlessly about the room, picking things up and putting them down.</p><p>\u201cWould you do such a thing?\u201d I asked, after a bit. \u201cIn the same circumstances, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, his back to me, hand on my hairbrush.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut it\u2019s a hard thing for a man to live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I see that . . .\u201d I began, slowly, but he swung round to face me. His own face was strained, filled with a weariness that had little to do with lack of sleep.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYe don\u2019t.\u201d He spoke gently, but with such a tone of despair in his voice that tears came to my eyes.</p><p>It was as much sheer physical weakness as emotional distress, but I knew that if I gave way to it, the end would be complete soggy disintegration, and no one needed that just now. I bit my lip hard and wiped my eyes with the edge of the sheet.</p><p>I heard the thump as he knelt down beside me, and I reached out blindly for him, pulling his head against my breast. He put his arms round me and sighed deeply, his breath warm on my skin through the linen of my shift. I stroked his hair with one trembling hand, and felt him give way suddenly, all the tension going out of him like water running from a jug.</p><p>I had the oddest feeling, then\u2014as though the strength he had clung to had now been let go . . . and was flowing into me. My tenuous grip on my own body firmed as I held his, and my heart ceased wavering, taking up instead its normal solid, tireless beating.</p><p>The tears had retreated, though they were precariously near the surface. I traced the lines of his face with my fingers, ruddy bronze and lined with sun and care; the high forehead with its thick auburn brows, and the broad planes of his cheek, the long straight nose, straight as a blade. The closed eyes, slanted and mysterious with those odd lashes of his, blond at the root, so deep an auburn at the tips as to seem almost black.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d I said very softly, tracing the small, neat line of his ear. Tiny, stiff blond hairs sprouted in a tiny whorl from the tagus, tickling my finger. \u201cDon\u2019t any of you know? That it\u2019s you. Not what you can give, or do, or provide. Just you.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep, shuddering breath, and nodded, though he didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know. I said that to him, to Fergus,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cOr at least I think I did. I said a terrible lot of things.\u201d</p><p>They had knelt together by the spring, embracing, wet with blood and water, locked together as though he could hold Fergus to the earth, to his family, by force of will alone, and he had no notion at all what he had said, lost in the passion of the moment\u2014until the end.</p><p>\u201cYou must continue, for their sakes\u2014though you would not for your own,\u201d he had whispered, Fergus\u2019s face pressed into his shoulder, the black hair wet with sweat and water, cold against his cheek. \u201cTu comprends, mon enfant, mon fils? Comprends-tu?\u201d</p><p>I felt his throat move as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cSee, I kent ye were dying,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cI was sure ye\u2019d be gone when I came back to the house, and I should be alone. I wasna speaking to Fergus then, I think, so much as to myself.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head then, and looked at me through a blur of tears and laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Claire,\u201d he said, \u201cI would have been so angry, if ye\u2019d died and left me!\u201d</p><p>I wanted to laugh or cry, or both, myself\u2014and had I still harbored regrets regarding the loss of eternal peace, I would have surrendered them now without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and touched his lip. \u201cI won\u2019t. Or at least I\u2019ll try not.\u201d I slid my hand behind his head and drew him back to me. He was a good deal larger and heavier than Henri-Christian, but I felt I could hold him forever, if necessary.</p><p>It was early afternoon, and the light just beginning to shift, slanting in through the tops of the west-facing windows so that the room filled with a clean, bright light that glowed on Jamie\u2019s hair and the worn creamy linen of his shirt. I could feel the knobs at the top of his spine, and the yielding flesh in the narrow channel between shoulder blade and backbone.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you send them?\u201d I asked, and tried to smooth the whorled hair of the cowlick on his crown.</p><p>\u201cTo Cross Creek, maybe\u2014or to Wilmington,\u201d he replied. His eyes were half-closed, watching the shadows of leaves flicker on the side of the armoire he had built me. \u201cWherever seems best for the printing trade.\u201d</p><p>He shifted a little, tightening his grip on my buttocks, then frowned.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Sassenach, ye havena got any bum left at all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, never mind,\u201d I said with resignation. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will grow back soon enough.\u201d</p><p>65</p><p>MOMENT OF DECLARATION</p><p>JAMIE MET THEM near Woolam\u2019s Mill, five men on horseback. Two were strangers; two were men from Salisbury that he knew\u2014ex-Regulators named Green and Wherry; avid Whigs. The last was Richard Brown, whose face was cold, save for his eyes.</p><p>He silently cursed his love of conversation. If not for that, he would have parted from MacDonald as usual, at Coopersville. But they had been talking of poetry\u2014poetry, for God\u2019s sake!\u2014and amusing each other in declamation. Now here he stood in the empty road, holding two horses, while MacDonald, whose guts were in disagreement with him, busied himself deep in the wood.</p><p>Amos Green tipped him a nod, and would have passed, but Kitman Wherry reined up; the strangers did likewise, staring curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Thou bound, friend James?\u201d Wherry, a Quaker, asked pleasantly. \u201cDoes Thee come to the meeting at Halifax? For Thee are welcome to ride with us, and that be so.\u201d</p><p>Halifax. He felt a trickle of sweat run down the crease of his back. The meeting of the Committee of Correspondence to elect delegates to the Continental Congress.</p><p>\u201cI am seeing a friend upon his road,\u201d he replied courteously, with a nod toward MacDonald\u2019s horse. \u201cI will follow, though; perhaps I shall catch ye up along the way.\u201d Fat chance of that, he thought, carefully not looking at Brown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d not be so sure of your welcome, Mr. Fraser.\u201d Green spoke civilly enough, but with a certain coldness in his manner that made Wherry glance at him in surprise. \u201cNot after what happened in Cross Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And would ye see an innocent man burnt alive, or tarred and feathered?\u201d The last thing he wished was an argument, but something must be said.</p><p>One of the strangers spat in the road.</p><p>\u201cNot so innocent, if that\u2019s Fogarty Simms you\u2019re speakin\u2019 of. Little Tory pissant,\u201d he added as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fellow,\u201d Green said, and spat in agreement. \u201cThe committee in Cross Creek set out to teach him a lesson; seems Mr. Fraser here was in disagreement. Quite a scene it was, from what I hear,\u201d he drawled, leaning back a little in his saddle to survey Jamie from his superior height. \u201cLike I said, Mr. Fraser\u2014you ain\u2019t all that popular, right this minute.\u201d</p><p>Wherry was frowning, glancing to and fro between Jamie and Green. \u201cTo save a man from tar and feathers, no matter what his politics, seems no more than common humanity,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>Brown laughed unpleasantly.</p><p>\u201cMight seem so to you, I reckon. Not to other folk. You know a man by the company he keeps. And beyond that, there\u2019s your auntie, eh?\u201d he said, redirecting his speech to Jamie. \u201cAnd the famous Mrs. MacDonald. I read that speech she gave\u2014in the final edition of Simms\u2019s newspaper,\u201d he added, repeating the unpleasant laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt\u2019s guests have naught to do wi\u2019 me,\u201d Jamie said, striving for simple matter-of-factness.</p><p>\u201cNo? How \u2019bout your aunt\u2019s husband\u2014your uncle, would he be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d His incredulity plainly showed in his voice, for the strangers exchanged glances, and their manner relaxed a little. \u201cNo, he\u2019s my aunt\u2019s fourth husband\u2014and a friend. Why d\u2019ye speak of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Duncan Innes is cheek-by-jowl with Farquard Campbell, and a good many other Loyalists. The two of \u2019em have been putting money enough to float a ship into pamphlets preachin\u2019 reconciliation with Mother England. Surprised you didn\u2019t know that, Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was not merely surprised but thunderstruck at this revelation, but hid it.</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s opinions are his own,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cDuncan must do as he likes, and I shall do the same.\u201d</p><p>Wherry was nodding agreement with this, but the others were regarding him with expressions ranging from skepticism to hostility.</p><p>Wherry was not unaware of his companions\u2019 responses.</p><p>\u201cWhat is thy opinion, then, friend?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d known it was coming. Had now and then tried to imagine the circumstances of his declaration, in situations ranging from the vaingloriously heroic to the openly dangerous, but as usual in such matters, God\u2019s sense of humor trumped all imagination. And so he found himself taking that final step into irrevocable and public commitment to the rebel cause\u2014just incidentally being required to ally himself with a deadly enemy in the process\u2014standing alone in a dusty road, with a uniformed officer of the Crown squatting in the bushes directly behind him, breeches round his ankles.</p><p>\u201cI am for liberty,\u201d he said, in a tone indicating mild astonishment that there could be any question regarding his position.</p><p>\u201cAre you so?\u201d Green looked hard at him, then lifted his chin in the direction of MacDonald\u2019s horse, where MacDonald\u2019s regimental sword hung from the saddle, gilt and tassels gleaming in the sun. \u201cHow come you to be in company with a redcoat, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a friend,\u201d Jamie replied evenly.</p><p>\u201cA redcoat?\u201d One of the strangers reared back in his saddle as though stung by a bee. \u201cHow come redcoats here?\u201d The man sounded flabbergasted, and looked hastily to and fro, as though expecting a company of the creatures to burst from the wood, muskets firing.</p><p>\u201cOnly the one, so far as I know,\u201d Brown assured him. \u201cName\u2019s MacDonald. He\u2019s not a real soldier; retired on half-pay, works for the Governor.\u201d</p><p>His companion didn\u2019t seem noticeably reassured.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with this MacDonald?\u201d he demanded of Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAs I said\u2014he is a friend.\u201d The attitude of the men had changed in an instant, from skepticism and mild hostility to open offense.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Governor\u2019s spy, is what he is,\u201d Green declared flatly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was no more than the truth, and Jamie was reasonably sure that half the backcountry knew it; MacDonald made no effort to hide either his appearance nor his errands. To deny the fact was to ask them to believe Jamie a dunce, duplicitous, or both.</p><p>There was a stirring among the men now, glances exchanged, and the smallest of motions, hands touching knife hilts and pistol grips.</p><p>Very fine, Jamie thought. Not satisfied with the irony of the situation, God had now decided that he should fight to the death against the allies he had declared himself to moments earlier, in defense of an officer of the Crown he had just declared himself against.</p><p>As his son-in-law was fond of remarking\u2014great.</p> <p>\u201cBring him out,\u201d Brown ordered, nudging his horse to the forefront. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what he has to say for himself, this friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then might be we\u2019ll learn him a lesson he can carry back to the Governor, eh?\u201d One of the strangers took off his hat and tucked it carefully beneath the edge of his saddle, preparing.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Wherry drew himself up, trying to quell them with a hand, though Jamie could have told him he was several minutes past the point where such an attempt might have had any effect. \u201cYou cannot lay violent hands upon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we, though?\u201d Brown grinned like a death\u2019s head, eyes fixed on Jamie, and began to undo the leather quirt coiled and fastened to his saddle. \u201cNo tar to hand, alas. But a good beating, say, and send \u2019em both squealing home to the Governor stark nak*d\u2014that\u2019d answer.\u201d</p><p>The second stranger laughed, and spat again, so the gob landed juicily at Jamie\u2019s feet.</p> <p>\u201cAye, that\u2019ll do. Hear you held off a mob by yourself in Cross Creek, Fraser\u2014only five to two now, how you like them odds?\u201d</p><p>Jamie liked them fine. Dropping the reins he held, he turned and flung himself between the two horses, screeching and slapping hard at their flanks, then dived headlong into the brush at the roadside, scrabbling through roots and stones on hands and knees as fast as he could.</p><p>Behind him, the horses were rearing and wheeling, whinnying loudly and spreading confusion and fright through the other men\u2019s mounts; he could hear cries of anger and alarm, as they tried to gain control of the plunging horses.</p><p>He slid down a short slope, dirt and uprooted plants spraying up around his feet, lost his balance and fell at the bottom, bounded up and dashed into an oak copse, where he plastered himself behind a screen of saplings, breathing hard.</p><p>Someone had had wit\u2014or fury\u2014enough to jump off his horse and follow on foot; he could hear crashing and cursing near at hand, over the fainter cries of the commotion on the road. Glancing cautiously through the leaves, he saw Richard Brown, disheveled and hatless, looking wildly round, pistol in hand.</p><p>Any thought he might have had of confrontation vanished; he was unarmed, save a small knife in his stocking, and it was clear to him that Brown would shoot him instantly, claiming self-defense when the others eventually caught up.</p> <p>Up the slope, toward the road, he caught a glimpse of red. Brown, turning in the same direction, saw it, too, and fired. Whereupon Donald MacDonald, having thoughtfully hung up his coat in a tree, stepped out of cover behind Richard Brown in his shirtsleeves, and hit Brown over the head with a solid length of tree branch.</p><p>Brown fell on his knees, momentarily stunned, and Jamie slipped out of the copse, beckoning to MacDonald, who ran heavily to meet him. Together they made their way deeper into the forest, waiting by a stream until prolonged silence from the road indicated that it might be safe to go back for a look.</p><p>The men were gone. So was MacDonald\u2019s horse. Gideon, the whites of his eyes showing and ears laid flat, rolled back his upper lip and squealed fiercely at them, big yellow teeth bared and slobber flying. Brown and company had wisely thought twice about stealing a rabid horse, but had tied him up to a tree and managed to spoil his harness, which hung in bits around his neck. MacDonald\u2019s sword lay in the dust, torn from its scabbard, blade broken in two.</p><p>MacDonald picked up the pieces, viewed them for a moment, then, shaking his head, tucked them through his belt.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think Jones could mend it?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr better to go down to Salisbury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilmington or New Bern,\u201d Jamie said, wiping a hand across his mouth. \u201cDai Jones hasna the skill to mend a sword, but ye\u2019ll find few friends in Salisbury, from what I hear.\u201d Salisbury had been at the heart of the Regulation, and antigovernment sentiment still ran high there. His own heart had gone back to its usual way of beating, but he still felt weak-kneed in the aftermath of flight and anger.</p><p>MacDonald nodded bleakly, then glanced at Gideon.</p><p>\u201cIs yon thing safe to ride?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>In Gideon\u2019s present state of agitation, Jamie wouldn\u2019t risk riding him alone, let alone double-mounted and with no bridle. They\u2019d left the rope on his saddle, at least. He got a loop over the stallion\u2019s head without being bitten, and they set off without comment, returning to the Ridge on foot.</p><p>\u201cVerra unfortunate,\u201d MacDonald observed thoughtfully at one point. \u201cThat they should have met us together. D\u2019ye think it\u2019s dished your chances of worming your way into their councils? I should give my left ball to have an eye and an ear in that meeting they spoke of, I\u2019ll tell ye that for nothing!\u201d</p><p>With a dim sense of wonder, Jamie realized that having made his momentous declaration, overheard by the man whose cause he sought to betray, and then nearly killed by the new allies whose side he sought to uphold\u2014neither side had believed him.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ever wonder what it sounds like when God laughs, Donald?\u201d he asked thoughtfully.</p><p>MacDonald pursed his lips and glanced at the horizon, where dark clouds swelled just beyond the shoulder of the mountain.</p><p>\u201cLike thunder, I imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cD\u2019ye not think so?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s a verra small, wee sound indeed.\u201d</p><p>66</p><p>THE DARK RISES</p><p>I HEARD ALL THE SOUNDS OF the household below, and the rumble of Jamie\u2019s voice outside, and felt entirely peaceful. I was watching the sun shift and glow on the yellowing chestnut trees outside, when the sound of feet came marching up the stairs, steady and determined.</p><p>The door flung open and Brianna came in, wind-tousled and bright-faced, wearing a steely expression. She halted at the foot of my bed, leveled a long forefinger at me, and said, \u201cYou are not allowed to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said, blinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried!\u201d she said, accusing. \u201cYou know you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not to say tried, exactly . . .\u201d I began weakly. If I hadn\u2019t exactly tried to die, though, it was true that I hadn\u2019t quite tried not to, and I must have looked guilty, for her eyes narrowed into blue slits.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare do that again!\u201d she said, and wheeling in a sweep of blue cloak, stomped out, pausing at the door to say, \u201cBecauseIloveyouandIcan\u2019tdowithoutyou,\u201d in a strangled voice, before running down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darling!\u201d I called, the always-ready tears coming to my eyes, but there was no reply, save the sound of the front door closing.</p><p>Adso, drowsing in a puddle of sun on the counterpane at my feet, opened his eyes a fraction of an inch at the noise, then sank his head back into his shoulders, purring louder.</p><p>I lay back on the pillow, feeling a good deal less peaceful, but somewhat more alive. A moment later, I sat up, put back the quilts, and swung my legs out of bed. Adso abruptly quit purring. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to keel over; your supply of milk and scraps is perfectly safe. Keep the bed warm for me.\u201d</p><p>I had been up, of course, and even allowed on short, intensely supervised excursions outside. But no one had let me try to go anywhere alone since before I fell ill, and I was reasonably sure they wouldn\u2019t let me do it now.</p><p>I therefore stole downstairs in stockinged feet, shoes in hand, and instead of going through the front door, whose hinges squeaked, or through the kitchen, where Mrs. Bug was working, I slipped into my surgery, opened the window, and\u2014having checked to be sure the white sow was not hanging about below\u2014climbed carefully out.</p><p>I felt quite giddy at my escape, a rush of spirits that sustained me for a little way down the path. Thereafter, I was obliged to stop every few hundred feet, sit down, and gasp a bit while my legs recovered their strength. I persevered, though, and at last came to the Christie cabin.</p><p>No one was in sight, nor was there any response to my tentative \u201cHallo!\u201d, but when I knocked at the door, I heard Tom Christie\u2019s voice, gruff and dispirited, bid me enter.</p><p>He was at the table, writing, but from the looks of him, ought still to have been in bed. His eyes widened in surprise at sight of me, and he hastily tried to straighten the grubby shawl round his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! Are you\u2014that is\u2014what in the name of God . . .\u201d Deprived of speech, he pointed at me, eyes round as saucers. I had taken off my broad-brimmed hat when I entered, forgetting momentarily that I looked like nothing so much as an excited bottle brush.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, passing a self-conscious hand over my head. \u201cThat. You ought to be pleased; I\u2019m not going about outraging the public by a wanton display of my flowing locks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a convict,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>I did, being rather in need of the stool he offered me, owing to the exertions of the walk.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I inquired, peering at him. The light in the cabin was very bad; he had been writing with a candle, and had put it out upon my appearance.</p><p>\u201cHow am I?\u201d He seemed both astonished and rather put out at the inquiry. \u201cYou have walked all the way here, in a dangerously enfeebled condition, to ask after my health?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you care to put it that way,\u201d I replied, rather nettled by that \u201cdangerously enfeebled.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would care to step out into the light, so that I can get a decent look at you, would you?\u201d</p><p>He drew the ends of the shawl protectively across his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He frowned at me, peaked brows drawing together so that he looked like an irritable owl.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to know a few things regarding your state of health,\u201d I replied patiently, \u201cand examining you is likely the best way of finding them out, since you don\u2019t seem able to tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are most unaccountable, madam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am a doctor,\u201d I countered. \u201cAnd I want to know\u2014\u201d A brief wave of giddiness came over me, and I leaned on the table, holding on \u2019til it passed.</p><p>\u201cYou are insane,\u201d he stated, having scrutinized me for a moment. \u201cYou are also still ill, I believe. Stay there; I shall call my son to go and fetch your husband.\u201d</p><p>I flapped a hand at him and took a deep breath. My heart was racing, and I was a trifle pale and sweaty, but essentially all right.</p><p>\u201cThe fact of the matter, Mr. Christie, is that while I\u2019ve certainly been ill, I wasn\u2019t ill with the same sickness that\u2019s been afflicting people on the Ridge\u2014and from what Malva was able to tell me, I don\u2019t think you were, either.\u201d</p><p>He had risen to go and call Allan; at this, he froze, staring at me with his mouth open. Then he slowly lowered himself back into his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Having finally got his attention, I was pleased to lay out the facts before him; I had them neatly to hand, having given them considerable thought over the last few days.</p><p>While several families on the Ridge had suffered the depredations of amoebic dysentery, I hadn\u2019t. I had had a dangerously high fever, accompanied by dreadful headache and\u2014so far as I could tell from Malva\u2019s excited account\u2014convulsions. But it certainly wasn\u2019t dysentery.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain of this?\u201d He was twiddling his discarded quill, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather hard to mistake bloody flux for headache and fever,\u201d I said tartly. \u201cNow\u2014did you have flux?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment, but curiosity got the better of him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was as you say\u2014a headache fit to split the skull, and fever. A terrible weakness, and . . . and extraordinarily unpleasant dreams. I had no notion that it was not the same illness afflicting the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason you should, I suppose. You didn\u2019t see any of them. Unless\u2014did Malva describe the illness to you?\u201d I asked only from curiosity, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to hear of such things; she does not tell me. Still, why have you come?\u201d He tilted his head to one side, narrowing his eyes. \u201cWhat difference does it make whether you and I suffered an ague, rather than a flux? Or anyone else, for that matter?\u201d He seemed rather agitated, and got up, moving about the cabin in an unfocused, bumbling sort of way, quite unlike his usual decisive movements.</p><p>I sighed, rubbing a hand over my forehead. I\u2019d got the basic information I came for; explaining why I\u2019d wanted it was going to be uphill work. I had enough trouble getting Jamie, Young Ian, and Malva to accept the germ theory of disease, and that was with the evidence visible through a microscope to hand.</p><p>\u201cDisease is catching,\u201d I said a little tiredly. \u201cIt passes from one person to another\u2014sometimes directly, sometimes by means of food or water shared between a sick person and a healthy one. All of the people who had the flux lived near a particular small spring; I have some reason to think that it was the water of that spring that carried the amoeba\u2014that made them ill.</p><p>\u201cYou and I, though\u2014I haven\u2019t seen you in weeks. Nor have I been near anyone else who\u2019s had the ague. How is it that we should both fall ill of the same thing?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, baffled and still frowning.</p><p>\u201cI do not see why two persons cannot fall ill without seeing each other. Certainly I have known such illnesses as you describe: gaol fever, for instance, spreads in close quarters\u2014but surely not all illnesses behave in the same fashion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d I admitted. I wasn\u2019t in a fit state to try to get across the basic notions of epidemiology or public health, either. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, for instance, for some diseases to be spread by mosquitoes. Malaria, for one.\u201d Some forms of viral meningitis, for another\u2014my best guess as to the illness I\u2019d just recovered from.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall being bitten by a mosquito any time recently?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, then uttered a brief sort of bark I took for laughter.</p><p>\u201cMy dear woman, everyone in this festering climate is bitten repeatedly during the hot weather.\u201d He scratched at his beard, as though by reflex.</p><p>That was true. Everyone but me and Roger. Now and then, some desperate insect would have a go, but for the most part, we escaped unbitten, even when there were absolute plagues of the creatures and everyone around us was scratching. As a theory, I suspected that blood-drinking mosquitoes had evolved so closely with mankind through the years that Roger and I simply didn\u2019t smell right to them, having come from too far away in time. Brianna and Jemmy, who shared my genetic material but also Jamie\u2019s, were bitten, but not as frequently as most people.</p><p>I didn\u2019t recall having been bitten any time recently, but it was possible that I had been and had simply been too busy to notice.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d Christie asked, seeming now merely baffled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just\u2014need to find things out.\u201d I\u2019d also needed both to get away from the house and to make some move to reclaim my life by the most direct means I knew\u2014the practice of medicine. But that wasn\u2019t anything I meant to share with Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d he said. He stood looking down at me, frowning and undecided, then suddenly extended a hand\u2014the one I had operated on, I saw; the \u201cZ\u201d of the incision had faded to a healthy pale pink, and the fingers lay straight.</p><p>\u201cCome outside, then,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cI will see you home, and if ye insist upon asking intrusive and bothersome questions regarding my health along the way, I suppose I cannot stop you.\u201d</p><p>Startled, I took his hand, and found his grip solid and steady, despite the haggard look of his face and the slump of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t walk me home,\u201d I protested. \u201cYou ought to be in bed, by the looks of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should you,\u201d he said, leading me to the door with a hand beneath my elbow. \u201cBut if ye choose to risk your health and your life by undertaking such inappropriate exertion\u2014why, so can I. Though you must,\u201d he added sternly, \u201cput on your hat before we go.\u201d</p><p>WE MADE IT BACK to the house, stopping frequently for rest, and arrived panting, dripping with sweat, and generally exhilarated by the adventure. No one had missed me, but Mr. Christie insisted upon delivering me inside, which meant that everyone observed my absence ex post facto, and in the irrational way of people, at once became very annoyed.</p><p>I was scolded by everyone in sight, including Young Ian, frog-marched upstairs virtually by the scruff of the neck, and thrust forcibly back into bed, where, I was given to understand, I should be lucky to be given bread and milk for my supper. The most annoying aspect of the whole situation was Thomas Christie, standing at the foot of the stairs with a mug of beer in his hand, watching as I was led off, and wearing the only grin I had ever seen on his hairy face.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of God possessed ye, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie jerked back the quilt and gestured peremptorily at the sheets.</p><p>\u201cWell, I felt quite well, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell! Ye\u2019re the color of bad buttermilk, and trembling so ye can scarcely\u2014here, let me do that.\u201d Making snorting noises, he pushed my hands away from the laces of my petticoats, and had them off me in a trice.</p><p>\u201cHave ye lost your mind?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd to sneak off like that without telling anyone, too! What if ye\u2019d fallen? What if ye got ill again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d told anyone, they wouldn\u2019t have let me go out,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cAnd I am a physician, you know. Surely I can judge my own state of health.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, strongly suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t trust me to judge a flower show, but merely gave a louder than usual snort in reply.</p><p>He then picked me up bodily, carried me to the bed, and placed me gently into it\u2014but with enough demonstration of restrained strength as to let me know that he would have preferred to drop me from a height.</p><p>He then straightened up, giving me a baleful look.</p><p>\u201cIf ye didna look as though ye were about to faint, Sassenach, I swear I would turn ye over and smack your bum for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I said, rather faintly. \u201cI haven\u2019t got one.\u201d I was in fact a little tired . . . well, to be honest, my heart was beating like a kettledrum, my ears were ringing, and if I didn\u2019t lie down flat at once, I likely would faint. I did lie down, and lay with my eyes closed, feeling the room spin gently round me, like a merry-go-round, complete with flashing lights and hurdy-gurdy music.</p><p>Through this confusion of sensations, I dimly sensed hands on my legs, then a pleasant coolness on my heated body. Then something warm and cloudlike enveloped my head, and I flailed my hands about wildly, trying to get it off before I smothered.</p><p>I emerged, blinking and panting, to discover that I was nak*d. I glanced at my pallid, sagging, skeletal remains, and snatched the sheet up over myself. Jamie was bending to collect my discarded gown, petticoat, and jacket from the floor, adding these to the shift he had folded over his arm. He picked up my shoes and stockings and added these to his bag.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, pointing a long accusatory finger at me, \u201care going nowhere. You are not allowed to kill yourself, do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s where Bree gets it,\u201d I murmured, trying to stop my head from swimming. I closed my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall,\u201d I said, \u201ca certain abbey in France. And a very stubborn young man in ill health. And his friend Murtagh, who took his clothes in order to prevent his getting up and wandering off before he was fit.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I opened one eye. He was standing stock still, the fading light from the window striking sparks in his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhereupon,\u201d I said conversationally, \u201cif memory serves, you promptly climbed out a window and decamped. Naked. In the middle of winter.\u201d</p><p>The stiff fingers of his right hand tapped twice against his leg.</p><p>\u201cI was four-and-twenty,\u201d he said at last, sounding gruff. \u201cI wasna meant to have any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t argue with that for an instant,\u201d I assured him. I opened the other eye and fixed him with both. \u201cBut you do know why I did it. I had to.\u201d</p><p>He drew a very deep breath, sighed, and set down my clothes. He came and sat down on the bed beside me, making the wooden frame creak and groan beneath his weight.</p><p>He picked up my hand, and held it as though it were something precious and fragile. It was, too\u2014or at least it looked fragile, a delicate construct of transparent skin and the shadow of the bones within it. He ran his thumb gently down the back of my hand, tracing the bones from phalange to ulna, and I felt an odd, small tingle of distant memory; the vision of my own bones, glowing blue through the skin, and Master Raymond\u2019s hands, cupping my inflamed and empty womb, saying to me through the mists of fever, \u201cCall him. Call the red man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said very softly. Sunlight flashed on the metal of my silver wedding ring. He took hold of it between thumb and forefinger, and slid the little metal circlet gently up and down my finger, so loose that it didn\u2019t even catch on the bony knuckle.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe won\u2019t.\u201d He folded my fingers closed, his own hand closing large and warm around mine.</p><p>He sat silent for a time, and we watched the bar of sun creep slowly across the counterpane. Adso had moved with it, to stay in its warmth, and the light tipped his fur with a soft silver glow, the fine hairs that edged his ears tiny and distinct.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great comfort,\u201d he said at last, \u201cto see the sun come up and go down. When I dwelt in the cave, when I was in prison, it gave me hope, to see the light come and go, and know that the world went about its business.\u201d</p><p>He was looking out the window, toward the blue distance where the sky darkened toward infinity. His throat moved a little as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIt gives me the same feeling, Sassenach,\u201d he said, \u201cto hear ye rustling about in your surgery, rattling things and swearin\u2019 to yourself.\u201d He turned his head, then, to look at me, and his eyes held the depths of the coming night.</p><p>\u201cIf ye were no longer there\u2014or somewhere\u2014\u201d he said very softly, \u201cthen the sun would no longer come up or go down.\u201d He lifted my hand and kissed it, very gently. He laid it, closed around my ring, upon my chest, rose, and left.</p><p>I SLEPT LIGHTLY NOW, no longer flung into the agitated world of fever dreams, nor sucked down into the deep well of oblivion as my body sought the healing of sleep. I didn\u2019t know what had wakened me, but I was awake, quite suddenly, alert and fresh-eyed, with no interval of drowsiness.</p><p>The shutters were closed, but the moon was full; soft light striped the bed. I ran a hand over the sheet beside me, lifted my hand far above my head. My arm was a slender pale stem, bloodless and fragile as a toadstool\u2019s stalk; my fingers flexed gently and spread, a web, a net to catch the dark.</p><p>I could hear Jamie breathing, in his accustomed spot on the floor beside the bed.</p><p>I brought my arm down, stroked my body lightly with both hands, assessing. A tiny swell of breast, ribs I could count, one, two, three, four, five, and the smooth concavity of my stomach, slung like a hammock between the uprights of my hipbones. Skin, and bones. Not much else.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d There was a stirring in the dark beside the bed, and Jamie\u2019s head rose up, a presence more sensed than seen, so dark was the shadow there by contrast with the moonlight.</p><p>A large dark hand groped across the quilt, touched my hip.</p><p>\u201cAre ye well, a nighean?\u201d he whispered. \u201cD\u2019ye need anything?\u201d</p><p>He was tired; his head lay on the bed beside me, his breath warm through my shift. If he hadn\u2019t been warm, his touch, his breath, perhaps I wouldn\u2019t have had the courage, but I felt cold and bodiless as the moonlight itself, and so I closed my spectral hand on his and whispered, \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>He was quite still for a moment, slowly making sense of what I\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not trouble your sleep?\u201d he said, sounding doubtful. I pulled on his wrist in answer, and he came, rising up from the pool of dark on the floor, the thin lines of moonlight rippling over him like water.</p><p>\u201cKelpie,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He snorted briefly in answer, and awkwardly, gingerly, eased himself beneath the quilt, the mattress giving under his weight.</p><p>We lay very shyly together, barely touching. He was breathing shallowly, clearly trying to make as little obtrusion of his presence as possible. Aside from a faint rustling of sheets, the house was silent.</p><p>Finally, I felt one large finger nudge gently against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI missed ye, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I rolled onto my side facing him, and kissed his arm in answer. I wanted to move closer, lay my head in the curve of his shoulder, and lie in the circle of his arm\u2014but the idea of my short, bristly hair against his skin kept me from it.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d I said, into the dark solidness of his arm.</p><p>\u201cWill I take ye, then?\u201d he said softly. \u201cD\u2019ye want it, truly?\u201d One hand caressed my arm; the other went downward, starting the slow, steady rhythm to ready himself.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d I whispered, stilling his hand with my own. \u201cLie still.\u201d</p><p>I made love to him at first like a sneak thief, hasty strokes and tiny kisses, stealing scent and touch and warmth and salty taste. Then he put a hand on the back of my neck, pressing me closer, deeper.</p><p>\u201cDinna hurry yourself, lass,\u201d he said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cI\u2019m no going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I let a quiver of silent amusement pass through me and he drew in a deep, deep breath as I closed my teeth very gently round him and slid my hand up under the warm, musky weight of his balls.</p><p>Then I rose up over him, light-headed at the sudden movement, needing urgently. We both sighed deeply as it happened, and I felt the breath of his laughter on my br**sts as I bent over him.</p><p>\u201cI missed ye, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>I was shy of his touching me, changed as I was, and leaned with my hands on his shoulders, keeping him from pulling me down to him. He didn\u2019t try, but slid his hand curled between us.</p><p>I felt a brief pang at the thought that the hair on my privates was longer than that on my head\u2014but the thought was driven out by the slow pressure of the big knuckle pressing deep between my legs, rocking gently back and forth.</p><p>I seized his other hand and brought it to my mouth, sucked his fingers hard, one by one, and shuddered, gripping his hand with all my strength.</p><p>I was still gripping it sometime later, as I lay beside him. Or rather, holding it, admiring the unseen shapes of it, complex and graceful in the dark, and the hard, smooth layer of callus on palms and knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve the hands of a bricklayer,\u201d he said, laughing a little as I passed my lips lightly over the roughened knuckles and the still-sensitive tips of his long fingers.</p><p>\u201cCalluses on a man\u2019s hands are deeply erotic,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cAre they, so?\u201d His free hand passed lightly over my shorn head and down the length of my back. I shivered and pressed closer to him, self-consciousness beginning to be forgotten. My own free hand roamed down the length of his body, toying with the soft, wiry bush of his hair, and the damply tender, half-hard cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He arched his back a little, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I havena got calluses there, it\u2019s no fault of yours, believe me.\u201d</p><p>67</p><p>THE LAST LAUGH</p> <p>IT WAS AN OLD MUSKET, made perhaps twenty years before, but well-kept. The stock was polished with wear, the wood beautiful to the touch, and the metal of the barrel mellow and clean.</p><p>Standing Bear clutched it in ecstasy, running awed fingers up and down the gleaming barrel, bringing them to his nose to sniff the intoxicating perfume of oil and powder, then beckoning his friends to come and smell it, too.</p><p>Five gentlemen had received muskets from the beneficent hand of Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, and a sense of delight ran through the house, spreading in ripples through the village. Bird himself, with twenty-five muskets still to give, was drunk with the sense of inestimable wealth and power, and thus in a mood to welcome anyone and anything.</p><p>\u201cThis is Hiram Crombie,\u201d Jamie said to Bird, in Tsalagi, indicating Mr. Crombie, who had stood by him, white-faced with nerves, throughout the preliminary talk, the presentation of the muskets, the summoning of the braves, and the general rejoicing over the guns. \u201cHe has come to offer his friendship, and to tell you stories of the Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your Christ? The one who went to the lower world and came back? I always wondered, did he meet Sky-woman there, or Mole? I am fond of Mole; I would like to know what he said.\u201d Bird touched the stone pendant at his neck, a small red carving of Mole, the guide to the underworld.</p> <p>Mr. Crombie\u2019s brow was furrowed, but luckily he had not yet developed any sense of ease in Tsalagi; he was still in the stage of mentally translating each word into English, and Bird was a rapid speaker. And Ian had found no occasion to teach Hiram the word for Mole.</p><p>Jamie coughed.</p><p>\u201cI am sure he will be happy to tell you all the stories he knows,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Crombie,\u201d he said, switching momentarily to English, \u201cTsisqua offers you welcome.\u201d</p><p>Bird\u2019s wife Penstemon\u2019s nostrils flared delicately; Crombie was sweating with nervousness, and smelled like a goat. He bowed earnestly, and presented Bird with the good knife he had brought as a present, slowly reciting the complimentary speech he had committed to memory. Reasonably well, too, Jamie thought; he\u2019d mispronounced only a couple of words.</p><p>\u201cI come to b-bring you great joy,\u201d he finished, stammering and sweating.</p><p>Bird looked at Crombie\u2014small, stringy, and dripping wet\u2014for a long, inscrutable moment, then back at Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a funny man, Bear-Killer,\u201d he said with resignation. \u201cLet us eat!\u201d</p><p>It was autumn; the harvest was in and the hunting was good. And so the Feast of the Guns was a notable occasion, with wapiti and venison and wild pig raised steaming from pits and roasted over roaring fires, with overflowing platters of maize and roasted squash and dishes of beans spiced with onion and coriander, dishes of pottage, and dozen upon dozen of small fish rolled in cornmeal, fried in bear grease, their flesh crisp and sweet.</p><p>Mr. Crombie, very stiff to begin with, began to unbend under the influence of food, spruce beer, and the flattering attention paid him. A certain amount of the attention, Jamie thought, was due to the fact that Ian, a wide grin on his face, stayed by his pupil for a time, prompting and correcting, \u2019til Hiram should feel more at ease in the tongue, and able to manage on his own. Ian was extremely popular, particularly with the young women of the village.</p><p>For himself, he enjoyed the feasting very much; relieved of responsibility, there was nothing to do save to talk and listen and eat\u2014and in the morning he would go.</p><p>It was an odd feeling, and one he was not sure he had ever had before. He had had many leavetakings, most regretful\u2014a few taken with a sense of relief\u2014some that wrenched the heart from his chest and left him aching. Not tonight. Everything seemed strangely ceremonious, something consciously done for the last time, and yet there was no sadness in it.</p><p>Completion, he supposed, was the sense of it. He had done what he could do, and now must leave Bird and the others to make their own way. He might come again, but never again by duty, in his role as the agent of the King.</p><p>That was a peculiar thought in itself. He had never lived without the consciousness of allegiance\u2014whether willing or not, witting or not\u2014to a king, whether that be German Geordie\u2019s house or the Stuarts. And now he did.</p><p>For the first time, he had some glimmer of what his daughter and his wife had tried to tell him.</p> <p>Hiram was trying to recite one of the psalms, he realized. He was doing a good job of it, because he had asked Ian to translate it, and had then carefully committed it to memory. However . . .</p><p>\u201cOil runs down over the head and the beard . . .\u201d</p><p>Penstemon cast a wary glance at the small pot of melted bear grease that they were using as a condiment, and narrowed her eyes at Hiram, plainly intending to snatch the dish from him if he tried to pour it over his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a story of his ancestors,\u201d Jamie said to her, with a brief shrug. \u201cNot his own custom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Hm.\u201d She relaxed a little, though continuing to keep a close eye on Hiram. He was a guest, but not all guests could be trusted to behave well.</p><p>Hiram did nothing untoward, though, and with many protests of sufficiency, and awkward compliments toward his hosts, was persuaded to eat until his eyes bulged, which pleased them.</p><p>Ian would stay for a few days, to be sure that Hiram and Bird\u2019s people were in some sort of mutual accord. Jamie was not quite sure that Ian\u2019s sense of responsibility would overcome his sense of humor, though\u2014in some ways, Ian\u2019s sense of humor tended toward the Indians\u2019. A word from Jamie might therefore not come amiss, just by way of precaution.</p><p>\u201cHe has a wife,\u201d Jamie said to Bird, with a nod toward Hiram, now engaged in close discourse with two of the older men. \u201cI think he would not welcome a young woman in his bed. He might be rude to her, not understanding the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Penstemon, overhearing this. She glanced at Hiram, and her lip curled with scorn. \u201cNobody would want a child from him. Now, a child from you, Bear-Killer . . .\u201d She gave him a long look beneath her lashes, and he laughed, saluting her with a gesture of respect.</p><p>It was a perfect night, cold and crisp, and the door was left open that the air might come in. The smoke from the fire rose straight and white, streaming toward the hole above, its moving wraiths like spirits ascending in joy.</p><p>Everyone had eaten and drunk to the point of a pleasant stupor, and there was momentary silence and a pervading sense of peace and happiness.</p><p>\u201cIt is good for men to eat as brothers,\u201d Hiram observed to Standing Bear, in his halting Tsalagi. Or rather, tried to. And after all, Jamie reflected, feeling his ribs creak under the strain, it was really a very minor difference between \u201cas brothers\u201d and \u201ctheir brothers.\u201d</p><p>Standing Bear gave Hiram a thoughtful look, and edged slightly farther away from him.</p><p>Bird observed this, and after a moment\u2019s silence, turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very funny man, Bear-Killer,\u201d he repeated, shaking his head. \u201cYou win.\u201d</p><p>To Mr. John Stuart,</p><p>Superintendent of the Southern</p><p>Department of Indian Affairs</p><p>From Fraser\u2019s Ridge,</p><p>on the First Day of November,</p><p>Anno Domini 1774,</p><p>James Fraser, Esq.</p><p>My dear sir,</p><p>This is to notify you of my Resignation as Indian Agent, as I find that my personal Convictions will no longer allow me to perform my Office on behalf of the Crown in good Conscience.</p><p>In thanks for your kind Attention and many Favors, and wishing you well in future, I remain</p><p>Your most humble Servant,</p><p>J. Fraser</p><p>PART NINE</p><p>The Bones of Time</p><p>68</p><p>SAVAGES</p><p>ONLY TWO LEFT. The pool of liquid wax glowed with the light of the flaming wick above it, and the jewels slowly came into view, one green, one black, glowing with their own inner fire. Jamie dipped the feather end of a quill gently into the melted wax and scooped the emerald up, raising it into the light.</p><p>He dropped the hot stone into the handkerchief I held waiting, and I rubbed it quickly, to get off the wax before it should harden.</p><p>\u201cOur reserves are getting rather low,\u201d I said, in uneasy jest. \u201cLet\u2019s hope there aren\u2019t any more expensive emergencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shallna touch the black diamond, regardless,\u201d he said definitely, and blew out the wick. \u201cThat one is for you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged a little, and reached to take the emerald in its handkerchief from me.</p><p>\u201cIf I should be killed,\u201d he said very matter-of-factly. \u201cYe\u2019ll take it and go. Back through the stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? I don\u2019t know that I would,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t like talking about any contingency that involved Jamie\u2019s death, but there was no point in ignoring the possibilities. Battle, disease, imprisonment, accident, assassination . . .</p><p>\u201cYou and Bree were going about forbidding me to die,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d do the same thing, if I had the faintest hope of your paying the least attention.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that.</p><p>\u201cI always mind your words, Sassenach,\u201d he assured me gravely. \u201cBut ye do tell me that man proposes and God disposes, and should He see fit to dispose of me\u2014ye\u2019ll go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d I said, nettled\u2014and unsettled. The memories of his sending me back through the stones on the eve of Culloden were not ones I ever wished to recall, and here he was, prying open the door to that tightly sealed chamber of my mind. \u201cI\u2019d stay with Bree and Roger, wouldn\u2019t I? Jem, Marsali and Fergus, Germain and Henri-Christian and the girls\u2014everyone\u2019s here. What is there to go back to, after all?\u201d</p><p>He took the stone from its cloth, turning it over between his fingers, and looked thoughtfully at me, as though making up his mind whether to tell me something. Small hairs began to prickle on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he said at last, shaking his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen ye there.\u201d</p><p>The prickling ran straight down the back of my neck and down both arms.</p><p>\u201cSeen me where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He waved a hand in a vague gesture. \u201cI dreamt of ye there. I dinna ken where it was; I only know it was there\u2014in your proper time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I demanded, my flesh creeping briskly. \u201cWhat was I doing?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed in the effort of recollection.</p><p>\u201cI dinna recall, exactly,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut I knew it was then, by the light.\u201d His brow cleared suddenly. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Ye were sitting at a desk, with something in your hand, maybe writing. And there was light all round ye, shining on your face, on your hair. But it wasna candlelight, nor yet firelight or sunlight. And I recall thinking to myself as I saw ye, Oh, so that\u2019s what electric light is like.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, open-mouthed.</p><p>\u201cHow can you recognize something in a dream that you\u2019ve never seen in real life?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to find that funny.</p><p>\u201cI dream of things I\u2019ve not seen all the time, Sassenach\u2014don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cYes. Sometimes. Monsters, odd plants, I suppose. Peculiar landscapes. And certainly people that I don\u2019t know. But surely that\u2019s different? To see something you know about, but haven\u2019t seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what I saw may not be what electric light does look like,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut that\u2019s what I said to myself when I saw it. And I was quite sure that ye were in your own time.</p><p>\u201cAnd after all,\u201d he added logically, \u201cI dream of the past; why would I not dream of the future?\u201d</p><p>There was no good answer to a thoroughly Celtic remark of that nature.</p><p>\u201cWell, you would, I suppose,\u201d I said. I rubbed dubiously at my lower lip. \u201cHow old was I, in this dream of yours?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised, then uncertain, and peered closely at my face, as though trying to compare it with some mental vision.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I dinna ken,\u201d he said, sounding for the first time unsure. \u201cI didna think anything about it\u2014I didna notice that ye had white hair, or anything of the sort\u2014it was just . . . you.\u201d He shrugged, baffled, then looked down at the stone in my hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel warm to your touch, Sassenach?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course it does,\u201d I said, rather crossly. \u201cIt\u2019s just come out of hot wax, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d And yet the emerald did seem to pulse gently in my hand, warm as my own blood and beating like a miniature heart. And when I handed it to him, I felt a small, peculiar reluctance\u2014as though it did not want to leave me.</p><p>\u201cGive it to MacDonald,\u201d I said, rubbing my palm against the side of my skirt. \u201cI hear him outside, talking to Arch; he\u2019ll be wanting to be off.\u201d</p><p>MACDONALD HAD COME pelting up to the Ridge in the midst of a rainstorm the day before, weathered face nearly purple with cold, exertion, and excitement, to inform us that he had found a printing establishment for sale in New Bern.</p><p>\u201cThe owner has already left\u2014somewhat involuntarily,\u201d he told us, dripping and steaming by the fire. \u201cHis friends seek to sell the premises and equipment promptly, before they might be seized or destroyed, and thus provide him with funds to reestablish himself in England.\u201d</p><p>By \u201csomewhat involuntarily,\u201d it turned out, he meant that the print shop\u2019s owner was a Loyalist, who had been kidnapped off the street by the local Committee of Safety and shoved willy-nilly onto a ship departing for England. This form of impromptu deportation was becoming popular, and while it was more humane than tar and feathers, it did mean that the printer would arrive penniless in England, and owing money for his passage, to boot.</p><p>\u201cI happened to meet wi\u2019 some of his friends in a tavern, tearin\u2019 their hair over his sad fate and drinking to his welfare\u2014whereupon I told them that I might be able to put them in the way of an advantage,\u201d the Major said, swelling with satisfaction. \u201cThey were all ears, when I said that ye might\u2014just might, mind\u2014have ready cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes ye think I do, Donald?\u201d Jamie asked, one eyebrow cocked.</p><p>MacDonald looked surprised, then knowing. He winked and laid a finger beside his nose.</p><p>\u201cI hear the odd bit, here and there. Word has it that ye\u2019ve got a wee cache of gems\u2014or so I hear, from a merchant in Edenton whose bank dealt wi\u2019 one.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d I said, and he nodded in resignation.</p><p>\u201cWell, as for me, mum\u2019s the word,\u201d MacDonald said, observing this. \u201cYe can rely upon my discretion, to be sure. And I doubt the matter\u2019s widely known. But then\u2014a poor man doesna go about buying muskets by the dozen, now, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he might,\u201d Jamie said, resigned. \u201cYe\u2019d be surprised, Donald. But as it is . . . I imagine a bargain might be struck. What are the printer\u2019s friends asking\u2014and will they offer insurance, in case of fire?\u201d</p><p>MACDONALD HAD BEEN empowered to negotiate on behalf of the printer\u2019s friends\u2014they being anxious to get the problematical real estate sold before some patriotic soul came and burned it down\u2014and so the bargain was concluded on the spot. MacDonald was sent hurtling back down the mountain to change the emerald into money, conclude payment on the printer\u2019s shop, leaving the residue of the money with Fergus for ongoing expenses\u2014and let it be known as quickly as possible in New Bern that the premises were shortly to be under new management.</p><p>\u201cAnd if anyone asks about the politics of the new owner . . .\u201d Jamie said. To which MacDonald merely nodded wisely, and laid his finger alongside his red-veined nose once more.</p><p>I was reasonably sure that Fergus had no personal politics to speak of; beyond his family, his sole allegiance was to Jamie. Once the bargain was made, though, and the frenzy of packing begun\u2014Marsali and Fergus would have to leave at once, to have any chance of making it to New Bern before winter set in in earnest\u2014Jamie had had a serious talk with Fergus.</p><p>\u201cNow, it\u2019ll no be like it was in Edinburgh. There\u2019s no but one other printer in the town, and from what MacDonald says, he\u2019s an elderly gentleman, and sae much afraid o\u2019 the committee and the Governor both, he willna print a thing but books of sermons and handbills advertising horseraces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTr\u00e8s bon,\u201d said Fergus, looking even happier, if such a thing was possible. He\u2019d been going about lit up like a Chinese lantern since hearing the news. \u201cWe will have all of the newspaper and broadsheet business, to say nothing of the printing of scandalous plays and pamphlets\u2014there is nothing like sedition and unrest for the printing business, milord, you know that yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that,\u201d Jamie said very dryly. \u201cWhich is why I mean to beat the need for care into your thick skull. I dinna wish to hear that ye\u2019ve been hanged for treason, nor yet tarred-and-feathered for no being treasonous enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, la.\u201d Fergus waved an airy hook. \u201cI know well enough how this game is played, milord.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, still looking dubious.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do. But it\u2019s been some years; ye may be out of practice. And ye\u2019ll not know who\u2019s who in New Bern; ye dinna want to find yourself buying meat from the man ye\u2019ve savaged in the morning\u2019s paper, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mind that, Da.\u201d Marsali sat by the fire, nursing Henri-Christian, and taking close heed. If anything, she looked happier than Fergus, upon whom she looked adoringly. She switched the look of adoration to Jamie, and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s frown softened as he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss ye, lass,\u201d he said softly. Her look of happiness dimmed, but didn\u2019t go out entirely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss ye, too, Da. All of us will. And Germain doesna want to leave Jem, o\u2019 course. But . . .\u201d Her eyes drifted back to Fergus, who was making a list of supplies, whistling \u201cAlouette\u201d under his breath, and she hugged Henri-Christian closer, making him kick his legs in protest.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know.\u201d Jamie coughed, to cover his emotion, and wiped a knuckle underneath his nose. \u201cNow then, wee Fergus. Ye\u2019ll have a bit of money over; be sure to bribe the constable and the watch first of all. MacDonald\u2019s given me the names o\u2019 the Royal Council, and the chief Assemblymen\u2014he\u2019ll be of help wi\u2019 the council, as he\u2019s the Governor\u2019s man. Be tactful, aye? But see he\u2019s taken care of; he\u2019s been a great help in the matter.\u201d</p><p>Fergus nodded, head bent over his paper.</p><p>\u201cPaper, ink, lead, bribes, shammy leather, brushes,\u201d he said, writing busily, and resumed absently singing, \u201cAlouette, gentil alouette . . .\u201d</p><p>IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO get a wagon up to the Ridge; the only approach was by the narrow trail that wound up the slope from Coopersville\u2014one of the factors that had led to the development of that minor crossroads into a small hamlet, as itinerant peddlers and other travelers tended to stop there, making brief forays on foot upward into the mountain.</p><p>\u201cWhich is all very well for discouraging hostile invasion onto the Ridge,\u201d I told Bree, panting as I set down a large canvas-wrapped bundle of candlesticks, chamber pots, and other small household belongings at the side of the trail. \u201cBut it unfortunately makes it rather difficult to get off the bloody Ridge, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it never occurred to Da that anyone would want to leave,\u201d Bree said, grunting as she lowered her own burden\u2014Marsali\u2019s cauldron, packed with cheeses, sacks of flour, beans, and rice, plus a wooden box full of dried fish and a string bag of apples. \u201cThis thing weighs a ton.\u201d</p><p>She turned and bellowed, \u201cGERMAIN!\u201d up the trail behind us. Dead silence. Germain and Jemmy were meant to be shepherding Mirabel the goat down to the wagon. They had left the cabin with us, but had been dropping steadily behind.</p><p>Neither a call nor a mehhhh came from the trail, but Mrs. Bug came into view, trundling slowly under the weight of Marsali\u2019s spinning wheel, which she bore on her back, and holding Mirabel\u2019s halter in one hand. Mirabel, a small, neat white goat with gray markings, blatted happily at sight of us.</p><p>\u201cI found the puir wee lassie tethered to a bush,\u201d Mrs. Bug said, setting down the spinning wheel with a wheeze and wiping her face with her apron. \u201cNo sign o\u2019 the lads, the wicked wee creatures.\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a low growling noise that boded ill for either Jemmy or Germain, if she caught them. Before she could stomp back up the trail, though, Roger and Young Ian came down, each carrying one end of Marsali\u2019s loom, collapsed for the occasion into a large bundle of heavy timbers. Seeing the traffic jam in the road, though, they stopped, setting down their burden with sighs of relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s amiss, then?\u201d Roger asked, glancing from face to face, and settling on the goat with a frown. \u201cWhere are Jem and Germain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollars to donuts the little fiends are hiding somewhere,\u201d Bree said, smoothing tumbled red hair out of her face. Her plait had come undone, and straggling wisps of hair were sticking damply to her face. I was momentarily grateful for my short thicket of curls; no matter what it looked like, it was certainly convenient.</p><p>\u201cShall I go and look?\u201d Ian asked, emerging from the wooden pudding basin he\u2019d been carrying upside down on his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll no have gone far.\u201d</p><p>Sounds of hasty feet from below made everyone turn expectantly in that direction\u2014but it was not the boys, but Marsali, breathless and wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cHenri-Christian,\u201d she gasped, her eyes flicking rapidly round the group. \u201cHave ye got him, Mother Claire? Bree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had him,\u201d Bree said, catching Marsali\u2019s sense of urgency.</p><p>\u201cI did. Wee Aidan McCallum was minding him for me, whilst I loaded things into the wagon. But then I stopped to feed him\u201d\u2014a hand went briefly to her bosom\u2014\u201cand they were both vanished! I thought perhaps . . .\u201d Her words died away as she began scanning the bushes along the trail, her cheeks flushed with exertion and annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll strangle him,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Germain, then?\u201d she cried, catching sight of Mirabel, who had taken advantage of the stop to nibble tasty thistles by the path.</p><p>\u201cThis is beginning to have the look of a plan about it,\u201d Roger observed, obviously amused. Ian, too, seemed to be finding something funny in the situation, but vicious glares from the frazzled females present wiped the smirks off their faces.</p><p>\u201cYes, do go and find them, please,\u201d I said, seeing that Marsali was about to either burst into tears or go berserk and throw things.</p><p>\u201cAye, do,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cAnd beat them, while ye\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYE KEN WHERE THEY ARE?\u201d Ian asked, shading his eyes to look up a trough of tumbled rock.</p><p>\u201cAye, likely. This way.\u201d Roger pushed through a tangle of yaupon and redbud, with Ian after him, and emerged onto the bank of the small creek that paralleled the trail here. Below, he caught a glimpse of Aidan\u2019s favorite fishing place near the ford, but there was no sign of life down there.</p><p>Instead, he turned upward, making his way through thick dry grass and loose rocks along the creekbank. Most of the leaves had fallen from the chestnuts and poplars, and lay in slippery mats of brown and gold underfoot.</p><p>Aidan had shown him the secret place some time ago; a shallow cave, barely three feet high, hidden at the top of a steep slope overgrown by a thicket of oak saplings. The oaks were bare now, and the cave\u2019s opening easily visible, if you knew to look for it. It was particularly noticeable at the moment, because smoke was coming out of it, slipping veil-like up the face of the rock above, leaving a sharp scent in the cold, dry air.</p><p>Ian raised one eyebrow. Roger nodded, and made his way up the slope, making no effort to be quiet about it. There was a mad scuffle of noises inside the cave, thumpings and low cries, and the veil of smoke wavered and stopped, replaced by a loud hiss and a puff of dark gray from the cave mouth as someone threw water on the fire.</p><p>Ian, meanwhile, had made his way silently up the side of the rockface above the cave, seeing a small crevice from which a tiny plume of smoke issued. Clinging one-handed to a dogwood that grew out of the rock, he leaned perilously out, and cupping a hand near his mouth, let out a frightful Mohawk scream, directed into the crevice.</p><p>Terror-stricken shrieks, much higher-pitched, issued from the cave, followed in short order by a tumble of little boys, pushing and tripping over each other in their haste.</p><p>\u201cHo, there!\u201d Roger snagged his own offspring neatly by the collar as he rushed past. \u201cThe jig\u2019s up, mate.\u201d</p><p>Germain, with Henri-Christian\u2019s sturdy form clutched to his midsection, was attempting to escape down the slope, but Ian leapt past him, springing pantherlike down the rocks, and grabbed the baby from him, bringing him to a reluctant stop.</p><p>Only Aidan remained at large. Seeing his comrades in captivity, he hesitated at the edge of the slope, obviously wanting to flee, but nobly gave in, coming back with dragging step to share their fate.</p><p>\u201cRight, lads; sorry, it\u2019s not on.\u201d Roger spoke with some sympathy; Jemmy had been upset for days at the prospect of Germain\u2019s leaving.</p><p>\u201cBut we do not want to go, Uncle Roger,\u201d Germain said, employing his most effective look of wide-eyed pleading. \u201cWe will stay here; we can live in the cave, and hunt for our food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir, and me and Jem, we\u2019ll share our dinners wi\u2019 them,\u201d Aidan piped up in anxious support.</p><p>\u201cI brought some of Mama\u2019s matches, so they\u2019ve got a fire to keep warm,\u201d Jem chipped in eagerly, \u201cand a loaf of bread, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ye see, Uncle\u2014\u201d Germain spread his hands gracefully in demonstration, \u201cwe shall be no trouble to anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nay trouble, is it?\u201d Ian said, with no less sympathy. \u201cTell your mother that, aye?\u201d</p><p>Germain put his hands behind him, clutching his buttocks protectively by reflex.</p><p>\u201cAnd what were ye thinking, dragging your wee brother up here?\u201d Roger said a little more severely. \u201cHe can barely walk yet! Two steps out of there\u201d\u2014he nodded at the cave\u2014\u201cand he\u2019d be tumbling down the burn and his neck broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir!\u201d Germain said, shocked. He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a piece of string. \u201cI should tie him up, when I was not there, so he shouldna wander or fall. But I couldna be leaving him; I promised Maman, when he was born, I said I would never leave him.\u201d</p><p>Tears were beginning to trickle down Aidan\u2019s thin cheeks. Henri-Christian, totally confused, began to howl in sympathy, which made Jem\u2019s lower lip tremble, as well. He wriggled out of Roger\u2019s grasp, ran to Germain, and clutched him passionately about the middle.</p><p>\u201cGermain can\u2019t go, Daddy, please don\u2019t make him go!\u201d</p><p>Roger rubbed his nose, exchanged brief looks with Ian, and sighed.</p><p>He sat down on a rock, and motioned to Ian, who was having a certain amount of difficulty in deciding which way up to hold Henri-Christian. Ian gave him the baby with a noticeable air of relief, and Henri-Christian, feeling the need of security, seized Roger\u2019s nose with one hand and his hair with the other.</p><p>\u201cLook, a bhailach,\u201d he said, detaching Henri-Christian\u2019s grasp with some difficulty. \u201cWee Henri-Christian needs his mother to feed him. He\u2019s barely got teeth, for God\u2019s sake\u2014he canna be living up here in the wild, eating raw meat wi\u2019 you savages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has too got teeth!\u201d Aidan said stoutly, extending a bitten forefinger in proof. \u201cLook!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe eats pap,\u201d Germain said, but with some uncertainty to his tone. \u201cWe would mash up biscuits for him with milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri-Christian needs his mother,\u201d Roger repeated firmly, \u201cand your mother needs you. Ye dinna expect her to manage a wagon and two mules and your sisters, all the way to New Bern alone, do ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Papa can help,\u201d Germain protested. \u201cThe girls mind him, when they mind no one else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour papa\u2019s gone already,\u201d Ian informed him. \u201cHe\u2019s ridden ahead, to find a place for ye all to live, once ye\u2019ve got there. Your mother\u2019s to follow on, wi\u2019 all your things. Roger Mac\u2019s right, a bhailach\u2014your mother needs ye.\u201d</p> <p>Germain\u2019s small face paled a little. He looked helplessly down at Jemmy, still clinging to him, then up the hill at Aidan, and gulped. The wind had come up, and blew his blond fringe back from his face, making him look very small and fragile.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, and stopped, swallowing. Very gently, he put his arms round Jemmy\u2019s shoulders and kissed the top of his round red head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back, cousin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you will come and visit me by the sea. You\u2019ll come, too,\u201d he assured Aidan, looking up. Aidan sniffed, nodding, and made his way slowly down the slope.</p><p>Roger reached out a free hand and gently detached Jemmy. \u201cGet on my back, mo chuisle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a steep slope; I\u2019ll take ye down pick-a-back.\u201d</p><p>Not waiting to be asked, Ian leaned down and picked up Aidan, who wrapped his legs round Ian\u2019s middle, hiding his tear-streaked face in Ian\u2019s buckskin shirt.</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019ye want to ride, too?\u201d Roger asked Germain, standing up carefully under the weight of his double burden. \u201cIan can carry ye, if ye like.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and held out a hand, but Germain shook his head, blond hair flying.</p><p>\u201cNon, Uncle Roger,\u201d he said, almost too softly to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d And turning round, began to make his way gingerly down the precipitous slope.</p><p>69</p><p>A STAMPEDE OF BEAVERS</p><p>October 25, 1774</p> <p>THEY HAD BEEN WALKING for an hour before Brianna began to realize that they weren\u2019t after game. They\u2019d cut the trail of a small herd of deer, with droppings so fresh that the pellets were still patchy with moisture, but Ian ignored the sign, pushing up the slope in single-minded determination.</p><p>Rollo had come with them, but after several fruitless attempts to draw his master\u2019s attention to promising scents, abandoned them in disgust and bounded off through the flurrying leaves to do his own hunting.</p><p>The climb was too steep to permit conversation, even had Ian seemed inclined. With a mental shrug, she followed, but kept gun in hand and an eye on the brush, just in case.</p><p>They had left the Ridge at dawn; it was well past noon when they paused at last, on the bank of some small and nameless stream. A wild grapevine wrapped itself round the trunk of a persimmon that overhung the bank; animals had taken most of the grapes, but a few bunches still hung out over the water, out of reach for any but the most daring of squirrels\u2014or a tall woman.</p><p>She shucked her moccasins and waded into the stream, gasping at the icy shock of the water on her calves. The grapes were ripe to bursting, so purple as to be nearly black, and sticky with juice. The squirrels hadn\u2019t got to them, but the wasps had, and she kept a cautious eye on the dagger-bellied foragers as she twisted the tough stem of a particularly succulent bunch.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to tell me what we\u2019re really looking for?\u201d she asked, back turned to her cousin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, a surprise, is it?\u201d She popped the stem, and turned to toss the grapes to him.</p> <p>He caught the bunch one-handed, and set them down on the bank beside the ragged knapsack in which he carried provisions.</p><p>\u201cSomething o\u2019 the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we aren\u2019t just out for a walk, then.\u201d She twisted off another bunch, and sloshed ashore, to sit down beside him.</p><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d He flipped two grapes into his mouth, crushed them, and spat the skins and pips with the ease of long custom. She nibbled hers more daintily, biting one in half and flicking the seeds out with a fingernail.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to eat the skins, Ian; they have vitamins.\u201d</p><p>He raised one shoulder in skepticism, but said nothing. Both she and her mother had explained the concept of vitamins\u2014numerous times\u2014to little or no effect. Jamie and Ian had reluctantly been obliged to admit the existence of germs, because Claire could show them teeming seas of microorganisms in her microscope. Vitamins, however, were unfortunately invisible and thus could be safely ignored.</p><p>\u201cIs it much farther, this surprise?\u201d The grape skins were, in fact, very bitter. Her mouth puckered involuntarily as she bit into one. Ian, industriously eating and spitting, noticed and grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cAye, a bit farther.\u201d</p><p>She cast an eye at the horizon; the sun was coming down the sky. If they were to turn back now, it would be dark before they reached home.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d She spit the mangled grape skin into her palm and flicked it away into the grass.</p><p>Ian glanced at the sun, too, and pursed his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I should think we\u2019ll reach it by midday tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll what? Ian!\u201d He looked abashed, and ducked his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, coz. I ken I should have told ye before\u2014but I thought ye maybe wouldn\u2019t come, if I said how far.\u201d</p><p>A wasp lighted on the bunch of grapes in her hand, and she slapped it irritably away.</p><p>\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t. Ian, what were you thinking? Roger will have a fit!\u201d</p><p>Her cousin seemed to find the notion funny; his mouth turned up at the corner.</p><p>\u201cA fit? Roger Mac? I shouldna think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right, he won\u2019t throw a fit\u2014but he\u2019ll be worried. And Jemmy will miss me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Ian assured her. \u201cI told Uncle Jamie we\u2019d be gone three days, and he said he\u2019d bring the wean up to the Big House. With your Mam and Lizzie and Mrs. Bug to fuss him, wee Jem won\u2019t even notice you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>This was likely true, but did nothing to assuage her annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYou told Da? And he just said fine, and both of you thought it was perfectly all right to\u2014to\u2014lug me off into the woods for three days, without telling me what was going on? You\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh-handed, insufferable, beastly Scots,\u201d Ian said, in such a perfect imitation of her mother\u2019s English accent that she burst out laughing, despite her annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, wiping spluttered grape juice off her chin. \u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>He was still smiling, but his expression had changed; he wasn\u2019t teasing anymore.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said softly, with that Highland lilt that made of her name something strange and graceful. \u201cIt\u2019s important, aye?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t smiling at all now. His eyes were fixed on hers, warm, but serious. His hazel eyes were the only feature of any beauty about Ian Murray\u2019s face, but they held a gaze of such frank, sweet openness that you felt he had let you look inside his soul, just for an instant. She had had occasion before to wonder whether he was aware of this particular effect\u2014but even if he was, it was difficult to resist.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and waved away a circling wasp, still cross but resigned. \u201cAll right. But you still should have told me. And you won\u2019t tell me, even now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking down at the grape he was thumbing loose from its stem.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said simply. He flipped the grape into his mouth and turned to open his bag\u2014which, now that she noticed, bulged suspiciously. \u201cD\u2019ye want some bread, coz, or a bit of cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She stood up and brushed dead leaves from her breeches. \u201cThe sooner we get there, the sooner we\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>THEY STOPPED AN HOUR before sunset, while enough light remained to gather wood. The bulging knapsack had proved to contain two blankets, as well as food and a jug of beer\u2014welcome, after the day\u2019s walking, which had been mostly uphill.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is a good batch,\u201d she said approvingly, sniffing at the neck of the jug after a long, aromatic, hop-edged swallow. \u201cWho made it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie. She caught the knack of it from Frau Ute. Before the . . . er . . . mphm.\u201d A delicate Scottish noise encompassed the painful circumstances surrounding the dissolution of Lizzie\u2019s betrothal.</p><p>\u201cMmm. That was too bad, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She lowered her lashes, watching him covertly to see whether he would say anything further about Lizzie. Lizzie and Ian had seemed fond of each other once\u2014but first he had gone to the Iroquois, and then she had been engaged to Manfred McGillivray when he returned. Now that both of them were free once more . . .</p><p>He dismissed her comment about Lizzie with nothing more than a shrug of agreement, though, concentrating on the tedious process of fire-making. The day had been warm and an hour of daylight remained, but the shadows under the trees were already blue; the night would be chilly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a look at the stream,\u201d she announced, plucking a coiled line and hook from the small pile of effects Ian had unloaded from his bag. \u201cIt looked like there\u2019s a trout pool just below the bend, and the flies will be rising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He nodded, but paid her little attention, patiently scraping the pile of kindling a little higher before striking the next shower of sparks from his flint.</p><p>As she made her way around the bend of the little creek, she saw that it wasn\u2019t merely a trout pool\u2014it was a beaver pond. The humped mound of the lodge was reflected in still water, and on the far bank she could see the agitated judderings of a couple of willow saplings, evidently in the process of being consumed.</p><p>She moved slowly, a wary eye out. Beavers wouldn\u2019t trouble her, but they would make a dash for the water if they saw her, not only splashing, but smacking the water with their tails in alarm. She\u2019d heard it before; it was amazingly loud, sounding like a fusillade of gunshots, and guaranteed to scare every fish within miles into hiding.</p><p>Gnawed sticks littered the near bank, the white inner wood chiseled as neatly as any carpenter could do, but none was fresh, and she heard nothing nearby but the sigh of wind in the trees. Beavers were not stealthy; none was close.</p><p>With a cautious eye on the far bank, she baited the hook with a small chunk of cheese, whirled it slowly overhead, picked up speed as she let the line out, then let it fly. The hook landed with a small plop! in the middle of the pond, but the noise wasn\u2019t sufficient to alarm the beavers; the willow saplings on the far bank continued to shake and heave under the assault of industrious teeth.</p><p>The evening hatch was rising, just as she\u2019d told Ian. The air was soft, cool on her face, and the surface of the water dimpled and glimmered like gray silk shaken in light. Small clouds of gnats drifted in the still air under the trees, prey for the rising of the carnivorous caddis flies, stone flies, and damselflies breaking free of the surface, new-hatched and ravenous.</p><p>It was a pity that she hadn\u2019t a casting rod or tied flies\u2014but still worth a try. Caddis flies weren\u2019t the only things that rose hungry at twilight, and voracious trout had been known to strike at almost anything that floated in front of them\u2014her father had once taken one with a hook adorned with nothing more than a few knotted strands of his own bright hair.</p><p>That was a thought. She smiled to herself, brushing back a wisp of hair that had escaped from its plait, and began to draw the line slowly back toward shore. But there were likely more than trout here, and cheese was\u2014</p><p>A strong tug came on the line, and she jerked in surprise. A snag? The line jerked back, and a thrill from the depths shot up her arm like electricity.</p><p>The next half hour passed without conscious thought, in the single-minded pursuit of finny prey. She was wet to mid-thigh, rashed with mosquito bites, and her wrist and shoulder ached, but she had three fat fish gleaming in the grass at her feet, a hunter\u2019s sense of profound satisfaction\u2014and a few more crumbs of cheese left in her pocket.</p><p>She was drawing back her arm to throw the hook again, when a sudden chorus of squeaks and hisses shattered the evening calm, and a stampede of beavers broke from cover, trundling down the opposite bank of the pond like a platoon of small, furry tanks. She stared at them open-mouthed, and took a step back in reflex.</p><p>Then something big and dark appeared among the trees behind the beavers, and further reflex shot adrenaline through her limbs as she whirled to flee. She would have been into the trees and away in an instant, had she not stepped on one of her fish, which slid under her foot like greased butter and dumped her unceremoniously on her backside. From which position she was ideally placed to see Rollo race from the trees in a long, low streak and launch himself in an arching parabola from the top of the bank. Graceful as a comet, he soared through the air and landed in the pond among the beavers, with a splash like a fallen meteor.</p><p>IAN LOOKED UP AT HER, open-mouthed. Slowly, his eyes traveled from her dripping hair, over her sopping, mud-smeared clothes, and down to the fish\u2014one slightly squashed\u2014that dangled from a leather string in her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe fish put up a good fight, did they?\u201d he asked, nodding at the string. The corners of his mouth began to twitch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and dropped them on the ground in front of him. \u201cBut not nearly as good a fight as the beavers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeavers,\u201d he said. He rubbed a knuckle meditatively down the bridge of his long, bony nose. \u201cAye, I heard them slapping. Ye\u2019ve been fighting beavers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been rescuing your wretched dog from beavers,\u201d she said, and sneezed. She sank to her knees in front of the new-made fire and closed her eyes in momentary bliss at the touch of heat on her shivering body.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rollo\u2019s back, then? Rollo! Where are ye, hound?\u201d The big dog slunk reluctantly out of the shrubbery, tail barely twitching in response to his master\u2019s call.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about beavers, then, a madadh?\u201d Ian said sternly. In response, Rollo shook himself, though no more than a fine mist of water droplets rose from his coat. He sighed, dropped to his belly, and put his nose morosely on his paws.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was only after fish, but the beavers didn\u2019t see it that way. They ran from him on shore, but once he was in the water\u2014\u201d Brianna shook her head, and wrung out the soggy tail of her hunting shirt. \u201cI tell you what, Ian\u2014you clean those damn fish.\u201d</p><p>He was already doing so, gutting one with a single neat slice up the belly and a scoop of the thumb. He tossed the entrails toward Rollo, who merely let out another sigh, and seemed to flatten against the dead leaves, ignoring the treat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no hurt, is he?\u201d Ian asked, frowning at his dog.</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. I expect he\u2019s embarrassed. You could ask whether I\u2019m hurt. Do you have any idea what kind of teeth beavers have?\u201d</p><p>The light was nearly gone, but she could see his lean shoulders shaking.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, sounding rather strangled. \u201cI have. They, um, didna bite ye, did they? I mean\u2014I should think it would be noticeable, if ye\u2019d been gnawed.\u201d A small wheeze of amusement escaped him, and he tried to cover it with a cough.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, rather coldly. The fire was going well, but not nearly well enough. The evening breeze had come up, and was reaching through the soaked fabric of shirt and breeches to fondle her backside with ice-cold fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the teeth as the tails,\u201d she said, shuffling round on her knees to present her back to the fire. She rubbed a hand gingerly over her right arm, where one of the muscular paddles had struck flat on her forearm, leaving a reddened bruise that stretched from wrist to elbow. For a few moments, she\u2019d thought the bone was broken.</p><p>\u201cIt was like being hit with a baseball bat\u2014er . . . with a club, I mean,\u201d she amended. The beavers hadn\u2019t attacked her directly, of course, but being in the water with a panicked wolf-dog and half a dozen sixty-pound rodents in a state of extreme agitation had been rather like walking through an automated car wash on foot\u2014a maelstrom of blinding spray and thrashing objects. A chill struck her and she wrapped both arms around herself, shivering.</p><p>\u201cHere, coz.\u201d Ian stood up and skinned the buckskin shirt off over his head. \u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>She was much too cold and battered to refuse the offer. Retiring modestly behind a bush, she stripped off the wet things and emerged a moment later, clad in Ian\u2019s buckskin, one of the blankets wrapped around her waist sarong-style.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t eat enough, Ian,\u201d she said, sitting down by the fire again, and eyeing him critically. \u201cAll your ribs show.\u201d</p><p>They did. He\u2019d always been lean to the point of thinness, but in his younger years, his teenage scrawniness had seemed quite normal, merely the result of his bones outstripping the growth of the rest of him.</p><p>Now he had reached his full growth and had had a year or two to let his muscles catch up. They had\u2014she could see every sinew in his arms and shoulders\u2014but the knobs of his spine bulged against the tanned skin of his back, and she could see the shadows of his ribs like rippled sand underwater.</p><p>He raised a shoulder, but made no reply, intent on skewering the cleaned fish on peeled willow twigs for broiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t sleep very well, either.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him across the fire. Even in this light, the shadows and hollows in his face were obvious, despite the distraction of the Mohawk tattoos that looped across his cheekbones. The shadows had been obvious to everyone for months; her mother had wanted to say something to Ian, but Jamie had told her to let the lad be; he would speak when he was ready.</p><p>\u201cOh, well enough,\u201d he murmured, not looking up.</p><p>Whether he was ready now or not, she couldn\u2019t say. But he\u2019d brought her here. If he wasn\u2019t ready, he could bloody well get that way fast.</p><p>She had\u2014of course\u2014wondered all day about the mysterious goal of their journey, and why she was his necessary companion. For a matter of hunting, Ian would have taken one of the men; good as she was with a gun, several of the men on the Ridge were better, including her father. And any one of them would be better suited than she to something like digging out a bear\u2019s den or packing home meat or hides.</p><p>They were in the Cherokee lands at the moment; she knew Ian visited the Indians frequently, and was on good terms with several villages. But if it had been a matter of some formal arrangement to be made, surely he would have asked Jamie to accompany him, or Peter Bewlie, with his Cherokee wife to interpret.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, with the tone in her voice that could bring almost any man up short. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up, and he blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, a little more gently, \u201cis this to do with your wife?\u201d</p><p>He stayed frozen for a moment, eyes dark and unfathomable. Rollo, in the shadows behind him, suddenly raised his head and let out a small whine of inquiry. That seemed to rouse Ian; he blinked and looked down.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, sounding quite matter-of-fact. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted the angle of the stick he had driven into the earth by the fire; the pale flesh of the fish curled and sizzled, browning on the green wood.</p><p>She waited for him to say more, but he didn\u2019t speak\u2014just broke off the edge of a piece of half-cooked fish and held it out to the dog, clicking his tongue in invitation. Rollo rose and sniffed Ian\u2019s ear in concern, but then deigned to take the fish, and lay down again, licking the hot tidbit delicately before scooping it up with his tongue, gathering enough spirit then to engulf the discarded heads and fish guts as well.</p><p>Ian pursed his lips a little, and she could see the thoughts flickering half-formed across his face, before he made up his mind to speak.</p><p>\u201cI did once think of marrying you, ye ken.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quick, direct glance, and she felt an odd little jolt of realization. He\u2019d thought about it, all right. And while she had no doubt that his offer then had been made from the purest of motives . . . he was a young man. She hadn\u2019t until this moment realized that he would of course have contemplated every detail of what that offer entailed.</p><p>His eyes held hers in wry acknowledgment of the fact that he had indeed imagined the physical details of sharing her bed\u2014and had not found the prospect in any way objectionable. She resisted the impulse to blush and look away; that would discredit them both.</p><p>She was suddenly\u2014and for the first time\u2014aware of him as a man, rather than as an endearing young cousin. And aware of the heat of his body that had lingered in the soft buckskin when she pulled it on.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been the worst thing in the world,\u201d she said, striving to match his matter-of-fact tone. He laughed, and the stippled lines of his tattoos lost their grimness.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe not the best\u2014that would be Roger Mac, aye? But I\u2019m glad to hear I wouldna have been the worst, either. Better than Ronnie Sinclair, d\u2019ye think? Or worse than Forbes the lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, bloody ha.\u201d She refused to be discomposed by his teasing. \u201cYou would have been at least third on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird?\u201d That got his attention. \u201cWhat? Who was second?\u201d He actually seemed miffed at the notion that someone might precede him, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cLord John Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Oh, well. Aye, I suppose he\u2019d do,\u201d Ian admitted grudgingly. \u201cThough of course, he\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, and darted a cautious look in her direction.</p><p>She felt an answering stab of caution. Did Ian know about John Grey\u2019s private tastes? She thought he must, from the odd expression on his face\u2014but if not, it was no place of hers to be revealing Lord John\u2019s secrets.</p><p>\u201cHave you met him?\u201d she asked curiously. Ian had gone with her parents to rescue Roger from the Iroquois, before Lord John had appeared at her aunt\u2019s plantation, where she had met the nobleman herself.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He was still looking wary, though he had relaxed a little. \u201cSome years ago. Him and his . . . son. Stepson, I mean. They came to the Ridge, traveling through to Virginia, and stopped a bit. I gave him the measle.\u201d He grinned, quite suddenly. \u201cOr at least he had the measle. Auntie Claire nursed him through it. Ye\u2019ve met the man yourself, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, at River Run. Ian, the fish is on fire.\u201d</p><p>It was, and he snatched the stick from the flames with a small Gaelic exclamation, waving scorched fingers to cool them. Extinguished in the grass, the fish proved to be quite edible, if a little crispy round the edges, and a tolerably good supper, with the addition of bread and beer.</p><p>\u201cDid ye meet Lord John\u2019s son, then, at River Run?\u201d he asked, resuming their conversation. \u201cWillie, his name is. A nice wee lad. He fell into the privy,\u201d he added thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cFell in the privy?\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHe sounds like an idiot. Or was he just quite small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a decent size for his age. And sensible enough, for an Englishman. See, it wasna quite his fault, ken. We were looking at a snake, and it came up the branch toward us, and . . . well, it was an accident,\u201d he concluded, handing Rollo another piece of fish. \u201cYe\u2019ve not seen the lad yourself, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I think you are deliberately changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I am. D\u2019ye want a bit more beer?\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him\u2014he needn\u2019t think he was going to escape that easily\u2014but nodded, accepting the jug.</p><p>They were quiet for a bit, drinking beer and watching the last of the light fade into darkness as the stars came out. The scent of the pine trees strengthened, their sap warmed from the day, and in the distance she heard the occasional gunshot warning slap of a beaver\u2019s tail on the pond\u2014evidently the beavers had posted sentries, in case she or Rollo should sneak back after dark, she thought wryly.</p><p>Ian had wrapped his own blanket round his shoulders against the growing chill, and was lying flat in the grass, staring upward into the vault of heaven overhead.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make any pretense of not watching him, and was quite sure he was aware of it. His face was quiet for the moment, minus its usual animation\u2014but not guarded. He was thinking, and she was content to let him take his time; it was autumn now and night would be long enough for many things.</p><p>She wished she had thought to ask her mother more about the girl Ian called Emily\u2014the Mohawk name was something multisyllabic and unpronounceable. Small, her mother had said. Pretty, in a neat, small-boned sort of way, and very clever.</p><p>Was she dead, Emily the small and clever? She thought not. She\u2019d been in this time long enough to have seen many men deal with the death of wives. They showed loss and grief\u2014but they didn\u2019t do what Ian had been doing.</p><p>Could he be taking her to meet Emily? That was a staggering thought, but one she rejected almost immediately. It would be a month\u2019s journey, at least, to reach the Mohawks\u2019 territory\u2014probably more. But then . . .</p><p>\u201cI wondered, ken?\u201d he said suddenly, still looking up at the sky. \u201cD\u2019ye feel sometimes . . . wrong?\u201d He glanced at her helplessly, not sure whether he\u2019d said what he meant\u2014but she understood him perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYes, all the time.\u201d She felt a sense of instant, unexpected relief at the admission. He saw the slump of her shoulders, and smiled a little, crookedly.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . maybe not all the time,\u201d she amended. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out in the woods, alone, it\u2019s fine. Or with Roger, by ourselves. Though even then . . .\u201d She saw Ian\u2019s eyebrow lift, and hurried to explain. \u201cNot that. Not being with him. It\u2019s just that we . . . we talk about what was.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look in which sympathy was mingled with interest. Plainly, he would like to know about \u201cwhat was,\u201d but put that aside for the moment.</p><p>\u201cThe woods, aye?\u201d he said. \u201cI see that. When I\u2019m awake, at least. Sleeping, though . . .\u201d He turned his face back toward the empty sky and the brightening stars.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid\u2014when the dark comes on?\u201d She\u2019d felt that now and then; a moment of deep fear at twilight\u2014a sense of abandonment and elemental loneliness as night rose from the earth. A feeling that sometimes remained, even when she had gone inside the cabin, the bolted door secure behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, frowning a little at her. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little,\u201d she said, waving it away. \u201cNot all the time. Not now. But what is it about sleeping in the woods?\u201d</p><p>He sat up, and rocked back a little, big hands linked around one knee, thinking.</p><p>\u201cAye, well . . .\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSometimes I think of the auld tales\u2014 from Scotland, aye? And ones I\u2019ve heard now and then, living wi\u2019 the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka. About . . . things that may come upon a man while he sleeps. To lure away his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings?\u201d Despite the beauty of the stars and the peace of the evening, she felt something small and cold slide down her back. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and blew it out, brows puckered.</p><p>\u201cYe call them sidhe in the Gaelic. The Cherokee call them the Nunnahee. And the Mohawk have names for them, too\u2014more than one. But when I heard Eats Turtles tell of them, I kent at once what they were. It\u2019s the same\u2014the Old Folk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairies?\u201d she said, and her incredulity must have been clear in her voice, for he glanced up sharply at her, a glint of irritation in his eyes.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I ken what you mean by that\u2014Roger Mac showed me the wee picture ye drew for Jem, all tiny things like dragonflies, prinking in the flowers. . . .\u201d He made an uncouth noise in the back of his throat. \u201cNay. These things are . . .\u201d He made a helpless gesture with one big hand, frowning at the grass.</p><p>\u201cVitamins,\u201d he said suddenly, looking up.</p><p>\u201cVitamins,\u201d she said, and rubbed a hand between her brows. It had been a long day; they had likely walked fifteen or twenty miles and fatigue had settled like water in her legs and back. The bruises from her battle with the beavers were beginning to throb.</p><p>\u201cI see. Ian . . . are you sure that your head isn\u2019t still a bit cracked?\u201d She said it lightly, but her real anxiety lest it be true must have shown in her voice, for he gave a low, rueful chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Or at least\u2014I dinna think so. I was only\u2014well, d\u2019ye see, it\u2019s like that. Ye canna see the vitamins, but you and Auntie Claire ken weel that they\u2019re there, and Uncle Jamie and I must take it on faith that ye\u2019re right about it. I ken as much about the\u2014the Old Ones. Can ye no believe me about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d She had begun to agree, for the sake of peace between them\u2014but a feeling swept over her, sudden and cold as a cloud-shadow, that she wished to say nothing to acknowledge the notion. Not out loud. And not here.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, catching sight of her face. \u201cSo ye do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, no,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know it\u2019s not, either. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to talk about things like that, in a wood at night, a million miles away from civilization. All right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little at that, and nodded in acceptance.</p> <p>\u201cAye. And it\u2019s no what I meant to say, really. It\u2019s more . . .\u201d His feathery brows knitted in concentration. \u201cWhen I was a bairn, I\u2019d wake in my bed, and I\u2019d ken at once where I was, aye? There was the window\u201d\u2014he flung out a hand\u2014\u201cand there was the basin and ewer on the table, wi\u2019 a blue band round the top, and there\u201d\u2014he pointed toward a laurel bush\u2014\u201cwas the big bed where Janet and Michael were sleepin\u2019, and Jocky the dog at the bed fit, farting like a beetle, and the smell of peat smoke from the fire and . . . well, even if I should wake at midnight and the house all still around me, I should ken at once where I was.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the memory of her own old room in the house on Furey Street rising around her, vivid as a vision in the smoke. The striped wool blanket, itchy under her chin, and the mattress with the indentation of her body in the middle, cupping her like a huge, warm hand. Angus, the stuffed Scottie with the ragged tam-o-shanter who shared her bed, and the comforting hum of her parents\u2019 conversation from the living room below, punctuated by the baritone sax of the theme music from Perry Mason.</p><p>Most of all, the sense of absolute security.</p><p>She had to close her eyes, and swallow twice before answering.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well. For some time after I left home, I might find myself sleeping rough, wi\u2019 Uncle Jamie in the heather, or here and there in inns and pothouses. I\u2019d wake wi\u2019 no notion where I was\u2014and still, I\u2019d ken I was in Scotland. It was all right.\u201d He paused, lower lip caught between his teeth as he struggled to find the right words.</p> <p>\u201cThen . . . things happened. I wasna in Scotland any longer, and home was . . . gone.\u201d His voice was soft, but she could hear the echo of loss in it.</p><p>\u201cI would wake, with no idea where I might be\u2014or who.\u201d</p><p>He was hunched over now, big hands hanging loose between his thighs as he gazed into the fire.</p><p>\u201cBut when I lay wi\u2019 Emily\u2014from the first time. I knew. Kent who I was again.\u201d He looked up at her then, eyes dark and shadowed by loss. \u201cMy soul didna wander while I slept\u2014when I slept wi\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it does?\u201d she asked quietly, after a moment.</p><p>He nodded, wordless. The wind whispered in the trees above. She tried to ignore it, obscurely afraid that if she listened closely, she might hear words.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, and touched his arm, very lightly. \u201cIs Emily dead?\u201d</p><p>He sat quite still for a minute, then took a deep, shuddering breath, and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna think so.\u201d He sounded very doubtful, though, and she could see the trouble in his face.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said very softly. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, but when she scooted close and put her arms around him, he didn\u2019t resist. She pulled him down with her, insisting that he lie beside her, his head pillowed in the curve between shoulder and breast, her arm around him.</p><p>Mother instinct, she thought, wryly amused. Whatever\u2019s wrong, the first thing you do is pick them up and cuddle them. And if they\u2019re too big to lift . . . and if his warm weight and the sound of his breathing in her ear kept the voices in the wind at bay, so much the better.</p><p>She had a fragmentary memory, a brief vivid image of her mother standing behind her father in the kitchen of their house in Boston. He lay back in a straight chair, his head against her mother\u2019s stomach, eyes closed in pain or exhaustion, as she rubbed his temples. What had it been? A headache? But her mother\u2019s face had been gentle, the lines of her own day\u2019s stress smoothed away by what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cI feel a fool,\u201d Ian said, sounding shy\u2014but didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, squirmed a little, and settled cautiously into the grass, his body barely touching hers.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I suppose not, then,\u201d he murmured. He relaxed by wary degrees, his head growing heavier on her shoulder, the muscles of his back yielding slowly, their tension subsiding under her hand. Very tentatively, as though expecting her to slap him away, he lifted one arm and laid it over her.</p><p>It seemed the wind had died. The firelight shone on his face, the dark dotted lines of his tattoos standing out against the young skin. His hair smelled of woodsmoke and dust, soft against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sighed, deeply.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we get there, aye?\u201d</p><p>He would not say more, and they lay together, quiet in the grass, and safe.</p><p>Brianna felt sleep come, the waves of it gentle, lifting her toward peace, and did not resist. The last thing she recalled was Ian\u2019s face, cheek heavy on her shoulder, his eyes still open, watching the fire.</p><p>WALKING ELK WAS telling a story. It was one of his best stories, but Ian wasn\u2019t paying proper attention. He sat across the fire from Walking Elk, but it was the flames he was watching, not his friend\u2019s face.</p><p>Very odd, he thought. He\u2019d been watching fires all his life, and never seen the woman in them, until these winter months. Of course, peat fires had no great flame to speak of, though they had a good heat and a lovely smell . . . oh. Aye, so she was there, after all, the woman. He nodded slightly, smiling. Walking Elk took this as an expression of approval at his performance and became even more dramatic in his gestures, scowling horrendously and lurching to and fro with bared teeth, growling in illustration of the glutton he had carefully tracked to its lair.</p><p>The noise distracted Ian from the fire, drawing his attention to the story again. Just in time, for Walking Elk had reached the cli**x, and the young men nudged each other in anticipation. Walking Elk was short and heavily built\u2014not so much unlike a glutton himself, which made his imitations that much more entertaining.</p><p>He turned his head, wrinkling up his nose and growling through his teeth, as the glutton caught the hunter\u2019s scent. Then he changed in a flash, became the hunter, creeping carefully through the brush, pausing, squatting low\u2014and springing upward with a sharp yelp, as his buttock encountered a thorny plant.</p><p>The men around the fire whooped as Walking Elk became the glutton, who looked at first astonished at the noise, and then thrilled to have seen its prey. It leaped from its lair, uttering growls and sharp yips of rage. The hunter fell back, horrified, and turned to run. Walking Elk\u2019s stubby legs churned the pounded earth of the longhouse, running in place. Then he threw up his arms and sprawled forward with a despairing \u201cAy-YIIIIII!\u201d as the glutton struck him in the back.</p><p>The men shouted encouragement, slapping their palms on their thighs, as the beleaguered hunter managed to roll onto his back, thrashing and cursing, grappling with the glutton that sought to tear out his throat.</p><p>The firelight gleamed on the scars that decorated Walking Elk\u2019s chest and shoulders\u2014thick white gouges that showed briefly at the gaping neck of his shirt as he writhed picturesquely, arms straining upward against his invisible enemy. Ian found himself leaning forward, his breath short and his own shoulders knotted with effort, though he knew what was coming next.</p><p>Walking Elk had done it many times, but it never failed. Ian had tried it himself, but couldn\u2019t do it at all. The hunter dug his heels and shoulders into the dirt, his body arched like a bow at full stretch. His legs trembled, his arms shook\u2014surely they would give way at any moment. The men by the fire held their breath.</p><p>Then it came: a soft, sudden click. Distinct and somehow muffled, it was exactly the sound made by the breaking of a neck. The snap of bone and ligament, muffled in flesh and fur. The hunter stayed arched a moment, unbelieving, and then slowly, slowly, lowered himself to the ground and sat up, staring at the body of his enemy, clutched limp in his hands.</p><p>He cast up his eyes in prayerful thanks, then stopped, wrinkling his nose. He glanced down, face screwed into a grimace, and rubbed fastidiously at his leggings, soiled by the odorous voidings of the glutton. The hearth rocked with laughter.</p><p>A small bucket of spruce beer was making the rounds; Walking Elk beamed, his face shining with sweat, and accepted it. His short, thick throat worked industriously, sucking the sharp drink down as though it was water. He lowered the bucket at last and looked about in dreamy satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou, Wolf\u2019s Brother. Tell us a story!\u201d He threw the half-empty bucket across the fire; Ian caught it, only sloshing a little over his wrist. He sucked the liquid from his sleeve, laughed, and shook his head. He took a quick mouthful of beer and passed the bucket to Sleeps with Snakes, beside him.</p><p>Eats Turtles, on his other side, poked Ian in the ribs, wanting him to talk, but he shook his head again and shrugged, jerking his chin toward Snake.</p><p>Snake, nothing loath, set the bucket neatly before him and leaned forward, the firelight dancing on his face as he began to talk. He was no actor like Walking Elk, but he was an older man\u2014perhaps thirty\u2014and had traveled much in his youth. He had lived with the Assiniboin and the Cayuga, and had many stories from them, which he told with great skill\u2014if less sweat.</p><p>\u201cWill you talk later, then?\u201d Turtle said in Ian\u2019s ear. \u201cI want to hear more tales of the great sea and the woman with green eyes.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, a little reluctant. He had been very drunk the first time, or he would never have spoken of Geillis Abernathy. It was only that they had been drinking trader\u2019s rum, and the spinning sensation it caused in his head was very like that caused by the stuff she\u2019d given him to drink, though the taste was different. That caused a giddiness that made his eyes blur, so candle flames streaked and ran like water, and the flames of the fire seemed to overflow and leap the hearthstones, glimmering all round her lavish room, small separate blazes springing up in all the rounded surfaces of silver and glass, gems and polished wood\u2014flickering brightest behind green eyes.</p><p>He glanced around. There were no shining surfaces here. Clay pots, rough firewood, and the smooth poles of bed frames, grinding stones and woven baskets; even the cloth and furs of their clothes were soft dull colors that drowned the light. It must have been only the memory of those times of light-glazed dizziness that had brought her to mind.</p><p>He seldom thought of the Mistress\u2014that was how the slaves and the other boys spoke of her; she needed no more name than that, for no one could imagine another of her sort. He did not value his memories of her, but Uncle Jamie had told him not to hide from them, and he obeyed, finding it good counsel.</p><p>He stared intently into the fire, only half-hearing Snake\u2019s recounting of the story about Goose and how he had outwitted the Evil One to bring tobacco to the People and save Old Man\u2019s life. Was it her, then, the witch Geillis, that he saw in the fire?</p><p>He thought it was not. The woman in the fire gave him a warm feeling when he saw her that ran from his heated face down through his chest and curled up low and hot in his belly. The woman in the fire had no face; he saw her limbs, her curving back, a sweep of long, smooth hair, twisting toward him, gone in a flicker; he heard her laugh, soft and breathy, far away\u2014and it was not Geillis Abernathy\u2019s laugh.</p><p>Still, Turtle\u2019s words had brought her to his mind, and he could see her there. He sighed to himself and thought what story he might tell, when it came his turn. Perhaps he would tell about Mrs. Abernathy\u2019s twin slaves, the huge black men who did her every bidding; he had once seen them kill a crocodile, and carry it up from the river between them to lay it at her feet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind so much. He had found\u2014after that first drunken telling\u2014that to speak of her in such a way caused him to think of her in the same way\u2014as though she was a story, interesting but unreal. Perhaps she had happened, as perhaps Goose had brought tobacco to Old Man\u2014but it did not seem so much as though she had happened to him.</p><p>And after all, he had no scars, like Walking Elk\u2019s, that would remind either his hearers or himself that he spoke truth.</p><p>In truth, he was growing bored with drinking and stories. The real truth was that he longed to escape to the furs and cool darkness of his bed platform, shed his clothes, and curl his hot nak*dness around his wife. Her name meant \u201cWorks with Her Hands,\u201d but in the privacy of bed, he called her Emily.</p><p>Their time was growing short; in two moons more, she would leave, to go to the women\u2019s house, and he would not see her. Another moon before the child came, one more after that for cleansing . . . The thought of two months spent cold and alone, without her next to him at night, was enough to make him reach for the beer as it came around, and drink deep.</p><p>Only the bucket was empty. His friends giggled as he held it upside down above his open mouth, a single amber drop splattering on his surprised nose.</p><p>A small hand reached over his shoulder and took the bucket from his grasp, as its partner reached over his other shoulder, holding a full one.</p><p>He took the bucket and twisted, smiling up at her. Works with Her Hands smiled smugly back; it gave her great pleasure to anticipate his wants. She knelt behind him, the curve of her belly pressing warm against his back, and swatted away Turtle\u2019s hand as he reached for the beer.</p><p>\u201cNo, let my husband have it! He tells much better stories when he\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>Turtle closed one eye, fixing her with the other. He was swaying slightly.</p><p>\u201cIs it that he tells better stories when he\u2019s drunk?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do we just think they\u2019re better, because we\u2019re drunk?\u201d</p><p>Works with Her Hands ignored this philosophical inquiry and proceeded to make room for herself at the hearth, swinging her solid little bum deftly back and forth like a battering ram. She settled comfortably next to Ian, folding her arms atop her mound.</p><p>Other young women had come in with her, bringing more beer. They nudged their way in among the young men, murmuring, poking, and laughing. He\u2019d been wrong, Ian thought, watching them. The firelight shone on their faces, glanced from their teeth, caught the moist shine of eyes and the soft dark flesh inside their mouths as they laughed. The fire gleamed on their faces more than it had ever shone from the crystal and silver of Rose Hall.</p><p>\u201cSo, husband,\u201d Emily said, lowering her eyelids demurely. \u201cTell us about this woman with green eyes.\u201d</p><p>He took a thoughtful swallow of beer, then another.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a witch, and a very wicked woman\u2014but she did make good beer.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes flew open wide, and everyone laughed. He looked into her eyes and saw it, clearly; the image of the fire behind him, tiny and perfect\u2014welcoming him in.</p><p>\u201cBut not as good as yours,\u201d he said. He lifted the bucket in salute, and drank deep.</p><p>70</p><p>EMILY</p><p>BRIANNA WOKE IN THE MORNING stiff and sore, but with one clear thought in mind. Okay. I know who I am. She had no clear idea where she was, but that didn\u2019t matter. She lay still for a moment, feeling oddly peaceful, despite the urge to get up and pee.</p><p>How long had it been, she wondered, since she had wakened alone and peaceful, with no company but her own thoughts? Really, not since she had stepped through the stones, she thought, in search of her family. And found them.</p><p>\u201cIn spades,\u201d she murmured, stretching gingerly. She groaned, staggered to her feet, and shuffled into the brush to pee and change back into her own clothes before returning to the blackened fire ring.</p><p>She unplaited her draggled hair, and began groggily combing her fingers through it. There was no sign of Ian or the dog nearby, but she wasn\u2019t concerned. The wood around her was filled with the racket of birds, but not alarm calls, just the daily business of flutter and feeding, a cheerful chatter that didn\u2019t alter when she rose. The birds had been watching her for hours; they weren\u2019t concerned, either.</p><p>She never woke easily, but the simple pleasure of not being dragged from sleep by the insistent demands of those who did made the morning air seem particularly sweet, in spite of the bitter tang of ashes from the dead fire.</p><p>Mostly awake, she wiped a handful of dew-wet poplar leaves over her face by way of a morning toilette, then squatted by the fire ring and began the chore of fire-starting. They had no coffee to boil, but Ian would be hunting. With luck, there\u2019d be something to cook; they\u2019d eaten everything in the knapsack, save a heel of bread.</p><p>\u201cHeck with this,\u201d she muttered, whacking flint and steel together for the dozenth time, and seeing the spatter of sparks wink out without catching. If Ian had only told her they were camping, she would have brought her fire-striker, or some matches\u2014though on second thought, she was not sure that would be safe. The things could easily burst into flame in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cHow did the Greeks do it?\u201d she said aloud, scowling at the tiny mat of charred cloth on which she was attempting to catch a spark. \u201cThey must have had a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Greeks had what?\u201d</p><p>Ian and Rollo were back, having captured, respectively, half a dozen yams and a blue-gray waterbird of some kind\u2014a small heron? Rollo refused to allow her to look at it, and took his prey off to devour under a bush, its long, limp yellow legs dragging on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThe Greeks had what?\u201d Ian repeated, turning out a pocket full of chestnuts, red-brown skins gleaming from the remnants of their prickly hulls.</p><p>\u201cHad stuff called phosphorus. You ever heard of it?\u201d</p><p>Ian looked blank, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff,\u201d she said, finding no better word to hand. \u201cLord John sent me some, so I could make matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatches between whom?\u201d Ian inquired, regarding her warily.</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, her morning-sodden mind making slow sense of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, having at last discovered the difficulty. \u201cNot that kind of match. Those fire-starters I made. Phosphorus burns by itself. I\u2019ll show you, when we get home.\u201d She yawned, and gestured vaguely at the small pile of unlit kindling in the fire ring.</p><p>Ian made a tolerant Scottish noise and took up the flint and steel himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Do the nuts, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here, you should put your shirt back on.\u201d Her own clothes had dried, and while she missed the comfort of Ian\u2019s buckskin, the worn thick wool of her fringed hunting shirt was warm and soft on her skin. It was a bright day, but chilly so early in the morning. Ian had discarded his blanket while starting the fire, and his bare shoulders were pebbled with gooseflesh.</p><p>He shook his head slightly, though, indicating that he\u2019d put on his shirt in a bit. For now . . . his tongue stuck out of the corner of his mouth in concentration as he struck flint and steel again, then disappeared as he muttered something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d She paused, a half-hulled nut in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s no but a\u2014\u201d He\u2019d struck once more and caught a spark, glowing like a tiny star on the square of char. Hastily, he touched a wisp of dry grass to it, then another, and as a tendril of smoke rose up, added a bark chip, more grass, a handful of chips, and finally a careful crisscross of pine twigs.</p><p>\u201cNo but a fire charm,\u201d he finished, grinning at her over the infant blaze that had sprung up before him.</p><p>She applauded briefly, then proceeded to cut the skin of the chestnut she was holding, crosswise, so it wouldn\u2019t burst in the fire.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that one,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He didn\u2019t blush easily, but the skin of his throat darkened a little. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s no the Gaelic, that one. It\u2019s the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka.\u201d</p><p>Her brows went up, as much at the easy sound of the word on his tongue as at what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think in Mohawk, Ian?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>He shot her a glance of surprise, almost, she thought, of fright.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said tersely, and rose off his heels. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch a bit of wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some,\u201d she said, holding him with a stare. She reached behind her and thrust a fallen pine bough into the kindling fire. The dry needles burst in a puff of sparks and were gone, but the ragged bark began to catch and burn at the edges.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I said, about thinking in Mohawk?\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed tight together, not wanting to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to come,\u201d she said, not sharp with him, but firm.</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d He took a deep breath, then looked down at the yams he was burying in the heating ashes to bake.</p><p>She worked on the nuts slowly, watching him make up his mind. Loud chewing sounds and intermittent puffs of blue-gray feathers drifted out from under Rollo\u2019s bush, behind him.</p><p>\u201cDid ye dream last night, Brianna?\u201d he asked suddenly, his eyes still on what he was doing.</p><p>She wished he had brought something coffeelike to boil, but still, she was sufficiently awake by now as to be able to think and respond coherently.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI dream a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that. Roger Mac told me ye write them down sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d That was a jolt, and one bigger than a cup of coffee. She\u2019d never hidden her dreambook from Roger, but they didn\u2019t really discuss it, either. How much of it had he read?</p><p>\u201cHe didna tell me anything about them,\u201d Ian assured her, catching the tone of her voice. \u201cOnly that ye wrote things down, sometimes. So I thought, maybe, those would be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to me,\u201d she said, but cautiously. \u201cWhy . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, d\u2019ye see\u2014the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka set great store by dreams. More even than Highlanders.\u201d He glanced up with a brief smile, then back at the ashes where he had buried the yams. \u201cWhat did ye dream of last night, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirds,\u201d she said, trying to recall. \u201cLots of birds.\u201d Reasonable enough, she thought. The forest around her had been live with birdsong since well before dawn; of course it would seep into her dreams.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Ian seemed interested. \u201cWere the birds alive, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, puzzled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and picked up a chestnut to help her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, to dream of live birds, especially if they sing. Dead birds are a bad thing, in a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were definitely alive, and singing,\u201d she assured him, with a glance up at the branch above him, where some bird with a bright yellow breast and black wings had lighted, viewing their breakfast preparations with interest.</p><p>\u201cDid any of them talk to ye?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, but he was clearly serious. And after all, she thought, why wouldn\u2019t a bird talk to you, in a dream?</p><p>She shook her head, though.</p><p>\u201cNo. They were\u2014oh.\u201d She laughed, unexpectedly recalling. \u201cThey were building a nest out of toilet paper. I dream about toilet paper all the time. That\u2019s a thin, soft kind of paper that you use to wipe your, er, behind with,\u201d she explained, seeing his incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cYe wipe your arse with paper?\u201d He stared at her, jaw dropped in horror. \u201cJesus God, Brianna!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She rubbed a hand under her nose, trying not to laugh at his expression. He might well be horrified; there were no paper mills in the Colonies, and aside from tiny amounts of handmade paper such as she made herself, every sheet had to be imported from England. Paper was hoarded and treasured; her father, who wrote frequently to his sister in Scotland, would write a letter in the normal fashion\u2014but then would turn the paper sideways, and write additional lines perpendicularly, to save space. Little wonder that Ian was shocked!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very cheap then,\u201d she assured him. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as cheap as a cob o\u2019 maize, I\u2019ll warrant,\u201d he said, narrow-eyed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, most people then won\u2019t have cornfields to hand,\u201d she said, still amused. \u201cAnd I tell you what, Ian\u2014toilet paper is much nicer than a dry corncob.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Nicer,\u2019\u201d he muttered, obviously still shaken to the core. \u201cNicer. Jesus, Mary, and Bride!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were asking me about dreams,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cDid you dream last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ah . . . no.\u201d He turned his attention from the scandalous notion of toilet paper with some difficulty. \u201cOr at least if I did, I dinna recall it.\u201d</p><p>It came to her suddenly, looking at his hollowed face, that one reason for his sleeplessness might be that he was afraid of what dreams might come to him.</p><p>In fact, he seemed afraid now that she might press him on the subject. Not meeting her eye, he picked up the empty beer jug and clicked his tongue for Rollo, who followed him, blue-gray feathers sticking to his jaws.</p><p>She had cut the last of the chestnut skins and buried the gleaming marrons in the ashes to bake with the yams, by the time he came back.</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d she called, seeing him. \u201cThe yams are ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in time, forbye,\u201d he answered, smiling. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>What he had was a chunk of honeycomb, thieved from a bee tree and still chilled enough that the honey ran slow and thick, drizzled over the hot yams in glorious blobs of gold sweetness. Garnished with roasted, peeled, sweet chestnuts and washed down with cold creek water, she thought it was possibly the best breakfast she\u2019d eaten since leaving her own time.</p><p>She said as much, and Ian lifted one feathery brow in derision.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? And what would ye eat then that\u2019s better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh . . . chocolate donuts, maybe. Or hot chocolate, with marshmallows in it. I really miss chocolate.\u201d Though it was hard to miss it much at the moment, licking honey off her fingers.</p><p>\u201cOch, get on wi\u2019 ye! I\u2019ve had chocolate.\u201d He squinched his eyes and pinched his lips in exaggerated distaste. \u201cBitter, nasty stuff. Though they did charge a terrible lot of money just for a wee cup of it, in Edinburgh,\u201d he added practically, unsquinching.</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cThey put sugar in it, where I come from,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar in your chocolate? That\u2019s the most decadent thing I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d he said severely. \u201cEven worse than the arse-wiping paper, aye?\u201d She saw the teasing glint in his eye, though, and merely snorted, nibbling the last shreds of orange yam flesh from the blackened skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll get hold of some chocolate, Ian,\u201d she said, discarding the limp peel and licking her fingers like a cat. \u201cI\u2019ll put sugar in it and feed it to you, and see what you think then!\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to snort, good-naturedly, but he made no further remarks, concentrating instead on licking his own hands clean.</p><p>Rollo had appropriated the remnants of honeycomb, and was noisily gnawing and slurping at the wax, with complete enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cThat dog must have the digestion of a crocodile,\u201d Brianna said, shaking her head. \u201cIs there anything he won\u2019t eat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve no tried him on nails, yet.\u201d Ian smiled briefly, but didn\u2019t take up the conversation. The unease that had lain upon him when he talked of dreams had disappeared over breakfast, but seemed now to have returned. The sun was well up, but he made no move to rise. He merely sat, arms wrapped about his knees, gazing thoughtfully into the fire as the rising sun stole the light from the flames.</p><p>In no great hurry to start moving herself, Brianna waited patiently, eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you eat for breakfast when you lived with the Mohawk, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, and his mouth tucked in at one corner. Not a smile, but a wry acknowledgment. He sighed, and laid his head on his knees, face hidden. He sat slumped that way for a bit, then slowly straightened up.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. \u201cIt was to do wi\u2019 my brother-in-law. At least to start.\u201d</p> <p>IAN MURRAY THOUGHT that before too long, he would be obliged to do something about his brother-in-law. Not that \u201cbrother-in-law\u201d was precisely the word for it. Still, Sun Elk was the husband of Looking at the Sky, who was in turn the sister of his own wife. By the notions of the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka this implied no relation between the men beyond that of clansmen, but Ian still thought of Sun Elk with the white part of his mind.</p><p>That was the secret part. His wife had English, but they did not speak it, even when most private. He spoke no word of Scots or English aloud, had heard not a syllable of either tongue in the year since he had chosen to stay, to become Kahnyen\u2019kehaka. It was assumed he had forgotten what he had been. But each day he found some moment to himself, and, lest he lose the words, would silently name the objects around him, hearing their English names echo in the hidden white part of his mind.</p><p>Pot, he thought to himself, squinting at the blackened earthenware warming in the ashes. In fact he was not alone at the moment. He was, however, feeling distinctly alien.</p><p>Corn, he thought, leaning back against the polished tree trunk that formed one upright of the longhouse. Several clusters of dried maize hung above him, festively colored by comparison with the sacks of grain sold in Edinburgh\u2014and yet corn nonetheless. Onions, he thought, eyes passing down the braided chain of yellow globes. Bed. Furs. Fire.</p><p>His wife leaned toward him, smiling, and the words ran suddenly together in his mind. BlackravenblackhairshiningbreastbudsthighssoroundohyesohyesohEmily . . .</p><p>She set a warm bowl in his hand, and the rich aroma of rabbit and corn and onion rose up into his nose. Stew, he thought, the slippery flow of words coming to a sudden halt as his mind focused on food. He smiled at her, and laid his hand over hers, holding it for a moment, small and sturdy under his, curved around the wooden bowl. Her smile deepened; then she pulled away, rising up to go and fetch more food.</p> <p>He watched her go, appreciating the sway of her walk. Then his eye caught Sun Elk\u2014watching, too, from the doorway of his own apartment.</p><p>Bastard, Ian thought, very clearly.</p><p>\u201cSEE, WE GOT ON WELL enough to start,\u201d Ian explained. \u201cHe\u2019s a bonny man, for the most part, Sun Elk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part,\u201d Brianna echoed. She sat still, watching him. \u201cAnd which part was that?\u201d</p><p>Ian rubbed a hand through his hair, making it stand up like the bushy quills on a porcupine.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . the friend part. We were friends, to begin with, aye? Brothers, in fact; we were of the same clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you stopped being friends because of\u2014of your wife?\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed deeply.</p> <p>\u201cWell, ye see . . . the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, they\u2019ve a notion of marriage that\u2014it\u2019s like what ye see in the Highlands, often enough. That is, the parents have a good deal to do wi\u2019 arranging it. Often enough, they\u2019ve watched the weans as they grew, and seen if maybe there was a lad and a lassie that seemed well-matched. And if they were\u2014and if they came from the proper clans\u2014now, that bit\u2019s different, see?\u201d he added, breaking off.</p><p>\u201cThe clans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. In the Highlands, ye\u2019d mostly marry within your own clan, save it was to make an alliance wi\u2019 another. Among the Iroquois nations, though, ye canna ever marry someone from your own clan, and ye can only marry someone from particular clans, not just any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama said the Iroquois reminded her a lot of Highlanders,\u201d Brianna said, mildly amused. \u201cRuthless, but entertaining, was how she put it, I think. Bar some of the torturing, maybe, and the burning your enemies alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s no heard some of Uncle Jamie\u2019s stories about his grandsire, then,\u201d he replied with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Lord Lovat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the other\u2014Seaumais Ruaidh\u2014Red Jacob, him Uncle Jamie\u2019s named for. A wicked auld bugger, my Mam always said; he\u2019d put any Iroquois to shame for pure cruelty, from all I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d He dismissed this tangent with a wave of the hand, though, returning to his explanation.</p><p>\u201cWell, so, when the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka took me, and named me, I was adopted to the Wolf clan, aye?\u201d he said, with an explanatory nod at Rollo, who had consumed the honeycomb, dead bees and all, and was now meditatively licking his paws.</p><p>\u201cVery appropriate,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhat clan was Sun Elk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf, of course. And Emily\u2019s mother and grandmother and sisters were Turtle. But what I was saying\u2014if a lad and lassie from properly different clans seemed maybe suited to each other, then the mothers would speak\u2014they call all the aunties \u2018mother,\u2019 too,\u201d he added. \u201cSo there might be a good many mothers involved in the matter. But if all the mothers and grandmothers and aunties were to agree that it would be a good match . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019d marry.\u201d</p><p>Brianna rocked back a little, arms around her knees.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t have a mother to speak for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did wonder what my Mam would ha\u2019 said, if she\u2019d been there,\u201d he said, and smiled, despite his seriousness.</p><p>Brianna, having met Ian\u2019s mother, laughed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cAunt Jenny would be a match for any Mohawk, male or female,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut what happened, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Emily,\u201d he said very simply. \u201cAnd she loved me.\u201d</p><p>This state of affairs, which rapidly became apparent to everyone in the village, caused considerable public comment. Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa, Works with Her Hands, the girl Ian called Emily, had been widely expected to marry Sun Elk, who had been a visitor to her family\u2019s hearth since childhood.</p><p>\u201cBut there it was.\u201d Ian spread his hands and shrugged. \u201cShe loved me, and she said so.\u201d</p><p>When Ian had been taken into the Wolf clan, he had been given to foster parents, as well\u2014the parents of the dead man in whose stead he had been adopted. His foster mother had been somewhat taken aback by the situation, but after discussing the matter with the other women of the Wolf clan, had gone to speak formally with Tewaktenyonh, Emily\u2019s grandmother\u2014and the most influential woman in the village.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we married.\u201d Dressed in their best, and accompanied by their parents, the two young people had sat together on a bench before the assembled people of the village, and exchanged baskets\u2014his containing the furs of sable and beaver, and a good knife, symbolizing his willingness to hunt for her and protect her; hers filled with grain and fruit and vegetables, symbolizing her willingness to plant, gather, and provide for him.</p><p>\u201cAnd four moons later,\u201d Ian added, \u201cSun Elk wed Looking at the Sky, Emily\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Brianna raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but.\u201d</p><p>IAN HAD THE GUN Jamie had left with him, a rare and valued item among the Indians, and he knew how to use it. He also knew how to track, to lie in ambush, to think like an animal\u2014other things of value that Uncle Jamie had left with him.</p><p>In consequence, he was a good hunter, and rapidly gained respect for his ability to bring in meat. Sun Elk was a decent hunter\u2014not the best, but capable. Many of the young men would joke and make remarks, denigrating each other\u2019s skills and making fun; he did it himself. Still, there was a tone to Sun Elk\u2019s jests to Ian that now and then made one of the other men glance sharply at him, then away with the faintest of shrugs.</p><p>He had been inclined to ignore the man. Then he had seen Sun Elk look at Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa, and everything became at once clear to him.</p><p>She had been going to the forest with some other girls, one day in late summer. They carried baskets for gathering; Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa had an ax through her belt. One of the other girls had asked her whether she meant to find wood for another bowl like the one she had made for her mother; Works With Her Hands had said\u2014with a quick, warm look toward Ian, who lounged nearby with the other young men\u2014that no, she wished to find a good red cedar, for wood to make a cradleboard.</p><p>The girls had giggled and embraced Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa; the young men had grinned and prodded Ian knowingly in the ribs. And Ian had caught a glimpse of Sun Elk\u2019s face, hot eyes fixed on Emily\u2019s straight back as she walked away.</p><p>Within one moon, Sun Elk had moved into the longhouse, husband to his wife\u2019s sister, Looking at the Sky. The sisters\u2019 compartments were across from each other; they shared a hearth. Ian had seldom seen Sun Elk look at Emily again\u2014but he had seen him look carefully away, too many times.</p><p>\u201cThere is a person who desires you,\u201d he said to Emily one night. It was long past the hour of the wolf, deep night, and the longhouse slept around them. The child she carried obliged her to rise and make water; she had come back to their furs skin-chilled and with the fresh smell of pines in her hair.</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, why not? Everyone else is asleep.\u201d She had stretched luxuriously and kissed him, the small bulge of her belly smooth and hard against his.</p><p>\u201cNot me. I mean\u2014of course this person desires you, too!\u201d he\u2019d said hastily, as she drew back a bit, offended. He wrapped his arms about her in quick illustration. \u201cI mean\u2014there is someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmf.\u201d Her voice was muffled, her breath warm against his chest. \u201cThere are many who desire me. I am very, very good with my hands.\u201d She gave him a brief demonstration, and he gasped, causing her to chuckle with satisfaction.</p><p>Rollo, who had accompanied her outside, crawled under the bed platform and curled up in his accustomed spot, chewing noisily at an itching spot near his tail.</p><p>A little later, they lay with the furs thrown back. The hide that hung over their doorway was pulled back, so the heat of the fire could come in, and he could see the shine of light on the moist gold skin of her shoulder, where she lay turned away from him. She reached back and put one of her clever hands on his, took his palm, and pressed it against her belly. The child inside had begun to stir; he felt a soft, sudden push against his palm, and his breath stilled in his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d Emily said very softly. \u201cThis person desires only you.\u201d</p><p>He had slept well.</p><p>In the morning, though, he had sat by the hearth eating cornmeal mush, and Sun Elk, who had already eaten, walked by. He stopped and looked down at Ian.</p><p>\u201cThis person dreamed about you, Wolf\u2019s Brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Ian said pleasantly. He felt the warmth rise up his throat, but kept his face relaxed. The Kahyen\u2019kehaka set great store by dreams. A good dream would have everyone in the longhouse discussing it for days. The look on Sun Elk\u2019s face didn\u2019t indicate that his dream about Ian had been a good one.</p><p>\u201cThat dog\u2014\u201d He nodded at Rollo, who lay sprawled inconveniently in the doorway of Ian\u2019s compartment, snoring. \u201cI dreamed that it rose up over your couch, and seized you by the throat.\u201d</p><p>That was a menacing dream. A Kahnyen\u2019kehaka who believed such a dream might decide to kill the dog, lest it be a foretelling of ill fortune. But Ian was not\u2014not quite\u2014Kahnyen\u2019kehaka.</p><p>Ian raised both brows, and went on eating. Sun Elk waited for a moment, but as Ian said nothing, eventually nodded and turned away.</p><p>\u201cAhkote\u2019ohskennonton,\u201d Ian said, calling his name. The man turned back, expectant.</p><p>\u201cThis person dreamed of you, too.\u201d Sun Elk glanced sharply at him. Ian didn\u2019t speak further, but let a slow and evil smile grow upon his face.</p><p>Sun Elk stared at him. He kept smiling. The other man turned away with a snort of disgust, but not before Ian had seen the faint look of unease in Sun Elk\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWELL, SO.\u201d Ian took a deep breath. He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them. \u201cYe ken the child died, aye?\u201d</p><p>He spoke with no emotion at all in his voice. It was that dry, controlled tone that seared her heart, and choked her so that she could do no more than nod in reply.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep it up, though. He opened his mouth as though to speak, but the big, bony hands clenched suddenly on his knees, and instead, he rose abruptly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll tell ye the rest, walking.\u201d</p><p>And he did, his back resolutely turned, as he led her higher up the mountain, then across a narrow ridge, and down the path of a stream that fell in a series of small, enchanting waterfalls, each encircled with a mist of miniature rainbows.</p><p>Works with Her Hands had conceived again. That child was lost just after her belly began to swell with life.</p><p>\u201cThey say, the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka,\u201d Ian explained, his voice muffled as he shoved his way through a screen of brilliant red creeper, \u201cthat for a woman to conceive, her husband\u2019s spirit does battle with hers, and must overcome it. If his spirit isna strong enough\u201d\u2014his voice came clear as he ripped a handful of creeper down, breaking the branch it hung from, and cast it viciously away\u2014\u201cthen the child canna take root in the womb.\u201d</p><p>After this second loss, the Medicine Society had taken the two of them to a private hut, there to sing and beat drums and to dance in huge painted masks, meant to frighten away whatever evil entities might be hampering Ian\u2019s spirit\u2014or unduly strengthening Emily\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to laugh, seeing the masks,\u201d Ian said. He didn\u2019t turn round; yellow leaves spangled the shoulders of his buckskin and stuck in his hair. \u201cThey call it the Funny-Face Society, too\u2014and for a reason. Didna do it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . suppose Em-Emily laughed.\u201d He was going so fast that she was pressed to keep up with him, though her legs were nearly as long as his own.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and uttered a short, bitter laugh himself. \u201cShe didna.\u201d</p><p>She had gone into the medicine hut beside him silent and gray, but had come out with a peaceful face, and reached for him in their bed that night with love. For three months, they had made love with tenderness and ardor. For another three, they had made love with a sense of increasing desperation.</p><p>\u201cAnd then she missed her courses again.\u201d</p><p>He had at once ceased his attentions, terrified of causing a further mishap. Emily had moved slowly and carefully, no longer going into the fields to work, but staying in the longhouse, working, always working, with her hands. Weaving, grinding, carving, boring beads of shell for wampum, hands moving ceaselessly, to compensate for the waiting stillness of her body.</p><p>\u201cHer sister went to the fields. It\u2019s the women who do, ken?\u201d He paused to slash an outreaching brier with his knife, tossing the severed branch out of the way so it wouldn\u2019t snap back and hit Brianna in the face.</p><p>\u201cLooking at the Sky brought us food. All the women did, but her most of all. She was a sweet lass, Kar\u00f2nya.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight catch in his voice at this, the first in his harsh recitation of facts.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Brianna hastened her step a little as they came out onto the top of a grass-covered bank, so that she drew up nearly even with him. He slowed a little, but didn\u2019t turn to look at her\u2014kept his face forward, chin raised as though confronting enemies.</p><p>\u201cTaken.\u201d Looking at the Sky had been in the habit of staying later in the fields than the other women, gathering extra corn or squash for her sister and Ian, though she had a child of her own by then. One evening, she did not return to the longhouse, and when the villagers had gone out to search for her, neither she nor the child was anywhere to be found. They had vanished, leaving only one pale moccasin behind, tangled in the squash vines at the edge of a field.</p><p>\u201cAbenaki,\u201d Ian said tersely. \u201cWe found the sign next day; it was full dark before we began to search in earnest.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long night searching, followed by a week of the same\u2014a week of growing fear and emptiness\u2014and Ian had returned to his wife\u2019s hearth at dawn on the seventh day, to learn that she had miscarried once more.</p><p>He paused. He was sweating freely from walking so fast, and wiped a sleeve across his chin. Brianna could feel the sweat trickling down her own back, dampening the hunting shirt, but disregarded it. She touched his back, very gently, but said nothing.</p><p>He heaved a deep sigh, almost of relief, she thought\u2014perhaps that the dreadful tale was nearly done.</p><p>\u201cWe tried a bit longer,\u201d he said, back to the matter-of-fact tone. \u201cEmily and I. But the heart had gone out of her. She didna trust me any longer. And . . . Ahkote\u2019ohskennonton was there. He ate at our hearth. And he watched her. She began to look back.\u201d</p><p>Ian had been shaping wood for a bow one day, concentrating on the flow of the grain beneath his knife, trying to see those things in the swirls that Emily saw, to hear the voice of the tree, as she had told him. It wasn\u2019t the tree that spoke behind him, though.</p><p>\u201cGrandson,\u201d said a dry old voice, lightly ironic.</p><p>He dropped the knife, narrowly missing his own foot, and swung round, bow in hand. Tewaktenyonh stood six feet away, one eyebrow lifted in amusement at having sneaked up on him unheard.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother,\u201d he said, and nodded in wry acknowledgment of her skill. Ancient she might be, but no one moved more softly. Hence her reputation; the children of the village lived in respectful dread of her, having heard that she could vanish into air, only to rematerialize in some distant spot, right before the guilty eyes of evil-doers.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Wolf\u2019s Brother,\u201d she said, and turned away, not waiting for his response. None was expected.</p><p>She was already out of sight by the time he had laid the half-made bow under a bush, taken up his fallen knife, and whistled for Rollo, but he caught her up with no difficulty.</p><p>She had led him away from the village, through the forest, to the head of a deer trail. There she had given him a bag of salt and an armlet of wampum and bade him go.</p><p>\u201cAnd you went?\u201d Brianna asked, after a long moment of silence. \u201cJust\u2014like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d he said, and looked at her for the first time since they had left their campsite that morning. His face was gaunt, hollow with memories. Sweat gleamed on his cheekbones, but he was so pale that the dotted lines of his tattoos stood out sharp\u2014perforations, lines along which his face might come apart.</p><p>She swallowed a few times before she could speak, but managed a tone much like his own when she did.</p><p>\u201cIs it much farther?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there.\u201d And turned to walk again before her.</p><p>HALF AN HOUR LATER, they had reached a place where the stream cut deep between its banks, widening into a small gorge. Silver birch and hobblebush grew thick, sprouting from the rocky walls, smooth-skinned roots twisting through the stones like fingers clawing at the earth.</p><p>The notion gave Brianna a slight prickle at the neck. The waterfalls were far above them now, and the noise of the water had lessened, the creek talking to itself as it purled over rocks and shushed through mats of cress and duckweed.</p><p>She thought the going might be easier above, on the lip of the gorge, but Ian led her down into it without hesitation, and she followed likewise, scrambling over the tumble of boulders and tree roots, hampered by her long gun. Rollo, scorning this clumsy exertion, plunged into the creek, which was several feet deep, and swam, ears clamped back against his head so that he looked like a giant otter.</p><p>Ian had recovered his self-possession in the concentration of navigating the rough ground. He paused now and then, reaching back to help her down a particularly tricky fall of rock, or over a tree uprooted in some recent flood\u2014but he didn\u2019t meet her eyes, and the shuttered planes of his face gave nothing away.</p><p>Her curiosity had reached fever pitch, but clearly he had done speaking for the moment. It was just past midday, but the light under the birches was a shadowed gold that made everything seem somehow hushed, almost enchanted. She could make no sensible guess as to the purpose of this expedition, in light of what Ian had told her\u2014but the place was one where almost anything seemed possible.</p><p>She thought suddenly of her first father\u2014of Frank Randall\u2014and felt a small, remembered warmth at the thought. She would like so much to show him this place.</p><p>They had taken holidays often in the Adirondacks; different mountains, different trees\u2014but something of the same hush and mystery in the shadowed glades and rushing water. Her mother had come sometimes, but more often it was just the two of them, hiking far up into the trees, not talking much, but sharing a deep content in the company of the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of the water rose again; there was another fall nearby.</p><p>\u201cJust here, coz,\u201d Ian said softly, and beckoned her to follow with a turn of the head.</p><p>They stepped out from under the trees and she saw that the gorge dropped suddenly away, the water falling twenty feet or more into a pool below. Ian led her past the head of the falls; she could hear the water rushing past below, but the top of the bank was thick with sedges, and they had to push their way through, tramping down the yellowing stems of goldenrod and dodging the panicked whir of grasshoppers rocketing up underfoot.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ian said, glancing back, and reached to part the screen of laurel in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>She recognized it immediately. There was no mistaking it, in spite of the fact that much of it was invisible, still buried in the crumbling bank on the far side of the gorge. Some recent flood had raised the level of the creek, undercutting the bank so that a huge block of stone and dirt had fallen away, revealing its buried mystery.</p><p>The raked arches of ribs rose huge from the dirt, and she had the impression of a scatter of things half-buried in the rubble at the foot of the bank: enormous things, knobbed and twisted. They might be bones or simply boulders\u2014but it was the tusk that caught her eye, jutting from the bank in a massive curve, intensely familiar, and the more startling for its very familiarity.</p><p>\u201cYe ken it?\u201d Ian asked eagerly, watching her face. \u201cYe\u2019ve seen something like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, and though the sun was warm on her back, she shivered, gooseflesh pebbling her forearms. Not from fear, but sheer awe at sight of it, and a kind of incredulous joy. \u201cOh, yes. I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ian\u2019s voice was still pitched low, as though the creature might hear them. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mammoth,\u201d she said, and found that she was whispering, too. The sun had passed its zenith; already the bottom of the creekbed lay in shadow. Light struck the stained curve of ancient ivory, and threw the vault of the high-crowned skull that held it into sharp relief. The skull was fixed in the soil at a slight angle, the single visible tusk rising high, the eye socket black as mystery.</p><p>The shiver came again, and she hunched her shoulders. Easy to feel that it might at any moment wrench itself free of the clay and turn that massive head toward them, empty-eyed, clods of dirt raining from tusks and bony shoulders as it shook itself and began to walk, the ground vibrating as long toes struck and sank in the muddy soil.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s called\u2014mammoth? Aye, well . . . it is verra big.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice dispelled the illusion of incipient movement, and she was able finally to take her eyes off it\u2014though she felt she must glance back, every second or so, to be sure it was still there.</p><p>\u201cThe Latin name is Mammuthus,\u201d she said, clearing her throat. \u201cThere\u2019s a complete skeleton in a museum in New York. I\u2019ve seen it often. And I\u2019ve seen pictures of them in books.\u201d She glanced back at the creature in the bank.</p><p>\u201cA museum? So it\u2019s not a thing ye\u2019ve got where\u2014when\u201d\u2014he stumbled a bit\u2014\u201cwhere ye come from? Not alive then, I mean?\u201d He seemed rather disappointed.</p><p>She wanted to laugh at the picture of mammoths roaming Boston Common, or wallowing on the bank of the Cambridge River. In fact, she had a moment\u2019s pang of disappointment that they hadn\u2019t been there; it would have been so wonderful to see them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said regretfully. \u201cThey all died thousands and thousands of years ago. When the ice came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce?\u201d Ian was glancing back and forth between her and the mammoth, as though afraid one or the other might do something untoward.</p><p>\u201cThe Ice Age. The world got colder, and sheets of ice spread down from the north. A lot of animals went extinct\u2014I mean, they couldn\u2019t find food, and all died.\u201d</p><p>Ian was pale with excitement.</p><p>\u201cAye. Aye, I\u2019ve heard such stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d She was surprised at that.</p><p>\u201cAye. But ye say it\u2019s real.\u201d He swung his head to look at the mammoth\u2019s bones once more. \u201cAn animal, aye, like a bear or a possum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, puzzled by his attitude, which seemed to alternate between eagerness and dismay. \u201cBigger, but yes. What else would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and took a deep breath. \u201cWell, d\u2019ye see, that\u2019s what I needed ye to tell me, coz. See, the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka\u2014they have stories of . . . things. Animals that are really spirits. And if ever I saw a thing that might be a spirit\u2014\u201d He was still looking at the skeleton, as though it might walk out of the earth, and she saw a slight shiver pass through him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t prevent a similar shiver, looking at the massive creature. It towered above them, grim and awful, and only her knowledge of what it was kept her from wanting to cower and run.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d she repeated, as much to reassure herself as him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s dead. Really dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019ye know these things?\u201d he asked, intently curious. \u201cIt\u2019s auld, ye say. You\u2019d be much further away from\u2014that\u201d\u2014he jerked his chin at the giant skeleton\u2014\u201cin your own time than we are now. How can ye ken more about it than folk do now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, smiling a little, and helpless to explain.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find this, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month. I came up the gorge\u201d\u2014he gestured with his chin\u2014\u201cand there it was. I near beshit myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d she said, stifling an urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, not noticing her amusement in his desire to explain. \u201cI should have been sure that it was Rawenniyo\u2014a spirit, a god\u2014save for the dog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rollo had climbed out of the stream, and having shaken the water from his fur, was squirming on his back in a patch of crushed turtlehead, tail wagging in pleasure, and clearly oblivious to the silent giant in the cliff above.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? That Rollo wasn\u2019t afraid of it?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye. He didna behave as though there were anything there at all. And yet . . .\u201d He hesitated, darting a glance at her. \u201cSometimes, in the wood. He\u2014he sees things. Things I canna see. Ken?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ken,\u201d she said, a ripple of unease returning. \u201cDogs do see . . . things.\u201d She remembered her own dogs; in particular, Smoky, the big Newfoundland, who would sometimes in the evening suddenly raise his head, listening, hackles rising as his eyes followed . . . something . . . that passed through the room and disappeared.</p><p>He nodded, relieved that she knew what he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cThey do. I ran, when I saw that\u201d\u2014he nodded at the cliff\u2014\u201cand ducked behind a tree. But the dog went on about his business, paying it no mind. And so I thought, well, just maybe it\u2019s no what I think, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cA Rawenniyo, you said?\u201d As the excitement of seeing the mammoth began to recede, she remembered what they were theoretically doing here. \u201cIan\u2014you said what you wanted to show me had to do with your wife. Is this\u2014\u201d She gestured toward the cliff, brows raised.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer directly, but tilted his head back, studying the jut of the giant tusks.</p> <p>\u201cI heard stories, now and then. Among the Mohawk, I mean. They\u2019d speak of strange things that someone found, hunting. Spirits trapped in the rock, and how they came to be there. Evil things, for the most part. And I thought to myself, if that should be what this is . . .\u201d</p><p>He broke off and turned to her, serious and intent.</p><p>\u201cI needed ye to tell me, aye? Whether that\u2019s what it is or no. Because if it was, then perhaps what I\u2019ve been thinking is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut what on earth have you been thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout God,\u201d he said, surprising her again. He licked his lips, unsure how to go on.</p><p>\u201cYeksa\u2019a\u2014the child. I didna have her christened,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldna. Or perhaps I could\u2014ye can do it yourself, ken, if there\u2019s no priest. But I hadna the courage to try. I\u2014never saw her. They\u2019d wrapped her already. . . . They wouldna have liked it, if I\u2019d tried to . . .\u201d His voice died away.</p> <p>\u201cYeksa\u2019a,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWas that your\u2014your daughter\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his mouth twisting wryly.</p><p>\u201cIt only means \u2018wee girl.\u2019 The Kahnyen\u2019kehaka dinna give a name to a child when it\u2019s born. Not until later. If . . .\u201d His voice trailed off, and he cleared his throat. \u201cIf it lives. They wouldna think of naming a child unborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He raised his head and took a breath that had a damp sound to it, like wet bandages pulled from a fresh wound.</p><p>\u201cIseaba\u00ecl,\u201d he said, and she knew it was the first\u2014perhaps would be the only\u2014time he\u2019d spoken it aloud. \u201cHad it been a son, I would ha\u2019 called him Jamie.\u201d He glanced at her, with the shadow of a smile. \u201cOnly in my head, ken.\u201d</p><p>He let out all his breath then with a sigh and put his face down upon his knees, back hunched.</p><p>\u201cWhat I am thinking,\u201d he said after a moment, his voice much too controlled, \u201cis this. Was it me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIan! You mean your fault that the baby died? How could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left,\u201d he said simply, straightening up. \u201cTurned away. Stopped being a Christian, being Scots. They took me to the stream, scrubbed me wi\u2019 sand to take away the white blood. They gave me my name\u2014Okwaho\u2019kenha\u2014and said I was Mohawk. But I wasna, not really.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply again, and she put a hand on his back, feeling the bumps of his backbone press through the leather of his shirt. He didn\u2019t eat nearly enough, she thought.</p><p>\u201cBut I wasna what I had been, either,\u201d he went on, sounding almost matter-of-fact. \u201cI tried to be what they wanted, ken? So I left off praying to God or the Virgin Mother, or Saint Bride. I listened to what Emily said, when she\u2019d tell me about her gods, the spirits that dwell in the trees and all. And when I went to the sweat lodge wi\u2019 the men, or sat by the hearth and heard the stories . . . they seemed as real to me as Christ and His saints ever had.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and looked up at her suddenly, half-bewildered, half-defiant.</p><p>\u201cI am the Lord thy God,\u201d he said. \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before me. But I did, no? That\u2019s mortal sin, is it not?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say no, of course not. Or to protest weakly that she was not a priest, how could she say? But neither of those would do; he was not looking for easy reassurance, and a weak-minded abnegation of responsibility would not serve him.</p><p>She took a deep breath and blew it out. It had been a good many years since she\u2019d been taught the Baltimore Catechism, but it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you forget.</p><p>\u201cThe conditions of mortal sin are these,\u201d she said, reciting the words precisely from memory. \u201cFirst, that the action be grievously wrong. Secondly, that you know the action is wrong. And thirdly\u2014that you give full consent to it.\u201d</p><p>He was watching her intently.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was wrong, and I suppose I kent that\u2014aye, I did ken that. Especially\u2014\u201d His face darkened further, and she wondered what he was recalling.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . how should I serve a God who would take a child for her father\u2019s sins?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he glanced toward the cliff face, where the remains of the mammoth lay frozen in time. \u201cOr was it them? Was it not my God at all, but the Iroquois spirits? Did they ken I wasna really Mohawk\u2014that I held back a part of myself from them?\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her, dead serious.</p><p>\u201cGods are jealous, are they no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan . . .\u201d She swallowed, helpless. But she had to say something.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did\u2014or didn\u2019t do\u2014that wasn\u2019t wrong, Ian,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYour daughter . . . she was half-Mohawk. It wasn\u2019t wrong to let her be buried according to her mother\u2019s ways. Your wife\u2014Emily\u2014she would have been terribly upset, wouldn\u2019t she, if you\u2019d insisted on baptizing the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe. But . . .\u201d He closed his eyes, hands clenched hard into fists on his thighs. \u201cWhere is she, then?\u201d he whispered, and she could see tears trembling on his lashes. \u201cThe others\u2014they were never born; God will have them in His hand. But wee Iseaba\u00ecl\u2014she\u2019ll not be in heaven, will she? I canna bear the thought that she\u2014that she might be . . . lost, somewhere. Wandering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear her, greeting. In the night.\u201d His breath was coming in deep, sobbing gasps. \u201cI canna help, I canna find her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d The tears were running down her own cheeks. She gripped his wrists fiercely, squeezed as hard as she could. \u201cIan, listen to me!\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep, trembling breath, head bent. Then he nodded, very slightly.</p><p>She rose onto her knees and gathered him tight against her, his head cradled on her br**sts. Her cheek pressed against the top of his head, his hair warm and springy against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI had another father. The man who raised me. He\u2019s dead now.\u201d For a long time now, the sense of desolation at his loss had been muted, softened by new love, distracted by new obligations. Now it swept over her, newly fresh, and sharp as a stab wound in its agony. \u201cI know\u2014I know he\u2019s in heaven.\u201d</p><p>Was he? Could he be dead and in heaven, if not yet born? And yet he was dead to her, and surely heaven took no heed of time.</p><p>She lifted her face toward the cliff, but spoke to neither bones nor God.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d she said, and her voice broke on the word, but she held her cousin hard. \u201cDaddy, I need you.\u201d Her voice sounded small, and pathetically unsure. But there was no other help to be had.</p><p>\u201cI need you to find Ian\u2019s little girl,\u201d she said, as firmly as she could, trying to summon her father\u2019s face, to see him there among the shifting leaves at the clifftop. \u201cFind her, please. Hold her in your arms, and make sure that she\u2019s safe. Take\u2014please take care of her.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, feeling obscurely that she should say something else, something more ceremonious. Make the sign of the cross? Say \u201camen\u201d?</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy,\u201d she said softly, and cried as though her father were newly dead, and she bereft, orphaned, lost, and crying in the night. Ian\u2019s arms were wrapped around her, and they clung tight together, squeezing hard, the warmth of the late sun heavy on their heads.</p><p>She stood still within his arms when she stopped crying, her head resting on his shoulder. He patted her back, very gently, but didn\u2019t push her away.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cAre ye all right, Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She straightened and stood away from him, swaying a little, as though she were drunk. She felt drunk, too, her bones gone soft and malleable, everything around her faintly out of focus, save for certain things that caught her eye: a brilliant patch of pink lady\u2019s slipper, a stone fallen from the cliff face, its surface streaked red with iron. Rollo, almost sitting on Ian\u2019s foot, big head pressed anxiously against his master\u2019s thigh.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Ian?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d His hand sought Rollo\u2019s head, and gave the pointed ears a cursory rub of reassurance. \u201cMaybe. Just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre ye . . . are ye sure, Brianna?\u201d</p><p>She knew what he was asking; it was a question of faith. She drew herself up to her full height, wiping her nose on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Roman Catholic and I believe in vitamins,\u201d she declared stoutly. \u201cAnd I knew my father. Of course I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep, sighing breath and his shoulders slumped as he let it out. He nodded then, and the lines of his face relaxed a little.</p><p>She left him sitting on a rock, and made her way down to the stream to splash cold water on her face. The shadow of the cliff fell across the creek and the air was cold with the scents of earth and pine trees. In spite of the chill, she remained there for a while, on her knees.</p><p>She could still hear the voices murmuring in trees and water, but paid no attention to them. Whoever they were, they were no threat to her or hers\u2014and not at odds with the presence that she felt so strongly nearby.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she whispered, closing her eyes, and felt at peace.</p><p>Ian must be better, too, she thought, when she made her way at length back through the rocks to where he sat. Rollo had left him to investigate a promising hole at the foot of a tree, and she knew the dog wouldn\u2019t have left Ian, had he considered his master to be in distress.</p><p>She was about to ask him whether their business here was complete, when he stood up, and she saw that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhy I brought ye here,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI wanted to know about that\u2014\u201d He nodded at the mammoth. \u201cBut I meant to ask ye a question. Advice, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice? Ian, I can\u2019t give you any advice! How could I tell you what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ye\u2019re maybe the only one who can,\u201d he said with a lopsided smile. \u201cYou\u2019re my family, you\u2019re a woman\u2014and ye care for me. Yet ye ken more even than Uncle Jamie, perhaps, because of who\u2014or what\u201d\u2014his mouth twisted a little\u2014\u201cye are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know more,\u201d she said, and looked up at the bones in the rock. \u201cOnly\u2014different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cWe\u2019re no wed\u2014we never shall be.\u201d He looked away for an instant, then back. \u201cBut if we had been marrit, I should have loved ye and cared for ye, so well as I could. I trust you, that ye\u2019d have done the same by me. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d Her throat was still thick, raspy with grief; the words came out in a whisper. She touched his face, cool-skinned and bony, and traced the line of tattooed dots with a thumb. \u201cI love you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said still softly. \u201cI ken that.\u201d He lifted a hand and put it over her own, big and hard. He pressed her palm against his cheek for a moment, then his fingers closed over hers and he brought their linked hands down, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said, his eyes not leaving hers. \u201cIf ye love me, tell me what I shall do. Shall I go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack,\u201d she repeated, searching his face. \u201cBack to the Mohawk, you mean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBack to Emily. She loved me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI ken that. Did I do wrong, to let the old woman send me away? Ought I to go back, maybe fight for her, if I had to? Perhaps see if she would come away wi\u2019 me, back to the Ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d She felt the same sense of helplessness as before, though this time it came without the burden of her own grief. But who was she to tell him anything? How could she be responsible for making that decision for him\u2014for saying to him, stay, or go?</p><p>His eyes stayed steady on her face, though, and it came over her\u2014she was his family. And so the responsibility lay in her hands, whether she felt adequate to it or not.</p><p>Her chest felt tight, as though she might burst if she took a deep breath. She took it anyway.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood looking into her eyes for a long time, his own deep hazel, gold-flecked and serious.</p><p>\u201cYou could fight him\u2014Ahk . . .\u201d She fumbled for the syllables of the Mohawk name. \u201cSun Elk. But you can\u2019t fight her. If she\u2019s made up her mind that she doesn\u2019t want to be with you anymore . . . Ian, you can\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, dark lashes cutting off his gaze, and kept his eyes closed, whether in acknowledgement or denial of what she\u2019d said, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more than that,\u201d she said, her voice growing firmer. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only her, or him. Is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. His voice sounded distant, almost uncaring, but she knew it wasn\u2019t that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them,\u201d she said more softly. \u201cAll the mothers. The grandmothers. The women. The\u2014the children.\u201d Clan and family and tribe and nation; custom, spirit, tradition\u2014the strands that wrapped Works with Her Hands and held her to the earth, secure. And above all, children. Those loud small voices that drowned the voices of the wood, and kept a soul from wandering through the night.</p><p>No one knew the strength of such bonds better than one who had walked the earth without them, outcast and alone. She had, and he had, and they both knew the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them,\u201d he echoed softly, and opened his eyes. They were dark with loss, the color of shadows in the deepest wood. \u201cAnd them.\u201d He turned his head, to look upward, into the trees beyond the creek, above the bones of the mammoth that lay trapped in the earth, stripped to the sky and mute to all prayer. He turned back, raised a hand, and touched her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay, then.\u201d</p><p>THEY CAMPED FOR the night on the far side of the beaver pond. The litter of wood chips and debarked saplings made good kindling for their fire.</p><p>There was little to eat; no more than a hatful of bitter fox-grapes and the heel of bread, so hard by now that it had to be dunked in water to chew. It didn\u2019t matter; neither one of them was hungry, and Rollo had disappeared to hunt for himself.</p><p>They sat silently, watching the fire die down. There was no need to keep it going; the night was not cold, and they would not linger in the morning\u2014home was too near.</p><p>At last, Ian stirred a bit, and Brianna glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your father\u2019s name?\u201d he asked very formally.</p><p>\u201cFrank\u2014er . . . Franklin. Franklin Wolverton Randall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Englishman, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d she said, smiling in spite of herself.</p><p>He nodded, murmuring \u201cFranklin Wolverton Randall\u201d to himself, as though to commit it to memory, then looked at her seriously.</p><p>\u201cIf ever I find myself in a church again, then, I shall light a candle to his memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect . . . he\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and leaned back, back braced against a longleaf pine. The ground nearby was littered with the cones; he picked up a handful and tossed them, one by one, into the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lizzie?\u201d she asked after a little while. \u201cShe\u2019s always been fond of you.\u201d To put it mildly: Lizzie had wilted and pined for weeks, when he had been lost to the Iroquois. \u201cAnd now that she\u2019s not marrying Manfred . . .\u201d</p><p>He tilted back his head, eyes closed, and rested it against the trunk of the pine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but.\u201d He opened his eyes and gave her a wry look. \u201cI\u2019d ken where I was, if I woke beside her. But where I\u2019d be is in bed wi\u2019 my wee sister. I think I\u2019m maybe not so desperate as that. Yet,\u201d he added as an obvious afterthought.</p><p>71</p><p>BLACK PUDDING</p><p>I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF a black pudding when Ronnie Sinclair appeared in the yard, carrying two small whisky casks. Several more were bound in a neatly corrugated cascade down his back, which made him look like some exotic form of caterpillar, balanced precariously upright in mid-pupation. It was a chilly day, but he was sweating freely from the long walk uphill\u2014and cursing in similar vein.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the name of Bride did Himself build the frigging house up here in the godforsaken clouds?\u201d he demanded without ceremony. \u201cWhy not where a bloody wagon could reach the yard?\u201d He set the casks down carefully, then ducked his head through the straps of the harness to shed his wooden carapace. He sighed in relief, rubbing at his shoulders where the straps had dug.</p><p>I ignored the rhetorical questions, and kept stirring, tilting my head toward the house in invitation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s fresh coffee made,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd bannocks with honey, too.\u201d My own stomach recoiled slightly at the thought of eating. Once spiced, stuffed, boiled, and fried, black pudding was delicious. The earlier stages, involving as they did arm-deep manipulations in a barrel of semi-coagulated pig\u2019s blood, were substantially less appetizing.</p><p>Sinclair, though, looked happier at mention of food. He wiped a sleeve across his sweating forehead and nodded to me, turning toward the house. Then he stopped and turned back.</p><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019d forgot, missus. I\u2019ve a wee message for yourself, as well.\u201d He patted gingerly at his chest, then lower, probing around his ribs until he at length found what he was looking for and extracted it from the layers of his sweat-soaked clothing. He pulled out a damp wad of paper and held it out to me in expectation, ignoring the fact that my right arm was coated with blood nearly to the shoulder, and the left in scarcely better case.</p><p>\u201cPut it in the kitchen, why don\u2019t you?\u201d I suggested. \u201cHimself\u2019s inside. I\u2019ll come as soon as I\u2019ve got this lot sorted. Who\u2014\u201d I started to ask whom the letter was from, but tactfully altered this to, \u201cWho gave it to you?\u201d Ronnie couldn\u2019t read\u2014though I saw no marks on the outside of the note, in any case.</p><p>\u201cA tinker on his way to Belem\u2019s Creek handed it to me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didna say who gave it him\u2014only that it was for the healer.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the wadded paper, but I saw his eyes slide sideways toward my legs. In spite of the chill, I was barefoot and stripped to my chemise and stays, no more than a smeared apron wrapped around my waist. Ronnie had been looking for a wife for some little time, and in consequence had formed the unconscious habit of appraising the physical attributes of every woman he encountered, without regard to age or availability. He noticed my noticing, and hastily jerked his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cThat was all?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe healer? He didn\u2019t give my name?\u201d</p><p>Sinclair rubbed a hand through thinning ginger hair, so two spikes stood up over his reddened ears, increasing his naturally sly, foxy look.</p><p>\u201cDidna have to, did he?\u201d Without further attempts at conversation, he disappeared into the house, in search of food and Jamie, leaving me to my sanguinary labors.</p><p>The worst part was cleaning the blood: swishing an arm through the dark, reeking depths of the barrel to collect the threads of fibrin that formed as the blood began to clot. These clung to my arm and could then be pulled out and rinsed away\u2014repeatedly. At that, it was slightly less nasty than the job of washing out the intestines to be used for the sausage casings; Brianna and Lizzie were doing that, down at the creek.</p><p>I peered at the latest results; no fibers visible in the clear red liquid that dripped from my fingers. I dunked my arm again in the water cask that stood beside the blood barrel, balanced on boards laid across a pair of trestles under the big chestnut tree. Jamie and Roger and Arch Bug had dragged the pig\u2014not the white sow, but one of her many offspring from a prior year\u2014into the yard, clubbed it between the eyes with a maul, then swung it up into the branches, slit the throat, and let the blood drain into the barrel.</p><p>Roger and Arch had then taken the disemboweled carcass away to be scalded and the bristles scraped off; Jamie\u2019s presence was required to deal with Major MacDonald, who had appeared suddenly, puffing and wheezing from the climb up to the Ridge. Between the two, I thought Jamie would much have preferred to deal with the pig.</p><p>I finished washing my hands and arms\u2014wasted labor, but necessary to my peace of mind\u2014and dried off with a linen towel. I shoveled double handsful into the barrel from the waiting bowls of barley, oatmeal, and boiled rice, smiling slightly at memory of the Major\u2019s plum-red face, and Ronnie Sinclair\u2019s complaints. Himself had picked his building site on the Ridge with a great deal of forethought\u2014precisely because of the difficulties involved in reaching it.</p><p>I ran my fingers through my hair, then took a deep breath and plunged my clean arm back into the barrel. The blood was cooling rapidly. Doused by the cereal, the smell was less immediate now than the metallic reek of fresh, hot blood. The mixture was still warm to the touch, though, and the grains made graceful swirls of white and brown, pale whirlpools drawn down into the blood as I stirred.</p><p>Ronnie was right; it hadn\u2019t been necessary to identify me further than \u201cthe healer.\u201d There wasn\u2019t another closer than Cross Creek, unless one counted the shamans among the Indians\u2014which most Europeans wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I wondered who had sent the note, and whether the matter was urgent. Probably not\u2014at least it was not likely to be a matter of imminent childbirth or serious accident. Word of such events was likely to arrive in person, carried urgently by a friend or relative. A written message entrusted to a tinker couldn\u2019t be counted on to be delivered with any sort of promptitude; tinkers wandered or stayed, depending on what work they found.</p><p>For that matter, tinkers and tramps seldom came so far as the Ridge, though we had seen three within the last month. I didn\u2019t know whether that was the result of our growing population\u2014Fraser\u2019s Ridge boasted nearly sixty families now, though the cabins were scattered over ten miles of forested mountain slopes\u2014or something more sinister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the signs, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie had told me, frowning after the departing form of the last such temporary guest. \u201cWhen there is war in the air, men take to the roads.\u201d</p><p>I thought he was right; I remembered wanderers on the Highland roads, carrying rumors of the Stuart Rising. It was as though the tremors of unrest jarred loose those who were not firmly attached to a place by love of land or family, and the swirling currents of dissension bore them onward, the first premonitory fragments of a slow-motion explosion that would shatter everything. I shivered, the light breeze touching cold through my shift.</p><p>The mass of gruel had reached the necessary consistency, something like a very thick, dark-red cream. I shook clumps of clotted grain from my fingers and reached with my clean left hand for the wooden bowl of minced and sauteed onions, standing ready. The strong smell of the onions overlaid the scent of butchery, pleasantly domestic.</p><p>The salt was ground, so was the pepper. All I needed now . . . as if on cue, Roger appeared around the corner of the house, a large basin in his hands, filled with fine-chopped pork fat.</p><p>\u201cJust in time!\u201d I said, and nodded toward the barrel. \u201cNo, don\u2019t dump it in, it has to be measured\u2014roughly.\u201d I\u2019d used ten double handsful of oatmeal, ten of rice, ten of barley. Half that total, then\u2014fifteen. I shook back the hair from my eyes again, and carefully scooped up a double handful of the basin\u2019s content, dropping it into the barrel with a splat.</p><p>\u201cAll right, are you?\u201d I asked. I gestured toward a stool with my chin, beginning to work the fat into the mixture with my fingers. Roger was still a trifle pale and tight around the mouth, but he gave me a wry smile as he sat.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d The note of wryness in his voice deepened. \u201cI only wish I\u2019d done it better.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, one-shouldered, and reached into the basin he held out for me.</p><p>\u201cIt takes practice.\u201d</p><p>Roger had volunteered to kill the pig. Jamie had simply handed him the maul and stood back. I had seen Jamie kill pigs before; he said a brief prayer, blessed the pig, then crushed the skull with one tremendous blow. It had taken Roger five tries, and the memory of the squealing raised gooseflesh on my shoulders even now. Afterward, he had set down the maul, gone behind a tree, and been violently sick.</p><p>I scooped another handful. The mix was thickening, developing a greasy feel.</p><p>\u201cHe should have shown you how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think there\u2019s anything technically difficult about it,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cStraightforward enough, after all, to bash an animal on the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically, perhaps,\u201d I agreed. I scooped more fat, working with both hands now. \u201cThere\u2019s a prayer for it, you know. For slaughtering an animal, I mean. Jamie should have told you.\u201d</p><p>He looked faintly startled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d He smiled, a little better now. \u201cLast rites for the pig, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s for the pig\u2019s benefit,\u201d I said tartly. We lapsed into silence for a few moments, as I creamed the rest of the fat into the grain mixture, pausing to flick away occasional bits of gristle. I could feel Roger\u2019s eyes on the barrel, watching the curious alchemy of cookery, that process of making the transfer of life from one being to another palatable.</p><p>\u201cHighland drovers sometimes drain a cup or two of blood from one of their beasts, and mix it with oatmeal to eat on the road,\u201d I said. \u201cNutritious, I suppose, but less tasty.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, abstracted. He had set down the nearly empty basin and was cleaning dried blood from under his nails with the point of his dirk.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same as the one for deer?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe prayer. I\u2019ve seen Jamie say that one, though I didn\u2019t catch all of the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gralloch prayer? I don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d</p><p>Roger worked industriously on a thumbnail, eyes fixed on his hand.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if he thought it right for me to know it. Me not being a Catholic, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I looked down into the mixture, hiding a smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would make a difference. That particular prayer is a lot older than the Church of Rome, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A flicker of interest lit Roger\u2019s face, the buried scholar coming to the surface.</p><p>\u201cI did think the Gaelic was a very old form\u2014even older than what you hear these days\u2014I mean . . . now.\u201d He flushed a little, realizing what he had said. I nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>I remembered what it was like, that feeling that one was living in an elaborate make-believe. The feeling that reality existed in another time, another place. I remembered, and with a small shock, realized that it was now only memory\u2014for me, time had shifted, as though my illness had pushed me through some final barrier.</p><p>Now was my time, reality the scrape of wood and slick of grease beneath my fingers, the arc of the sun that set the rhythm of my days, the nearness of Jamie. It was the other world, of cars and ringing telephones, of alarm clocks and mortgages, that seemed unreal and remote, the stuff of dreams.</p> <p>Neither Roger nor Bree had made that transition, though. I could see it in the way they behaved, hear it in the echoes of their private conversations. Likely it was because they had each other; they could keep the other time alive, a small shared world between them. For me, the change was easier. I had lived here before, had come this time on purpose, after all\u2014and I had Jamie. No matter what I told him of the future, he could never see it as other than a fairy tale. Our small shared world was built of different things.</p><p>I worried now and then about Bree and Roger, though. It was dangerous to treat the past as they sometimes did\u2014as picturesque or curious, a temporary condition that could be escaped. There was no escape for them\u2014whether it was love or duty, Jemmy held them both, a small redheaded anchor to the present. Better\u2014or safer, at least\u2014if they could wholly accept this time as theirs.</p><p>\u201cThe Indians have it, too,\u201d I said to Roger. \u201cThe gralloch prayer, or something like it. That\u2019s why I said I thought it older than the Church.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, interested.</p><p>\u201cI think that kind of thing is common to all primitive cultures\u2014anyplace where men kill to eat.\u201d</p> <p>Primitive cultures. I caught my lower lip between my teeth, forbearing to point out that primitive or not, if his family were to survive, he personally would very likely be obliged to kill for them. But then I caught sight of his hand, idly rubbing at the dried blood between his fingers. He knew that already. \u201cYes, I did,\u201d he\u2019d said, when I\u2019d told him he need not.</p><p>He looked up then, caught my eye, and gave me a faint, tired smile. He understood.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe . . . it\u2019s that killing without ceremony seems like murder,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIf you have the ceremony\u2014some sort of ritual that acknowledges your necessity . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessity\u2014and also sacrifice.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came softly from behind me, startling me. I turned my head sharply. He was standing in the shadow of the big red spruce; I wondered how long he\u2019d been there.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t hear you come out,\u201d I said, turning up my face to be kissed as he came to me. \u201cHas the Major gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and kissed my brow, one of the few clean spots left. \u201cI\u2019ve left him wi\u2019 Sinclair for a bit. He\u2019s exercised about the Committee of Safety, aye?\u201d He grimaced, then turned to Roger.</p> <p>\u201cAye, ye\u2019ve the right of it,\u201d he said. \u201cKilling\u2019s never a pleasant business, but it\u2019s needful. If ye must spill blood, though, it\u2019s right to take it wi\u2019 thanks.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, glancing at the mixture I was working, up to my elbows in spilled blood.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll tell me the proper words for the next time, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too late for this time, is it?\u201d I said. Both men looked slightly startled. I raised an eyebrow at Jamie, then Roger. \u201cI did say it wasn\u2019t for the pig.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes met mine with a glint of humor, but he nodded gravely.</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>At my direction, he took up the heavy jar of spices: the ground mixture of mace and marjoram, sage and pepper, parsley and thyme. Roger held out his hands, cupped, and Jamie poured them full. Then Roger rubbed the herbs slowly between his palms, showering the dusty, greenish crumbs into the barrel, their pungent scent mingling with the smell of the blood, as Jamie spoke the words slowly, in an ancient tongue come down from the days of the Norsemen.</p><p>\u201cSay it in English,\u201d I said, seeing from Roger\u2019s face that while he spoke the words, he did not recognize them all.</p> <p>\u201cO Lord, bless the blood and the flesh of this the creature that You gave me,\u201d Jamie said softly. He scooped a pinch of the herbs himself, and rubbed them between thumb and forefinger, in a rain of fragrant dust.</p><p>\u201cCreated by Your hand as You created man,</p><p>Life given for life.</p><p>That me and mine may eat with thanks for the gift,</p><p>That me and mine may give thanks for Your own sacrifice of blood and flesh,</p><p>Life given for life.\u201d</p><p>The last crumbs of green and gray disappeared into the mixture under my hands, and the ritual of the sausage was complete.</p><p>\u201cTHAT WAS GOOD OF YE, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, drying my clean, wet hands and arms with the towel afterward. He nodded toward the corner of the house, where Roger had disappeared to help with the rest of the butchering, looking somewhat more peaceful. \u201cI did think to tell him before, but I couldna see how to do it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and moved close to him. It was a cold, windy day, and now that I had stopped working, the chill drove me closer to seek his warmth. He wrapped his arms around me, and I felt both the reassuring heat of his embrace, and the soft crackle of paper inside his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a bittie letter Sinclair\u2019s brought,\u201d he said, drawing back a bit to reach into his shirt. \u201cI didna want to open it while Donald was there, and didna trust him not to be reading it when I went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your letter, anyway,\u201d I said, taking the smudged wad of paper from him. \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is it? Sinclair didna say, just handed it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would!\u201d Not unusually, Ronnie Sinclair viewed me\u2014all women, for that matter\u2014as simply a minor appendage of a husband. I rather pitied the woman he might eventually induce to marry him.</p><p>I unfolded the note with some difficulty; it had been worn so long next to sweaty skin that the edges had frayed and stuck together.</p><p>The message inside was brief and cryptic, but unsettling. It had been scratched into the paper with something like a sharpened stick, using an ink that looked disturbingly like dried blood, though it was more likely berry juice.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say, Sassenach?\u201d Seeing me frowning at the paper, Jamie moved to the side to look. I held it out to him.</p><p>Far down, in one corner, scratched in faint and tiny letters, as though the sender had hoped by this means to escape notice, was the word \u201cFaydree.\u201d Above, in bolder scratchings, the message read</p><p>YU</p><p>CUM</p><p>\u201cIT MUST BE HER,\u201d I said, shivering as I drew my shawl closer. It was cold in the surgery, despite the small brazier glowing in the corner, but Ronnie Sinclair and MacDonald were in the kitchen, drinking cider and waiting while the sausages boiled. I spread the note open on my surgery table, its minatory summons dark and peremptory above the timid signature. \u201cLook. Who else could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe canna write, surely?\u201d Jamie objected. \u201cThough I suppose it might be that someone wrote it for her,\u201d he amended, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo, she could have written this, I think.\u201d Brianna and Roger had come into the surgery, too; Bree reached out and touched the ragged paper, one long finger gently tracing the staggered letters. \u201cI taught her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Jamie looked surprised. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I stayed at River Run. When you and Mama went to find Roger.\u201d Her wide mouth pressed thin for a moment; it wasn\u2019t an occasion she wished much to remember.</p><p>\u201cI taught her the alphabet; I meant to teach her to read and write. We did all the letters\u2014she knew how they sounded, and she could draw them. But then one day she said she couldn\u2019t anymore, and she wouldn\u2019t sit down with me.\u201d She glanced up, a troubled frown between her thick, red brows. \u201cI thought maybe Aunt Jocasta found out, and stopped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore likely Ulysses. Jocasta would have stopped you, lass.\u201d Jamie\u2019s frown matched hers as he glanced at me. \u201cYe do think it\u2019s Phaedre, then? My aunt\u2019s body slave?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, and bit one corner of my lip in doubt.</p><p>\u201cThe slaves at River Run do say her name like that\u2014Faydree. And I certainly don\u2019t know anyone else by that name.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had questioned Ronnie Sinclair\u2014casually, to give no occasion for alarm or gossip\u2014but the cooper knew no more than he had told me: the note had been handed to him by a tinker, with the simple direction that it was \u201cfor the healer.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over the table, lifting a candle high to look at the note once more. The \u201cF\u201d of the signature had been made with a hesitant, repeated stroke\u2014more than one try before the writer had committed herself to signing it. The more evidence, I thought, of its origin. I didn\u2019t know whether it was against the law in North Carolina to teach a slave to read or write, but it was certainly discouraged. While there were marked exceptions\u2014slaves educated to their owners\u2019 ends, like Ulysses himself\u2014it was on the whole a dangerous skill, and one a slave would go some way to conceal.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have risked sending word like this, unless it was a serious matter,\u201d Roger said. He stood behind Bree, one hand on her shoulder, looking down at the note she held flattened on the table. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from your aunt lately?\u201d I asked Jamie, but I knew the answer before he shook his head. Any word from River Run that reached the Ridge would have been a matter of public knowledge within hours.</p><p>We had not gone to the Gathering at Mt. Helicon this year; there was too much to do on the Ridge and Jamie wished to avoid the heated politics involved. Still, Jocasta and Duncan had meant to be there. Anything wrong would surely have been a matter of general gossip, which would have reached us long since.</p><p>\u201cSo it is not only serious, but a private matter to the slave, too,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cOtherwise, my aunt would have written, or Duncan sent word.\u201d His two stiff fingers tapped once, softly, against his thigh.</p><p>We stood around the table, staring at the note as though it were a small white slab of dyn**ite. The scent of boiling sausages filled the cold air, warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Roger asked, looking up at me. \u201cDo you think it might be a medical matter? If she were ill, say\u2014or pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot illness,\u201d I said. \u201cToo urgent.\u201d It was a week\u2019s ride to River Run at least\u2014in good weather, and barring accident. Heaven knew how long it had taken the note to make its way up to Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p><p>\u201cBut if she was pregnant? Maybe.\u201d Brianna pursed her lips, still frowning at the paper. \u201cI think she thinks of Mama as a friend. She\u2019d tell you before she\u2019d tell Aunt Jocasta, I think.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but reluctantly. Friendship was too strong a word; people situated as Phaedre and I could not be friends. Liking was constrained by too many things\u2014suspicion, mistrust, the vast chasm of difference that slavery imposed.</p><p>And yet there was a certain feeling of sympathy between us, that much was true. I had worked with her, side by side, planting herbs and harvesting them, making simples for the stillroom, explaining their uses. We had buried a dead girl together and plotted to protect a runaway slave accused of her murder. She had a certain talent with the sick, did Phaedre, and some knowledge of herbs. Any minor matter, she could deal with herself. But something like an unexpected pregnancy . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat does she think I could do, though, I wonder?\u201d I was thinking out loud, and my fingertips felt cold in contemplation. An unexpected child born to a slave would be of no concern to an owner\u2014to the contrary, it would be welcomed as additional property; but I had heard stories of slave women who killed a child at birth, rather than have the babe brought up in slavery. Phaedre was a house slave, though, well-treated, and Jocasta did not separate slave families, I knew that. If it were that, Phaedre\u2019s situation was surely not so dire\u2014and yet, who was I to judge?</p><p>I blew out a cloud of smoky breath, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t see why\u2014I mean, she couldn\u2019t possibly expect that I\u2019d help her to get rid of a child. And for anything else . . . why me? There are midwives and healers much closer. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d Brianna said, and stopped. She pursed her lips in speculation, looking from me to Jamie and back. \u201cWhat if,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cshe was pregnant, but the father was . . . someone it shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d</p><p>A wary but humorous speculation sprang up in Jamie\u2019s eyes, increasing the resemblance between him and Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWho, lass?\u201d he said. \u201cFarquard Campbell?\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud at the thought, and Brianna snorted with mirth, white wisps of breath floating round her head. The notion of the very upright\u2014and quite elderly\u2014Farquard Campbell seducing a house slave was . . .</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cThough he does have all those children. But I just thought suddenly\u2014what if it was Duncan?\u201d</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat, and avoided catching my eye. I bit my lip, feeling my face start to go red. Duncan had confessed his chronic impotence to Jamie before Duncan\u2019s wedding to Jocasta\u2014but Brianna didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldna think it likely,\u201d Jamie said, sounding a trifle choked. He coughed, and fanned smoke from the brazier away from his face. \u201cWhat gives ye that notion, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about Duncan,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut Aunt Jocasta is\u2014well, old. And you know what men can be like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d asked Roger blandly, making me cough with the effort to suppress a laugh.</p><p>Jamie eyed her with a certain amount of cynicism.</p><p>\u201cA good deal better than you do, a nighean. And while I wouldna wager much on some men, I think I should feel safe in laying odds that Duncan Innes isna the man to be breaking his marriage vows with his wife\u2019s black slave.\u201d</p><p>I made a small noise, and Roger lifted one eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, sounding strangled. \u201cJust\u2014fine.\u201d I put a corner of the shawl over my no-doubt purple face and coughed ostentatiously. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . smoky in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Brianna conceded, addressing Jamie. \u201cIt might not be that at all. It\u2019s just that Phaedre sent the note to \u2018the healer,\u2019 probably because she didn\u2019t want to use Mama\u2019s name, in case anybody saw the note before it got here. I just thought, maybe it wasn\u2019t really Mama she wants\u2014maybe it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>That sobered both Jamie and me, and we glanced at each other. It was a definite possibility, and one that hadn\u2019t occurred to either of us.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t send a note direct to you without rousing all kinds of curiosity,\u201d Bree went on, frowning at the note. \u201cBut she could say \u2018the healer\u2019 without putting a name on it. And she\u2019d know that if Mama came, you\u2019d probably come with her, at this time of year. Or if you didn\u2019t, Mama could send for you openly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thought,\u201d Jamie said slowly. \u201cBut why in God\u2019s name might she want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d said Roger, practical. He looked at Jamie. \u201cMost of the outside work is done; the crops and the hay are in, the slaughtering\u2019s finished. We can manage here, if you want to go.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood still for a moment, frowning in thought, then crossed to the window and raised the sash. A cold wind blew into the room, and Bree pinned the fluttering note to the table to keep it from taking wing. The coals in the small brazier smoked and flamed higher, and the bunches of dried herbs rustled uneasily overhead.</p><p>Jamie thrust his head out the window and breathed in deeply, eyes closed like one savoring the bouquet of fine wine.</p><p>\u201cCold and clear,\u201d he announced, drawing in his head and closing the window. \u201cClear weather for three days, at least. We could be off the mountain by that time, and we ride briskly.\u201d He smiled at me; the tip of his nose was red with the cold. \u201cIn the meantime, d\u2019ye think those sausages are ready yet?\u201d</p><p>72</p><p>BETRAYALS</p><p>A SLAVE I DIDN\u2019T RECOGNIZE opened the door to us, a broad-built woman in a yellow turban. She eyed us severely, but Jamie gave her no chance to speak, pushing rudely past her into the hall.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Mrs. Cameron\u2019s nephew,\u201d I felt obliged to explain to her, as I followed him.</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she muttered, in a lilt that came from Barbados. She glared after him, making it evident that she detected a family resemblance in terms of high-handedness, as well as physique.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his wife,\u201d I added, overcoming the reflexive urge to shake her hand, and bowing slightly instead. \u201cClaire Fraser. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, disconcerted, but before she could reply, I had whisked past her, following Jamie toward the small drawing room where Jocasta was inclined to sit in the afternoons.</p><p>The door to the drawing room was closed, and as Jamie set his hand on the knob, a sharp yelp came from inside\u2014the prelude to a barrage of frenzied barking as the door swung wide.</p><p>Stopped in his tracks, Jamie paused, hand on the door, frowning at the small brown bundle of fur that leaped to and fro at his feet, eyes bulging in hysteria as it barked its head off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he said, edging his way into the room as the creature made abortive dashes at his boots, still yapping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wee dog, what d\u2019ye think?\u201d Jocasta said acerbically. She lifted herself from her chair, frowning in the direction of the noise. \u201cSheas, Samson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamson? Oh, to be sure. The hair.\u201d Smiling despite himself, Jamie squatted and extended a closed fist toward the dog. Throttling back to a low growl, the dog extended a suspicious nose toward his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Delilah?\u201d I asked, edging into the room behind him.</p><p>\u201cAh, ye\u2019ve come, as well, Claire?\u201d Jocasta\u2019s face swiveled in my direction, lit by a smile. \u201cA rare treat, to have the both of ye. I dinna suppose Brianna or the bittie lad have come along\u2014no, I would have heard them.\u201d Dismissing that, she sat down again, and waved toward the hearth.</p><p>\u201cAs for Delilah, the lazy creature\u2019s asleep by the fire; I can hear her snoring.\u201d</p><p>Delilah was a large whitish hound of indeterminate breed but plentiful skin; it drooped around her in folds of relaxation as she lay on her back, paws curled over a freckled belly. Hearing her name, she snorted briefly, opened one eye a crack, then closed it again.</p><p>\u201cI see ye\u2019ve had a few changes since I was last here,\u201d Jamie observed, rising to his feet. \u201cWhere is Duncan? And Ulysses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone. Looking for Phaedre.\u201d Jocasta had lost weight; the high MacKenzie cheekbones stood out sharp, and her skin looked thin and creased.</p><p>\u201cLooking for her?\u201d Jamie glanced sharply at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s become of the lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun away.\u201d She spoke with her usual self-possession, but her voice was bleak.</p><p>\u201cRun away? But\u2014are you sure?\u201d Her workbox had been upset, the contents spilled on the floor. I knelt and began to tidy the confusion, picking up the scattered reels of thread.</p><p>\u201cWeel, she\u2019s gone,\u201d Jocasta said with some acerbity. \u201cEither she\u2019s run, or someone\u2019s stolen her. And I canna think who would have the gall or the skill to snatch her from my house, and no one seeing.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged a quick glance with Jamie, who shook his head, frowning. Jocasta was rubbing a fold of her skirt between thumb and forefinger; I could see small worn spots in the nap of the fabric near her hand, where she had done it repeatedly. Jamie saw it, too.</p><p>\u201cWhen did she go, Auntie?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cFour weeks past. Duncan and Ulysses have been gone for two.\u201d</p><p>That fitted well enough with the arrival of the note. No telling how long before her disappearance the note had actually been written, given the vagaries of delivery.</p><p>\u201cI see Duncan took pains to leave ye some company,\u201d Jamie observed. Samson had abandoned his watchdog role, and was sniffing assiduously at Jamie\u2019s boots. Delilah rolled onto her side with a luxurious groan and opened two luminous brown eyes, through which she regarded me with utmost tranquillity.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, they\u2019re that.\u201d Half-grudgingly, Jocasta leaned out from her chair and located the hound\u2019s head, scratching behind the long, floppy ears. \u201cThough Duncan meant them for my protection, or so he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sensible precaution,\u201d Jamie said mildly. It was; we had had no further word of Stephen Bonnet, nor had Jocasta heard the voice of the masked man again. But lacking the concrete reassurance of a corpse, either one could presumably pop up at any time.</p><p>\u201cWhy would the lassie run, Aunt?\u201d Jamie asked. His tone was still mild, but persistent.</p><p>Jocasta shook her head, lips compressed.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken at all, Nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened of late? Nothing out of the ordinary?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cDo ye not think I should have said at once?\u201d she asked sharply. \u201cNo. I woke late one morning, and couldna hear her about my room. There was nay tea by my bed, and the fire had gone out; I could smell the ashes. I called for her, and there was no answer. Gone, she was\u2014vanished without a trace.\u201d She tilted her head toward him with a grim sort of \u201cso there\u201d expression.</p><p>I raised a brow at Jamie and touched the pocket I wore at my waist, containing the note. Ought we to tell her?</p><p>He nodded, and I drew the note from my pocket, unfolding it on the arm of her chair, as he explained.</p><p>Jocasta\u2019s look of displeasure faded into one of puzzled astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhyever should she send for you, a nighean?\u201d she asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014perhaps she was with child?\u201d I suggested. \u201cOr had contracted a\u2014disease of some sort?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to suggest syphilis openly, but it was a possibility. If Manfred had infected Mrs. Sylvie, and she had then passed the infection on to one or more of her customers in Cross Creek, who then had visited River Run . . . but that would mean, perhaps, that Phaedre had had some kind of relationship with a white man. That was something a slave woman would go to great lengths to keep secret.</p><p>Jocasta, no fool, was rapidly coming to similar conclusions, though her thoughts ran parallel to mine.</p><p>\u201cA child, that would be no great matter,\u201d she said, flicking a hand. \u201cBut if she had a lover . . . aye,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cShe might have gone off with a lover. But then, why send for you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie was growing restive, impatient with so much unprovable speculation.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she might think ye meant to sell her, Aunt, if ye discovered such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sell her?\u201d</p><p>Jocasta broke out laughing. Not her usual social laughter, nor even the sound of genuine amusement; this was shocking\u2014loud and crude, almost vicious in its hilarity. It was her brother Dougal\u2019s laugh, and the blood ran momentarily cold in my veins.</p><p>I glanced at Jamie, to find him looking down at her, face gone blank. Not in puzzlement; it was the mask he wore to hide strong feeling. So he\u2019d heard that grisly echo, too.</p><p>She seemed unable to stop. Her hands clutched the carved arms of her chair and she leaned forward, face turning red, gasping for breath between those unnerving deep guffaws.</p><p>Delilah rolled onto her belly and uttered a low \u201cwuff\u201d of unease, looking anxiously round, unsure what the matter was, but convinced that something wasn\u2019t right. Samson had backed under the settee, growling.</p><p>Jamie reached out and took her by the shoulder\u2014not gently.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Aunt,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019re frightening your wee dogs.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, abruptly. There was no sound but the faint wheeze of her breathing, nearly as unnerving as the laughter. She sat still, bolt upright in her chair, hands on the arms, the blood ebbing slowly from her face and her eyes gone dark and bright, fixed as though on something that only she could see.</p><p>\u201cSell her,\u201d she murmured, and her mouth creased as though the laughter were about to break out of her again. She didn\u2019t laugh, though, but stood up suddenly. Samson yapped once, in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She was through the door before either of us could say anything. Jamie lifted an eyebrow at me, but motioned me through the door before him.</p><p>She knew the house intimately; she made her way down the hall toward the door to the stables with no more than an occasional touch of the wall to keep her bearings, walking as fast as though she could see. Outside, though, she paused, feeling with one extended foot for the edge of the brick-laid path.</p><p>Jamie stepped up beside her and took her firmly by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhere d\u2019ye wish to go?\u201d he asked, a certain resignation in his tone.</p><p>\u201cTo the carriage barn.\u201d The peculiar laughter had left her, but her face was still flushed, her strong chin lifted with an air of defiance. Who was she defying? I wondered.</p><p>The carriage barn was shadowed and tranquil, dust motes drifting gold in the stir of air from the opened doors. A wagon, a carriage, a sledge, and the elegant two-wheeled trap sat like large, placid beasts on the straw-covered floor. I glanced at Jamie, whose mouth curled slightly as he looked at me; we had taken temporary refuge in that carriage, during the chaos of Jocasta\u2019s wedding to Duncan, almost four years before.</p><p>Jocasta paused in the doorway, one hand braced on the jamb and breathing deeply, as though orienting herself. She made no move to enter the barn herself, though, but instead nodded toward the depths of the building.</p><p>\u201cAlong the back wall, an mhic mo peather. There are boxes there; I want the large chest made of wickerwork, the one as high as your knee, with a rope tied round it.\u201d</p><p>I had not really noticed during our earlier excursion into the carriage barn, but the back wall was stacked high with boxes, crates, and bundles, piled two and three deep. With such explicit direction, though, Jamie made short work of finding the desired container, and dragged it out into the light, covered with dust and bits of straw.</p><p>\u201cShall I carry it into the house for ye, Auntie?\u201d he asked, rubbing a finger under a twitching nose.</p><p>She shook her head, stooping and feeling for the knot of the rope that bound it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I shallna have it the house. I swore I should not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d I laid a hand on hers to still her fumbling, then took charge of the knot myself. Whoever had tied it had been thorough, but not skilled; I had it loose within a minute, and the catch undone.</p><p>The wicker chest was filled with pictures. Bundles of loose drawings, done in pencil, ink, and charcoal, neatly tied with faded ribbons of colored silk. Several bound sketchbooks. And a number of paintings: a few large unframed squares, and two smaller boxes of miniatures, all framed, stacked on edge like a deck of cards.</p><p>I heard Jocasta sigh, above me, and looked up. She stood still, eyes closed, and I could tell that she was inhaling deeply, breathing in the smell of the pictures\u2014the smell of oils and charcoal, gesso, paper, canvas, linseed and turpentine, a full-bodied ghost that floated out of its wicker casket, transparently vivid against the background scents of straw and dust, wood and wicker.</p><p>Her fingers curled, thumb rubbing against the tips of her other fingers, unconsciously rolling a brush between them. I had seen Bree do that, now and then, looking at something she wanted to paint. Jocasta sighed again, then opened her eyes and knelt down beside me, reaching in to run her fingers lightly over the cache of buried art, searching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe oils,\u201d she said. \u201cFetch those out.\u201d</p><p>I had already taken out the boxes of miniatures. Jamie squatted on the other side of the casket, lifting the bundles of loose drawings and the sketchbooks, so that I could pull out the larger oils, laid on edge along the side of the container.</p><p>\u201cA portrait,\u201d she said, head on one side to listen to the flat, hollow sound as I laid each one against the side of the wicker box. \u201cAn old man.\u201d</p><p>It was plain which one she meant. Two of the large canvases were landscapes, three, portraits. I recognized Farquard Campbell, much younger than his present age, and what must be a self-portrait of Jocasta herself, done perhaps twenty years before. I had no time to look at these, though, interesting as they were.</p> <p>The third portrait looked to have been done much more recently than the others, and showed the effects of Jocasta\u2019s failing eyesight.</p><p>The edges were blurred, the colors muddy, shapes just slightly distorted, so that the elderly gentleman who looked out of the clouded oil seemed somehow disturbing, as though he belonged to some race not quite human, in spite of the orthodoxy of his wig and high white stock.</p><p>He wore a black coat and waistcoat, old-fashioned in style, with the folds of a tartan plaid draped over his shoulder, caught up with a brooch whose golden gleam was echoed by the ornamental knurl atop the dirk the old man held, his fingers bent and gnarled with arthritis. I recognized that dirk.</p><p>\u201cSo that is Hector Cameron.\u201d Jamie recognized it, too. He looked at the painting with fascination.</p><p>Jocasta reached out a hand, touching the surface of the paint as though to identify it by touch.</p> <p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s him,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cNever saw him in life, did ye, Nephew?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOnce perhaps\u2014but I was nay more than a babe at the time.\u201d His gaze traced the old man\u2019s features with deep interest, as though looking for clues to Hector Cameron\u2019s character. Such clues were evident; the man\u2019s force of personality fairly vibrated from the canvas.</p><p>He had strong bones, the man in the portrait, though the flesh hung from them in the infirmity of age. The eyes were still sharp, but one was half-closed\u2014it might have been only a drooping eyelid caused by a small stroke, but the impression was that of an habitual manner of looking at the world; one eye always narrowed in cynical appraisal.</p><p>Jocasta was searching through the contents of the chest, fingers darting lightly here and there, like hunting moths. She touched one box of miniatures, and lifted it with a small grunt of satisfaction.</p><p>She ran a finger slowly along the edge of each miniature, and I saw that the frames were patterned differently; squares and ovals, smooth gilded wood, tarnished silver laid in a rope border, another studded with tiny rosettes. She found one she recognized, and plucked it from the box, handing it absently to me as she went back to her search.</p> <p>The miniature was also of Hector Cameron\u2014but this portrait done many years before the other. Dark wavy hair lay loose on his shoulders, a small ornamental braid down one side sporting two grouse\u2019s feathers, in the ancient Highland style. The same solid bones were there, but the flesh was firm; he had been handsome, Hector Cameron.</p><p>It was an habitual expression; whether by inclination or accident of birth, the right eye was narrowed here, as well, though not as much as in the older portrait.</p><p>My scrutiny was interrupted by Jocasta, who laid a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cIs this the lass?\u201d she asked, thrusting another of the miniatures at me.</p><p>I took it, puzzled, and gasped when I turned it over. It was Phaedre, done when the girl was in her early teens. Her usual cap was missing; she wore a simple kerchief bound over her hair that threw the bones of her face into bold relief. Hector Cameron\u2019s bones.</p><p>Jocasta nudged the box of paintings with her foot.</p><p>\u201cGive those to your daughter, Nephew. Tell her to paint them over\u2014it would be shame to waste the canvas.\u201d Without waiting for response, she set off back toward the house alone, hesitating only briefly at the fork in the path, steering by scent and memory.</p><p>THERE WAS A PROFOUND silence in the wake of Jocasta\u2019s departure, broken only by the singing of a mockingbird in a nearby pine.</p> <p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d Jamie said at last, taking his eyes off the figure of his aunt as she vanished into the house, alone. He didn\u2019t look shocked, so much as deeply bemused. \u201cDid the girl know, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly,\u201d I said. \u201cThe slaves would surely have known; some must have been here when she was born; they\u2019d have told her, if she wasn\u2019t quick enough to have worked it out herself\u2014and I certainly think she is.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and leaned back against the wall of the carriage house, looking meditatively down his long nose at the wicker chest of paintings. I felt a strong reluctance to go back to the house, myself. The buildings were beautiful, a mellow gold in the late-fall sun, and the grounds were peaceful, well-ordered. The sound of cheerful voices came from the kitchen garden, several horses grazed contentedly in the paddock nearby, and far away down the distant silver river, a small boat came down, a four-oared piretta, its oars stroking the surface, brisk and graceful as a water strider.</p><p>\u201cWhere every prospect pleases, and only man is vile,\u201d I remarked. Jamie gave me a brief glance of incomprehension, then returned to his thoughts.</p><p>So Jocasta would by no means sell Phaedre, and thought Phaedre knew it. I wondered exactly why. Because she felt some duty to the girl, as the child of her husband? Or as a subtle form of revenge on that long-dead husband, keeping his illegitimate daughter as a slave, a body servant? I supposed that the two were not entirely exclusive, come to that\u2014I had known Jocasta long enough to realize that her motives were rarely simple.</p><p>There was a chill in the air, with the sun low in the sky. I leaned against the carriage house beside Jamie, feeling the stored warmth of the sun soak from its bricks into my body, and wished that we could step into the old farm wagon and drive posthaste back to the Ridge, leaving River Run to deal with its own legacies of bitterness.</p><p>But the note was in my pocket, crackling when I moved. YU CUM. Not an appeal I could dismiss. But I had come\u2014and now what?</p><p>Jamie straightened suddenly, looking toward the river. I looked, too, and saw that the boat had drawn into the dock there. A tall figure sprang up onto the dock, then turned to help another out of the boat. The second man was shorter, and moved in an odd fashion, off-kilter and out of rhythm.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d I said at once, seeing this. \u201cAnd Ulysses. They\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jamie said, taking my arm and starting toward the house. \u201cBut they havena found her.\u201d</p><p>RUNAWAY or STOLEN on the 31st of October, a Negro Wench, twenty-two years of Age, above middling Height and comely in Appearance, with a Scar on the left Forearm in the shape of an Oval, caused by a Burn. Dressed in an indigo Gown, with a green-striped Apron, white Cap, brown Stockings, and leather Shoes. No missing Teeth. Known by the Name of \u201cFAYDREE.\u201d Communicate Particulars to D. Innes, River Run Plantation, in the vicinity of Cross Creek. Substantial Reward will be paid for good Information.</p><p>I smoothed the crumpled broadsheet, which also sported a crude drawing of Phaedre, looking vaguely cross-eyed. Duncan had emptied his pockets and dropped a handful of these sheets on the table in the hall when he had come in the afternoon before, exhausted and dispirited. They had, he said, posted the bills in every tavern and public house between Campbelton and Wilmington, making inquiries as they went\u2014but to no avail. Phaedre had vanished like the dew.</p><p>\u201cMay I have the marmalade, please?\u201d Jamie and I were taking breakfast alone, neither Jocasta nor Duncan having appeared this morning. I was enjoying it, despite the gloomy atmosphere. Breakfast at River Run was normally a lavish affair, extending even to a pot of real tea\u2014Jocasta must be paying her pet smuggler an absolute fortune for it; there was none to be found between Virginia and Georgia, to the best of my knowledge.</p><p>Jamie was frowning at another of the broadsheets, deep in thought. He didn\u2019t take his eyes off it, but his hand roamed vaguely over the table, settled on the cream jug, and passed it across to me.</p><p>Ulysses, showing little sign of his long journey beyond a certain heaviness of the eyes, stepped silently forward, took the cream jug, replaced it neatly, and set the pot of marmalade beside my plate.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and he graciously inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cWill you require further bloaters, madam?\u201d he inquired. \u201cOr more ham?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my mouth being full of toast, and he glided off, picking up a loaded tray by the door, this presumably intended for Jocasta, Duncan, or both.</p><p>Jamie watched him go, with a sort of abstracted expression.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking, Sassenach,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI would never have guessed it,\u201d I assured him. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>He looked momentarily surprised, but then smiled, realizing.</p><p>\u201cYe kent what I told ye, Sassenach, about Brianna and the widow McCallum? That she wouldna scruple long to act, if Roger Mac were to be taking heed where he shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded, as though verifying something to himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, the lass comes by it honestly enough. The MacKenzies of Leoch are proud as Lucifer, all of them, and black jealous with it. Ye dinna want to cross one\u2014still less to betray one.\u201d</p><p>I regarded him warily over my cup of tea, wondering where this was leading.</p><p>\u201cI thought their defining trait was charm, allied with cunning. And as for betrayal, both your uncles were past hands at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two go together, do they not?\u201d he asked, reaching across to dip a spoon in the marmalade. \u201cYe must beguile someone before ye can betray them, no? And I am inclined to think that a man who would betray is all the quicker to resent betrayal himself. Or a woman,\u201d he added delicately.</p><p>\u201cOh, really,\u201d I said, sipping with pleasure. \u201cJocasta, you mean.\u201d Put in those terms, I could see it. The MacKenzies of Leoch had powerful personalities\u2014I did wonder what Jamie\u2019s maternal grandfather, the notorious Red Jacob, had been like\u2014and I\u2019d noted small commonalities of behavior between Jocasta and her elder brothers before.</p><p>Colum and Dougal had had an unshakable loyalty to each other\u2014but to no one else. And Jocasta was essentially alone, separated from her family since her first marriage at fifteen. Being a woman, it was natural that the charm should be more apparent in her\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean the cunning wasn\u2019t there. Nor yet the jealousy, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cWell, plainly she knew that Hector betrayed her\u2014and I do wonder whether she painted that portrait of Phaedre as a means of indicating to the world at large that she knew it, or merely as a private message to Hector\u2014but what has that got to do with the present situation?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot Hector,\u201d he said. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, absolutely open-mouthed. All other considerations aside, Duncan was impotent; he had told Jamie so, on the eve of his wedding to Jocasta. Jamie smiled crookedly, and reaching across the table, put a thumb under my chin and pushed my mouth gently shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thought, Sassenach, is all I\u2019m saying. But I think I must go and have a word wi\u2019 the man. Will ye come?\u201d</p><p>DUNCAN WAS IN the small room he used as a private office, tucked away above the stables, along with the tiny rooms that housed the grooms and stable-lads. He was slumped in a chair, looking hopelessly at the untidy stacks of papers and undusted ledgers that had accumulated on every horizontal surface.</p><p>He looked desperately tired, and a great deal older than when I had last seen him, at Flora MacDonald\u2019s barbecue. His gray hair was thinning, and when he turned to greet us, the light of the sun shone across his face, and I saw the thin line of the harelip scar Roger had mentioned, hidden in the luxuriant growth of his mustache.</p><p>Something vital seemed to have gone out of him, and when Jamie delicately broached the subject upon which we had come, he made no attempt at all to deny it. In fact, he seemed glad, rather than otherwise, to have it out.</p><p>\u201cYe did lie wi\u2019 the lass, then, Duncan?\u201d Jamie asked directly, wanting to have the fact established.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cI should have liked to, o\u2019 course\u2014but what wi\u2019 her sleeping in Jo\u2019s dressing room . . .\u201d At this reference to his wife, his face flushed a deep, unhealthy red.</p><p>\u201cI mean, ye\u2019ve had carnal knowledge of the woman, have ye not?\u201d Jamie said, keeping a grip on his patience.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He gulped. \u201cAye. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked bluntly.</p><p>The flush deepened, to such a degree that I feared he might have an apoplexy on the spot. He breathed like a grampus for a bit, though, and finally, his complexion began to fade back to something like normal.</p><p>\u201cShe fed me,\u201d he said at last, rubbing a hand tiredly across his eyes. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta rose late and breakfasted in her sitting room, attended by Ulysses, to make plans for the day. Duncan, who had risen before dawn every day of his life, usually in the expectation of a dry crust or at most, a bit of drammach\u2014oatmeal mixed with water\u2014woke now to find a steaming pot of tea beside his bed, accompanied by a bowl of creamy parritch, liberally garnished with honey and cream, toast drenched in butter, eggs fried with ham.</p><p>\u201cSometimes a wee fish, rolled in cornmeal, crisp and sweet,\u201d he added, with mournful reminiscence.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s verra seductive, to be sure, Duncan,\u201d Jamie said, not without sympathy. \u201cA man\u2019s vulnerable when he\u2019s hungry.\u201d He gave me a wry glance. \u201cBut still . . .\u201d</p><p>Duncan had been grateful to Phaedre for her kindness, and had\u2014being a man, after all\u2014admired her beauty, though in a purely disinterested sort of way, he assured us.</p><p>\u201cTo be sure,\u201d Jamie said with marked skepticism. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Duncan had dropped the butter, was the answer, whilst struggling to butter his toast one-handed. Phaedre had hastened to retrieve the pieces of the fallen dish, and then hurried to fetch a cloth and wipe the streaks of butter from the floor\u2014and then from Duncan\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was in my nightshirt,\u201d he murmured, starting to go red again. \u201cAnd she was\u2014she had\u2014\u201d His hand rose and made vague motions in the vicinity of his chest, which I took to indicate that Phaedre\u2019s bodice had displayed her bosom to particular advantage while in such close proximity to him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jamie prompted ruthlessly.</p><p>And, it appeared, Duncan\u2019s anatomy had taken note of the fact\u2014a circumstance admitted with such strangulated modesty that we could barely hear him.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldna,\u201d he assured me hastily. \u201cOnly at night, like, dreaming. But not waking, not since I had the accident. Perhaps it was being so early i\u2019 the morning; my c*ck thought I was still asleep.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a low Scottish noise expressing considerable doubt as to this supposition, but urged Duncan to continue, with a certain amount of impatience.</p><p>Phaedre had taken notice in her turn, it transpired.</p><p>\u201cShe was only sorry for me,\u201d Duncan said frankly. \u201cI could tell as much. But she put her hand on me, soft. So soft,\u201d he repeated, almost inaudibly.</p><p>He had been sitting on his bed\u2014and had gone on sitting there in dumb amazement, as she took away the breakfast tray, lifted his nightshirt, climbed on the bed with her skirts neatly tucked above her round brown thighs, and with great tenderness and gentleness, had welcomed back his manhood.</p><p>\u201cOnce?\u201d Jamie demanded. \u201cOr did ye keep doing it?\u201d</p><p>Duncan put his head in his hand, a fairly eloquent admission, under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cHow long did this . . . er . . . liaison go on?\u201d I asked more gently.</p><p>Two months, perhaps three. Not every day, he hastened to add\u2014only now and then. And they had been very careful.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna ever have wanted to shame Jo, ken,\u201d he said very earnestly. \u201cAnd I kent weel I shouldna be doing it, \u2019twas a great sin, and yet I couldna keep from\u2014\u201d He broke, off, swallowing. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, what\u2019s happened, let the sin be on me! Och, my puir darling lass . . .\u201d</p><p>He fell silent, shaking his head like an old, sad, flea-ridden dog. I felt terribly sorry for him, regardless of the morality of the situation. The collar of his shirt was turned awkwardly under, strands of his grizzled hair trapped beneath his coat; I gently pulled them out and straightened it, though he took no heed.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think she\u2019s dead, Duncan?\u201d Jamie asked quietly, and Duncan blanched, his skin going the same gray as his hair.</p><p>\u201cI canna bring myself to think it, Mac Dubh,\u201d he said, and his eyes filled with tears. \u201cAnd\u2014and yet . . .\u201d</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged uneasy glances. And yet. Phaedre had taken no money when she disappeared. How could a female slave travel very far without detection, advertised and hunted, lacking a horse, money, or anything beyond a pair of leather shoes? A man might possibly make it to the mountains, and manage to survive in the woods, if he were tough and resourceful\u2014but a girl? A house slave?</p><p>Someone had taken her\u2014or else she was dead.</p><p>None of us wanted to voice that thought, though. Jamie heaved a great sigh, and taking a clean handkerchief from his sleeve, put it in Duncan\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI shall pray for her, Duncan\u2014wherever she may be. And for you, a charaid . . . and for you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, not looking up, the handkerchief clutched tight. It was clear that any attempt at comfort would be futile, and so at last we left him sitting there, in his tiny, landlocked room, so far from the sea.</p><p>We made our way back slowly, not speaking, but holding hands, feeling the strong need to touch each other. The day was bright, but there was a storm coming up; ragged clouds were streaming in from the east, and the breeze came in gusts that whirled my skirts about like a twirling parasol.</p><p>The wind was less on the back terrace, sheltered as it was by its waist-high wall. Looking up from here, I could just see the window that Phaedre had been looking out of when I\u2019d found her there, the night of the barbecue.</p><p>\u201cShe told me that something wasn\u2019t right,\u201d I said. \u201cThe night of Mrs. MacDonald\u2019s barbecue. Something was troubling her then.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shot me an interested glance.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? But she didna mean Duncan, surely?\u201d he objected.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I shrugged helplessly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem to know what was wrong herself\u2014she just kept saying, \u2018Something ain\u2019t right.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath and blew it out again, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIn a way, I suppose I hope that whatever it was, it had to do with her going. For if it wasna to do with her and Duncan . . .\u201d He trailed off, but I had no difficulty in finishing the thought.</p><p>\u201cThen it wasn\u2019t to do with your aunt, either,\u201d I said. \u201cJamie\u2014do you really think Jocasta might have had her killed?\u201d</p><p>It should have sounded ridiculous, spoken aloud like that. The horrible thing was that it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jamie made that small, shrugging gesture he used when very uncomfortable about something, as though his coat was too tight.</p><p>\u201cHad she her sight, I should think it\u2014possible, at least,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be betrayed by Hector\u2014and she blamed him already, for the death of her girls. So her daughters are dead, but there is Phaedre, alive, every day, a constant reminder of insult. And then to be betrayed yet again, by Duncan, with Hector\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle under his nose. \u201cI should think any woman of spirit might be . . . moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, imagining what I might think or feel under the same circumstances. \u201cCertainly. But to murder\u2014that is what we\u2019re talking about, isn\u2019t it? Couldn\u2019t she simply have sold the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t. We made provision to safeguard her money when she wed\u2014but not the property. Duncan is the owner of River Run\u2014and all that goes with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Phaedre.\u201d I felt hollow, and a little sick.</p><p>\u201cAs I said. Had she her sight, I shouldna be astonished at all by the thought. As it is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUlysses,\u201d I said, with certainty, and he nodded reluctantly. Ulysses was not only Jocasta\u2019s eyes, but her hands, as well. I didn\u2019t think he would have killed Phaedre at his mistress\u2019s command\u2014but if Jocasta had poisoned the girl, for instance, Ulysses might certainly have helped to dispose of the body.</p><p>I felt an odd air of unreality\u2014even with what I knew of the MacKenzie family, calmly discussing the possibility of Jamie\u2019s aged aunt having murdered someone . . . and yet . . . I did know the MacKenzies.</p><p>\u201cIf my aunt had any hand at all in the matter,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAfter all, Duncan said they were discreet. And it may be the lass was taken off\u2014perhaps by the man my aunt recalls from Coigach. It could be he\u2019d think Phaedre might help him to the gold, no?\u201d</p><p>That was a somewhat happier thought. And it did fit with Phaedre\u2019s premonition\u2014if that\u2019s what it was\u2014which had occurred the same day that the man from Coigach came.</p><p>\u201cI suppose all we can do is pray for her, poor thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s a patron saint of abducted persons, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint Dagobert,\u201d he replied promptly, causing me to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I am not,\u201d he said with dignity. \u201cSaint Athelais is another one\u2014and perhaps better, now I think. She was a young Roman lass, who was abducted by the Emperor Justinian, who wished to have his way wi\u2019 her, and she vowed to chastity. But she escaped and went off to live with her uncle in Benevento.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. And Saint Dagobert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA king of some sort\u2014Frankish? Anyway, his guardian took against him as a child, and had him kidnapped away to England, so the guardian\u2019s son might reign instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you learn these things?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cFrom Brother Polycarp, at the Abbey of St. Anne,\u201d he said, the corner of his mouth tucking back in a smile. \u201cWhen I couldna sleep, he\u2019d come and tell me stories of the saints, hours on end. It didna always put me to sleep, but after an hour or so of hearing about holy martyrs having their br**sts amputated or being flogged wi\u2019 iron hooks, I\u2019d close my eyes and make a decent pretense of it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie took my cap off and set it on the ledge. The air blew through my inch of hair, ruffling it like meadow grass, and he smiled as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYe look like a boy, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThough damned if I\u2019ve ever seen a lad with an arse like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much,\u201d I said, absurdly pleased. I had eaten like a horse in the last two months, slept well and deeply through the nights, and knew I was much improved in looks, hair notwithstanding. Never hurt to hear it, though.</p><p>\u201cI want ye verra much, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said softly, and curled his fingers round my wrist, letting the pads rest gently on my pulse.</p><p>\u201cSo the MacKenzies of Leoch are all prone to black jealousy,\u201d I said. I could feel my pulse, steady under his fingers. \u201cCharming, cunning, and given to betrayal.\u201d I touched his lip, ran my thumb lightly along it, the tiny prickles of beard pleasant to the touch. \u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>He looked down, fixing me suddenly with a dark blue gaze in which humor and ruefulness were mingled with a good many other things I couldn\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cYe think I am not?\u201d he said, and smiled a little sadly. \u201cGod and Mary bless ye, Sassenach.\u201d And bent to kiss me.</p><p>WE COULD NOT TARRY at River Run. The fields down here on the piedmont had long since been harvested and turned under, the remnants of dried stalks flecking the fresh dark earth; snow would fly soon in the mountains.</p><p>We had discussed the matter round and round\u2014but came to no useful conclusion. There was nothing further we could do to help Phaedre\u2014except to pray. Beyond that, though . . . there was Duncan to think of.</p><p>For it had occurred to both of us that if Jocasta had found out about his liaison with Phaedre, her wrath was not likely to be limited to the slave girl. She might bide her time\u2014but she would not forget the injury. I\u2019d never met a Scot who would.</p><p>We took our leave of Jocasta after breakfast the next day, finding her in her private parlor, embroidering a table runner. The basket of silk threads sat in her lap, the colors carefully arrayed in a spiral, so that she could choose the one she wanted by touch, and the finished linen fell to one side, five feet of cloth edged with an intricate design of apples, leaves, and vines\u2014or no, I realized, when I picked up the end of the cloth to admire it. Not vines. Black-eyed serpents, coiling slyly, slithering, green and scaly. Here and there one gaped to show its fangs, guarding scattered red fruit.</p><p>\u201cGarden of Eden,\u201d she explained to me, rubbing the design lightly betwixt her fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow beautiful,\u201d I said, wondering how long she\u2019d been working on it. Had she begun it before Phaedre\u2019s disappearance?</p><p>A bit of casual talk, and then Josh the groom appeared to say that our horses were ready. Jamie nodded, dismissing him, and stood.</p><p>\u201cAunt,\u201d he said to Jocasta matter-of-factly, \u201cI should take it verra much amiss were any harm to come to Duncan.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, fingers halting in their work.</p><p>\u201cWhy should any harm come to him?\u201d she asked, lifting her chin.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t reply at once, but stood regarding her, not without sympathy. Then he leaned down, so that she could feel his presence close, his mouth near her ear.</p><p>\u201cI know, Aunt,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd if ye dinna wish anyone else to share that knowledge . . . then I think I shall find Duncan in good health when I return.\u201d</p><p>She sat as though turned to salt. Jamie stood up, nodding toward the door, and we took our leave. I glanced back from the hallway, and saw her still sitting like a statue, face as white as the linen in her hands and the little balls of colored thread all fallen from her lap, unraveling across the polished floor.</p><p>73</p><p>DOUBLE-DEALING</p><p>WITH MARSALI GONE, the whisky-making became more difficult. Among us, Bree and Mrs. Bug and I had managed to get off one more malting before the weather became too cold and rainy, but it was a near thing, and it was with great relief that I saw the last of the malted grain safely decanted into the still. Once set to ferment, the stuff became Jamie\u2019s responsibility, as he trusted no one else with the delicate job of judging taste and proof.</p><p>The fire beneath the still had to be kept at exactly the right level, though, to keep fermentation going without killing the mash, then raised for the distillings once fermentation was complete. This meant that he lived\u2014and slept\u2014beside the still for the few days necessary for each batch to come off. I generally brought him supper and stayed until the dark came, but it was lonely without him in my bed, and I was more than pleased when we poured the last of the new making into casks.</p><p>\u201cOh, that smells good.\u201d I sniffed beatifically at the inside of an empty cask; it was one of the special casks Jamie had obtained through one of Lord John\u2019s shipping friends\u2014charred inside like a normal whisky cask, but previously used to store sherry. The sweet mellow ghost of the sherry mingled with the faint scent of char and the hot, raw reek of the new whisky were together enough to make my head spin pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s a small batch, but no bad,\u201d Jamie agreed, inhaling the aroma like a perfume connoisseur. He lifted his head and eyed the sky overhead; the wind was coming up strong, and thick clouds were racing past, dark-bellied and threatening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s only the three casks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf ye think ye might manage one, Sassenach, I\u2019ll take the others. I should like to have them safe, rather than dig them out of a snowbank next week.\u201d</p><p>A half-mile walk in a roaring wind, carrying or rolling a six-gallon cask, was no joke, but he was right about the snow. It wasn\u2019t quite cold enough for snow yet, but it would be soon. I sighed, but nodded, and between us, we managed to lug the casks slowly up to the whisky cache, hidden among rocks and ragged grapevines.</p><p>I had quite regained my strength, but even so, every muscle I had was trembling and jerking in protest by the time we had finished, and I made no objection at all when Jamie made me sit down to rest before heading back to the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do with these?\u201d I asked, nodding back toward the cache. \u201cKeep, or sell?\u201d</p> <p>He wiped a flying strand of hair out of his face, squinting against a blast of flying dust and dead leaves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to sell one, for the spring seed. We\u2019ll keep one to age\u2014and I think perhaps I can put the last to good purpose. If Bobby Higgins comes again before the snow, I shall send a half-dozen bottles to Ashe, Harnett, Howe, and a few others\u2014a wee token of my abiding esteem, aye?\u201d He grinned wryly at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard of worse bona fides,\u201d I said, amused. It had taken him a good deal of work to worm his way back into the good graces of the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence, but several members had begun answering his letters again\u2014cautiously, but with respect.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think anything important will happen over the winter,\u201d he said thoughtfully, rubbing his cold-reddened nose.</p><p>\u201cLikely not.\u201d Massachusetts, where most of the uproar had been taking place, was now occupied by a General Gage, and the latest we had heard was that he had fortified Boston Neck, the narrow spit of land that connects the city to the mainland\u2014which meant that Boston was now cut off from the rest of the colony, and under seige.</p> <p>I felt a small pang, thinking of it; I had lived in Boston for nearly twenty years, and was fond of the city\u2014though I knew I would not recognize it now.</p><p>\u201cJohn Hancock\u2014he\u2019s a merchant there\u2014is heading the Committee of Safety, Ashe says. They\u2019ve voted to recruit twelve thousand militia, and are looking to purchase five thousand muskets\u2014with the trouble I had to find thirty, good luck to them, is all I can say.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but before I could reply, Jamie stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d His head turned sharply, and he laid a hand on my arm. Silenced abruptly, I held my breath, listening. The wind stirred the drying leaves of wild grapevines with a papery rustle behind me, and in the distance a murder of crows passed, squabbling in shrill cries.</p><p>Then I heard it, too: a small, desolate, and very human sound. Jamie was already on his feet, making his way with care between the fallen rocks. He ducked beneath the lintel made by a leaning slab of granite, and I made to follow him. He stopped abruptly, nearly making me run into him.</p><p>\u201cJoseph?\u201d he said incredulously.</p> <p>I peered around him as best I could. To my equal astonishment, it was Mr. Wemyss, sitting hunched on a boulder, a stone jug between his bony knees. He\u2019d been crying; his nose and eyes were red, making him look even more like a white mouse than usual. He was also extremely drunk.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, blinking in dismay at us. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre ye . . . quite well, Joseph?\u201d Jamie came closer, extending a hand gingerly, as though afraid that Mr. Wemyss might crack into pieces if touched.</p><p>This instinct was sound; when he touched the little man, Mr. Wemyss\u2019s face crumpled like paper, and his thin shoulders began to shake uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, sir,\u201d he kept saying, quite dissolved in tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave me a \u201cdo something, Sassenach\u201d look of appeal, and I knelt swiftly, putting my arms round Mr. Wemyss\u2019s shoulders, patting his slender back.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d I said, giving Jamie a \u201cnow what?\u201d sort of look over Mr. Wemyss\u2019s matchstick shoulder in return. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said, hiccuping. \u201cOh, no, it can\u2019t.\u201d He turned a face streaming with woe toward Jamie. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it, sir, truly I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Wemyss\u2019s bones felt thin and brittle, and he was shivering. He was wearing only a thin shirt and breeches, and the wind was beginning to whine through the rocks. Clouds thickened overhead, and the light went from the little hollow, suddenly, as though a blackout curtain had been dropped.</p><p>Jamie unfastened his own cloak and wrapped it rather awkwardly round Mr. Wemyss, then lowered himself carefully onto another boulder.</p><p>\u201cTell me the trouble, Joseph,\u201d he said quite gently. \u201cIs someone dead, then?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss sank his face into his hands, head shaking to and fro like a metronome. He muttered something, which I understood to be \u201cBetter if she were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie?\u201d I asked, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jamie. \u201cIs it Lizzie you mean?\u201d She\u2019d been perfectly all right at breakfast; what on earth\u2014</p><p>\u201cFirst Manfred McGillivray,\u201d Mr. Wemyss said, raising his face from his hands, \u201cand then Higgins. As though a degenerate and a murderer were not bad enough\u2014now this!\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s brows shot up and he looked at me. I shrugged slightly. The gravel was jabbing sharply into my knees; I rose stiffly and brushed it away.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that Lizzie is, er . . . in love with someone . . . unsuitable?\u201d I asked carefully.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss shuddered.</p><p>\u201cUnsuitable,\u201d he said, in a hollow tone. \u201cJesus Christ. Unsuitable!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never heard Mr. Wemyss blaspheme before; it was unsettling.</p><p>He turned wild eyes on me, looking like a crazed sparrow, huddled in the depths of Jamie\u2019s cloak.</p><p>\u201cI gave up everything for her!\u201d he said. \u201cI sold myself\u2014and gladly!\u2014to save her from dishonor. I left home, left Scotland, knowing I should never see it more, that I should leave my bones in the soil of the strangers. And yet I\u2019ve said nay word of reproach to her, my dear wee lassie, for how should it be her fault? And now . . .\u201d He turned a hollow, haunted gaze on Jamie.</p><p>\u201cMy God, my God. What shall I do?\u201d he whispered. A blast of wind thundered through the rocks and whipped the cloak around him, momentarily obliterating him in a shroud of gray, as though distress had quite engulfed him.</p><p>I kept tight hold of my own cloak, to prevent it being torn off me; the wind was strong enough that I nearly lost my footing. Jamie squinted against the spray of dust and fine gravel that blasted us, setting his teeth in discomfort. He wrapped his arms around himself, shivering.</p><p>\u201cIs the lass with child, then, Joseph?\u201d he said, obviously wanting to get to the bottom of things and go home.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss\u2019s head popped out of the folds of cloak, fair hair tousled into broomstraw. Blinking reddened eyes, he nodded, then excavated the jug and, raising it in trembling hands, took several gulps. I saw the single \u201cX\u201d marked on the jug; with his characteristic modesty, he had taken a jug of the raw new whisky, not the cask-aged higher quality.</p><p>Jamie sighed, reached out a hand, and taking the jug from him, took a healthy gulp himself.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he said, handing it back. \u201cIs it my nephew?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss stared at him, owl-eyed.</p><p>\u201cYour nephew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan Murray,\u201d I put in helpfully. \u201cTall brown-haired lad? Tattoos?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave me a look suggesting that I was perhaps not being quite so helpful as I thought, but Mr. Wemyss went on looking blank.</p><p>\u201cIan Murray?\u201d Then the name appeared to penetrate through the alcoholic fog. \u201cOh. No. Christ, if it were! I should bless the lad,\u201d he said fervently.</p><p>I exchanged another look with Jamie. This looked like being serious.</p><p>\u201cJoseph,\u201d he said with just a touch of menace. \u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d He wiped his nose on the back of his hand. \u201cWho\u2019s debauched your daughter? Give me his name, and I\u2019ll see him wed to her in the morning or dead at her feet, whichever ye like. But let\u2019s do it inside by the fire, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeardsley,\u201d Mr. Wemyss said, in a tone suggesting visions of utter despair.</p><p>\u201cBeardsley?\u201d Jamie repeated. He raised one eyebrow at me. It wasn\u2019t what I would have expected\u2014but hearing it came as no great shock, either.</p><p>\u201cWhich Beardsley was it?\u201d he asked, with relative patience. \u201cJo? Or Kezzie?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss heaved a sigh that came from the bottoms of his feet.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d said Jamie involuntarily. He reached for the whisky again, and drank heavily.</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d I said, giving him a meaningful look as he lowered the jug. He surrendered it to me without comment, and straightened himself on his boulder, shirt plastered against his chest by the wind, his hair whipped loose behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the two of them in, and find out the truth of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Wemyss, \u201cwe won\u2019t. They don\u2019t know, either.\u201d</p><p>I had just taken a mouthful of raw spirit. At this, I choked, spluttering whisky down my chin.</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d I croaked, wiping my face with a corner of my cloak. \u201cYou mean . . . both of them?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss looked at me. Instead of replying, though, he blinked once. Then his eyes rolled up into his head and he fell headlong off the boulder, poleaxed.</p><p>I MANAGED TO RESTORE Mr. Wemyss to semiconsciousness, but not to the point of his being able to walk. Jamie was therefore obliged to carry the little man slung across his shoulders like a deer carcass; no mean feat, considering the broken ground that lay between the whisky cache and the new malting floor, and the wind that pelted us with bits of gravel, leaves, and flying pinecones. Clouds had boiled up over the shoulder of the mountain, dark and dirty as laundry suds, and were spreading rapidly across the sky. We were going to get drenched, if we didn\u2019t hurry.</p><p>The going became easier once we reached the trail to the house, but Jamie\u2019s temper was not improved by Mr. Wemyss\u2019s suddenly coming to at this point and vomiting down the front of his shirt. After a hasty attempt at swabbing off the mess, we reorganized our strategy, and made our way with Mr. Wemyss precariously balanced between us, each firmly gripping one elbow as he slipped and stumbled, his spindly knees giving way at unexpected moments, like Pinocchio with his strings cut.</p><p>Jamie was talking to himself volubly in Gaelic under his breath during this phase of the journey, but desisted abruptly when we came into the dooryard. One of the Beardsley twins was there, catching chickens for Mrs. Bug before the storm; he had two of them, held upside down by the legs like an ungainly bouquet of brown and yellow. He stopped when he saw us, and stared curiously at Mr. Wemyss.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d began the boy. He got no further. Jamie dropped Mr. Wemyss\u2019s arm, took two strides, and punched the Beardsley twin in the stomach with sufficient force that he doubled over, dropped the chickens, staggered back, and fell down. The chickens flapped off in a cloud of scattered feathers, squawking.</p><p>The boy writhed about on the ground, mouth opening and closing in a vain search for air, but Jamie paid no attention. He stooped, seized the lad by the hair, and spoke loudly and directly into his ear\u2014in case it was Kezzie, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cFetch your brother. To my study. Now.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss had been watching this interesting tableau, one arm draped across my shoulders for support and his mouth hanging open. It continued to hang open as he turned his head, following Jamie as he strode back toward us. He blinked, though, and shut it, as Jamie seized his other arm and, removing him neatly from me, propelled him into the house without a backward glance.</p><p>I gazed reproachfully at the Beardsley on the ground.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d I said.</p><p>He made soundless goldfish mouths at me, his eyes completely round, then managed a long heeeeee sound of inhalation, his face dark purple.</p><p>\u201cJo? What\u2019s the matter, are ye hurt?\u201d Lizzie came out of the trees, a pair of chickens clutched by the legs in either hand. She was frowning worriedly at\u2014well, I supposed it was Jo; if anyone could tell the difference, it would surely be Lizzie.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not hurt,\u201d I assured her. \u201cYet.\u201d I pointed a monitory finger at her. \u201cYou, young lady, go and put those chickens in their coop and then\u2014\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the boy on the ground, who had recovered enough breath to gasp and was gingerly sitting up. I didn\u2019t want to bring her into my surgery, not if Jamie and Mr. Wemyss were going to be eviscerating the Beardsleys right across the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I decided hastily, gesturing her away from Jo. \u201cShoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She cast a bewildered glance at Jo\u2014yes, it was Jo; he ran a hand through his hair to get it out of his face, and I saw the scarred thumb.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, turning her toward the chicken coop with a firm hand on her shoulder. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back, to see that Jo Beardsley had made it to his feet and, with a hand pressed to his tender middle, was making off toward the stable, presumably to fetch his twin as ordered.</p><p>I glanced back at Lizzie, giving her a narrow eye. If Mr. Wemyss had the right end of the stick and she was pregnant, she was evidently one of those fortunate persons who doesn\u2019t suffer from morning sickness or the usual digestive symptoms of early pregnancy; she was, in fact, very healthy-looking.</p><p>That in itself should have alerted me, I supposed, pale and green-stick as she normally was. Now that I looked carefully, there seemed to be a soft pink glow about her, and her pale blond hair was shiny where it peeped out under her cap.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d I asked, holding back a branch for her. She gave me a quick look, gulped visibly, then ducked under the branch.</p><p>\u201cAbout four months gone, I think,\u201d she said meekly, not looking at me. \u201cUm . . . Da told ye, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your poor father,\u201d I said severely. \u201cIs he right? Both of the Beardsleys?\u201d</p><p>She hunched her shoulders a little, head bowed, but nodded, almost imperceptibly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what will Himself do to them?\u201d she asked, her voice small and tremulous.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d I doubted that Jamie himself had formed any specific notions\u2014though he had mentioned having the miscreant responsible for Lizzie\u2019s pregnancy dead at her feet if her father wished it.</p><p>Now that I thought, the alternative\u2014having her wed by morning\u2014was likely to be somewhat more problematic than simply killing the twins would be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeated. We had reached the coop, a stoutly built edifice that sheltered under a spreading maple. Several of the hens, slightly less stupid than their sisters, were roosting like huge, ripe fruits in the lower branches, heads buried in their feathers.</p><p>I pulled open the door, releasing a gust of ripe ammonia from the dark interior, and holding my breath against the stink, pulled the hens from the tree and tossed them brusquely inside. Lizzie ran into the woods nearby, snatching chickens out from under bushes and rushing back to shove them in. Large drops were beginning to plummet from the clouds, heavy as pebbles, making small, audible splats as they struck the leaves above.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d I slammed the door behind the last of the squawking chickens, threw the latch, and seized Lizzie by the arm. Borne on a whoosh of wind, we ran for the house, skirts whirling up round us like pigeons\u2019 wings.</p><p>The summer kitchen was nearest; we burst through the door just as the rain came down with a roar, a solid sheet of water that struck the tin roof with a sound like anvils falling.</p><p>We stood panting inside. Lizzie\u2019s cap had come off in flight, and her plait had come undone, so that her hair straggled over her shoulders in strands of shining, creamy blond; a noticeable change from the wispy, flyaway look she usually shared with her father. If I had seen her without her cap, I should have known at once. I took time to recover my breath, trying to decide what on earth to say to her.</p><p>She was making a great to-do over tidying herself, panting and pulling at her bodice, smoothing her skirts\u2014all the while trying not to meet my eye.</p><p>Well, there was one question that had been niggling at me since Mr. Wemyss\u2019s shocking revelation; best to get that one out of the way at once. The initial roar of the rain had slackened to a regular drumbeat; it was loud, but conversation was at least possible.</p><p>\u201cLizzie.\u201d She looked up from her skirt-settling, slightly startled. \u201cTell me the truth,\u201d I said. I put my hands on either side of her face, looking earnestly into her pale blue eyes. \u201cWas it rape?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, the look of absolute amazement that suffused her features more eloquent than any spoken denial could have been.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am!\u201d she said just as earnestly. \u201cYe couldna think Jo or Kezzie would do such a thing?\u201d Her small pink lips twitched slightly. \u201cWhat, did ye think they maybe took it in turns to hold me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said tartly, releasing her. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d best ask, just in case.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t really thought so. But the Beardsleys were such an odd mix of the civil and the feral that it was impossible to say definitely what they might or might not do.</p><p>\u201cBut it was . . . er . . . both of them? That\u2019s what your father said. Poor man,\u201d I added, with a tone of some reproach.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She cast down her pale lashes, pretending to find a loose thread on her skirt. \u201cUmmm . . . well, aye, it was. I do feel something terrible about shaming Da so. And it wasna really that we did it a-purpose . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Wemyss,\u201d I said, with no little asperity, \u201crape aside\u2014and we\u2019ve ruled that out\u2014it is not possible to engage in sexual relations with two men without meaning to. One, maybe, but not two. Come to that . . .\u201d I hesitated, but vulgar curiosity was simply too much. \u201cBoth at once?\u201d</p><p>She did look shocked at that, which was something of a relief.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am! It was . . . I mean, I didna ken that it . . .\u201d She trailed off, quite pink in the face.</p><p>I pulled two stools out from under the table and pushed one toward her.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I said, \u201cand tell me about it. We aren\u2019t going anywhere for a bit,\u201d I added, glancing through the half-open door at the downpour outside. A silver haze rose knee-high over the yard, as the raindrops struck the grass in small explosions of mist, and the sharp smell of it washed through the room.</p><p>Lizzie hesitated, but took the stool; I could see her making up her mind to it that there was really nothing to do now but explain\u2014assuming that the situation could be explained.</p><p>\u201cYou, um, said you didn\u2019t know,\u201d I said, trying to offer her an opening. \u201cYou mean\u2014you thought it was only one twin, but they, er, fooled you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aye,\u201d she said, and took a huge breath of the chilly air. \u201cSomething like that. See, \u2019twas when you and Himself went to Bethabara for the new goat. Mrs. Bug was down wi\u2019 the lumbago, and it was only me and Da in the house\u2014but then he went down to Woolam\u2019s for to fetch the flour, and so it was just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Bethabara? That was six months ago! And you\u2019re four months gone\u2014you mean all this time you\u2019ve been\u2014well, never mind. What happened, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fever,\u201d she said simply. \u201cIt came back.\u201d</p><p>She had been gathering firewood when the first malarial chill struck her. Recognizing it for what it was, she had dropped the wood and tried to reach the house, only to fall halfway there, her muscles going slack as string.</p><p>\u201cI lay upon the ground,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I could feel the fever comin\u2019 for me. It\u2019s like a great beast, aye? I can feel it seize me in its jaws and bite\u2014\u2019tis like my blood runs hot and then cold, and the teeth of it sink into my bones. I can feel it set in then, to try to break them in twa, and suck the marrow.\u201d She shuddered in memory.</p><p>One of the Beardsleys\u2014she thought it was Kezzie, but had been in no state of mind to ask\u2014had discovered her lying in a disheveled heap in the dooryard. He\u2019d run to fetch his brother, and the two of them had raised her, carried her between them into the house, and fetched her upstairs to her bed.</p><p>\u201cMy teeth were clackin\u2019 so hard together I thought they\u2019d break, surely, but I told them to fetch the ointment, wi\u2019 the gallberries, the ointment ye\u2019d made.\u201d</p><p>They had rummaged through the surgery cupboard until they found it, and then, frantic as she burned hotter and hotter, had stripped off her shoes and stockings and begun to rub the ointment into her hands and feet.</p><p>\u201cI told them\u2014I told them they must rub it all over,\u201d she said, her cheeks going a deep peony. She looked down, fiddling with a strand of hair. \u201cI was\u2014well, I was quite oot my mind wi\u2019 the fever, ma\u2019am, truly I was. But I kent I needed my medicine bad.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, beginning to understand. I didn\u2019t blame her; I\u2019d seen the malaria overpower her. And so far as that went, she\u2019d done the right thing; she did need the medicine, and couldn\u2019t have managed to apply it herself.</p><p>Frantic, the two boys had done as she\u2019d said, got her clothes awkwardly off, and rubbed the ointment thoroughly into every inch of her nak*d body.</p><p>\u201cI was goin\u2019 in and oot a bit,\u201d she explained, \u201cwi\u2019 the fever dreams walkin\u2019 oot my heid and about the room, so it\u2019s all a bit mixed, what I recall. But I do think one o\u2019 the lads said to the other as he was getting the ointment all over, and would spoil his shirt, best take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said, seeing vividly. \u201cAnd then . . .\u201d</p><p>And then she had quite lost track of what was happening, save that whenever she drifted to the surface of the fever, the boys were still there, talking to her and each other, the murmur of their voices a small anchor to reality and their hands never leaving her, stroking and smoothing and the sharp smell of gallberries cutting through the woodsmoke from the hearth and the scent of beeswax from the candle.</p><p>\u201cI felt . . . safe,\u201d she said, struggling to express it. \u201cI dinna remember much in particular, only opening my eyes once and seein\u2019 his chest right before my face, and the dark curlies all round his paps, and them wee and brown and wrinkled, like raisins.\u201d She turned her face to me, eyes still rounded at the memory. \u201cI can still see that, like as it was right in front o\u2019 me this minute. That\u2019s queer, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed, though in fact it was not; there was something about high fever that blurred reality but at the same time could sear certain images so deeply into the mind that they never left. \u201cAnd then . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Then she had begun to shake violently with chills, which neither more quilts nor a hot stone at her feet had helped. And so one of the boys, in desperation, had crawled under the quilts beside her and held her against him, trying to drive out the cold from her bones with his own heat\u2014which, I thought cynically, must have been considerable, at that point.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken which it was, or if it was the same one all night, or if they changed now and then, but whenever I woke, he was there, wi\u2019 his arms about me. And sometimes he\u2019d put back the blanket and rub more ointment down my back and, and, round . . .\u201d She stumbled, blushing. \u201cBut when I woke in the morning, the fever was gone, like it always is on the second day.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, pleading for understanding.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken how that is, ma\u2019am, when a great fever\u2019s broken? \u2019Tis the same every time, so I\u2019m thinking it may be so for everyone. But it\u2019s . . . peaceful. Your limbs are sae heavy ye canna think of moving, but ye dinna much care. And everything ye see\u2014all the wee things ye take nay notice of day by day\u2014ye notice, and they\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI think sometimes that will be how it is when I\u2019m dead. I shall just wake, and everything will be like that, peaceful and beautiful\u2014save I shall be able to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you woke this time, and couldn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the boy\u2014whichever it was\u2014he was still there, with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Jo,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cHe spoke to me, but I didna pay much mind to what he said, and I dinna think he did, either.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip momentarily, the small teeth sharp and white.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I hadna done it before, ma\u2019am. But I came close, a time or two wi\u2019 Manfred. And closer still wi\u2019 Bobby Higgins. But Jo hadna ever even kissed a lass, nor his brother had, either. So ye see, \u2019twas really my fault, for I kent well enough what was happening, but . . . we were both slippery wi\u2019 the ointment, still, and nak*d under the quilts, and it . . . happened.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, understanding precisely and in detail.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see how it happened, all right. But then it . . . er . . . went on happening, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed up and she went very pink again.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . aye. It did. It\u2014it feels sae nice, ma\u2019am,\u201d she whispered, leaning a little toward me as though imparting an important secret.</p><p>I rubbed a knuckle hard across my lips.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. Quite. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>The Beardsleys had washed the sheets at her direction, and there were no incriminating traces left by the time her father returned, two days later. The gallberries had done their work, and while she was still weak and tired, she told Mr. Wemyss only that she had had a mild attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, she met with Jo at every opportunity, in the deep summer grass behind the dairy shed, in the fresh straw in the stable\u2014and when it rained, now and then on the porch of the Beardsleys\u2019 cabin.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna do it inside, for the stink o\u2019 the hides,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut we put an old quilt on the porch, so as I shouldna have splinters in my backside, and the rain comin\u2019 down just a foot away . . .\u201d She looked wistfully through the open door, where the rain had softened into a steady whisper, the needles trembling on the pine trees as it fell.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Kezzie? Where was he, while all this was going on?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, Kezzie,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath.</p><p>They had made love in the stable, and Jo had left her lying on her cloak in the straw, watching as he rose and dressed himself. Then he had kissed her and turned to the door. Seeing that he had forgotten his canteen, she called softly after him.</p><p>\u201cAnd he didna answer, nor turn round,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it came to me sudden, as he didna hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou, um, couldn\u2019t tell the difference?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a direct blue look.</p><p>\u201cI can now,\u201d she said.</p><p>In the beginning, though, sex was so new\u2014and the brothers both sufficiently inexperienced\u2014that she hadn\u2019t noticed any differences.</p><p>\u201cHow long . . . ?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, do you have any idea when they, er . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for certain,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut if I was to guess about it, I think the first time it was Jo\u2014no, I ken for sure that was Jo, for I saw his thumb\u2014but the second time, it was likely Kezzie. They share, ken?\u201d</p><p>They did share\u2014everything. And so it was the most natural thing in the world\u2014to all three of them, evidently\u2014that Jo should wish his brother to share in this new marvel.</p><p>\u201cI ken it seems . . . strange,\u201d she said, shrugging a little. \u201cAnd I suppose I ought to have said something, or done something\u2014but I couldna think what. And really\u201d\u2014she raised her eyes to me, helpless\u2014\u201cit didna seem wrong at all. They\u2019re different, aye, but at the same time, they\u2019re sae close to each other . . . well, it\u2019s just as if I was touching the one lad, and talking to him\u2014only he\u2019s got the twa bodies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwa bodies,\u201d I said, a little bleakly. \u201cWell, yes. There\u2019s just the difficulty, you see, the two bodies part.\u201d I eyed her closely. Despite the history of malaria and her fine-boned build, she had definitely filled out; she had a plump little bosom swelling over the edge of her bodice, and, while she was sitting on it so I couldn\u2019t tell for sure, very likely a bottom to match. The only real wonder was that it had taken her three months to fall pregnant.</p><p>As though reading my mind, she said, \u201cI took the seeds, aye? The ones you and Miss Bree take. I had a store put by, from when I was betrothed to Manfred; Miss Bree gave me them. I meant to gather more, but I didna always remember, and\u2014\u201d She shrugged again, putting her hands across her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhereupon you proceeded to say nothing,\u201d I observed. \u201cDid your father find out by accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I told him,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I best had, before I began to show. Jo and Kezzie came with me.\u201d</p> <p>This explained Mr. Wemyss\u2019s resort to strong drink, all right. Perhaps we should have brought the jug back with us.</p><p>\u201cYour poor father,\u201d I said again, but abstractedly. \u201cHad the three of you worked out any sort of plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI hadna told the lads I was in a family way \u2019til this morning, either. They seemed taken back a bit,\u201d she added, biting her lip again.</p><p>\u201cI daresay.\u201d I glanced outside; it was still raining, but the downpour had slackened momentarily, dimpling the puddles on the path. I rubbed a hand over my face, feeling suddenly rather tired.</p><p>\u201cWhich one will you choose?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>She gave me a sudden, startled look, the blood draining from her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have them both, you know,\u201d I said gently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she said, trying for boldness\u2014but her voice trembled. \u201cIt\u2019s no harming anyone. And it\u2019s no one\u2019s business but ours.\u201d</p><p>I began to feel the need of a stiff drink myself.</p><p>\u201cHoho,\u201d I said. \u201cTry telling your father that. Or Mr. Fraser. In a big city, perhaps you could get away with it. But here? Everything that happens is everybody\u2019s business, and you know it. Hiram Crombie would stone you for fornication as soon as look at you, if he found out about it.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, I got to my feet.</p><p>\u201cNow, then. We\u2019ll go back to the house and see whether they\u2019re both still alive. Mr. Fraser may have taken matters into his own hands, and solved the problem for you.\u201d</p> <p>THE TWINS WERE STILL ALIVE, but didn\u2019t look as though they were particularly glad of the fact. They sat shoulder to shoulder in the center of Jamie\u2019s study, pressed together as though trying to reunite into a single being.</p><p>Their heads jerked toward the door in unison, looks of alarm and concern mingling with joy at seeing Lizzie. I had her by the arm, but when she saw the twins, she pulled loose and hurried to them with a small exclamation, putting an arm about each boy\u2019s neck to draw him to her bosom.</p><p>I saw that one of the boys had a fresh black eye, just beginning to puff and swell; I supposed it must be Kezzie, though I didn\u2019t know whether this was Jamie\u2019s notion of fairness, or merely a convenient means of ensuring that he could tell which twin was which while talking to them.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss was also alive, though he didn\u2019t look any more pleased about it than the Beardsleys. He was red-eyed, pale, and still slightly green about the gills, but was at least upright and reasonably sober, seated beside Jamie\u2019s table. There was a cup of chicory coffee in front of him\u2014I could smell it\u2014but it seemed so far untouched.</p><p>Lizzie knelt on the floor, still clinging to the boys, the three heads drawn together like the lobes of a clover leaf as they murmured to one another.</p><p>\u201cAre ye hurt?\u201d she was saying, and \u201cAre ye all right?\u201d they were asking, an absolute tangle of hands and arms meanwhile searching, patting, stroking, and embracing. They reminded me of nothing so much as a tenderly solicitous octopus.</p><p>I glanced at Jamie, who was viewing this behavior with a jaundiced eye. Mr. Wemyss emitted a low moan, and buried his head in his hands.</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat with a low Scottish noise of infinite menace, and the proceedings in the middle of the room stopped as though hit with some sort of paralyzing death ray. Very slowly, Lizzie turned her head to look at him, chin held high, her arms still locked protectively about the Beardsleys\u2019 necks.</p> <p>\u201cSit down, lass,\u201d Jamie said with relative mildness, nodding toward an empty stool.</p><p>Lizzie rose, and turned, her eyes still fixed on him. She made no move to take the offered stool, though. Instead, she walked deliberately round behind the twins and stood between them, putting her hands upon their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand, sir,\u201d she said, her voice high and thin with fear, but filled with determination. Like clockwork, each twin reached up and grasped the hand upon his shoulder, their faces assuming similar expressions of mingled apprehension and steadfastness.</p><p>Jamie wisely decided not to make an issue of it, instead nodding to me in an offhand way. I took the stool myself, surprisingly glad to sit down.</p><p>\u201cThe lads and I have been talking wi\u2019 your father,\u201d he said, addressing Lizzie. \u201cI take it it\u2019s true, what ye told your Da? Ye are with child, and ye dinna ken which is the father?\u201d</p><p>Lizzie opened her mouth, but no words came out. Instead, she bobbed her head in an awkward nod.</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, then, ye\u2019ll need to be wed, and the sooner the better,\u201d he said, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. \u201cThe lads couldna quite decide which of them it should be, so it\u2019s up to you, lass. Which one?\u201d</p><p>All six hands tightened in a flash of white knuckles. It was really quite fascinating\u2014and I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for the three of them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Lizzie whispered. Then she cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she repeated more strongly. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want to choose. I love them both.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked down at his clasped hands for a moment, lips pursing as he thought. Then he raised his head and looked at her, very levelly. I saw her draw herself upright, lips pressed together, trembling but resolute, determined to defy him.</p><p>Then, with truly diabolical timing, Jamie turned to Mr. Wemyss.</p><p>\u201cJoseph?\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss had been sitting transfixed, eyes on his daughter, pale hands wrapped round his coffee cup. He didn\u2019t hesitate, though, or even blink.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he said, his voice very soft, \u201cdo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Her facade of defiance broke like a dropped egg, tears welling from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Da!\u201d she said. She let go the twins and ran to her father, who stood up in time to clasp her tightly in his arms, cheek pressed to her hair. She clung to him, sobbing, and I heard a brief sigh from one of the twins, though I couldn\u2019t tell which one.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss swayed gently with her, patting and soothing her, his murmured words indistinguishable from her sobs and broken utterances.</p><p>Jamie was watching the twins\u2014not without sympathy. Their hands were knotted together, and Kezzie\u2019s teeth were fixed in his lower lip.</p><p>Lizzie separated herself from her father, sniffling and groping vaguely for a handkerchief. I pulled one from my pocket, got up, and gave it to her. She blew her nose hard, and wiped her eyes, trying not to look at Jamie; she knew very well where the danger lay.</p><p>It was, however, a fairly small room, and Jamie was not a person who could be easily ignored, even in a large one. Unlike my surgery, the windows of the study were small and placed high in the wall, which gave the room under normal circumstances a pleasant dim coziness. At the moment, with the rain still coming down outside, a gray light filled the room and the air was chill.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no a matter of whom ye love, now, lass,\u201d Jamie said very gently. \u201cNot even your father.\u201d He nodded toward her stomach. \u201cYe\u2019ve a child in your belly. Nothing else matters, but to do right by it. And that doesna mean painting its mother a whore, aye?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed, a patchy crimson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didna say ye were,\u201d Jamie replied calmly. \u201cBut others will, and it gets around what ye\u2019ve been up to, lass. Spreading your legs for two men, and married to neither of them? And now with a wean, and ye canna name its father?\u201d</p><p>She looked angrily away from him\u2014and saw her own father, head bowed, his own cheeks darkening in shame. She made a small, heartbroken sound, and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>The twins stirred uneasily, glancing at each other, and Jo got his feet under him to rise\u2014then caught a look of wounded reproach from Mr. Wemyss, and changed his mind.</p><p>Jamie sighed heavily and rubbed a knuckle down the bridge of his nose. He stood then, stooped to the hearth, and pulled two straws from the basket of kindling. Holding these in his fist, he held them out to the twins.</p><p>\u201cShort straw weds her,\u201d he said with resignation.</p><p>The twins gaped at him, open-mouthed. Then Kezzie swallowed visibly, closed his eyes, and plucked a straw, gingerly, as though it might be attached to something explosive. Jo kept his eyes open, but didn\u2019t look at the straw he\u2019d drawn; his eyes were fixed on Lizzie.</p><p>Everyone seemed to exhale at once, looking at the straws.</p><p>\u201cVerra well, then. Stand up,\u201d Jamie said to Kezzie, who held the short one. Looking dazed, he did so.</p><p>\u201cTake her hand,\u201d Jamie told him patiently. \u201cNow, d\u2019ye swear before these witnesses\u201d\u2014he nodded at me and Mr. Wemyss\u2014\u201cthat ye take Elizabeth Wemyss as your wife?\u201d</p><p>Kezzie nodded, then cleared his throat and drew himself up.</p><p>\u201cI do, so,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you, ye wee besom, accept Keziah\u2014ye are Keziah?\u201d he asked, squinting dubiously at the twin. \u201cAye, all right, Keziah. Ye\u2019ll take him as your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Lizzie said, sounding hopelessly confused.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jamie said briskly. \u201cYou\u2019re handfast. Directly we find a priest, we\u2019ll have it properly blessed, but ye\u2019re married.\u201d He looked at Jo, who had risen to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d he said firmly, \u201cye\u2019ll leave. Tonight. Ye\u2019ll not come back \u2019til the child is born.\u201d</p><p>Jo was white to the lips, but nodded. He had both hands pressed to his body\u2014not where Jamie had hit him, but higher, over his heart. I felt a sharp answering pain in the same place, seeing his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Jamie took a deep breath, his shoulders slumping a little. \u201cJoseph\u2014have ye still got the marriage contract ye drew for your daughter and young McGillivray? Fetch it out, aye, and we\u2019ll change the name.\u201d</p><p>Looking like a snail poking its head out after a thunderstorm, Mr. Wemyss nodded cautiously. He looked at Lizzie, still standing hand-in-hand with her new bridegroom, the two of them resembling Lot and Mrs. Lot, respectively. Mr. Wemyss patted her softly on the shoulder, and hurried out, his feet tapping on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a fresh candle, won\u2019t you?\u201d I said to Jamie, tilting my head meaningfully toward Lizzie and the twins. The stub in his candlestick had half an inch to go, but I thought it only decent to give them a few moments of privacy.</p><p>\u201cOh? Oh, aye,\u201d he said, catching my meaning. He coughed. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah, come and get it.\u201d</p><p>The moment we entered my surgery, he closed the door, leaned against it, and let his head fall, shaking it.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPoor things,\u201d I said, with some sympathy. \u201cI mean\u2014you do have to feel sorry for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d He sniffed at his shirt, which had dried but still had a distinct stain of vomit down the front, then straightened up, stretching \u2019til his back creaked. \u201cAye, I suppose I do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut\u2014oh, God! Did she tell ye how it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll tell you the gory details later.\u201d I heard Mr. Wemyss\u2019s feet coming down the stairs. I took down a fresh pair of candles from the array that hung near the ceiling and held them out, stretching the long wick that joined them. \u201cDo you have a knife handy?\u201d</p><p>His hand went automatically to his waist, but he wasn\u2019t wearing his dirk.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s a penknife on my desk, though.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door just as Mr. Wemyss reached the office. Mr. Wemyss\u2019s exclamation of shock reached me simultaneously with the smell of blood.</p><p>Jamie pushed Mr. Wemyss unceremoniously aside, and I rushed in after him, heart in my throat.</p><p>The three of them were standing by the desk, close together. A spray of fresh blood stained the desk, and Kezzie was holding my bloodied handkerchief wrapped round his hand. He looked up at Jamie, his face ghostly in the guttering light. His teeth were gritted tight together, but he managed a smile.</p><p>A small movement caught my eye, and I saw Jo, carefully holding the blade of Jamie\u2019s penknife over the candle flame. Acting as though no one was there, he took his brother\u2019s hand, pulled off the handkerchief, and pressed the hot metal against the raw oval of the wound on Kezzie\u2019s thumb.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss made a small choking noise, and the smell of seared flesh mixed with the scent of rain. Kezzie drew breath deeply, then let it out, and smiled crookedly at Jo.</p><p>\u201cGodspeed, Brother,\u201d he said, his voice a little loud and flat.</p><p>\u201cMuch happiness to you, Brother,\u201d Jo said\u2014in the same voice.</p><p>Lizzie stood between them, small and disheveled, her reddened eyes fixed on Jamie. And smiled.</p><p>74</p><p>SO ROMANTIC</p><p>BRIANNA DROVE THE LITTLE CAR slowly up the slope of the quilt over Roger\u2019s leg, across his stomach, and into the center of his chest, where he captured both the car and her hand, giving her a wry grin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really good car,\u201d she said, pulling her hand loose and rolling comfortably onto her side beside him. \u201cAll four wheels turn. What kind is it? A Morris Minor, like that little orange thing you had in Scotland? That was the cutest thing I ever saw, but I never understood how you managed to squeeze into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith talcum powder,\u201d he assured her. He lifted the toy and set a front wheel spinning with a flick of his thumb. \u201cAye, it is a good one, isn\u2019t it? It isn\u2019t really meant to be a particular model, but I suppose I was remembering that Ford Mustang of yours. Remember driving down out of the mountains that time?\u201d His eyes softened with memory, the green of them nearly black in the dim light of the banked fire.</p><p>\u201cI do. I nearly drove off the road when you kissed me at eighty-five miles per hour.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him by reflex, nudging him with a knee. He rolled obligingly to face her, and kissed her again, meanwhile running the car swiftly backward down the length of her spine and over the curve of her buttocks. She yelped and squirmed against him, trying to escape the tickling wheels, then punched him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cCut that out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought ye found speed erotic. Vroom,\u201d he murmured, steering the toy up her arm\u2014and suddenly down the neck of her shift. She grabbed for the car, but he snatched it away, then plunged his hand under the covers, running the wheels down her thigh\u2014then madly up again.</p><p>A furious wrestling match for possession of the car ensued, which ended with both of them on the floor in a tangle of bedding and nightclothes, gasping for breath and helpless with giggling.</p><p>\u201cSsh! You\u2019ll wake up Jemmy!\u201d She heaved and wriggled, trying to get out from under Roger\u2019s weight. Secure in his fifty pounds\u2019 advantage, he merely relaxed on top of her, pinning her to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t wake him with cannon fire,\u201d Roger said, with a certainty born of experience. It was true; once past the stage of waking to be fed every few hours, Jem had always slept like a particularly comatose log.</p><p>She subsided, puffing hair out of her eyes and biding her time.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever go anywhere at eighty-five miles per hour again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I fall off the edge of a very deep gorge. Ye\u2019re nak*d, did ye know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so are you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but I started out that way. Where\u2019s the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she lied. It was, in fact, under the small of her back, and very uncomfortable, but she wasn\u2019t about to give him any further advantages. \u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was going to explore the terrain a bit,\u201d he said, raising himself on one elbow and walking his fingers slowly across the upper slope of one breast. \u201cI suppose I could do it on foot, though. Takes more time, but ye do enjoy the scenery more. They say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He could hold her down with his weight, but couldn\u2019t restrain her arms. She extended one index finger, and placed the nail of it precisely on his nipple, making him breathe in deeply. \u201cDid you have a long journey in mind?\u201d She glanced at the small shelf near the bed, where she kept her contraceptive materials.</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d He followed her glance, then looked back to meet her eyes, a question in his own.</p><p>She wriggled to make herself more comfortable, unobtrusively dislodging the miniature car.</p><p>\u201cThey say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\u201d she said, and raising her head, put her mouth on his nipple, and closed her teeth gently. A moment later, she let go.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d she said reproachfully. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake up Jemmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHERE ARE YOUR SCISSORS? I\u2019m cutting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you. I like it long.\u201d She pushed the soft dark hair back from his face and kissed the end of his nose, which appeared to disconcert him slightly. He smiled, though, and kissed her briefly back before sitting up, swiping the hair out of his face with one hand.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be comfortable,\u201d he said, eyeing the cradle. \u201cSurely I should move him to his own bed?\u201d</p><p>Brianna glanced up at the cradle from her position on the floor. Jemmy, aged four, had long since graduated to a trundle bed, but now and then insisted upon sleeping in his cradle for old times\u2019 sake, wedging himself stubbornly into it, despite the fact that he couldn\u2019t get all four limbs and his head inside at once. He was invisible at the moment, save for two chubby bare legs sticking straight up in the air at one end.</p><p>He was getting so big, she thought. He couldn\u2019t quite read yet, but knew all his letters, and could count to a hundred and write his name. And he knew how to load a gun; his grandfather had taught him.</p><p>\u201cDo we tell him?\u201d she asked suddenly. \u201cAnd if so, when?\u201d</p><p>Roger must have been thinking something along the same lines, for he appeared to understand exactly what she meant.</p><p>\u201cChrist, how do you tell a kid something like that?\u201d he said. He rose and picked up a handful of bedding, shaking it in apparent hopes of finding the leather string with which he bound his hair.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you tell a kid if he were adopted?\u201d she objected, sitting up and running both hands through her own bountiful hair. \u201cOr if there\u2019s some family scandal, like his father\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s in prison? If you tell them early, it doesn\u2019t mean all that much to them, I don\u2019t think; they\u2019re comfortable with it as they get older. If they find out later, it\u2019s a shock.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry, sidelong look. \u201cYou\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would you.\u201d She spoke dryly, but she felt the echo of it, even now. Disbelief, anger, denial\u2014and then the sudden collapse of her world as she began, against her will, to believe. The sense of hollowness and abandonment\u2014and the sense of black rage and betrayal at discovering how much of what she had taken for granted was a lie.</p><p>\u201cAt least for you, it wasn\u2019t a choice,\u201d she said, squirming into a more comfortable position against the edge of the bed. \u201cNobody knew about you; nobody could have told you what you were\u2014but didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and ye think they should have told you about the time travel early on? Your parents?\u201d He lifted one black brow, cynically amused. \u201cI can see the notes coming home from your school\u2014Brianna has a most creative imagination, but should be encouraged to recognize situations where it is not appropriate to employ it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d She kicked away the remaining tangle of clothes and bedding. \u201cI went to a Catholic school. The nuns would have called it lying, and put a stop to it, period. Where\u2019s my shift?\u201d She had wriggled completely out of it in the struggle, and while she was still warm from their struggle, she felt uncomfortably exposed, even in the dim shadows of the room.</p><p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d He plucked a wad of linen from the mess and shook it out. \u201cDo you?\u201d he repeated, looking up at her with one brow raised.</p><p>\u201cThink they should have told me? Yes. And no,\u201d she admitted reluctantly. She reached for the shift and pulled it over her head. \u201cI mean\u2014I see why they didn\u2019t. Daddy didn\u2019t believe it, to start with. And what he did believe . . . well, whatever it was, he did ask Mama to let me think he was my real father. She gave him her word; I guess I don\u2019t think she should have broken it, no.\u201d To the best of her knowledge, her mother had broken her word only once\u2014unwillingly, but to staggering effect.</p><p>She smoothed the worn linen over her body and fished for the ends of the drawstring that gathered the neck. She was covered now, but felt just as much exposed as if she were still nak*d. Roger was sitting on the mattress, methodically shaking out the blankets, but his eyes were still fixed on her, green and questioning.</p><p>\u201cIt was still a lie,\u201d she burst out. \u201cI had a right to know!\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He picked up a rope of twisted sheet and began unwinding it. \u201cAye, well. I can see telling a kid he\u2019s adopted or his dad\u2019s in prison. This is maybe more along the lines of telling a kid his father murdered his mother when he found her screwing the postie and six good friends in the kitchen, though. Maybe it doesn\u2019t mean that much to him if you tell him early on\u2014but it\u2019s definitely going to get the attention of his friends when he starts telling them.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, feeling unexpectedly cross and prickly. She hadn\u2019t thought her own feelings were still so near the surface, and didn\u2019t like either the fact that they were\u2014or that Roger could see that they were.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yes.\u201d She glanced at the cradle. Jem had moved; he was curled up like a hedgehog now, with his face pressed to his knees, and nothing visible save the curve of his bottom under his nightshirt, rising over the edge of the cradle like the moon rising above the horizon. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019d have to wait until he\u2019s old enough to realize that he can\u2019t tell people; that it\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>The leather thong fell out of a shaken quilt. He bent to pick it up, dark hair falling round his face.</p><p>\u201cWould ye want to tell Jem someday that I\u2019m not his real father?\u201d he asked quietly, not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d All her crossness disappeared in a flood of panic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that in a hundred million years! Even if I thought it was true,\u201d she added hastily, \u201cand I don\u2019t. Roger, I don\u2019t! I know you\u2019re his father.\u201d She sat down beside him, gripping his arm urgently. He smiled, a little crookedly, and patted her hand\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. He waited a moment, then moved, gently disengaging himself in order to tie up his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat ye said, though. Has he not got a right to know who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s different.\u201d It was; and yet it wasn\u2019t. The act that had resulted in her own conception hadn\u2019t been rape\u2014but it had been just as unintended. On the other hand, there had been no doubt, either: both\u2014well, all three\u2014of her parents had known that she was Jamie Fraser\u2019s child, beyond doubt.</p><p>With Jem . . . she looked again at the cradle, instinctively wanting to find some stamp, some undeniable clue to his paternity. But he looked like her, and like her father, in terms both of coloring and feature. He was big for his age, long-limbed and broad-backed\u2014but so were both of the men who might have fathered him. And both, damn them, had green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling him that,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cNot ever, and neither are you. You are his father, in any way that matters. And there wouldn\u2019t be any good reason for him to even know that Stephen Bonnet exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave that he does exist,\u201d Roger pointed out. \u201cAnd he thinks the wean is his. What if they should meet someday? When Jem\u2019s older, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She had not grown up with the habit of crossing herself at moments of stress as her father and cousin did\u2014but she did it now, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cI am not being funny,\u201d she said, sitting up straight. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. And if it did\u2014if I ever saw Stephen Bonnet anywhere near my child, I\u2019d . . . well, next time, I\u2019ll aim higher, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re determined to give the lad a good story for his classmates, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke lightly, teasing, and she relaxed a little, hoping that she had succeeded in easing any doubt he might have about what she might tell Jemmy regarding his paternity.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but he does have to know the rest, sooner or later. I don\u2019t want him to find out by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didna find out by accident. Your mother did tell you.\u201d And look where we are now. That bit went unspoken, but rang loud inside her head, as he gave her a long, straight look.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t felt compelled to come back, go through the stones to find her real father\u2014none of them would be here now. They\u2019d be safe in the twentieth century, perhaps in Scotland, perhaps in America\u2014but in a place where children didn\u2019t die of diarrhea and sudden fevers.</p><p>In a place where sudden danger didn\u2019t lurk behind every tree and war wasn\u2019t hiding under the bushes. A place where Roger\u2019s voice still sang pure and strong.</p><p>But maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014she wouldn\u2019t have Jem.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, feeling choked. \u201cI know it\u2019s my fault\u2014all of it. If I hadn\u2019t come back . . .\u201d She reached out, tentatively, and touched the ragged scar that circled his throat. He caught her hand and pulled it down.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said softly, \u201cif I could have gone anywhere to find either of my parents\u2014including hell\u2014Brianna, I would have done it.\u201d He looked up, his eyes bright green, and squeezed her hand hard. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone in this world who understands that, hen, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed back with both hands, hard. Relief that he didn\u2019t blame her loosened the cords of her body, but sorrow for his own losses\u2014and hers\u2014still filled throat and chest, heavy as wet feathers, and it hurt to breathe.</p><p>Jemmy stirred, rose suddenly upright, then fell back, still sound asleep, so that one arm flopped out of the cradle, limp as a noodle. She\u2019d frozen at his sudden movement, but now relaxed and rose to try to tuck the arm back in. Before she could reach the cradle, though, a knock came at the door.</p><p>Roger grabbed hastily for his shirt with one hand, his knife with the other.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she called, heart thumping. People didn\u2019t pay calls after dark, save in emergency.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Miss Bree,\u201d said Lizzie\u2019s voice through the wood. \u201cCan we come in, please?\u201d She sounded excited, but not alarmed. Brianna waited to be sure that Roger was decently covered, then lifted the heavy bolt.</p><p>Her first thought was that Lizzie looked excited, too; the little bondmaid\u2019s cheeks were flushed as apples, the color visible even in the darkness of the stoop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u201d was herself and the two Beardsleys, who bowed and nodded, murmuring apologies for the lateness of the hour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Brianna said automatically, glancing around for a shawl. Not only was her linen shift thin and ratty, it had an incriminating stain on the front. \u201cEr, come in!\u201d</p><p>Roger came forward to greet the unexpected guests, magnificently disregarding the fact that he was wearing nothing but a shirt, and she scuttled hastily into the dark corner behind her loom, groping for the ancient shawl she kept there as comfort for her legs while working.</p><p>Safely wrapped in this, she kicked a log to break the fire, and stooped to light a candle from the fiery coals. In the wavering glow of the candlelight, she could see that the Beardsleys were dressed with unaccustomed neatness, their hair combed and firmly plaited, each with a clean shirt and a leather vest; they didn\u2019t own coats. Lizzie was dressed in her best, too\u2014in fact, she was wearing the pale peach woolen dress they had made for her wedding.</p><p>Something was up, and it was fairly obvious what, as Lizzie buzzed earnestly into Roger\u2019s ear.</p> <p>\u201cYe want me to marry you?\u201d Roger said, in tones of astonishment. He glanced from one twin to the other. \u201cEr . . . to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d Lizzie bobbed a respectful curtsey. \u201cIt\u2019s me and Jo, sir, if ye\u2019d be sae kind. Kezzie\u2019s come to be witness.\u201d</p><p>Roger rubbed a hand over his face, looking baffled.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . but . . .\u201d He gave Brianna a pleading look.</p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble, Lizzie?\u201d Brianna asked directly, lighting a second candle and putting it in the sconce by the door. With more light, she could see that Lizzie\u2019s eyelids were reddened and swollen, as though she had been crying\u2014though her attitude was one of excited determination, rather than fear.</p> <p>\u201cNot to say trouble, exactly. But I\u2014I\u2019m wi\u2019 child, aye.\u201d Lizzie crossed her hands on her belly, protective. \u201cWe\u2014we wanted to be marrit, before I tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . .\u201d Roger gave Jo a disapproving look, but appeared no more than half-convinced. \u201cBut your father\u2014won\u2019t he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa would want us to be marrit by a priest,\u201d Lizzie explained earnestly. \u201cAnd so we will be. But ye ken, sir, it\u2019ll be months\u2014maybe years\u2014before we can find one.\u201d She cast down her eyes, blushing. \u201cI\u2014I should like to be marrit, with proper words, ken, before the babe comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, eyes drawn ineluctably to Lizzie\u2019s midsection. \u201cI grasp that. But I dinna quite understand the rush, if ye take my meaning. I mean, ye won\u2019t be noticeably more pregnant tomorrow than ye are tonight. Or next week.\u201d</p><p>Jo and Kezzie exchanged glances over Lizzie\u2019s head. Then Jo put his hand on Lizzie\u2019s waist and drew her gently to him.</p><p>\u201cSir. It\u2019s only\u2014we want to do right by each other. But we\u2019d like it to be private, see? Just me and Lizzie, and my brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust us,\u201d Kezzie echoed, drawing close. He looked earnestly at Roger. \u201cPlease, sir?\u201d He seemed to have injured his hand somehow; there was a handkerchief wound round it.</p><p>Brianna found the three of them touching almost beyond bearing; they were so innocent, and so young, the three scrubbed faces turned earnestly up to Roger in supplication. She moved closer and touched Roger\u2019s arm, warm through the cloth of his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cDo it for them,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPlease? It\u2019s not a marriage, exactly\u2014but you can make them handfast\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, but they ought to be counseled . . . her father . . .\u201d His protests trailed off as he glanced from her toward the trio, and she could see that he was as much touched by their innocence as she was. And, she thought, privately amused, he was also very much drawn by the thought of performing his first wedding, unorthodox as it might be. The circumstances would be romantic and memorable, here in the quiet of the night, vows exchanged by the light of fire and candle, with the memory of their own lovemaking warm in the shadows and the sleeping child a silent witness, both blessing and promise for the new marriage to be made.</p><p>Roger sighed deeply, then smiled at her in resignation, and turned away.</p><p>\u201cAye, all right, then. Let me put my breeches on, though; I\u2019m not conducting my first wedding bare-arsed.\u201d</p><p>ROGER HELD A SPOON of marmalade over his slice of toast, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d he said, in a strangled tone.</p> <p>\u201cOh, she didn\u2019t!\u201d Bree clapped a hand to her mouth, eyes wide above it, removing it at once to ask, \u201cBoth of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently so,\u201d I said, suppressing a most disgraceful urge to laugh. \u201cYou really married her to Jo last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help me, I did,\u201d Roger muttered. Looking thoroughly rattled, he put the spoon in his coffee cup and stirred mechanically. \u201cBut she\u2019s handfast with Kezzie, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore witnesses,\u201d I assured him, with a wary glance at Mr. Wemyss, who was sitting across the breakfast table, mouth open and apparently turned to stone.</p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d Bree said to me, \u201cI mean\u2014both of them at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, she said not,\u201d I replied, cutting my eyes toward Mr. Wemyss as an indication that perhaps this was not a suitable question to be considering in his presence, fascinating as it was.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mr. Wemyss said, in a voice from the sepulchre. \u201cShe is damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God.\u201d Mrs. Bug, saucer-eyed, crossed herself. \u201cMay Christ have mercy!\u201d</p><p>Roger took a gulp of his coffee, choked, and put it down, spluttering. Brianna pounded him helpfully on the back, but he motioned her away, eyes watering, and pulled himself together.</p><p>\u201cNow, it\u2019s maybe not so bad as it seems,\u201d he said to Mr. Wemyss, trying to find a bright side to look on. \u201cI mean, one could maybe make a case that the twins are one soul that God\u2019s put into two bodies for purposes of His own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but\u2014two bodies!\u201d Mrs. Bug said. \u201cDo ye think\u2014both at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, giving up. \u201cBut I imagine\u2014\u201d I glanced at the window, where the snow whispered at the closed shutter. It had begun to snow heavily the night before, a thick, wet snow; by now, there was nearly a foot of it on the ground, and I was reasonably sure that everyone at the table was imagining exactly what I was: a vision of Lizzie and the Beardsley twins, tucked up cozily in a warm bed of furs by a blazing fire, enjoying their honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s actually much anybody can do about it,\u201d Bree said practically. \u201cIf we say anything in public, the Presbyterians will probably stone Lizzie as a Papist whore, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss made a sound like a stepped-on pig\u2019s bladder.</p><p>\u201cCertainly no one will say anything.\u201d Roger fixed Mrs. Bug with a hard look. \u201cWill they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to tell Arch, mind, or I\u2019ll burst,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cBut no one else. Silent as the grave, I swear it, de\u2019il take me if I lie.\u201d She put both hands over her mouth in illustration, and Roger nodded.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he said dubiously, \u201cthat the marriage I performed isna actually valid as such. But then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly as valid as the handfasting Jamie did,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd besides, I think it\u2019s too late to force her to choose. Once Kezzie\u2019s thumb heals, no one will be able to tell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Lizzie, probably,\u201d Bree said. She licked a smear of honey from the corner of her mouth, regarding Roger thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder what it would be like if there were two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d both of us be thoroughly bamboozled,\u201d he assured her. \u201cMrs. Bug\u2014is there any more coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s bamboozled?\u201d The kitchen door opened in a swirl of snow and frigid air, and Jamie came in with Jem, both fresh from a visit to the privy, ruddy-faced, their hair and lashes thick with melting snowflakes.</p><p>\u201cYou, for one. You\u2019ve just been done in the eye by a nineteen-year-old bigamist,\u201d I informed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a bigamiss?\u201d Jem inquired.</p><p>\u201cA very large young lady,\u201d Roger said, taking a piece of buttered toast and thrusting it into Jem\u2019s mouth. \u201cHere. Why don\u2019t ye take that, and . . .\u201d His voice died away as he realized that he couldn\u2019t send Jem outside.</p><p>\u201cLizzie and the twins came round to Roger\u2019s last night, and he married her to Jo,\u201d I told Jamie. He blinked, water from the melting snow on his lashes running down his face.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d he said. He took a long breath, then realized he was still covered with snow, and went to shake himself at the hearth, bits of snow falling into the fire with a sputter and hiss.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, coming back to the table and sitting down beside me, \u201cat least your grandson will have a name, Joseph. It\u2019s Beardsley, either way.\u201d</p><p>This ridiculous observation seemed actually to comfort Mr. Wemyss a bit; a small bit of color came back to his cheeks, and he allowed Mrs. Bug to put a fresh bannock on his plate.</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose that\u2019s something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I really cannot see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome look,\u201d Jemmy was saying, tugging impatiently on Bree\u2019s arm. \u201cCome see, Mama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote my name! Grandda showed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you did? Well, good for you!\u201d Brianna beamed at him, then her brow furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2014just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Come see afore it\u2019s covered up!\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jamie under lowered brows.</p><p>\u201cDa, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a piece of fresh toast from the platter, and spread it neatly with butter.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be some advantage still to being a man, even if no one pays a bit of heed to what ye say. Will ye pass the marmalade, Roger Mac?\u201d</p><p>75</p><p>LICE</p><p>JEM PUT HIS ELBOWS on the table, chin on his fists, following the path of the spoon through the batter with the intent expression of a lion watching an appetizing wildebeest on its way to the water hole.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d I said, with a glance at his grubby fingers. \u201cThey\u2019ll be done in a few minutes; you can have one then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like \u2019em raw, Grandma,\u201d he protested. He widened his dark-blue eyes in wordless pleading.</p><p>\u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to eat raw things,\u201d I said sternly. \u201cThey can make you sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, Grandma.\u201d He poked a finger at my mouth, where a smudge of brownish batter remained. I cleared my throat and wiped the incriminating evidence on a towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spoil your supper,\u201d I said, but with the acuity of any jungle beast, he sensed the weakening of his prey.</p><p>\u201cPromise I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll eat everything!\u201d he said, already reaching for the spoon.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d I said, relinquishing it with some reluctance. \u201cJust a taste, now\u2014leave some for your daddy and grandda.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wordless, and licked the spoon with a long, slow swipe of the tongue, closing his eyes in ecstasy.</p><p>I found another spoon and set about dropping the cookies onto the tin sheets I used for baking. We ended in a dead heat, the sheets full and the bowl quite empty, just as footsteps came down the hallway toward the door. Recognizing Brianna\u2019s tread, I snatched the empty spoon from Jemmy and rubbed a quick towel across his smudgy mouth.</p><p>Bree stopped in the doorway, her smile turning to a look of suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking molasses cookies,\u201d I said, lifting the sheets in evidence, before sliding them into the brick oven set in the wall of the fireplace. \u201cJemmy\u2019s been helping me.\u201d</p><p>One neat red brow arched upward. She glanced from me to Jemmy, who was wearing a look of sublimely unnatural innocence. I gathered my own expression was no more convincing.</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cHow much batter did you eat, Jem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d Jemmy said, eyes going wide.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She leaned forward, and picked a speck out of his wavy red hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, then?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at it, crossing his eyes slightly in the attempt to focus.</p><p>\u201cA real big louse?\u201d he suggested brightly. \u201cReckon I got it from Rabbie McLeod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRabbie McLeod?\u201d I said, uneasily aware that Rabbie had been curled up on the kitchen settle a few days ago, his unruly black curls flowing into Jemmy\u2019s bright locks as the boys slept, waiting for their fathers. I recalled thinking at the time how charming the little boys looked, curled up head to head, their faces soft with dreaming.</p><p>\u201cHas Rabbie got lice?\u201d Bree demanded, flicking the bit of batter away from her as though it were indeed a loathsome insect.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, he\u2019s crawlin\u2019,\u201d Jemmy assured her cheerfully. \u201cHis Mam says she\u2019s gonna get his daddy\u2019s razor and shave off ever bit of his hair, him and his brothers and his daddy and his uncle Rufe too. She says they got lice hoppin\u2019 all over their bed. She\u2019s tired of bein\u2019 ate up alive.\u201d Quite casually, he lifted a hand to his head and scratched, fingers raking through his hair in a characteristic gesture I had seen all too often before.</p><p>Bree and I exchanged a brief look of horror, then she seized Jemmy by the shoulders, dragging him over to the window.</p><p>\u201cCome here!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough. Exposed to the brilliant light bouncing off the snow, the tender skin behind his ears and on the back of his neck showed the characteristic pinkness caused by scratching for lice, and a quick inspection of his head revealed the worst: tiny nits clinging to the base of the hairs, and a few reddish-brown adult lice, half the size of rice grains, who scrambled madly away into the thickets. Bree caught one and cracked it between her thumbnails, tossing the remains into the fire.</p><p>\u201cEugh!\u201d She rubbed her hands on her skirt, then pulled off the ribbon that tied back her hair, scratching vigorously. \u201cHave I got them?\u201d she asked anxiously, thrusting the crown of her head toward me.</p><p>I ruffled quickly through the thick mass of auburn and cinnamon, looking for the telltale whitish nits, then stepped back, bending my own head.</p><p>\u201cNo, have I?\u201d</p><p>The backdoor opened, and Jamie stepped in, looking only mildly surprised to find Brianna picking through my hair like a crazed baboon. Then his head jerked up, sniffing the air.</p><p>\u201cIs something burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got \u2019em, Grandda!\u201d</p><p>The exclamation reached me together with the scent of singeing molasses. I jerked upright and banged my head on the edge of the dish shelf, hard enough to make me see stars.</p><p>These cleared just in time for me to see Jemmy, standing on tiptoe as he reached into the smoking oven in the wall of the hearth, well over his head. His eyes were squinched shut with concentration, his face turned away from the waves of heat coming off the brick, and he had a towel wound clumsily round the groping hand.</p><p>Jamie reached the boy with two strides, jerking him back by the collar. He reached into the oven bare-handed and yanked out a tin sheet of smoking cookies, flinging the hot sheet away with such force that it struck the wall. Small brown disks flew off and scattered over the floor.</p><p>Adso, who had been perched in the window, helping with the louse hunt, saw what looked like prey and pounced fiercely on a fleeing cookie, which promptly burned his paws. Uttering a startled yowl, he dropped it and raced under the settle.</p><p>Jamie, shaking his scorched fingers and making extremely vulgar remarks in Gaelic, had seized a stick of kindling in his other hand and was poking into the oven, trying to extract the remaining cookie-sheet amid clouds of smoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going\u2014hey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemmy!\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s cry coincided with Bree\u2019s. Coming in on Jamie\u2019s heels, Roger\u2019s expression of bewilderment had changed at once to alarm at sight of his offspring crouched on the floor, industriously collecting cookies, and oblivious of the fact that his trailing towel was smoldering in the ashes of the cookfire.</p><p>Roger lunged for Jemmy, colliding with Bree on the same course. The two of them cannoned into Jamie, who had just maneuvered the second sheet of cookies to the edge of the oven. He reeled, staggering off balance, and the sheet clanged into the hearth, scattering lumps of smoking, molasses-scented charcoal. The cauldron, knocked askew, swung and shifted perilously on its hook, splashing soup into the coals and sending up clouds of hissing, savory steam.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or run out of the door, but settled for snatching up the towel, which had burst into flames, and beating it out on the stone-flagged hearth.</p><p>I stood up, panting, to find that my family had now managed to extricate itself from the fireplace. Roger had a squirming Jemmy in a death grip against his chest, while Bree frisked the child for burns, flames, and broken bones. Jamie, looking rather annoyed, was sucking on a blistered finger, waving smoke away from his face with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cCold water,\u201d I said, addressing the most immediate exigency. I grasped Jamie by the arm, pulled the finger out of his mouth, and stabbed it into the washbowl.</p><p>\u201cIs Jemmy all right?\u201d I asked, turning to the Happy Families tableau by the window. \u201cYes, I see he is. Do put him down, Roger, the child has lice.\u201d</p><p>Roger dropped Jemmy like a hot potato, and\u2014in the usual adult reaction to hearing the word \u201clice\u201d\u2014scratched himself. Jemmy, unaffected by the recent commotion, sat down on the floor and began to eat one of the cookies he had kept clutched in his hand throughout.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spoil your\u2014\u201d Brianna began automatically, then caught sight of the spilled cauldron and the puddled hearth, glanced at me, and shrugged. \u201cGot any more cookies?\u201d she asked Jemmy. Mouth full, he nodded, reached into his shirt, and handed her one. She viewed it critically, but took a bite anyway.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d she said, through crumbs. \u201cHm?\u201d She held the remnant out to Roger, who wolfed it one-handed, using the other to poke through Jemmy\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going round,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least, we saw half a dozen lads near Sinclair\u2019s, all shaved like convicts. Shall we have to shave your head, then?\u201d he asked, smiling at Jemmy and ruffling the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face lighted up at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWill I be bald like Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, even balder,\u201d I assured him tartly. I had in fact got a good two-inch crop at the moment, though the curliness made it look shorter, little waves and swirls hugging the curves of my skull.</p><p>\u201cShave his head?\u201d Brianna looked aghast. She turned to me. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any other good way to get rid of lice?\u201d</p><p>I looked consideringly at Jemmy\u2019s head. He had the same thick, slightly wavy hair as his mother and grandfather. I glanced at Jamie, who grinned at me, one hand in the washbowl. He knew from experience just how long it took to nit-comb that sort of hair; I\u2019d done it for him many times. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShave him,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019ll not get a lad that size to sit still long enough to comb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could use lard,\u201d I suggested dubiously. \u201cYou plaster his head with lard or bear grease and leave it for a few days. It suffocates the lice. Or at least you hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAck.\u201d Brianna viewed her son\u2019s head with disfavor, obviously envisioning the havoc he could wreak on clothes and linens, if allowed to roam at large while plastered with lard.</p><p>\u201cVinegar and a fine-comb will get out the big ones,\u201d I said, coming to peer down at the fine white line of the parting through Jemmy\u2019s ruddy hair. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get the nits, though; you have to scrape those off with your fingernails\u2014or else wait \u2019til they hatch and comb them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShave him,\u201d Roger said, shaking his head. \u201cYe never get all the nits; you have to do it over again every few days, and if ye miss a few that grow big enough to hop . . .\u201d He grinned and flicked a cookie crumb off his thumbnail; it bounced off Bree\u2019s skirt and she slapped it away, glowering at Roger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a big help!\u201d She bit her lip, frowning, then nodded reluctantly. \u201cAll right, then, I suppose there\u2019s no help for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will grow back,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>Jamie went upstairs to fetch his razor; I went to the surgery to get my surgical scissors and a bottle of oil of lavender for Jamie\u2019s burned finger. By the time I came back, Bree and Roger had their heads together over what looked like a newspaper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, coming to peer over Brianna\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFergus\u2019s maiden effort.\u201d Roger smiled up at me, and moved the paper so I could see. \u201cHe sent it up with a trader who left it at Sinclair\u2019s for Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>I craned my neck to see, and a small thrill went through me at sight of the bold headline across the top of the page:</p><p>THE NEW BERN UNION</p><p>Then I looked closer.</p><p>\u201cOnion?\u201d I said, blinking. \u201cThe Onion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he explains that,\u201d Roger said, pointing to an ornately embellished Remarks by the Proprietor in the center of the page, the legend upheld by a couple of floating cherubim. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with onions having layers\u2014complexity, you see\u2014and the . . . er\u201d\u2014his finger ran down the line\u2014\u201cthe Pungency and Savor of the Reasoned Discourse always to be exercised herein for the compleat Information and Amusement of our Purchasers and Readers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice he makes a distinction between purchasers and readers,\u201d I remarked. \u201cVery French of him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Roger agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinctly Gallic tone to some of the pieces, but you can see that Marsali must have had a hand in it\u2014and, of course, most of the advertisements were written by the people who placed them.\u201d He pointed to one small item, headed, Lost, a hat. If found in good condition, please return to the subscriber, S. Gowdy, New Bern. If not in good condition, wear it yourself.</p><p>Jamie arrived with his razor in time to hear this, and joined in the laughter. He poked a finger down the page, at another item.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s good, but I think the \u2018Poet\u2019s Corner\u2019 is maybe my favorite. Fergus couldna have done it, I dinna think; he\u2019s no ear for rhyme at all\u2014was it Marsali, d\u2019ye think, or someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead it out loud,\u201d Brianna said, reluctantly relinquishing the paper to Roger. \u201cI\u2019d better clip Jemmy before he gets away and spreads lice all over Fraser\u2019s Ridge.\u201d</p><p>Once resigned to the prospect, Brianna didn\u2019t hesitate, but tied a dishcloth round Jemmy\u2019s neck and set to with the scissors in a determined fashion that sent strands of red-gold and auburn falling to the floor like shimmering rain. Meanwhile, Roger read out, with dramatic flourishes,</p><p>\u201cOn the late Act against retailing</p><p>Spirituous Liquors, etc.\u2014</p><p>Tell me\u2014can it be understood,</p><p>This Act intends the Publick Good?</p><p>No truly; I deny it:</p><p>For if, as all allow, \u2019tis best,</p><p>Of Evils Two, to chose the least,</p><p>Then my Opinion\u2019s right.</p><p>Suppose on Search\u2014it should appear,</p><p>Ten Bunters dy\u2019d in every year\u2014</p><p>\u201c\u2014By drinking to Excess</p><p>Should thousands innocent be led</p><p>Into Despair, and lose their Bread,</p><p>Such folly to redress?</p><p>I\u2019d not be thought t\u2019encourage sin,</p><p>Or be an Advocate of Gin;</p><p>But humbly do conceive,</p><p>This scheme, tho\u2019 drawn with nicest care</p><p>Don\u2019t with Almighty Justice square</p><p>If Scriptures we believe</p><p>When Sodom\u2019s Sin for Vengeance call\u2019d</p><p>Ten righteous had its Doom forestall\u2019d</p><p>And mov\u2019d e\u2019en God to Pity.</p><p>But now Ten bare-fac\u2019d Debauchees</p><p>Some private Epicures displease,</p><p>And ruin half a City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d not be thought t\u2019encourage sin/Or be an Advocate of Gin,\u201d Bree repeated, giggling. \u201cYou notice he\u2014or she\u2014doesn\u2019t mention whisky. What\u2019s a Bunter, though? Oops, hold still, baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA harlot,\u201d Jamie said absently, stropping his razor while still reading over Roger\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a harlot?\u201d Jemmy asked, his radar naturally picking up the single indelicate word in the conversation. \u201cIs it Richie\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>Richard Woolam\u2019s sister Charlotte was a most attractive young person; she was also a most devout Quaker. Jamie exchanged glances with Roger, and coughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I shouldna think it, lad,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t say so, either! Here, are ye ready to be shaved?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, he picked up the shaving brush and lathered Jemmy\u2019s polled head, to the accompaniment of delighted squeals.</p><p>\u201cBarber, barber, shave a pig,\u201d Bree said, watching. \u201cHow many hairs to make a wig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots,\u201d I replied, sweeping up the drifts of fallen hair and throwing them into the fire, hopefully to the destruction of all resident lice. It was rather a pity; Jemmy\u2019s hair was beautiful. Still, it would grow again\u2014and the clipping showed off the lovely shape of his head, roundly pleasing as a cantaloupe.</p><p>Jamie hummed tunelessly under his breath, drawing the razor over the skin of his grandson\u2019s head with as much delicacy as if he had been shaving a honeybee.</p><p>Jemmy turned his head slightly, and I caught my breath, struck by a fleeting memory\u2014Jamie, his hair clipped short against his skull in Paris, readying himself to meet Jack Randall; readying himself to kill\u2014or be killed. Then Jemmy turned again, squirming on his stool, and the vision vanished\u2014to be replaced by something else.</p><p>\u201cWhatever is that?\u201d I leaned forward to look, as Jamie drew his razor down with a flourish and flicked away the last dollop of lather into the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bree leaned in beside me, and her eyes widened at sight of the small brown blotch. It was about the size of a farthing, quite round, just above the hairline toward the back of his head, behind the left ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, frowning. She touched it gently, but Jemmy scarcely noticed; he was squirming even more, wanting to get down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019s all right,\u201d I assured her, after a quick inspection. \u201cIt looks like what\u2019s called a nevus\u2014it\u2019s something like a flat mole, usually quite harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where did it come from? He wasn\u2019t born with it, I know!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cBabies very seldom have any sort of mole,\u201d I explained, untying my dishcloth from round Jemmy\u2019s neck. \u201cAll right, yes, you\u2019re done! Go and be good now\u2014we\u2019ll have supper as soon as I can manage. No,\u201d I added, turning back to Bree, \u201cmoles usually start to develop around three years of age\u2014though of course people can get more as they grow older.\u201d</p><p>Freed from restraint, Jemmy was rubbing his nak*d head with both hands, looking pleased and chanting, \u201cChar-lotte the Har-lot, Char-lotte the Har-lot,\u201d quietly under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s all right?\u201d Brianna was still frowning, worried. \u201cIt isn\u2019t dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Roger assured her, glancing up from the newspaper. \u201cI\u2019ve had one just like that myself, ever since I was a kid. Just . . . here.\u201d His face changed abruptly as he spoke, and his hand rose, very slowly, to rest on the back of his head\u2014just above the hairline, behind the left ear.</p><p>He looked at me, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed, the jagged rope scar dark against the sudden paleness of his skin. The down hairs rose silently on my arms.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, answering the look, and hoping my voice didn\u2019t shake too noticeably. \u201cThat sort of mark is . . . often hereditary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie said nothing, but his hand closed on mine, squeezing tight.</p><p>Jemmy was on his hands and knees now, trying to coax Adso out from under the settle. His neck was small and fragile, and his shaven head looked unearthly white and shockingly nak*d, like a mushroom poking out of the earth. Roger\u2019s eyes rested on it for a moment; then he turned to Bree.</p><p>\u201cI do believe perhaps I\u2019ve picked up a few lice myself,\u201d he said, his voice just a tiny bit too loud. He reached up, pulled off the thong that bound his thick black hair, and scratched his head vigorously with both hands. Then he picked up the scissors, smiling, and held them out to her. \u201cLike father, like son, I suppose. Give us a hand here, aye?\u201d</p><p>PART TEN</p> <p>Where\u2019s Perry Mason</p><p>When You Need Him?</p><p>76</p><p>DANGEROUS</p><p>CORRESPONDENCE</p> <p>From Mount Josiah Plantation in the Colony of Virginia,</p><p>Lord John Grey to Mr. James Fraser, Esq.,</p><p>Fraser\u2019s Ridge, North Carolina,</p><p>upon the Sixth of March, Anno Domini 1775</p><p>Dear Mr. Fraser\u2014</p><p>What in the Name of God are you about? I have known you in the course of our long Acquaintance to be many Things\u2014Intemperate and Stubborn being two of them\u2014but have always known you for a Man of Intelligence and Honor.</p> <p>Yet despite explicit Warnings, I find your Name upon more than one List of suspected Traitors and Seditionists, associated with illegal Assemblies, and thus subject to Arrest. The Fact that you are still at Liberty, my Friend, reflects nothing more than the Lack of Troops at present available in North Carolina\u2014and that may change rapidly. Josiah Martin has implored London for Help, and it will be forthcoming, I assure you.</p><p>Was Gage not more than sufficiently occupied in Boston, and Lord Dunsmore\u2019s Virginia troops still in process of Assembly, the Army would be upon you within a few Months. Do not delude yourself; the King may be misguided in his Actions, but the Government perceives\u2014if belatedly\u2014the Level of Turmoil in the Colonies, and is moving as rapidly as may be to suppress it, before greater Harm can ensue.</p><p>Whatever else you may be, you are no Fool, and so I must assume you realize the Consequences of your Actions. But I would be less than a Friend did I not put the Case to you bluntly: you expose your Family to the utmost Danger by your Actions, and you put your own Head in a Noose.</p><p>For the Sake of whatever Affection you may yet bear me, and for the Sake of those dear Connexions between your Family and myself\u2014I beg you to renounce these most dangerous Associations while there is still Time.</p><p>John</p><p>I read the letter through, then looked up at Jamie. He was sitting at his desk, papers strewn in every direction, scattered with the small brown fragments of broken sealing wax. Bobby Higgins had brought a good many letters, newspapers, and packages\u2014Jamie had put off reading Lord John\u2019s letter \u2019til the last.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very much afraid for you,\u201d I said, putting the single sheet of paper down on top of the rest.</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p> <p>\u201cFor a man of his parts to refer to the King\u2019s actions as possibly \u2018misguided\u2019 is verra close to treason, Sassenach,\u201d he observed, though I thought he was joking.</p><p>\u201cThese lists he mentions\u2014do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged at that, and poked through one of the untidy piles with a forefinger, pulling out a smeared sheet that had obviously been dropped in a puddle at some point.</p><p>\u201cLike that, I suppose,\u201d he said, handing it over. It was unsigned, and nearly illegible, a misspelt and vicious denunciation of various Outrages and Debached Persons\u2014here listed\u2014whose speech, action, and appearance was a threat to all who valued peace and prosperity. These, the writer felt, should be shown whats what, presumably by being beaten, skinned alive, rold in bolling Tar and plac\u2019d on a Rail, or in particularly pernicious cases, Hanged outright from there own Rooftrees.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you pick that up?\u201d I dropped it on the desk, using two fingers.</p><p>\u201cIn Campbelton. Someone sent it to Farquard, as Justice of the Peace. He gave it to me, because my name is on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d I squinted at the straggling letters. \u201cOh, so it is. J. Frayzer. You\u2019re sure it\u2019s you? There are quite a few Frasers, after all, and not a few named John, James, Jacob, or Joseph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelatively few who could be described as a Red-haired dejenerate Pox-ridden Usuring Son of a Bitch who skulks in Brothels when not drunk and comitting Riot in the Street, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I missed that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the exposition at the bottom.\u201d He gave the paper a brief, indifferent glance. \u201cI think Buchan the butcher wrote it, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways assuming that \u2018usuring\u2019 is a word, I don\u2019t see where he gets that bit; you haven\u2019t any money to lend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna suppose a basis in truth is strictly required, under the circumstances, Sassenach,\u201d he said very dryly. \u201cAnd thanks to MacDonald and wee Bobby, there are a good many folk who think I do have money\u2014and if I am not inclined to lend it to them, why then, plainly it\u2019s a matter of my having put my fortune all in the hands of Jews and Whig speculators, as I am intent upon ruining trade for my own profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a somewhat more literary effort,\u201d he said, shuffling through the pile and pulling out an elegant parchment sheet, done in a copperplate hand. This one had been sent to a newspaper in Hillsboro, and was signed, A Friend to Justice; and while it didn\u2019t name Jamie, it was clear who the subject of the denunciation was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hair,\u201d I said, looking critically at him. \u201cIf you wore a wig, they\u2019d have a much harder time of it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a sardonic shrug. The commonly held view of red hair as an indicator of low character and moral coarseness, if not outright demonic possession, was by no means limited to anonymous ill-wishers. The knowledge of that view\u2014together with personal disinclination\u2014had quite a bit to do with the fact that he never did wear either wig or powder, even in situations where a proper gentleman would.</p><p>Without asking, I reached for a stack of the papers and began to leaf through them. He made no move to stop me, but sat quietly watching, listening to the thrum of the rain.</p><p>A heavy spring storm was washing down outside, and the air was cold and damp, thick with the green scents of the forest insinuating themselves through the crevices of door and window. I sometimes had the sudden feeling, hearing the wind coming through the trees, that the wilderness outside meant to come in, march through the house, and obliterate it, erasing all trace of us.</p><p>The letters were a mixed bag. Some were from the members of the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence, with bits of news, most of it from the north. Continental Association Committees had sprung up in New Hampshire and New Jersey, these bodies now beginning to virtually take over the functions of government, as the royal governors lost their grip on assemblies, courts, and Customs, the remnants of organization falling ever deeper into disarray.</p><p>Boston was still occupied by Gage\u2019s troops, and some of the letters continued the appeals for food and supplies to be sent to the succor of her citizens\u2014we had sent two hundredweight of barley during the winter, which one of the Woolams had undertaken to get into the city, along with three wagonloads of other foodstuffs contributed by the inhabitants of the Ridge.</p><p>Jamie had picked up his quill, and was writing something, slowly, to accommodate the stiffness of his hand.</p><p>Next up was a note from Daniel Putnam, circulated through Massachusetts, noting the rising of militia companies in the countryside, and asking for arms and powder. It was signed by a dozen other men, each one bearing witness to the truth of the situation in his own township.</p><p>A Second Continental Congress was proposed, to meet in Philadelphia, the date yet undecided.</p><p>Georgia had formed a Provincial Congress, but as the Loyalist letter-writer\u2014plainly assuming Jamie to be like-minded\u2014triumphantly noted, There is no Sense of Grievance toward Great Britain here, as elsewhere; Loyalist Sentiment is so strong that only five Parishes of twelve have sent anyone to this upstart and illegal Congress.</p><p>A much-bedraggled copy of the Massachusetts Gazette, dated February 6, containing a letter, circled in ink and titled The Rule of Law and the Rule of Men. It was signed Novanglus\u2014which I took to be a sort of hog-Latin for \u201cnew Englishman\u201d\u2014and to be a response to previous letters by a Tory who signed himself Massachusettensis, of all things.</p><p>I had no idea who Massachusettensis might be, but I recognized a few phrases from Novanglus\u2019s letter, from long-ago bits of Bree\u2019s schoolwork\u2014John Adams, in good form.</p><p>\u201cA government of laws, not of men,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat sort of pen name would you use, if you were going to write this sort of thing?\u201d Glancing up, I caught sight of him, looking sheepish to a degree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing it already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just the odd bittie letter here or there,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cNo pamphlets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, deprecating.</p><p>\u201cScotus Americanus, but only \u2019til I think of something better. There are a few others using that name, that I ken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something. The King will have a harder time picking you out of the crowd.\u201d Muttering \u201cMassachusettensis\u201d to myself, I picked up the next document.</p><p>A note from John Stuart, much affronted by Jamie\u2019s abrupt resignation, noting that the most illegal and prodigal Congress, as they call it of Massachusetts had formally invited the Stockbridge Indians to enlist in the service of the colony, and informing Jamie that should any of the Cherokee follow suit, he, John Stuart, would take the greatest pleasure in personally ensuring that he, Jamie Fraser, was hanged for treason.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose John Stuart even knows you have red hair,\u201d I observed, laying it aside. I felt a trifle shaky, in spite of my attempts to joke about it. Seeing it all laid out in black and white solidified the clouds that had been gathering round us, and I felt the first chilling drop of icy rain on my skin, despite the woolen shawl around my shoulders.</p><p>There was no hearth in the study; only a small brazier that we used for heat. It was burning now in the corner, and Jamie rose, picked up a stack of letters, and began to feed them to the fire, one by one.</p><p>I had a sudden rush of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and saw him standing by the hearth in the drawing room of his cousin Jared\u2019s house in Paris, feeding letters to the fire. The stolen letters of Jacobite conspirators, rising in white puffs of smoke, the gathering clouds of a storm long past.</p><p>I remembered what Fergus had said, in answer to Jamie\u2019s instructions: \u201cI remember how this game is played.\u201d So did I, and spicules of ice began to form in my blood.</p><p>Jamie dropped the last flaming fragment into the brazier, then sanded the page he had been writing, shook the sand off, and handed it to me. He had used one of the sheets of the special paper Bree had made by pressing a digested pulp of rags and plant matter between silk screens. It was thicker than the usual, with a soft, glossy texture, and she had mixed berries and tiny leaves into the pulp, so that here and there a small red stain spread like blood beneath the shadow of a leaf\u2019s silhouette.</p><p>From Fraser\u2019s Ridge, in the Colony of North Carolina,</p><p>this 16th day of March, Anno Domini 1775,</p><p>James Fraser to Lord John Grey, of Mount Josiah Plantation,</p><p>in the Colony of Virginia</p><p>My dear John\u2014</p><p>It is too late.</p><p>Our continued Correspondence cannot but prove a Danger to you, but it is with the greatest Regret that I sever this Link between us.</p><p>Believe me ever</p><p>Your most humble and affectionate Friend,</p><p>Jamie</p><p>I read it in silence, and handed it back. As he poked about in search of the sealing wax, I noticed a small wrapped parcel on the corner of his desk that had been hidden by the drifts of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I picked it up; it was amazingly heavy for its size.</p><p>\u201cA present from his Lordship, for wee Jemmy.\u201d He lit the beeswax taper from the brazier and held it over the seam of the folded letter. \u201cA set of lead soldiers, Bobby says.\u201d</p><p>77</p><p>THE EIGHTEENTH OF APRIL</p><p>ROGER CAME AWAKE QUITE SUDDENLY , with no notion what had wakened him. It was full dark, but the air had the still, inward feel of the small hours; the world holding its breath, before dawn comes on a rising wind.</p><p>He turned his head on the pillow and saw that Brianna was awake, too; she lay looking upward, and he caught the brief flicker of her eyelids as she blinked.</p><p>He moved a hand to touch her, and hers closed over it. An adjuration to silence? He lay very still, listening, but heard nothing. An ember broke in the hearth with a muffled crack and her hand tightened. Jemmy flung himself over in bed with a rustle of quilts, let out a small yelp, and fell silent. The night was undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he said, low-voiced.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn to look at him; her eyes were fixed now on the window, a dark gray rectangle, barely visible.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was the eighteenth of April,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d Her voice was calm, but there was something in it that made him move closer, so they lay side by side, touching from shoulder to foot.</p><p>Somewhere to the north of them, men were gathering in the cold spring night. Eight hundred British troops, groaning and cursing as they dressed by candlelight. Those who had gone to bed rousing to the beat of the drum passing by the houses and warehouses and churches where they quartered, those who hadn\u2019t, stumbling from dice and drink, the warm hearths of taverns, the warm arms of women, hunting lost boots and seizing weapons, turning out by twos and threes and fours, clanking and mumbling through the streets of frozen mud to the muster point.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in Boston,\u201d she said, her voice softly conversational. \u201cEvery kid in Boston learned that poem, somewhere along the line. I learned it in fifth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, my children, and you shall hear/Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\u201d Roger smiled, envisioning her in the uniform of Saint Finbar\u2019s parochial school, blue overall jumper, white blouse, and knee socks. He\u2019d seen her fifth-grade school photograph once; she looked like a small, fierce, disheveled tiger that some maniac had dressed in doll\u2019s clothes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five/Hardly a man is now alive/Who remembers that famous day and year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a man,\u201d Roger echoed softly. Someone\u2014who? A householder, eavesdropping on the British commanders quartered in his house? A barmaid, bringing mugs of pokered hot rum to a couple of sergeants? There was no keeping of secrets, not with eight hundred men on the move. It was all a matter of time. Someone had sent word from the occupied city, word that the British meant to seize the stored arms and powder in Concord, and at the same time, arrest Hancock and Samuel Adams\u2014the founder of the Committee of Safety, the inflammatory speaker, the leaders of this treasonous rebellion\u2014reported to be in Lexington.</p><p>Eight hundred men to capture two? Good odds. And a silversmith and his friends, alarmed at the news, had set out into that cold night. Bree continued:</p><p>\u201cHe said to his friend, \u2018If the British march</p><p>By land or sea from the town tonight,</p><p>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</p><p>Of the North Church tower as a signal light\u2014</p><p>One if by land, and two if by sea;</p><p>And I on the opposite shore will be,</p><p>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</p><p>Through every Middlesex village and farm,</p><p>For the country folk to be up and to arm.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t write poems like that anymore,\u201d Roger said. But in spite of his cynicism, he couldn\u2019t bloody help seeing it: the steam of a horse\u2019s breath, white in darkness, and across the black water, the tiny star of a lantern, high above the sleeping town. And then another.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen he said \u2018Good-night!\u2019 and with muffled oar</p><p>Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</p><p>Just as the moon rose over the bay,</p><p>Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</p><p>The Somerset, British man-of-war;</p><p>A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</p><p>Across the moon like a prison bar,</p><p>And a huge black hulk, that was magnified</p><p>By its own reflection in the tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not too bad,\u201d he said judiciously. \u201cI like the bit about the Somerset. Rather a painterly description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She kicked him, though without real violence. \u201cIt goes on about his friend, who wanders and watches, with eager ears\u2014\u201d Roger snorted, and she kicked him again. \u201cTill in the silence around him he hears/The muster of men at the barrack door/The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet/And the measured tread of the grenadiers/Marching down to their boats on the shore.\u201d</p><p>He had visited her in Boston in the spring. In mid-April, the trees would have no more than a haze of green, their branches still mostly bare against pale skies. The nights were still frigid, but the cold was somehow touched with life, a freshness moving through the icy air.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s a boring part about the friend climbing the stairs of the church tower, but I like the next verse.\u201d Her voice, already soft, dropped a little, whispering.</p><p>\u201cBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,</p><p>In their night encampment on the hill,</p><p>Wrapped in silence so deep and still</p><p>That he could hear, like a sentinel\u2019s tread,</p><p>The watchful night-wind, as it went</p><p>Creeping along from tent to tent,</p><p>And seeming to whisper, \u2018All is well!\u2019</p><p>A moment only he feels the spell</p><p>Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread</p><p>Of the lonely belfry and the dead;</p><p>For suddenly all his thoughts are bent</p><p>On a shadowy something far away,</p><p>Where the river widens to meet the bay\u2014</p><p>A line of black that bends and floats</p><p>On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s a lot of stuff with old Paul killing time waiting for the signal,\u201d she said, abandoning the dramatic whisper for a more normal tone of voice. \u201cBut it finally shows up, and then . . .</p><p>\u201cA hurry of hoofs in a village street,</p><p>A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,</p><p>And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark</p><p>Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;</p><p>That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,</p><p>The fate of a nation was riding that night;</p><p>And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,</p><p>Kindled the land into flame with its heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d His hand curved over her thigh, just above the knee, in case she might kick him again, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you remember the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he goes along by the Mystic River,\u201d Brianna said, ignoring him, \u201cand then there are three verses, as he passes through the townships:</p><p>\u201cIt was twelve by the village clock</p><p>When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</p><p>He heard the crowing of the cock,</p><p>\u201cAnd the barking of the farmer\u2019s dog,</p><p>And felt the damp of the river fog,</p><p>That rises after the sun goes down.</p><p>\u201cIt was one by the village clock,</p><p>When he galloped into Lexington.</p><p>He saw the gilded weathercock</p><p>Swim in the moonlight as he passed,</p><p>And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,</p><p>Gaze at him with a spectral glare,</p><p>As if they already stood aghast</p><p>At the bloody work they would look upon.</p><p>\u201cIt was two by the village clock\u2014and yes, I hear the clock chiming in the first lines, be quiet!\u201d He had in fact drawn breath, but not to interrupt, only because he\u2019d suddenly realized he\u2019d been holding it. \u201cIt was two by the village clock,\u201d she repeated,</p><p>\u201cWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.</p><p>He heard the bleating of the flock,</p><p>And the twitter of birds among the trees,</p><p>And felt the breath of the morning breeze</p><p>Blowing over the meadow brown.</p><p>And one was safe and asleep in his bed</p><p>Who at the bridge would be first to fall,</p><p>Who that day would be lying dead,</p><p>Pierced by a British musket ball.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rest.\u201d She stopped abruptly, her hand tight on his.</p><p>From one moment to the next, the character of the night had changed. The stillness of the small hours had ceased, and a breath of wind moved through the trees outside. All of a sudden, the night was alive again, but dying now, rushing toward dawn.</p><p>If not actively twittering, the birds were wakeful; something called, over and over, in the nearby wood, high and sweet. And above the stale, heavy scent of the fire, he breathed the wild clean air of morning, and felt his heart beat with sudden urgency.</p><p>\u201cTell me the rest,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He saw the shadows of men in the trees, the stealthy knocking on doors, the low-voiced, excited conferences\u2014and all the while, the light growing in the east. The lap of water and creak of oars, the sound of restless kine lowing to be milked, and on the rising breeze the smell of men, stale with sleep and empty of food, harsh with black powder and the scent of steel.</p><p>And without thinking, pulled his hand from his wife\u2019s grasp, rolled over her, and pulling up the shift from her thighs, took her hard and fast, in vicarious sharing of that mindless urge to spawn that attended the imminent presence of death.</p><p>Lay on her trembling, the sweat drying on his back in the breeze from the window, heart thumping in his ears. For the one, he thought. The one who would be the first to fall. The poor sod who maybe hadn\u2019t swived his wife in the dark and taken the chance to leave her with child, because he had no notion what was coming with the dawn. This dawn.</p><p>Brianna lay still under him; he could feel the rise and fall of her breath, powerful ribs that lifted even under his weight.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rest,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cI would sell my soul to be there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said, but her hand rose, and settled on his back in what might be benediction. They lay still, watching the light grow by degrees, keeping silence.</p><p>THIS SILENCE WAS broken a quarter of an hour later, by the sound of rushing footsteps and a pounding at the door. Jemmy popped out of his blankets like a cuckoo from a clock, eyes round, and Roger heaved himself up, hurriedly brushing down his nightshirt.</p><p>It was one of the Beardsleys, face pinched and white in the gray light. He paid no attention to Roger, but cried out to Brianna, \u201cLizzie\u2019s having the baby, come quick!\u201d, before dashing off in the direction of the Big House, where the figure of his brother could be seen gesticulating wildly on the porch.</p><p>Brianna flung on her clothes and burst out of the cabin, leaving Roger to deal with Jemmy. She met her mother, similarly disheveled but with a neatly packed medical kit slung over her shoulder, hurrying toward the narrow path that led past spring house and stable, into the distant woods where the Beardsleys\u2019 cabin lay.</p><p>\u201cShe should have come down last week,\u201d Claire gasped. \u201cI told her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. She said . . .\u201d Brianna gave up the attempt to speak. The Beardsley twins had long outdistanced them, sprinting through the wood like deer, whooping and yelling\u2014whether from sheer excitement at their impending fatherhood, or to let Lizzie know help was on the way, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Claire had worried about Lizzie\u2019s malaria, she knew. And yet the yellow shadow that so often hung over her erstwhile bondmaid had all but disappeared during her pregnancy; Lizzie bloomed.</p><p>Nonetheless, Brianna felt her stomach clench in fear as they came into sight of the Beardsleys\u2019 cabin. The hides had been moved outside, stacked round the tiny house like a barricade, and the smell of them gave her a moment\u2019s terrible vision of the MacNeills\u2019 cabin, filled with death.</p><p>The door hung open, though, and there were no flies. She forced herself to hang back an instant, to let Claire go in first, but hurried in on her heels\u2014to find that they were too late.</p><p>Lizzie sat up in a blood-smeared bower of furs, blinking with amazed stupefaction at a small, round, blood-smeared baby, who was regarding her with the exact same expression of open-mouthed astonishment.</p><p>Jo and Kezzie were clutching each other, too excited and afraid to speak. From the corner of her eye, Brianna saw their mouths opening and closing in syncopation, and wanted to laugh, but instead followed her mother to the bedside.</p><p>\u201cHe just popped out!\u201d Lizzie was saying, glancing momentarily at Claire, but then jerking her fascinated gaze back to the baby, as though she expected him\u2014yes, it was a him, Brianna saw\u2014to disappear as suddenly as he had arrived.</p><p>\u201cMy back hurt something dreadful, all last night, so I couldna sleep, and the lads took it in turns to rub me, but it didna really help, and then when I got up to go to the privy this morning, all the water burst forth from betwixt my legs\u2014just as ye said it would, ma\u2019am!\u201d she said to Claire. \u201cAnd so I said to Jo and Kezzie they must run fetch ye, but I didna ken quite what to do next. So I set about to mix up batter for to make hoecake for breakfast\u201d\u2014she waved at the table, where a bowl of flour sat with a jug of milk and two eggs\u2014\u201cand next thing, I had this terrible urge to\u2014to\u2014\u201d She blushed, a deep, becoming peony color.</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldna even reach the chamber-pot. I just squatted there by the table, and\u2014and\u2014pop! There he was, right on the ground beneath me!\u201d</p><p>Claire had picked the new arrival up, and was cooing reassurances to him, while deftly checking whatever it was one checked about new babies. Lizzie had made a blanket in preparation, carefully knitted of lamb\u2019s wool, dyed with indigo. Claire glanced at the pristine blanket, then pulled a length of stained, soft flannel from her kit. Wrapping the baby in it, she handed him to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cHold him a moment while I deal with the cord, will you, darling?\u201d she said, pulling scissors and thread from her kit. \u201cThen you can clean him off a bit\u2014there\u2019s a bottle of oil in here\u2014while I take care of Lizzie. And you lot,\u201d she added, glancing sternly at the Beardsleys, \u201cgo outside.\u201d</p><p>The baby moved suddenly inside his wrappings, startling Brianna with the sudden vivid recollection of tiny, solid limbs pushing from inside: a kick to the liver, the liquid swell and shift as head or buttocks pressed up in a hard, smooth curve beneath her ribs.</p><p>\u201cHallo, little guy,\u201d she said softly, cuddling him against her shoulder. He smelled strongly and strangely of the sea, she thought, and oddly fresh against the acrid pungency of the hides outside.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d Lizzie gave a startled squeal, as Claire kneaded her belly, and there was a juicy, slithering sort of sound. Brianna remembered that vividly, too; the placenta, that liverish, slippery afterthought of birth, almost soothing as it passed over the much-abused tissues with a sense of peaceful completion. All over, and the stunned mind began to comprehend survival.</p><p>There was a gasp from the doorway, and she looked up to see the Beardsleys, side by side and saucer-eyed.</p><p>\u201cShoo!\u201d she said firmly, and flipped a hand at them. They promptly disappeared, leaving her to the entertaining task of cleaning and oiling the flailing limbs and creased body. He was a small baby, but round: round-faced, very round-eyed for a newborn\u2014he hadn\u2019t cried at all, but was plainly awake and alert\u2014and with a round little belly, from which the stump of his umbilical cord protruded, dark purple and fresh.</p><p>His look of astonishment had not faded; he goggled up at her, solemn as a fish, though she could feel the huge smile on her own face.</p><p>\u201cYou are so cute!\u201d she told him. He smacked his lips in a thoughtful sort of way, and crinkled his brow.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hungry!\u201d she called over her shoulder. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Lizzie croaked. \u201cMother of God, how can ye be ready for something like this?\u201d, which made Claire and Brianna both laugh like loons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nonetheless, Lizzie reached for the little blue-wrapped bundle and put it uncertainly to her breast. There was a certain amount of fumbling and increasingly anxious grunts from the baby, but at last a suitable connection was established, making Lizzie utter a brief shriek of surprise, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>At this point, Brianna became aware that there had been conversation going on outside for some time\u2014a mutter of male voices, deliberately pitched low, in a confusion of speculation and puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you can let them in now. Then put the griddle in the fire, if you would.\u201d Claire, beaming fondly at mother and child, was mixing the neglected batter.</p><p>Brianna poked her head out of the cabin door, to find Jo, Kezzie, her own father, Roger, and Jemmy, clustered in a knot a little distance away. They all glanced up when they saw her, with expressions ranging from vaguely shamefaced pride to simple excitement.</p> <p>\u201cMama! Is the baby here?\u201d Jem rushed up, pushing to get past her into the cabin, and she grabbed him by the collar.</p><p>\u201cYes. You can come see him, but you have to be quiet. He\u2019s very new, and you don\u2019t want to scare him, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d one of the Beardsleys asked, excited. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told ye so!\u201d his brother said, nudging him in the ribs. \u201cI said I saw a wee prick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say things like \u2018prick\u2019 in front of ladies,\u201d Jem informed him severely, turning to frown at him. \u201cAnd Mama says be quiet!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d said the Beardsley twin, abashed. \u201cOh, aye, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Moving with an exaggerated caution that made her want to laugh, the twins tiptoed into the cabin, followed by Jem, Jamie\u2019s hand firm on his shoulder, and Roger.</p><p>\u201cIs Lizzie all right?\u201d he asked softly, pausing to kiss her briefly in passing.</p><p>\u201cA little overwhelmed, I think, but fine.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie was in fact sitting up, soft blond hair now combed and shining around her shoulders, glowing with happiness at Jo and Kezzie, who knelt at her bedside, grinning like apes.</p><p>\u201cMay the blessing of Bride and of Columba be on you, young woman,\u201d Jamie said formally in Gaelic, bowing to her, \u201cand may the love of Christ sustain you always in your motherhood. May milk spring from your br**sts like water from the rock and may you rest secure in the arms of your\u201d\u2014he coughed briefly, glancing at the Beardsleys\u2014\u201chusband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t say \u2018prick,\u2019 why can you say \u2018breasts\u2019?\u201d Jemmy inquired, interested.</p><p>\u201cYe can\u2019t, unless it\u2019s a prayer,\u201d his father informed him. \u201cGrandda was giving Lizzie a blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Are there any prayers with pricks in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are,\u201d Roger replied, carefully avoiding Brianna\u2019s eye, \u201cbut ye don\u2019t say them out loud. Why don\u2019t ye go and help Grannie with the breakfast?\u201d</p><p>The iron griddle was sizzling with fat, and the fragrant smell of fresh batter filled the room as Claire began to pour spoonfuls onto the hot metal.</p><p>Jamie and Roger, having presented their compliments to Lizzie, had stepped back a bit, to give the little family a moment to themselves\u2014though the cabin was so small, there was barely room for everyone to fit inside.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Jo\u2014or possibly Kezzie\u2014whispered, touching her hair with an awed forefinger. \u201cYe look like the new moon, Lizzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt ye very much, sweetheart?\u201d murmured Kezzie\u2014or maybe Jo\u2014stroking the back of her hand.</p> <p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d she said, stroking Kezzie\u2019s hand, then lifting her palm to cup Jo\u2019s cheek. \u201cLook. Is he no the bonniest wee creature ye\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d The baby had drunk his fill and fallen asleep; he let go the nipple with an audible pop! and rolled back in his mother\u2019s arm like a dormouse, mouth a little open.</p><p>The twins made identical soft sounds of awe, and looked doe-eyed at their\u2014well, what else could one say? Brianna thought\u2014their son.</p><p>\u201cOh, such dear wee fingers!\u201d Kezzie\u2014or Jo\u2014breathed, touching the little pink fist with a dirty forefinger.</p><p>\u201cIs he all there?\u201d Jo\u2014or Kezzie\u2014asked. \u201cYe\u2019ve looked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Lizzie assured him. \u201cHere\u2014d\u2019ye want to hold him?\u201d Not pausing for assent, she put the bundle into his arms. Whichever twin it was looked at once thrilled and terrified, and glanced wildly at his brother for support.</p><p>Brianna, enjoying the tableau, felt Roger close behind her.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they sweet?\u201d she whispered, reaching back for his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, a smile in his voice. \u201cEnough to make ye want another, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was an innocent remark; she could tell he had meant nothing by it\u2014but he heard the echo, even as she did, and coughed, letting go her hand.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014that\u2019s for Lizzie.\u201d Claire was handing a plate of fragrant cakes, drizzled with butter and honey, to Jem. \u201cIs anyone else hungry?\u201d</p><p>The general stampede in response to this enabled Brianna to hide her feelings, but they were still there\u2014and painfully clear, if still tangled.</p><p>Yes, she did want another baby, thank you, she thought fiercely at Roger\u2019s oblivious back. In the instant of holding the newborn child, she wanted it with a yearning of flesh that surpassed hunger or thirst. And she would have loved to blame him for the fact that it hadn\u2019t happened yet.</p><p>It had taken a true leap of faith, across the vertiginous abyss of knowledge, for her to put aside her dauco seeds, those fragile pellets of protection. But she\u2019d done it. And nothing. Lately, she\u2019d been thinking uneasily of what Ian had told her about his wife and their struggles to conceive. True, she had suffered no miscarriage, and was profoundly grateful for that. But the part he had told her, where their lovemaking became more mechanical and desperate\u2014that was beginning to loom like a specter in the distance. It hadn\u2019t gotten that bad yet\u2014but more often than not, she turned into Roger\u2019s arms, thinking, Now? Will it be this time? But it never was.</p><p>The twins were becoming more comfortable with their offspring, their dark heads pressed close together, tracing the chubby outlines of his sleeping features and wondering aloud who he most resembled, of all idiotic things.</p><p>Lizzie was single-mindedly devouring her second plate of hoecakes, accompanied by grilled sausages. The smell was wonderful, but Brianna wasn\u2019t hungry.</p><p>It was a good thing that they knew for sure, she told herself, watching Roger take his turn to hold the baby, his dark, lean face softening. If there had still been any doubt that Jemmy was Roger\u2019s child, he would have blamed himself as Ian did, thought there was something wrong with him. As it was . . .</p><p>Had something happened to her? she wondered uneasily. Had Jemmy\u2019s birth damaged something?</p><p>Jamie was holding the new baby now, one big hand cradling the round little head, smiling down with that look of soft affection so peculiar\u2014and endearing\u2014to men. She did long to see that look on Roger\u2019s face, holding his own newborn child.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser.\u201d Lizzie, filled at last with sausages, put aside her empty plate and leaned forward, looking earnestly up at Jamie. \u201cMy father. Does\u2014does he know?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help glancing at the empty doorway behind him.</p><p>Jamie looked momentarily disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and handed the baby carefully to Roger, clearly taking advantage of the pause to try to think of some less-hurtful way to phrase the truth.</p><p>\u201cAye, he kens the babe was on the way,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cI told him.\u201d</p><p>And he had not come. Lizzie\u2019s lips pressed together, and a shadow of unhappiness crossed the new-moon glow of her face.</p><p>\u201cHad we\u2014had I\u2014one of us\u2014best go and tell him, sir?\u201d one of the twins asked hesitantly. \u201cThat the child\u2019s here, I mean, and . . . and that Lizzie\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated, clearly uncertain whether that would be a good idea or not. Mr. Wemyss, pale and ill-looking, had not referred to his daughter, his putative sons-in-law, or his theoretical grandchild since the imbroglio surrounding Lizzie\u2019s multiple weddings. Now that the grandchild was a concrete fact, though . . .</p><p>\u201cWhatever he thinks he ought to do,\u201d Claire said, her face slightly troubled, \u201che\u2019ll want to know that they\u2019re all right, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Jamie agreed. He glanced dubiously at the twins. \u201cI\u2019m just no entirely sure it should be Jo or Kezzie to tell him, though.\u201d</p><p>The twins exchanged a long glance, in which some decision seemed to be reached.</p><p>\u201cIt should, sir,\u201d one of them said firmly, turning to Jamie. \u201cThe baby\u2019s ourn, but it\u2019s his blood, too. That\u2019s a link between us; he\u2019ll know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want him to be crosswise with Lizzie, sir,\u201d his brother said, more soft-spoken. \u201cIt hurts her. Might be the baby would . . . ease things, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face betrayed nothing other than a studied attention to the matter at hand, but Brianna saw him dart a quick glance at Roger before returning his gaze to the bundle in Roger\u2019s arm, and she hid a smile. He had certainly not forgotten his own acrimonious first response to Roger, but it had been Roger\u2019s claiming of Jem that had established the first\u2014and very fragile\u2014link in the chain of acceptance that she thought now bound Roger nearly as close to Jamie\u2019s heart as she herself.</p><p>\u201cAye, then,\u201d Jamie said, still reluctant. He very much disliked being involved in this situation, she could tell\u2014but hadn\u2019t yet succeeded in figuring out any way of dealing with it. \u201cGo and tell him. Just the one of ye, though! And should he come, t\u2019other of ye keep well out of his sight, d\u2019ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, sir,\u201d both of them assured him in unison. Jo\u2014or Kezzie\u2014frowned a little at the bundle, and hesitantly extended his arms. \u201cShould I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d Lizzie was sitting bolt upright, her arms braced to keep her weight off her tender nether parts. Her small fair brow was set in a frown of determination. \u201cTell him we\u2019re well, aye. But if he wants to see the bairn\u2014he\u2019ll come, and welcome. But if he\u2019ll no set foot upon my threshold . . . well, then, he\u2019s no welcome to see his grandson. Tell him,\u201d she repeated, easing herself back upon her pillows.</p><p>\u201cNow give my bairnie to me.\u201d She held out her arms, and clutched the sleeping baby to her, closing her eyes against any possibility of argument or reproach.</p><p>78</p><p>THE UNIVERSAL</p><p>BROTHERHOOD OF MAN</p><p>BRIANNA LIFTED THE WAXED CLOTH covering one of the big earthenware basins, and sniffed, taking pleasure in the musty, turned-earth smell. She stirred the pale mess with a stick, lifting it out periodically in order to assess the texture of the pulp that dripped from it.</p><p>Not bad. Another day, and it would be dissolved enough to press. She considered whether to add more of the dilute sulfuric acid solution, but decided against it, and instead reached into the bowl at her side, filled with the limp petals of dogwood and redbud flowers gathered for her by Jemmy and Aidan. She scattered a handful of these delicately over the grayish pulp, stirred them in, then covered the bowl again. By tomorrow, they\u2019d be no more than faint outlines, but still visible as shadows in the finished sheets of paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d always heard that paper mills stank.\u201d Roger made his way through the bushes toward her. \u201cPerhaps they use something else in the making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad I\u2019m not tanning hides,\u201d she advised him. \u201cIan says the Indian women use dog turds for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do European tanners; they just call the stuff \u2018pure.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure dog turds, I suppose,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Coming up beside her, he looked with interest at her own small paper factory: a dozen big, fired-clay basins, each filled with scraps of used paper, worn-out scraps of silk and cotton, flax fibers, the soft pith of cattail reeds, and anything else she could get her hands on that might be useful, torn to shreds or ground small in a quern. She\u2019d dug out a small seep, and laid one of her broken water pipes as a catch basin, to provide a convenient water supply; nearby, she\u2019d built a platform of stone and wood, on which stood the framed silk screens in which she pressed the pulp.</p><p>There was a dead moth floating in the next bowl, and he reached to take it out, but she waved him away.</p><p>\u201cBugs drown in it all the time, but as long as they\u2019re soft-bodied, it\u2019s okay. Enough sulfuric acid\u201d\u2014she nodded at the bottle, stoppered with a bit of rag\u2014\u201cand they all just become part of the pulp: moths, butterflies, ants, gnats, lacewings . . . wings are the only things that won\u2019t dissolve all the way. Lacewings look sort of pretty embedded in the paper, but not roaches.\u201d She fished one of these out of a bowl and flicked it away into the bushes, then added a little more water from the gourd dipper, stirring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. I stamped on one of them this morning; he flattened out, then popped back up and strolled off, smirking.\u201d He paused a moment; he wanted to ask her something, she could tell, and she made an interrogative hum to encourage him.</p><p>\u201cI was only wondering\u2014would ye mind taking Jem up to the Big House after supper? Perhaps the two of ye spending the night?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do? Throw a stag party for Gordon Lindsay?\u201d Gordon, a shy boy of about seventeen, was betrothed to a Quaker girl from Woolam\u2019s Mill; he\u2019d been round the day before to \u201cthig\u201d\u2014beg small bits of household goods in preparation for his marriage.</p><p>\u201cNo girls popping out of cakes,\u201d he assured her, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely men only. It\u2019s the first meeting of the Fraser\u2019s Ridge Lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLodge . . . what, Freemasons?\u201d She squinted dubiously at him, but he nodded. The breeze had come up, and it whipped his black hair up on end; he smoothed it back with one hand.</p><p>\u201cNeutral ground,\u201d he explained. \u201cI didna want to suggest holding meetings in either the Big House or Tom Christie\u2019s place\u2014not wanting to favor either side, ye might say.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, seeing that.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But why Freemasons?\u201d She knew nothing whatever about Freemasons, save that they were some sort of secret society and that Catholics weren\u2019t allowed to join.</p><p>She mentioned this particular point to Roger, who laughed.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said \u201cThe Pope forbade it about forty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What does the Pope have against Freemasons?\u201d she asked, interested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather a powerful body. A good many men of power and influence belong\u2014and it crosses international lines. I imagine the Pope\u2019s actual concern is competition in terms of power-broking\u2014though if I recall aright, his stated reason was that Freemasonry is too much like a religion itself. Oh, that, and they worship the Devil.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYe did know your father started a Lodge at Ardsmuir, in the prison there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he mentioned it; I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did bring up the Catholic thing with him. He gave me one of those looks of his and said, \u2018Aye, well, the Pope wasna in Ardsmuir Prison, and I was.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds reasonable to me,\u201d she said, amused. \u201cBut then, I\u2019m not the Pope. Did he say why? Da, I mean, not the Pope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014as a means of uniting the Catholics and Protestants imprisoned together. One of the principles of Freemasonry being the universal brotherhood of man, aye? And another being that ye don\u2019t talk religion or politics in Lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t? What do you do in Lodge, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Not worshipping the Devil, though.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him, and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhen ye join, you take an oath not to talk outside the Lodge about what\u2019s done there.\u201d</p><p>She was mildly miffed at that, but dismissed it, going back to add more water to one bowl. It looked as though someone had thrown up in it, she thought critically, and reached for the acid bottle.</p><p>\u201cSounds pretty fishy to me,\u201d she remarked. \u201cAnd kind of silly. Isn\u2019t there something about secret handshakes, that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>He merely smiled, not bothered by her tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a bit of stage business involved. It\u2019s more or less medieval in origin, and it\u2019s kept quite a bit of the original trappings\u2014rather like the Catholic Church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d she said dryly, picking up a ready bowl of pulp. \u201cOkay. So, is it Da\u2019s idea to start a Lodge here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, mine.\u201d His voice lost its humorous tone, and she looked at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cI need a way to give them common ground, Bree,\u201d he said. \u201cThe women have it\u2014the fishers\u2019 wives sew and spin and knit and quilt wi\u2019 the others, and if they privately think you or your mother or Mrs. Bug are heretics damned to hell, or goddamned Whigs, or whatever, it seems to make no great difference. But not the men.\u201d</p><p>She thought of saying something about the relative intelligence and common sense of the two sexes, but feeling that this might be counterproductive just at the moment, nodded understanding. Besides, he obviously had no notion of the kind of gossip that went on in sewing circles.</p><p>\u201cHold that screen steady, will you?\u201d</p><p>He obligingly grasped the wooden frame, pulling taut the edges of the finely drawn wire threaded through it, as instructed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, spooning the thin gruel of the pulp onto the silk, \u201cdo you want me to provide milk and cookies for this affair tonight?\u201d</p><p>She spoke with considerable irony, and he smiled across the screen at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice, aye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d He was still smiling, but with complete seriousness behind his eyes, and she realized suddenly that this wasn\u2019t a whim. With an odd small twist of the heart, she saw her father standing there.</p><p>One had known the care of other men from his earliest years, a part of the duty of his birthright; the other had come to it later, but both felt that burden to be the will of God, she had no doubt at all\u2014both accepted that duty without question, would honor it, or die in trying. She only hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that\u2014for either of them.</p><p>\u201cGive me one of your hairs,\u201d she said, looking down to hide what she felt.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, but was plucking a strand from his head even as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe paper. The pulp shouldn\u2019t be spread any thicker than a hair.\u201d She laid the black thread at the edge of the silk screen, then spread the creamy liquid thin and thinner, so it flowed past the hair but did not cover it. It flowed with the liquid, a sinuous dark line through the white, like the tiny crack on the surface of her heart.</p><p>79</p><p>ALARMS</p><p>l\u2019oignon\u2013INTELLIGENCER</p><p>A MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED. The NEW BERN INTELLIGENCER, founded by Jno. Robinson, has ceased publication with the removal of its founder to Great Britain, but we assure its Customers that this Newspaper shall not vanish altogether, as its Premises, Stock, and Subscription Lists have been acquired by the Proprietors of THE ONION, that esteemed, popular, and Preeminent Journal. The New Periodical, Much Improved and Expanded, will henceforth appear as the L\u2019OIGNON\u2013INTELLIGENCER, distributed upon a Weekly Basis, with Extra Editions as events demand, these provided at a modest cost of One Penny. . . .</p><p>To Mr. and Mrs. James Fraser, of the Ridge,</p><p>North Carolina, from Mr. and Mrs. Fergus Fraser,</p><p>Thorpe Street, New Bern</p><p>Dear Father and Mother Claire:</p><p>I write to acquaint you with the latest Change in our Fortunes. Mr. Robinson, who had owned the other Newspaper in the town, found himself removed to Great Britain. Literally removed, as some Persons unknown, disguised as Savages, invaded his Shop in the early Hours of the Morning, and pulled him from his Bed, hurrying him to the Harbor and there thrusting him aboard a Ship, clad only in his Nightclothes and Cap.</p><p>The Captain promptly cast off his Tethers and made Sail, leaving the Town in some Uproar, as you may imagine.</p><p>Within a Day of Mr. Robinson\u2019s abrupt Departure, though, we were visited by two separate Parties (I cannot write their Names, being discreet as you will appreciate). One of these was a Member of the local Committee of Safety\u2014which everyone knows was behind Mr. Robinson\u2019s Removal, but no one says so. He was civil in his Speech, but his manner was not so much. He wished, he said, to assure himself that Fergus did not share the Willfully Wrongheaded Sentiments so oft expressed by Mr. Robinson, regarding recent Events and Particulars.</p><p>Fergus told him with a very straight face that he would not chuse to share so much as a Glass of Wine with Mr. Robinson (which he could not, Mr. Robinson being Methody and against Drink), and the Gentleman took this to mean what he wished, and went away satisfied, and gave Fergus a Purse of Money.</p><p>Next thing comes another Gentleman, fat and most Important in the Affairs of the Town, and a Member of the Royal Council, though I did not know it at the time. His Errand was the Same\u2014or rather, the Opposite: he wished to inquire whether Fergus was inclined to acquire Mr. Robinson\u2019s Assets, so to continue his work on behalf of the King\u2014that being the printing of some Letters, and the Suppression of Others.</p><p>Fergus says to this Gentleman, most grave, that he has always found Much to admire in Mr. Robinson (chiefly his horse, which is gray and very amiable, and the curious Buckles on his Shoes), but adding that we have barely Means to buy Ink and Paper, and so he feared we must resign ourselves to the Acquisition of Mr. Robinson\u2019s Shop by a Person of no great Sensitivity in Politickal Matters.</p><p>I was myself in Terror, a State not improved when the Gentleman uttered a Laugh and took a fat Purse from his Pocket, remarking that one must not \u201cspoil the ship for a happeny\u2019s worth of tar.\u201d He seemed to think this most amusing, and laughed quite immoderate, then patted Henri-Christian on the Head and went away.</p><p>So our Prospects are at once enlarged and alarming. I am fair sleepless, thinking on the Future, but Fergus is so much Improved in Spirits that I cannot regret it.</p><p>Pray for us, as we pray for you always, my Dear Parents.</p><p>Your Obedient and Loving Daughter,</p><p>Marsali</p><p>\u201cYou taught him well,\u201d I remarked, trying to keep my voice casual.</p><p>\u201cEvidently so.\u201d Jamie looked slightly worried, but much more amused. \u201cDinna fash yourself over it, Sassenach. Fergus has some skill at this game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not a game,\u201d I said, with enough vehemence that he looked at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I repeated, a little more calmly.</p><p>He raised his brows at me, and pulling a small sheaf of papers from the mess on his desk, handed them across.</p><p>WEDNESDAY MORNING</p><p>NEAR 10 OF THE CLOCK\u2014WATERTOWN</p><p>To all the friends of American liberty be it known that this morning before break of day, a brigade, consisting of about 1,000 to 1,200 men landed at Phip\u2019s Farm at Cambridge and marched to Lexington, where they found a company of our colony militia in arms, upon whom they fired without any provocation and killed six men and wounded four others. By an express from Boston, we find another brigade are now upon their march from Boston supposed to be about 1,000. The Bearer, Israel Bissell, is charged to alarm the country quite to Connecticut and all persons are desired to furnish him with fresh horses as they may be needed. I have spoken with several persons who have seen the dead and wounded. Pray let the delegates from this colony to Connecticut see this.</p><p>J. Palmer, one of the Committee of Safety.</p><p>They know Col. Foster of Brookfield one of the Delegates.</p><p>Beneath this message was a list of signatures, though most were done in the same handwriting. The first read A true copy taken from the original per order of the Committee of Correspondence for Worcester\u2014April 19, 1775. Attest. Nathan Baldwin, Town Clerk. All the others were preceded by similar statements.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Lexington Alarm.\u201d I glanced up at Jamie, wide-eyed. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Colonel Ashe\u2019s men brought it.\u201d He shuffled to the end of the last sheet, pointing out John Ashe\u2019s endorsement. \u201cWhat is the Lexington Alarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d I looked at it with fascination. \u201cAfter the battle at Lexington, General Palmer\u2014he\u2019s a general of militia\u2014wrote this and sent it through the countryside by an express rider, to bear witness to what had happened; to notify the militias nearby that the war had started.</p><p>\u201cMen along the way took copies of it, endorsed them to swear that they were true copies, and sent the message along to other townships and villages; there were probably hundreds of copies made at the time, and quite a few survived. Frank had one that someone gave him as a present. He kept it in a frame, in the front hall of our house in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Then a quite extraordinary shudder went through me, as I realized that the familiar letter I was looking at had in fact been written only a week or two before\u2014not two hundred years.</p><p>Jamie was looking a little pale, too.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014it\u2019s what Brianna told me would happen,\u201d he said, a tone of wonder in his voice. \u201cUpon the nineteenth of April, a fight in Lexington\u2014the start of the war.\u201d He looked straight at me, and I saw that his eyes were dark, with a combination of awe and excitement.</p><p>\u201cI did believe ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish the sentence, but sat down, reaching for his quill. With slow deliberation, he signed his name at the foot of the page.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll make me a fair copy, Sassenach?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll send it on.\u201d</p><p>80</p><p>THE WORLD TURNED</p><p>UPSIDE DOWN</p><p>COLONEL ASHE\u2019S MAN HAD also brought word of a congress to be held in Mecklenberg County, to take place in mid-May, with the intent to declare the county\u2019s official independence from the King of England.</p><p>Aware of the fact that he was still viewed with skepticism by not a few leaders of what had now suddenly become \u201cthe rebellion,\u201d despite the stout personal support of John Ashe and a few other friends, Jamie made up his mind to attend this congress and speak openly in support of the measure.</p><p>Roger, absolutely blazing with suppressed excitement at this, his first chance to witness recorded history in the making, was to go with him.</p><p>A few days before their scheduled departure, though, everyone\u2019s attention was distracted from the prospect of history by the more immediate present: the entire Christie family arrived suddenly at the front door, soon after breakfast.</p><p>Something had happened; Allan Christie was flushed with agitation, Tom grim and gray as an old wolf. Malva had clearly been crying, and her face went red and white by turns. I greeted her, but she looked away from me, lips trembling, as Jamie invited them into his study, gesturing them to sit.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Tom?\u201d He glanced briefly at Malva\u2014plainly she was the focus of this family emergency\u2014but gave his attention to Tom, as patriarch.</p><p>Tom Christie\u2019s mouth was pressed so tight that it was barely visible in the depths of his neatly clipped beard.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter finds herself with child,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jamie cast another brief glance at Malva\u2014who stood with capped head bowed, looking down at her clasped hands\u2014then looked at me with a raised eyebrow. \u201cAh. Well . . . there\u2019s a good bit of it going about, to be sure,\u201d he said, and smiled kindly, in an effort to ease the Christies, all of whom were quivering like beads on a tight-pulled wire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was myself less than startled to hear the news, though naturally concerned. Malva had always attracted a great deal of attention from young men, and while both her brother and father had been vigilant in preventing any open courting, the only way of keeping young men away altogether would have been to lock her in a dungeon.</p><p>Who had the successful suitor been? I wondered. Obadiah Henderson? Bobby, perhaps? One of the McMurchie brothers? Not\u2014please God\u2014both of them, I hoped. All of these\u2014and not a few others\u2014had been obvious in their admiration.</p><p>Tom Christie received Jamie\u2019s attempt at pleasantry with stony silence, though Allan made a poor attempt at a smile. He was nearly as pale as his sister.</p><p>Jamie coughed.</p> <p>\u201cWell, so. Is there some way in which I might help, then, Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says,\u201d Christie began gruffly, with a piercing look at his daughter, \u201cthat she will not name the man, save in your presence.\u201d He turned the look on Jamie, thick with dislike.</p><p>\u201cIn my presence?\u201d Jamie coughed again, clearly embarrassed at the obvious implication\u2014that Malva thought her male relatives would either beat her or proceed to do violence upon her lover, unless the presence of the landlord constrained them. Personally, I thought that particular fear was probably well founded, and gave Tom Christie a narrow look of my own. Had he already tried, and failed, to beat the truth out of her?</p><p>Malva was not making any attempt at divulging the name of the father of her child, Jamie\u2019s presence notwithstanding. She merely pleated her apron between her fingers, over and over, eyes fixed on her hands.</p><p>I cleared my throat delicately.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2014um\u2014how far gone are you, my dear?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer directly, but pressed both hands, shaking, against her apron front, smoothing down the cloth so that the round bulge of her pregnancy was suddenly visible, smooth and melonlike, surprisingly large. Six months, perhaps; I was startled. Clearly, she\u2019d delayed telling her father for as long as she possibly could\u2014and hidden it well.</p><p>The silence was well beyond awkward. Allan shifted uncomfortably on his stool, and leaned forward to murmur reassuringly to his sister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, Mallie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYe\u2019ve got to say, though.\u201d</p><p>She took a huge gulp of air at that, and raised her head. Her eyes were reddened, but still very beautiful, and wide with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir,\u201d she said, but then stopped dead.</p> <p>Jamie was by now looking nearly as uncomfortable as the Christies, but did his best to keep his air of kindness.</p><p>\u201cWill ye not tell me, then, lass?\u201d he said, as gently as possible. \u201cI promise ye\u2019ll not suffer for it.\u201d</p><p>Tom Christie made an irritable noise, like some beast of prey disturbed at its meal, and Malva went very pale indeed, but her eyes stayed fixed on Jamie.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir,\u201d she said, and her voice was small but clear as a bell, ringing with reproach. \u201cOh, sir, how can ye say that to me, when ye ken the truth as well as I do?\u201d Before anyone could react to that, she turned to her father, and lifting a hand, pointed directly at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIt was him,\u201d she said.</p><p>I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO grateful for anything in life as for the fact that I was looking at Jamie\u2019s face when she said it. He had no warning, no chance to control his features\u2014and he didn\u2019t. His face showed neither anger nor fear, denial or surprise; nothing save the open-mouthed blankness of absolute incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, and blinked, once. Then realization flooded into his face.</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d he said, in a tone that should have knocked the little trollop flat on her lying little bottom.</p> <p>She blinked then, and cast down her eyes, the very picture of virtue shamed. She turned, as though unable to bear his gaze, and stretched out a tremulous hand toward me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d she whispered, tears trembling becomingly on her lashes. \u201cHe\u2014we\u2014we didna mean to hurt ye.\u201d</p><p>I watched with interest from somewhere outside my body, as my arm lifted and drew back, and felt a sense of vague approval as my hand struck her cheek with enough force that she stumbled backward, tripped over a stool, and fell, her petticoats tumbled up to her waist in a froth of linen, wool-stockinged legs sticking absurdly up in the air.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even thought of saying anything, and was surprised to feel the words in my mouth, cool and round as river stones.</p><p>Suddenly, I was back in my body. I felt as though my stays had tightened during my temporary absence; my ribs ached with the effort to breathe. Liquid surged in every direction; blood and lymph, sweat and tears\u2014if I did draw breath, my skin would give way and let it all spurt out, like the contents of a ripe tomato, thrown against a wall.</p><p>I had no bones. But I had will. That alone held me upright and saw me out the door. I didn\u2019t see the corridor or realize that I had pushed open the front door of the house; all I saw was a sudden blaze of light and a blur of green in the dooryard and then I was running, running as though all the demons of hell coursed at my heels.</p><p>In fact, no one pursued me. And yet I ran, plunging off the trail and into the wood, feet sliding in the layers of slippery needles down the runnels between stones, half-falling down the slope of the hill, caroming painfully off fallen logs, wrenching free of thorns and brush.</p><p>I arrived breathless at the bottom of a hill and found myself in a dark, small hollow walled by the towering black-green of rhododendrons. I paused, gasping for breath, then sat down abruptly. I felt myself wobble, and let go, ending on my back among the dusty layers of leathery mountain laurel leaves.</p><p>A faint thought echoed in my mind, under the sound of my gasping breath. The guilty flee, where no man pursues. But I surely wasn\u2019t guilty. Nor was Jamie; I knew that. Knew it.</p><p>But Malva was certainly pregnant. Someone was guilty.</p><p>My eyes were blurred from running and the sunlight starred into fractured slabs and streaks of color\u2014dark blue, light blue, white and gray, pinwheels of green and gold as the cloudy sky and the mountainside spun round and round above me.</p><p>I blinked hard, unshed tears sliding down my temples.</p><p>\u201cBloody, bloody, f**king hell,\u201d I said very softly. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>JAMIE STOOPED WITHOUT thought, seized the girl by the elbows, and hauled her unceremoniously to her feet. Her one cheek bore a crimson patch where Claire had struck her, and for an instant, he had a strong urge to give her one to match on the other side.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t the chance either to quell that desire or to execute it; a hand seized his shoulder to yank him round, and it was reflex alone that made him dodge aside as Allan Christie\u2019s fist glanced off the side of his head, catching him painfully on the tip of the ear. He pushed the young man hard in the chest with both hands, then hooked a heel behind his calf as he staggered, and Allan dropped on his backside with a thud that shook the room.</p><p>Jamie stepped back, a hand to his throbbing ear, and glared at Tom Christie, who was standing staring at him like Lot\u2019s wife.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s free left hand was clenched in a fist, and he raised it a little, in invitation. Christie\u2019s eyes narrowed further, but he made no move toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d Christie said to his son. \u201cAnd keep your fists to yourself. There\u2019s nay need for that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201d cried the lad, scrambling to his feet. \u201cHe\u2019s made a whore of your daughter, and you\u2019ll let him stand? Well, and ye\u2019ll play coward, auld man, I\u2019ll not!\u201d</p><p>He lunged at Jamie, wild-eyed, hands grabbing for his throat. Jamie stepped to the side, shifted weight back on one leg, and hooked the lad in the liver with a vicious left that drove his wame into his backbone and doubled him over with a whoof. Allan stared up at him, open-mouthed and the whites of his eyes showing all round, then subsided onto his knees with a thud, mouth opening and closing like a fish\u2019s.</p><p>It might have been comical under other circumstances, but Jamie felt no disposition to laugh. He wasted no more time on either of the men, but swung round on Malva.</p><p>\u201cSo, what mischief is this ye\u2019re about, nighean na galladh?\u201d he said to her. It was a serious insult, and Tom Christie knew what it meant, Gaelic or not; Jamie could see Christie stiffen, in the corner of his eye.</p><p>The girl herself was already in tears, and burst into sobs at this.</p><p>\u201cHow can ye speak to me so?\u201d she wailed, and clutched her apron to her face. \u201cHow can ye be so cruel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said crossly. He shoved a stool in her direction. \u201cSit, ye wee loon, and we\u2019ll hear the truth of whatever ye think ye\u2019re up to. Mr. Christie?\u201d He glanced at Tom, nodded toward another stool, and went to take his own chair, ignoring Allan, who had collapsed onto the floor and was curled up on his side like a kitten, holding his belly.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug, hearing the racket, had come out from her kitchen, and was standing in the doorway, eyes wide under her cap.</p><p>\u201cWill ye . . . be needin\u2019 anything, sir?\u201d she asked, making no pretense of not staring from Malva, red-faced and sobbing on her stool, to Allan, white and gasping on the floor.</p><p>Jamie thought that he needed a strong dram\u2014or maybe two\u2014but that would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, Mrs. Bug,\u201d he said politely, \u201cbut no. We\u2019ll bide.\u201d He lifted his fingers in dismissal, and she faded reluctantly from view. She hadn\u2019t gone far, though, he knew, just round the edge of the door.</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face, wondering what it was about young girls these days. It was a full moon tonight; perhaps they truly did run lunatic.</p><p>On the other hand, the wee bitch had undoubtedly been playing the loon with someone; with her apron up like that, the bairn was showing plainly, a hard round swell like a calabash under her thin petticoat.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he asked Christie, with a nod toward her.</p><p>\u201cSix months gone,\u201d Christie said, and sank reluctantly onto the offered stool. He was dour as Jamie had ever seen him, but in control of himself, that was something.</p><p>\u201cIt was when the sickness came late last summer; when I was here, helping to nurse his wife!\u201d Malva burst out, lowering her apron and staring reproachfully at her father, full lip a-tremble. \u201cAnd not just the once, either!\u201d She switched her gaze back to Jamie, wet-eyed and pleading. \u201cTell them, sir, please\u2014tell them the truth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I mean to,\u201d he said, giving her a black look. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ll do the same, lass, I assure ye.\u201d</p><p>The shock of it was beginning to fade, and while his sense of irritation remained\u2014in fact, it was growing by the moment\u2014he was beginning to think, and furiously.</p><p>She was pregnant by someone grossly unsuitable; that much was clear. Who? Christ, he wished Claire had stayed; she listened to the gossip on the Ridge and she took interest in the lass; she\u2019d know which young men were likely prospects. He\u2019d seldom noticed young Malva particularly himself, save she was always about, helping Claire.</p><p>\u201cThe first time was when Herself was so ill as we despaired of her life,\u201d Malva said, snapping him back to attention. \u201cI told ye, Faither. It wasna rape\u2014only Himself being off his heid wi\u2019 the sorrow of it, and me, as well.\u201d She blinked, a pearly tear sliding down the unmarked cheek. \u201cI came down from her room late at night, to find him in here, sitting in the dark, and grieving. I felt so sorry for him. . . .\u201d Her voice shook, and she stopped, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cI asked could I fetch him a wee bite, maybe something to drink\u2014but he\u2019d drink taken already, there was whisky in a glass before him. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said no, thank ye kindly, and that I\u2019d be alone,\u201d Jamie broke in, feeling the blood begin to surge in his temples at her recounting. \u201cYe left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head; the cap had come half off when she fell and she hadn\u2019t settled it again; dark tendrils of hair hung down, framing her face. \u201cOr rather, ye did say that to me, that ye\u2019d be alone. But I couldn\u2019t bear to see ye in such straits, and\u2014I know \u2019twas forward and unseemly, but I did pity ye so much!\u201d she burst out, looking up and then immediately dropping her gaze again.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I came and touched him,\u201d she whispered, so low that he had trouble hearing her. \u201cPut my hand on his shoulder, like, only to comfort him. But he turned then, and put his arms round me, all of a sudden and grasped me to him. And\u2014and then . . .\u201d She gulped, audibly.</p><p>\u201cHe . . . he took me. Just . . . there.\u201d The toe of one small buskin stretched out, pointing delicately at the rag rug just in front of the table. Where there was, in fact, a small and ancient brown stain, which might have been blood. It was blood\u2014Jemmy\u2019s, left when the wee lad had tripped on the rug and bumped his nose so it bled.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, but was so choked by outraged amazement that nothing emerged but a sort of gasp.</p><p>\u201cSo ye\u2019ve not the balls to deny it, eh?\u201d Young Allan had recovered his breath; he was swaying on his knees, hair hanging in his face, and glaring. \u201cBalls enough to do it, though!\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave Allan a quelling look, but didn\u2019t bother replying to him. He turned his attention instead to Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cIs she mad?\u201d he inquired. \u201cOr only clever?\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s face might have been carved in stone, save for the pouchy flesh quivering beneath his eyes, and the eyes themselves, bloodshot and narrowed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mad,\u201d Christie said.</p><p>\u201cA clever liar, then.\u201d Jamie narrowed his own eyes at her. \u201cClever enough to ken no one would believe a tale of rape.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened in horror.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d she said, and shook her head so hard the dark curls danced by her ears. \u201cI should never say such a thing of ye, never!\u201d She swallowed, and timidly raised her eyes to meet his\u2014swollen with weeping, but a soft dove gray, guileless with innocence.</p><p>\u201cYe needed comfort,\u201d she said, softly but clearly. \u201cI gave it ye.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose hard betwixt thumb and forefinger, hoping the sensation would wake him from what was plainly nightmare. This failing to occur, he sighed and looked at Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with child by someone, and not by me,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cWho might it have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d the girl protested, letting her apron fall as she sat bolt upright on her stool. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else!\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s eyes slid reluctantly toward his daughter, then came back to meet Jamie\u2019s. They were the same dove gray, but they\u2019d never possessed any trace of either guilelessness or innocence.</p><p>\u201cI know of no one,\u201d he said. He took a deep breath, squaring his stocky shoulders. \u201cShe says it wasn\u2019t just the once. That ye had her a dozen times or more.\u201d His voice was nearly colorless, but not from lack of feeling, rather, from the grip he had upon his feelings.</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s lied a dozen times or more,\u201d Jamie said, keeping his own voice under as much control as Christie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYe know I have not! Your wife believes me,\u201d Malva said, and a steely note had entered her voice. She lifted a hand to her cheek, where the flaming color had subsided but where the print of Claire\u2019s fingers was still clear, livid in outline.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has better sense,\u201d he said coldly, but was conscious all the same of a sinking sensation at the mention of Claire. Any woman might find such an accusation shock enough to make her flee\u2014but he did wish that she\u2019d stayed. Her presence, stoutly denying any misbehavior by him and personally rebuking Malva\u2019s lies, would have helped.</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d The vivid color had faded from the girl\u2019s face altogether, but she had stopped weeping. She was white-faced, her eyes huge and brilliant. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve sense, as well, sir. Sense enough to prove what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he said skeptically. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the scars on your nak*d body; I can describe them.\u201d</p><p>That declaration brought everyone up short. There was silence for a moment, broken by Allan Christie\u2019s grunt of satisfaction. He rose to his feet, one hand still pressed to his middle, but an unpleasant smile upon his face.</p><p>\u201cSo, then?\u201d he said. \u201cNay answer to that one, have ye?\u201d</p><p>Irritation had long since given way to a monstrous anger. Under that, though, was the barest thread of something he would not\u2014not yet\u2014call fear.</p><p>\u201cI dinna put my scars on display,\u201d he said mildly, \u201cbut there are a number of folk who\u2019ve seen them, nonetheless. I havena lain with any of them, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, folk speak sometimes of the scars on your back,\u201d Malva shot back. \u201cAnd everyone kens the great ugly one up your leg, that ye took at Culloden. But what of the crescent-shaped one across your ribs? Or the wee one on your left hurdie?\u201d She reached a hand behind her, cupping her own buttock in illustration.</p><p>\u201cNot in the center, quite\u2014a bit down, on the outer side. About the size of a farthing.\u201d She didn\u2019t smile, but something like triumph blazed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI havena got\u2014\u201d he began, but then stopped, appalled. Christ, he did. A spider\u2019s bite, taken in the Indies, that festered for a week, made an abscess, then burst, to his great relief. Once healed, he\u2019d never thought of it again\u2014but it was there.</p><p>Too late. They\u2019d seen the realization cross his face.</p><p>Tom Christie closed his eyes, jaw working under his beard. Allan grunted again with satisfaction, and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cWant to show us she\u2019s wrong?\u201d the young man inquired sarcastically. \u201cTake down your breeks, and gie us a look at your backside, then!\u201d</p><p>With a good deal of effort, he kept himself from telling Allan Christie what he could do with his own backside. He took a long, slow breath, hoping that by the time he let it out again, some useful thought would have come to him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. Tom Christie opened his eyes with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI suppose ye\u2019ll not intend to put aside your wife and marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never do such a thing!\u201d The suggestion filled him with fury\u2014and something like panic at the mere notion of being without Claire.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll draw a contract.\u201d Christie rubbed a hand over his face, shoulders slumped with exhaustion and distaste. \u201cMaintenance for her and the bairn. Formal acknowledgment of the child\u2019s rights as one of your heirs. Ye can decide, I suppose, if ye wish to take it for your wife to rear, but that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d He rose, very slowly, and leaned forward, hands on the table, eyes fixed on Christie\u2019s. \u201cTake your daughter and leave my house.\u201d</p><p>Christie stopped speaking and looked at him, black-browed. The girl had started grieving again, making whimpering noises into her apron. He\u2019d the odd feeling that time had stopped, somehow; they would all just be trapped here forever, himself and Christie staring each other down like dogs, unable to look down but knowing that the floor of the room had vanished beneath their feet and they hung suspended over some dreadful abyss, in the endless moment before the fall.</p><p>It was Allan Christie who broke it, of course. The movement of the young man\u2019s hand going to his knife freed Jamie\u2019s gaze from Christie\u2019s, and his fingers tightened, digging into the wood of the table. An instant before, he\u2019d felt bodiless; now blood hammered in his temples and pulsed through his limbs and his muscles trembled with an urgent need to damage Allan Christie. And wring his sister\u2019s neck to stop her noise, as well.</p><p>Allan Christie\u2019s face was black with anger, but he\u2019d sense enough\u2014barely, Jamie thought\u2014not to draw the knife.</p><p>\u201cI should like nothing better, wee man, than to gie ye your heid in your hands to play with,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLeave now, before I do it.\u201d</p><p>Young Christie licked his lips and tensed himself, knucklebones going white on the hilt\u2014but his eyes wavered. He glanced at his father, who sat like a stone, grim-jowled and square. The light had changed; it shone from the side and through the grizzled tufts of Christie\u2019s beard, so his own scar showed, a thin pink rope that curled like a snake above his jaw.</p><p>Christie straightened slowly, pushing himself up with his hands on his thighs, then shook his head suddenly like a dog shaking off water and stood up. He gripped Malva by the arm, lifted her from her stool, and pushed her before him, weeping and stumbling on the way out.</p><p>Allan followed them, making occasion to brush so near to Jamie as he left that Jamie could smell the younger man\u2019s stink, ripe with fury. Young Christie cast a single angry glance back over his shoulder, hand still on his knife\u2014but left. Their tread in the hall made the floorboards tremble under Jamie\u2019s feet, and then came the heavy slam of the door.</p><p>He looked down, then, vaguely surprised to see the battered surface of his table and his own hands still flattened there as if they\u2019d grown to it. He straightened up and his fingers curled, the stiff joints painful as they made themselves into fists. He was drenched with sweat.</p><p>Lighter footsteps came down the hall then, and Mrs. Bug came in with a tray. She set it down before him, curtsied to him, and went out. The single crystal goblet that he owned was stood on it, and the decanter that held the good whisky.</p><p>He felt obscurely that he wanted to laugh, but couldn\u2019t quite remember how it was done. The light touched the decanter and the drink within glowed like a chrysoberyl. He touched the glass gently in acknowledgment of Mrs. Bug\u2019s loyalty, but that would have to wait. The Devil was loose in the world and there\u2019d be hell to pay, surely. Before he did aught else, he must find Claire.</p><p>AFTER A TIME, the drifting clouds boiled up into thunderheads, and a cold breeze moved over the top of the hollow, shaking the laurels overhead with a rattling like dry bones. Very slowly, I got to my feet and began to climb.</p><p>I had no sure destination in mind; didn\u2019t care, really, if I were wet or not. I only knew that I couldn\u2019t go back to the house. As it was, I came to the trail that led to the White Spring, just as rain began to fall. Huge drops splattered on the leaves of pokeweed and burdock, and the firs and pines let go their long-held breath in a fragrant sigh.</p><p>The patter of drops on leaves and branches was punctuated by the muffled thud of heavier drops striking deep into soft earth\u2014hail was coming with the rain, and suddenly there were tiny white particles of ice bouncing crazily on the packed needles, peppering my face and neck with stinging cold.</p><p>I ran, then, and took shelter beneath the drooping branches of a balsam fir that overhung the spring. The hail pocked the water and made it dance, but melted on impact, disappearing at once into the dark water. I sat still, arms wrapped around myself against the chill, shivering.</p><p>You could almost understand, said the part of my mind that had begun talking somewhere on the journey up the hill. Everyone thought you were dying\u2014including you. You know what happens . . . you\u2019ve seen it. People under the terrible strain of grief, those dealing with the presence of overwhelming death\u2014I\u2019d seen it. It was a natural seeking of solace; an attempt to hide, only for a moment, to deny death\u2019s coldness by taking comfort in the simple warmth of bodily contact.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t,\u201d I said stubbornly, out loud. \u201cIf he had, and that was it\u2014I could forgive him. But God damn it, he didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>My subconscious subsided in the face of this certainty, but I was aware of subterranean stirrings\u2014not suspicions, nothing strong enough to be called doubts. Only small, cool observations that poked their heads above the surface of my own dark well like spring peepers, high, thin pipings that were barely audible individually but that together might eventually form a racket of sound to shake the night.</p><p>You\u2019re an old woman.</p><p>See how the veins stand out on your hands.</p><p>The flesh has fallen away from your bones; your br**sts sag.</p><p>If he were desperate, needing comfort . . .</p><p>He might reject her, but could never turn away from a child of his blood.</p><p>I closed my eyes and fought a rising sense of nausea. The hail had passed, succeeded by heavy rain, and cold steam began to rise from the ground, vapor drifting upward, disappearing like ghosts into the downpour.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said aloud. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I felt as though I had swallowed several large rocks, jagged and dirt-covered. It wasn\u2019t just the thought that Jamie might\u2014but that Malva had most certainly betrayed me. Had betrayed me if it were true\u2014and still more, if it were not.</p><p>My apprentice. My daughter of the heart.</p><p>I was safe from the rain, but the air was thick with water; my garments grew damp and hung heavy on me, clammy on my skin. Through the rain, I could see the big white stone that stood at the head of the spring, that gave the pool its name. Here it was that Jamie had shed his blood in sacrifice, and dashed it on that rock, asking the help of the kinsman he had slain. And here it was that Fergus had lain down, opening his veins in despair for his son, his blood blooming dark in the silent water.</p><p>And I began to realize why I had come here, why the place had called me. It was a place to meet oneself, and find truth.</p><p>The rain passed, and the clouds broke. Slowly, the light began to fade.</p><p>IT WAS NEARLY DARK when he came. The trees were moving, restless with twilight and whispering among themselves; I didn\u2019t hear his footsteps on the sodden trail. He was just there, suddenly, at the edge of the clearing.</p><p>He stood searching; I saw his head lift when he saw me, and then he strode round the pool and ducked under the overhanging branches of my shelter. He\u2019d been out for some time, I saw; his coat was wet and the cloth of his shirt plastered to his chest with rain and sweat. He\u2019d brought a cloak with him, bundled under his arm, and he unfolded this and wrapped it round my shoulders. I let him.</p><p>He sat quite close to me then, arms wrapped about his knees, and stared into the darkening pool of the spring. The light had reached that point of beauty, just before all color fades, and the hairs of his eyebrows arched auburn and perfect over the solid ridges of his brows, each hair distinct, like the shorter, darker hairs of his sprouting beard.</p><p>He breathed long and deep, as though he had been walking for some time, and rubbed away a drop of moisture that dripped from the end of his nose. Once or twice, he took a shorter breath, as though about to say something, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>The birds had come out briefly after the rain. Now they were going to their rest, cheeping softly in the trees.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you were planning to say something,\u201d I said finally, politely. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll probably start screaming, and I might not be able to stop.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound somewhere between amusement and dismay, and sank his face into the palms of his hands. He stayed that way for a moment, then rubbed his hands hard over his face and sat up, sighing.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking all the time I was searching for ye, Sassenach, what in God\u2019s name I should say when I found ye. I thought of one thing and another\u2014and . . . there seemed nothing whatever I could say.\u201d He sounded helpless.</p><p>\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked, a distinct edge in my voice. \u201cI could think of a few things to say, I daresay.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and made a brief gesture of frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat? To say I was sorry\u2014that\u2019s not right. I am sorry, but to say so\u2014it sounds as though I\u2019ve done something to be sorry for, and that I have not. But I thought to start off so would make ye maybe think . . .\u201d He glanced at me. I was keeping a tight grip on both my face and my emotions, but he knew me very well. The instant he\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d my stomach had plunged toward my feet.</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s naught I can say,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthat doesna sound as though I try to defend or excuse myself. And I willna do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I made a small sound, as though someone had punched me in the stomach, and he glanced sharply at me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it!\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cThere is no way to deny such a charge that doesna carry the stink of doubt about it. And nothing I can say to you that doesna sound like some groveling apology for\u2014for\u2014well, I willna apologize for something I havena done, and if I did, ye\u2019d only doubt me more.\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to breathe a little easier.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a lot of faith in my faith in you.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a wary look.</p><p>\u201cIf I hadna got quite a lot of it, Sassenach, I wouldna be here.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a moment, then reached out and touched my hand. My fingers turned at once and curved to meet his, and our hands clasped tight. His fingers were big and cold and he held mine so tightly that I thought my bones would break.</p><p>He took a deep breath, almost a sob, and his shoulders, tight in his sodden coat, relaxed all at once.</p><p>\u201cYe didna think it true?\u201d he asked. \u201cYe ran away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d I said. And I\u2019d thought, dimly, that if I stayed, I might just kill her.</p><p>\u201cAye, it was,\u201d he said very dryly. \u201cI expect I might have run away myself\u2014if I could.\u201d</p><p>A small twinge of guilt was added to the overload of emotions; I supposed my hasty exit couldn\u2019t have helped the situation. He didn\u2019t reproach me, though, but merely said again, \u201cYe didna think it true, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t.\u201d His eyes searched mine. \u201cBut ye did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pulled the cloak closer round me, settling it on my shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now ye do.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, deep breath of my own and let it go, then turned to face him, straight on.</p><p>\u201cJamie Fraser,\u201d I said, with great deliberation. \u201cIf you could do such a thing as that\u2014and I don\u2019t mean lying with a woman, I mean doing it and lying to me about it\u2014then everything I\u2019ve done and everything I\u2019ve been\u2014my whole life\u2014has been a lie. And I am not prepared to admit such a thing.\u201d</p><p>That surprised him a little; it was nearly dark now, but I saw his eyebrows rise.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean by that, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand up the trail, where the house lay invisible above us, then toward the spring, where the white stone stood, a blur in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong here,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBrianna, Roger . . . they don\u2019t belong here. Jemmy shouldn\u2019t be here; he should be watching cartoons on television, drawing pictures of cars and airplanes with crayons\u2014not learning to shoot a gun as big as he is and cut the entrails from a deer.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my face and closed my eyes, feeling the damp settle on my skin, heavy on my lashes.</p> <p>\u201cBut we are here, all of us. And we\u2019re here because I loved you, more than the life that was mine. Because I believed you loved me the same way.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, so that my voice wouldn\u2019t tremble, opened my eyes and turned to him.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me that\u2019s not true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after a moment, so softly I could barely hear him. His hand tightened harder on mine. \u201cNo, I willna tell ye that. Not ever, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d I said, and felt the anxiety and fury and fear of the afternoon run out of me like water. I rested my head on his shoulder, and breathed the rain and sweat on his skin. He smelled acrid, pungent with the musk of fear and curdled anger.</p><p>It was entirely dark by now. I could hear sounds in the distance, Mrs. Bug calling to Arch from the stable where she\u2019d been milking the goats, and his cracked old voice hallooing back. A bat flittered past, silent and hunting.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Jamie said softly.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell ye something.\u201d</p><p>I froze. After a moment, I carefully detached myself from him and sat upright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes me feel as though I\u2019ve been punched in the stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to swallow the sudden feeling of nausea.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t start off by saying you were sorry, because it felt as though there must be something to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, and sighed.</p><p>I felt the movement between us as the two stiff fingers of his right hand thrummed against his leg.</p><p>\u201cThere isna any good way,\u201d he said finally, \u201cof telling your wife ye\u2019ve lain wi\u2019 someone else. No matter what the circumstances. There\u2019s just not.\u201d</p><p>I felt suddenly dizzy, and short of breath. I closed my eyes momentarily. He didn\u2019t mean Malva; he\u2019d made that clear.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said as evenly as possible. \u201cAnd when?\u201d</p><p>He stirred uneasily.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . . when ye . . . when ye were . . . gone, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>I managed to take a short breath.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJust the once,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean\u2014I hadna the slightest intention of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and rubbed hard at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cChrist. The last thing I want is to upset ye, Sassenach, by sounding as though it\u2014but I dinna want to malign the puir woman by makin\u2019 it seem that she was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHO?\u201d I roared, seizing him by the arm.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d he said, thoroughly startled. \u201cMary MacNab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said again, blankly this time.</p><p>\u201cMary MacNab,\u201d he repeated, and sighed. \u201cCan ye let go, Sassenach? I think ye\u2019ve drawn blood.\u201d</p><p>I had, my fingernails digging hard enough into his wrist as to pierce the skin. I flung his hand away, and folded my own into fists, wrapping my arms around my body by way of stopping myself from strangling him.</p><p>\u201cWho. The. Hell. Is. Mary. MacNab?\u201d I said, through my teeth. My face was hot, but cold sweat prickled along my jaw and rolled down my ribs.</p><p>\u201cYe ken her, Sassenach. She was wife to Rab\u2014him that died when his house was burnt. They had the one bairn, Rabbie; he was stable-lad at Lallybroch when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary MacNab. Her?\u201d I could hear the astonishment in my own voice. I did recall Mary MacNab\u2014barely. She\u2019d come to be a maid at Lallybroch after the death of her nasty husband; a small, wiry woman, worn with work and hardship, who seldom spoke, but went about her business like a shadow, never more than half-noticed in the rowdy chaos of life at Lallybroch.</p><p>\u201cI scarcely noticed her,\u201d I said, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to remember whether she had been there on my last visit. \u201cBut I gather you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and sighed. \u201cNot like ye mean, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d I said, my voice sounding low and venomous to my own ears.</p><p>He made a Scottish noise in his throat, of frustrated resignation, rubbing his wrist.</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, see, \u2019twas the night before I gave myself up to the English\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever told ye what?\u201d He sounded confused.</p><p>\u201cThat you gave yourself up to the English. We thought you\u2019d been captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cBut by arrangement, for the price on my head.\u201d He flipped a hand, dismissing the matter. \u201cIt wasna important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might have hanged you!\u201d And a good thing, too, said the small, furiously hurt voice inside.</p><p>\u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d A faint tinge of amusement showed in his voice. \u201cYe\u2019d told me so, Sass\u2014mmphm. I didna really care, though, if they did.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what he meant by saying I\u2019d told him so, but I certainly didn\u2019t care at the moment.</p><p>\u201cForget that,\u201d I said tersely. \u201cI want to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Mary. Aye, I ken.\u201d He rubbed a hand slowly through his hair. \u201cAye, well. She came to me, the night before I\u2014I went. I was in the cave, ken, near Lallybroch, and she brought me supper. And then she . . . stayed.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue, not to interrupt. I could feel him gathering his thoughts, searching for words.</p><p>\u201cI tried to send her away,\u201d he said at last. \u201cShe . . . well, what she said to me . . .\u201d He glanced at me; I saw the movement of his head. \u201cShe said she\u2019d seen me with ye, Claire\u2014and that she kent the look of a true love when she saw it, for all she\u2019d not had one herself. And that it wasna in her mind to make me betray that. But she would give me . . . some small thing. That\u2019s what she said to me,\u201d he said, and his voice had grown husky, \u201c\u2018some small thing, that maybe ye can use.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014I mean, it wasna . . .\u201d He stopped, and made that odd shrugging motion of his, as though his shirt were tight across his shoulders. He bowed his head for a moment on his knees, hands linked round them.</p><p>\u201cShe gave me tenderness,\u201d he said finally, so softly that I barely heard him. \u201cI\u2014I hope I gave her the same.\u201d</p><p>My throat and chest were too tight to speak, and tears prickled behind my eyes. I remembered, quite suddenly, what he had said to me the night I mended Tom Christie\u2019s hand, about the Sacred Heart\u2014\u201cso wanting\u2014and no one to touch him.\u201d And he had lived in a cave for seven years, alone.</p><p>There was no more than a foot of space between us, but it seemed an unbridgeable gulf.</p><p>I reached across it and laid my hand on his, the tips of my fingers on his big, weathered knuckles. I took a breath, then two, trying to steady my voice, but it cracked and broke, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cYou gave her . . . tenderness. I know you did.\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, suddenly, and my face was pressed into his coat, the cloth of it damp and rough on my skin, my tears blooming in tiny warm patches that vanished at once into the chill of the fabric.</p><p>\u201cOh, Claire,\u201d he whispered into my hair. I reached up, and could feel wetness on his cheeks. \u201cShe said\u2014she wished to keep ye alive for me. And she meant it; she didna mean to take anything for herself.\u201d</p><p>I cried then, holding nothing back. For empty years, yearning for the touch of a hand. Hollow years, lying beside a man I had betrayed, for whom I had no tenderness. For the terrors and doubts and griefs of the day. Cried for him and me and for Mary MacNab, who knew what loneliness was\u2014and what love was, as well.</p><p>\u201cI would have told ye, before,\u201d he whispered, patting my back as though I were a small child. \u201cBut it was . . . it was the once.\u201d He shrugged a little, helpless. \u201cAnd I couldna think how. How to say it, that ye\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed, gulped air, and finally sat up, wiping my face carelessly on a fold of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. My voice was thick and clogged, but fairly steady now. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>And I did. Not only about Mary MacNab and what she had done\u2014but why he\u2019d told me now. There was no need; I would never have known. No need but the need for absolute honesty between us\u2014and that I must know it was there.</p><p>I had believed him, about Malva. But now I had not only certainty of mind\u2014but peace of heart.</p><p>We sat close together, the folds of my cloak and skirts flowing over his legs, his simple presence a comfort. Somewhere nearby, a very early cricket began to chirp.</p><p>\u201cThe rain\u2019s past, then,\u201d I said, hearing it. He nodded, with a small sound of assent.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d I said at last. My voice sounded calm.</p><p>\u201cFind out the truth\u2014if I can.\u201d</p><p>Neither of us mentioned the possibility that he might not. I shifted, gathering the folds of my cloak.</p><p>\u201cWill we go home, then?\u201d</p><p>It was too dark to see now, but I felt him nod as he got to his feet, putting down a hand to help me.</p><p>\u201cAye, we will.\u201d</p><p>THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY when we returned, though Mrs. Bug had left a covered dish of shepherd\u2019s pie on the table, the floor swept, and the fire neatly smoored. I took off my wet cloak and hung it on the peg, but then stood, unsure quite what to do next, as though I stood in a stranger\u2019s house, in a country where I did not know the custom.</p><p>Jamie seemed to feel the same way\u2014though after a moment, he stirred, fetched down the candlestick from the shelf over the hearth, and lit it with a spill from the fire. The wavering glow seemed only to emphasize the odd, echoing quality of the room, and he stood holding it for a minute, at a loss, before finally setting it down with a thump in the middle of the table.</p><p>\u201cAre ye hungry, S . . . Sassenach?\u201d He had begun to speak by habit, but then interrupted himself, looking up to be sure the name was once more allowed. I did my best to smile at him, though I could feel the corners of my mouth tremble.</p><p>\u201cNo. Are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, silent, and dropped his hand from the dish. Looking round for something else to do, he took up the poker and stirred the coals, breaking up the blackened embers and sending a swirl of sparks and soot up the chimney and out onto the hearth. It would ruin the fire, which would need to be rebuilt before bed, but I said nothing\u2014he knew that.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like a death in the family,\u201d I said at last. \u201cAs though something terrible has happened, and this is the shocked bit, before you begin to send round and tell all the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>He gave a small, rueful laugh, and put the poker down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll not need to. They\u2019ll all ken well enough by daybreak what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Rousing at last from my immobility, I shook out my damp skirts and came to stand beside him by the fire. The heat of it seared at once through the wet cloth; it should have been comforting, but there was an icy weight in my abdomen that wouldn\u2019t melt. I put a hand on his arm, needing the touch of him.</p><p>\u201cNo one will believe it,\u201d I said. He put a hand over mine, and smiled a little, his eyes closed, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all believe it, Claire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>81</p><p>BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT</p><p>IT ISN\u2019T FREAKING TRUE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Roger watched his wife warily; she was exhibiting the general symptoms of a large explosive device with an unstable timing mechanism, and he had the distinct feeling that it was dangerous to be in her vicinity.</p><p>\u201cThat little bitch! I want to just grab her and choke the truth out of her!\u201d Her hand closed convulsively on the neck of the syrup bottle, and he reached to take it from her before she should break it.</p><p>\u201cI understand the impulse,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on the whole\u2014better not.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, but relinquished the bottle.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do something?\u201d she said.</p><p>He\u2019d been asking himself that since he\u2019d heard the news of Malva\u2019s accusation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d go and talk to the Christies, at least. And if I can get Malva alone, I will.\u201d Thinking of his last t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Malva Christie, though, he had an uneasy feeling that she wouldn\u2019t be easily shaken from her story.</p><p>Brianna sat down, scowling at her plate of buckwheat cakes, and began slathering them with butter. Her fury was beginning to give way to rational thought; he could see ideas darting behind her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you can get her to admit that it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cthat\u2019s good. If not, though\u2014the next best thing is to find out who\u2019s been with her. If some guy will admit in public that he could be the father\u2014that would cast a lot of doubt on her story, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Roger poured syrup sparingly over his own cakes, even in the midst of uncertainty and anxiety enjoying the thick dark smell of it and the anticipation of rare sweetness. \u201cThough there would still be those who\u2019d be convinced Jamie\u2019s guilty. Here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her kissing Obadiah Henderson in the woods,\u201d Bree said, accepting the bottle. \u201cLate last fall.\u201d She shuddered fastidiously. \u201cIf it was him, no wonder she doesn\u2019t want to say.\u201d</p><p>Roger eyed her curiously. He knew Obadiah, who was large and uncouth, but not at all bad looking and not stupid. Some women would consider him a decent match; he had fifteen acres, which he farmed competently, and was a good hunter. He\u2019d never seen Bree so much as speak to the man, though.</p><p>\u201cCan you think of anybody else?\u201d she asked, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . Bobby Higgins,\u201d he replied, still wary. \u201cThe Beardsley twins used to eye her now and then, but of course . . .\u201d He had a nasty feeling that this line of inquiry was going to culminate in her adjuring him to go and ask awkward questions of any putative fathers\u2014a process that struck him as likely being both pointless and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded, cutting viciously into her stack of pancakes. \u201cWhy would she do it? Mama\u2019s always been so kind to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of two reasons,\u201d Roger replied, and paused for a moment, closing his eyes, the better to savor the decadence of melted butter and velvet-smooth maple syrup on fresh, hot buckwheat. He swallowed, and reluctantly opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEither the real father is someone she doesn\u2019t want to marry\u2014for whatever reason\u2014or she\u2019s decided to try to get hold of your father\u2019s money or property, by getting him to settle a sum on her or, failing that, on the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr both. I mean, she doesn\u2019t want to marry whoever it is, and wants Da\u2019s money\u2014not that he has any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr both,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They ate in silence for a few minutes, forks scraping on the wooden plates, each absorbed in thought. Jem had spent the night at the Big House; in the wake of Lizzie\u2019s marriage, Roger had suggested that Amy McCallum take over Lizzie\u2019s work as housemaid, and since she and Aidan had moved in, Jem spent even more time over there, finding solace for the loss of Germain in Aidan\u2019s companionship.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t true,\u201d she repeated stubbornly. \u201cDa simply wouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d But he saw the faint doubt at the back of her eyes\u2014and a slight glaze of panic at the thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cBrianna\u2014you can\u2019t possibly think there\u2019s any truth to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d But she spoke too loudly, too definitely. He laid down his fork and looked at her levelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Do ye know something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She chased the last bite of pancake round her plate, speared and ate it.</p><p>He made a skeptical sound, and she frowned at the sticky puddle left on her plate. She always poured too much honey or syrup; he, more sparing, always ended with a clean plate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. She bit her lower lip, though, and put the tip of her finger into the puddle of syrup. \u201cIt\u2019s only . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Da,\u201d she said slowly. She put the tip of her finger in her mouth and sucked the syrup off. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know for sure about Daddy. It\u2019s only\u2014looking back at things I didn\u2019t understand at the time\u2014now I see\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly, and closed her eyes, then opened them, fixing him directly.</p><p>\u201cI was looking through his wallet one day. Not snooping, just having fun, taking all the cards and things out and putting them back. There was a note tucked away, between the dollar bills. It was asking him to meet somebody for lunch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started out with Darling\u2014, and it wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s handwriting,\u201d she said tersely.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and after a moment, \u201chow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d She drew small patterns on the plate with the tip of her finger. \u201cI just put the note back and kind of blotted it out of my mind. I didn\u2019t want to think about it\u2014and I don\u2019t think I ever did, from that day to this. There were a few other things, things I saw and didn\u2019t understand\u2014it was mostly the way things were between them, my parents . . . Every now and then, something would happen, and I never knew what, but I always knew something was really wrong.\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, sighed deeply, and wiped her finger on her napkin.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d he said gently. \u201cJamie\u2019s an honorable man, and he loves your mother deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI would have sworn Daddy was, too. And did.\u201d</p><p>IT WASN\u2019T IMPOSSIBLE. The thought kept returning, to niggle Roger uncomfortably, like a pebble in his shoe. Jamie Fraser was an honorable man, he was deeply uxorious\u2014and he had been in the depths of despair and exhaustion during Claire\u2019s illness. Roger had feared for him nearly as much as for Claire; he\u2019d gone hollow-eyed and grim-jawed through the hot, endless days of reeking death, not eating, not sleeping, held together by nothing more than will.</p><p>Roger had tried to speak to him then, of God and eternity, reconcile him with what seemed the inevitable, only to be repulsed with a hot-eyed fury at the mere idea that God might think to take his wife\u2014this followed by complete despair as Claire lapsed into a stupor near death. It wasn\u2019t impossible that the offer of a moment\u2019s physical comfort, made in that void of desolation, had gone further than either party intended.</p><p>But it was early May now, and Malva Christie was six months gone with child. Which meant that she\u2019d got that way in November. The crisis of Claire\u2019s illness had been in late September; he remembered vividly the smell of burnt-over fields in the room when she\u2019d wakened from what looked like certain death, her eyes huge and lambent, startlingly beautiful in a face like an androgynous angel\u2019s.</p><p>Right, then, it frigging was impossible. No man was perfect, and any man might yield in extremis\u2014once. But not repeatedly. And not Jamie Fraser. Malva Christie was a liar.</p><p>Feeling more settled in mind, Roger made his way down the creekside toward the Christies\u2019 cabin.</p><p>Can\u2019t you do something? Brianna had asked him, anguished. Damn little, he thought, but he had to try. It was Friday; he could\u2014and would\u2014preach an ear-blistering sermon on the evils of gossip, come Sunday. Knowing what he did of human nature, though, any benefit derived from that was likely to be short-lived.</p><p>Beyond that\u2014well, Lodge meeting was Wednesday night. It had been going really well, and he hated to jeopardize the fragile amity of the newborn Lodge by risking unpleasantness at a meeting . . . but if there was a chance of it helping . . . would it be useful to encourage both Jamie and the two Christie men to attend? It would get the matter out in the open, and no matter how bad, open public knowledge was always better than the festering weed of whispered scandal. He thought Tom Christie would observe the proprieties and be civil, notwithstanding the delicacy of the situation\u2014but he wasn\u2019t all that sure of Allan. The son shared his father\u2019s features and his sense of self-righteousness, but lacked Tom\u2019s iron will and self-control.</p><p>But now he was at the cabin, which seemed deserted. He heard the sound of an ax, though, the slow klop! of kindling being split, and went round to the back.</p><p>It was Malva, who turned at his greeting, her face wary. There were lavender smudges beneath her eyes, he saw, and the bloom of her skin was clouded. Guilty conscience, he hoped, as he greeted her cordially.</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019ve come to try to get me to take it back, I won\u2019t,\u201d she said flatly, ignoring his greeting.</p><p>\u201cI came to ask if ye wanted someone to talk to,\u201d he said. That surprised her; she set down the ax, and wiped her face with her apron.</p><p>\u201cTo talk to?\u201d she said slowly, eyeing him. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and offered her a very slight smile.</p><p>\u201cAnything ye like.\u201d He let his accent relax, broadening toward her own Edinburgh tinge. \u201cI doubt ye\u2019ve been able to talk to anyone of late, save your Da and brother\u2014and they might not be able to listen just the noo.\u201d</p><p>A matching small smile flitted across her features, and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t listen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all right; I\u2019ve naught much to say, ken? I\u2019m a hoor; what else is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna think ye\u2019re a hoor,\u201d Roger said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye don\u2019t?\u201d She rocked back a little on her heels, surveying him mockingly. \u201cWhat else would ye call a woman that spreads her legs for a marrit man? Adulteress, of course\u2014but hoor, as well, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>He thought she meant to shock him with deliberate coarseness. She did, rather, but he kept it to himself.</p><p>\u201cMistaken, maybe. Jesus didna speak harshly to the woman who was a harlot; it\u2019s no my business to be doing it to someone who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye\u2019ve come to quote the Bible to me, save your breath to cool your parritch with,\u201d she said, a look of distaste pulling down the delicate corners of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a deal more of it than I care to.\u201d</p><p>That, he reflected, was probably true. Tom Christie was the sort who knew a verse\u2014or ten\u2014for every occasion, and if he didn\u2019t beat his daughter physically, had almost certainly been doing it verbally.</p><p>Not sure what to say next, he held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019ll give me the hatchet, I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow raised, she put it into his hand and stepped back. He put up a chunk of kindling and split it clean in two, stooped for another. She watched for a moment, then sat down, slowly, on a smaller stump.</p><p>The mountain spring was still cool, touched with the last winter breath of the high snows, but the work warmed him. He didn\u2019t by any means forget she was there, but he kept his eyes on the wood, the bright grain of the fresh-split stick, the tug of it as he pulled the ax blade free, and found his thoughts move back to his conversation with Bree.</p><p>So Frank Randall had been\u2014perhaps\u2014unfaithful to his wife, on occasion. In all justice, Roger wasn\u2019t sure he could be blamed, knowing the circumstances of the case. Claire had disappeared completely, without trace, leaving Frank to hunt desperately, to mourn, and then, at last, to begin to put the pieces of his life back together and move on. Whereupon the missing wife pops back up, distraught, mistreated\u2014and pregnant by another man.</p><p>Whereupon Frank Randall, whether from a sense of honor, of love, or simply of\u2014what? curiosity?\u2014had taken her back. He recalled Claire\u2019s telling them the story, and it was clear that she hadn\u2019t particularly wanted to be taken back. It must have been damned clear to Frank Randall, too.</p><p>Little wonder, then, if outrage and rejection had led him occasionally\u2014and little wonder, too, that the echoes of the hidden conflicts between her parents had reached Brianna, like seismic disturbances that travel through miles of earth and stone, jolts from an upwelling of magma, miles deep beneath the crust.</p><p>And little wonder, he realized with a sense of revelation, that she\u2019d been so upset by his friendship with Amy McCallum.</p><p>He realized, quite suddenly, that Malva Christie was crying. Silently, without covering her face. Tears ran down her cheeks and her shoulders quivered, but her lower lip was caught hard between her teeth; she made no sound.</p><p>He cast down the ax and went to her. Put an arm gently round her shoulders, and cradled her capped head, patting her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, aye? It\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, and the tears washed down her face.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Beneath his pity for her, Roger was aware of a sense of growing hope. Whatever reluctance he might have to exploit her desperation was well overcome by a determination to get to the bottom of her trouble. Mostly for the sake of Jamie and his family\u2014but for her own, as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He mustn\u2019t push too hard, though, mustn\u2019t rush. She had to trust him.</p><p>So he patted her, rubbed her back as he did for Jem when he woke with nightmare, said small soothing things, all meaningless, and felt her begin to yield. Yield, but in a strangely physical fashion, as though her flesh were somehow opening, blossoming slowly under his touch.</p><p>Strange, and at the same time, oddly familiar. He\u2019d felt it now and then with Bree, when he\u2019d turned to her in the dark, when she hadn\u2019t time to think but responded to him with her body alone. The physical recollection jarred him, and he drew back a little. He meant to say something to Malva, but the sound of a footfall interrupted him, and he looked up to see Allan Christie coming toward him out of the trees, fast, with a face like black thunder.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her!\u201d</p> <p>He straightened, heart pounding as he realized quite suddenly what this might look like.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean, slinkin\u2019 round like a rat after a rind o\u2019 cheese?\u201d Allan cried. \u201cD\u2019ye think since she\u2019s shamed, she\u2019s meat for any whoreson bastard that cares to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to offer counsel,\u201d Roger said as coolly as he could manage. \u201cAnd comfort, if I might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Allan Christie\u2019s face was flushed, the tufts of his hair standing on end like the bristles on a hog about to charge. \u201cComfort me with apples and stay me with raisins, is it? Ye can stick your comfort straight up your arse, MacKenzie, and your goddamned stiff prick, too!\u201d</p><p>Allan\u2019s hands were clenched at his sides, trembling with rage.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019re no better than your wicked good-father\u2014or perhaps\u201d\u2014he rounded suddenly on Malva, who had stopped crying, but was sitting white-faced and frozen on her stump\u2014\u201cperhaps it was him, too? Is that it, ye wee bitch, did ye take them both? Answer me!\u201d His hand shot out to slap her, and Roger caught his wrist by reflex.</p><p>Roger was so angry that he could barely speak. Christie was strong, but Roger was bigger; he would have broken the young man\u2019s wrist, if he could. As it was, he dug his fingers hard into the space between the bones, and was gratified to see Christie\u2019s eyes pop and water from the pain of it.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll not speak to your sister that way,\u201d he said, not loudly, but very clearly. \u201cNor to me.\u201d He shifted his grip suddenly and bent Christie\u2019s wrist sharply backward. \u201cD\u2019ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>Allan\u2019s face went white and the breath hissed out of him. He didn\u2019t answer, but managed to nod. Roger released his hold, almost flinging the younger man\u2019s wrist away, with a sudden feeling of revulsion.</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to hear that ye\u2019ve abused your sister in any way,\u201d he said, as evenly as he could. \u201cIf I do\u2014ye\u2019ll regret it. Good day, Mr. Christie. Miss Christie,\u201d he added, with a brief bow to Malva. She didn\u2019t respond, only stared at him from eyes gray as storm clouds, huge with shock. The memory of them followed him as he strode from the clearing and plunged into the darkness of the wood, wondering whether he\u2019d made things better, or much, much worse.</p><p>THE NEXT MEETING of the Fraser\u2019s Ridge Lodge was on Wednesday. Brianna went as usual to the Big House, taking Jemmy and her workbasket, and was surprised to find Bobby Higgins seated at the table, finishing his supper.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Brianna!\u201d He half-rose at sight of her, beaming, but she waved him back to his seat, and slid into the bench opposite.</p><p>\u201cBobby! How nice to see you again! We thought\u2014well, we thought you wouldn\u2019t come again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking rueful.</p><p>\u201cAye, happen I might not, at least not for a bit. But his Lordship had some things, things come in from England, and he says to me as I shall bring \u2019em.\u201d He ran a piece of bread carefully round the inside of his bowl, sopping up the last of Mrs. Bug\u2019s chicken gravy.</p><p>\u201cAnd then . . . well, I did wish to come on my own account. For to see Miss Christie, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glanced up and caught Mrs. Bug\u2019s eye. The older woman rolled her eyes, helpless, and shook her head. \u201cUm. Yes, Malva. Er . . . is my mother upstairs, Mrs. Bug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, a nighean. She was called to Mr. MacNeill; he\u2019s bad wi\u2019 the pleurisy.\u201d Barely pausing for breath, she whipped off her apron and hung it on its hook, reaching for her cloak with the other hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be along, then, a leannan; Arch will be wanting his supper. If there\u2019s aught wanting, Amy\u2019s about.\u201d And with the briefest of farewells, she vanished, leaving Bobby staring after her in puzzlement at this uncharacteristic behavior.</p><p>\u201cIs something amiss?\u201d he asked, turning back to Brianna with a small frown.</p> <p>\u201cAhh . . . well.\u201d With a few uncharitable thoughts toward Mrs. Bug, Brianna girded up her loins and told him, grimacing inwardly at the sight of his sweet young face as it turned white and rigid in the firelight.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to mention Malva\u2019s accusation, only told him that the girl was with child. He\u2019d hear about Jamie, soon enough, but please God, not from her.</p><p>\u201cI see, miss. Aye . . . I see.\u201d He sat for a moment, staring at the bit of bread in his hand. Then he dropped it into his bowl, rose suddenly, and rushed outside; she heard him retching into the blackberry bushes outside the back door. He didn\u2019t come back.</p><p>It was a long evening. Her mother was plainly spending the night with Mr. MacNeill and his pleurisy. Amy McCallum came down for a little while, and they made awkward conversation over their sewing, but then the maid escaped upstairs. Aidan and Jemmy, allowed to stay up late and play, wore themselves out and fell asleep on the settle.</p><p>She fidgeted, abandoned her sewing, and paced up and down, waiting for Lodge to finish. She wanted her own bed, her own house; her parents\u2019 kitchen, normally so welcoming, seemed strange and uncomfortable, and she a stranger in it.</p><p>At long, long last, she heard footsteps and the creak of the door, and Roger came in, looking bothered.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she said with relief. \u201cHow was Lodge? Did the Christies come?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. It . . . went all right, I suppose. A bit of awkwardness, of course, but your father carried it off as well as anyone might, in the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, imagining it.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he thought he\u2019d go and walk by himself for a bit\u2014maybe do a little night fishing.\u201d Roger put his arms round her and hugged her close, sighing. \u201cDid ye hear the ruckus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019d just had a wee blether on the universal nature of brotherly love, when a clishmaclaver broke out, over by your kiln. Well, so, everyone streamed out to see what was to do, and here\u2019s your cousin Ian and wee Bobby Higgins, rolling in the dirt and trying to kill each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d She felt a spasm of guilt. Probably someone had told Bobby everything, and he had gone in search of Jamie, meeting Ian instead, and thrown Malva\u2019s accusations of Jamie at him. If she\u2019d told him herself . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ian\u2019s bloody dog took a hand, for the one thing\u2014or a paw. Your father barely stopped him tearing out Bobby\u2019s throat, but it did stop the fight. We dragged them apart, then, and Ian tore free and loped off into the woods, with the dog beside him. Bobby\u2019s . . . well, I cleaned him up a bit, then gave him Jemmy\u2019s trundle for the night,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cHe said he couldna stay up here\u2014\u201d He looked round at the shadowed kitchen; she\u2019d already smoored the fire and carried the little boys up to bed; the room was empty, lit only by a faint hearth glow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Will ye sleep here, then?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head emphatically.</p><p>\u201cBobby or no Bobby, I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, all right. You go on, then; I\u2019ll fetch Amy down to bar the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d And before he could protest, she was down the hall and up the stair, the empty house strange and silent below.</p><p>82</p><p>NOT THE END OF</p><p>THE WORLD</p><p>THERE IS A GREAT DEAL of satisfaction in wresting weeds out of the earth. Backbreaking and endless as the chore may be, there is a tiny but unassailable sense of triumph in it, feeling the soil give suddenly, yielding the stubborn root, and the foe lying defeated in your hand.</p><p>It had rained recently and the earth was soft. I ripped and tore with ferocious concentration; dandelions, fireweed, rhododendron sprouts, bunchgrass, muhly, smartweed, and the creeping mallow known locally as \u201ccheese.\u201d Paused for an instant, narrow-eyed at a bull thistle, and prised it from the ground with a vicious stab of my pruning knife.</p><p>The grapevines that ran up the palisades had just begun their spring rush, and sprouts and ruffles of a delicate green tinged with rust cascaded from the woody stems, eager tendrils curling like my own new-grown hair\u2014God damn her, she\u2019d taken my hair on purpose to disfigure me! The shade they cast provided refuge for immense bushy growths of the pernicious thing I called \u201cjewelweed,\u201d not knowing its real name, for the tiny white flowers that winked like diamond clusters in the feathery green fronds. It was likely a fennel of some sort, but formed neither a useful bulb nor edible seeds; pretty, but useless\u2014and thus the sort of thing that spreads like wildfire.</p><p>There was a small swishing sound, and a ball of rags came to rest by my foot. This was followed immediately by the rush of a much larger body, and Rollo swept past me, snatching the ball adroitly and galloping away, the wind of his passage stirring my skirts. Startled, I looked up, to see him bounding toward Ian, who\u2019d come soft-footed into the garden.</p><p>He made a small gesture of apology, but I sat back on my heels and smiled at him, making an effort to quell the vicious sentiments surging to and fro in my bosom.</p><p>Evidently, the quelling wasn\u2019t all that successful, for I saw him frown a little, and hesitate, looking at my face.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something, Ian?\u201d I said shortly, dropping the facade of welcome. \u201cIf that hound of yours knocks over one of my hives, I\u2019ll make a rug of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRollo!\u201d Ian snapped his fingers at the dog, who leapt gracefully over the row of bee gums and basket hives that sat at the far end of the garden, trotted up to his master, dropped the ball at his feet, and stood genially panting, yellow wolf-eyes fixed with apparent interest on me.</p><p>Ian scooped up the ball, and turning, flung it out through the open gate, Rollo after it like the tail of a comet.</p><p>\u201cI did want to ask ye something, Auntie,\u201d he said, turning back to me. \u201cIt would wait, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right. Now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d Getting awkwardly to my feet, I waved him to the little bench Jamie had made for me in a shady nook beneath a flowering dogwood that overhung the corner of the garden.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I settled myself beside him, brushing crumbs of dirt from the bottom of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well . . .\u201d He stared at his hands, linked over his knee, big-knuckled and bony. \u201cI . . . ah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been exposed to syphilis again, have you?\u201d I asked, with a vivid memory of my last interview with an awkward young man in this garden. \u201cBecause if you have, Ian, I swear I will use Dr. Fentiman\u2019s syringe on you and I won\u2019t be gentle with it. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d he said hastily. \u201cNo, of course not, Auntie. It\u2019s about\u2014about Malva Christie.\u201d He tensed as he said it, in case I should lunge for the pruning knife, but I merely drew a deep breath and let it out again, slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d I said, my voice deliberately even.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . no really her, exactly. More what she said\u2014about Uncle Jamie.\u201d He stopped, swallowing, and I drew another slow breath. Disturbed as I was by the situation myself, I\u2019d scarcely thought about its impact on anyone else. But Ian had idolized Jamie from the time he was a tiny boy; I could well imagine that the widespread suggestions that Jamie might have feet of clay were deeply upsetting to him.</p><p>\u201cIan, you mustn\u2019t worry yourself.\u201d I put a consoling hand\u2014dirt-stained as it was\u2014on his arm. \u201cIt will . . . work itself out, somehow. Such things always do.\u201d They did\u2014generally with the maximum of uproar and catastrophe. And if Malva\u2019s child should by some horrid cosmic joke be born with red hair . . . I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling a wave of dizziness.</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose they will,\u201d Ian said, sounding uncertain in the extreme. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014what they\u2019re sayin\u2019, about Uncle Jamie. Even his own Ardsmuir men, folk that should know better! That he must have\u2014well, I\u2019ll no repeat any of it, Auntie\u2014but . . . I canna bear to hear it!\u201d</p><p>His long, homely face was twisted with unhappiness, and it suddenly occurred to me that he might be having his own doubts about the matter.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, with as much firmness as I could muster, \u201cMalva\u2019s child could not possibly be Jamie\u2019s. You do believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, very slowly, but wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said softly, and then swallowed hard. \u201cBut, Auntie . . . it could be mine.\u201d</p><p>A bee had lighted on my arm. I stared at it, seeing the veins in its glassy wings, the dust of yellow pollen that clung to the minuscule hairs of its legs and abdomen, the gentle pulsing of its body as it breathed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian,\u201d I said as softly as he\u2019d spoken himself. \u201cOh, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He was strung tight as a marionette, but when I spoke, a little of the tension left the arm under my hand, and I saw that he had closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Auntie,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Wordless, I patted his arm. The bee flew off, and I wished passionately that I could exchange places with it. It would be so wonderful, simply to be about the business of gathering, single-minded in the sun.</p><p>Another bee lighted on Ian\u2019s collar, and he brushed it absently away.</p><p>\u201cWell, so,\u201d he said, taking a deep breath and turning his head to look at me. \u201cWhat must I do, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark with misery and worry\u2014and something very like fear, I thought.</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d I said, sounding as blank as I felt. \u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ, Ian.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t meant to make him smile, and he didn\u2019t, but he did seem to relax very slightly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve done it already,\u201d he said, very rueful. \u201cBut\u2014it\u2019s done, Auntie. How can I mend it?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my brow, trying to think. Rollo had brought back his ball, but seeing that Ian was in no mood to play, dropped it by his feet and leaned against his leg, panting.</p><p>\u201cMalva,\u201d I said finally. \u201cDid she tell you? Before, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe think I scorned her, and that\u2019s what made her accuse Uncle Jamie?\u201d He gave me a wry look, absently scratching Rollo\u2019s ruff. \u201cWell, I wouldna blame ye if ye did, Auntie, but no. She said not a word to me about the matter. If she had, I should ha\u2019 marrit her at once.\u201d</p><p>The hurdle of confession overcome, he was talking more easily now.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think of marrying her first?\u201d I said, with perhaps a slight tinge of acerbity.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . no,\u201d he said, very sheepish. \u201cIt wasna precisely a matter of\u2014well, I wasna thinking at all, Auntie. I was drunk. The first time, anyway,\u201d he added as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cThe first\u2014? How many\u2014 No, don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know the gory details.\u201d I shut him up with a brusque gesture, and sat up straight, struck by a thought. \u201cBobby Higgins. Was that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He nodded, lowering his lashes so I couldn\u2019t see his eyes. The blood had come up under his tan.</p><p>\u201cAye. That was why\u2014I mean, I didna really wish to marry her, to begin with, but still, I would have asked, after we . . . but I put it off a bit, and\u2014\u201d He scrubbed a hand across his face, helpless. \u201cWell, I didna want her to wife, but I couldna keep from wanting her, nonetheless, and I ken well enough how awful it must seem\u2014but I\u2019ve got to tell the truth, Auntie, and that\u2019s it.\u201d He took a gulp of air, and continued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2014wait for her. In the woods, when she came to gather. She\u2019d not speak when she saw me, only smile, and raise her skirts a bit, then turn quick and run and . . . God, I should be after her like a dog after a bitch in heat,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cBut then one day I came late, and she wasna there where we usually met. But I heard her laughing, far off, and when I went to see . . .\u201d</p><p>He twisted his hands hard enough to dislocate a finger, grimacing, and Rollo whined softly.</p><p>\u201cLet us just say that yon bairn might well be Bobby Higgins\u2019s, too,\u201d he said, biting off the words.</p><p>I felt suddenly exhausted, as I had when recovering from my illness, as though it was too much effort even to breathe. I leaned back against the palisades, feeling the cool papery rustle of grape leaves against my neck, fanning softly over my heated cheeks.</p><p>Ian bent forward, head in his hands, the dappled green shadows playing over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d he asked at last, voice muffled. He sounded as tired as I felt. \u201cI dinna mind saying that I\u2014that the child might be mine. But would it help, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said bleakly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Public opinion would not be changed in the slightest; everyone would simply assume that Ian was lying for his uncle\u2019s sake. Even if he were to marry the girl, it wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>A thought struck me and I pulled myself upright again.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to marry her, even before you knew about Bobby. Why?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>He lifted his head from his hands with a helpless gesture.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken how to say it. She was\u2014well, she was bonnie enough, aye, and a proper spirit to her, as well. But she . . . I dinna ken, Auntie. It was only that I always had the feeling, lying wi\u2019 her\u2014that I dare not fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be off-putting, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>He had dismissed that, though, and was frowning, digging the heel of his moccasin into the soil.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no means of telling which of two men has fathered a bairn, is there?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cOnly\u2014if it\u2019s mine, I should want it. I would wed her for the child\u2019s sake, no matter what else. If it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Bree had told me the bare bones of his history; I knew about his Mohawk wife, Emily, and the death of his daughter, and I felt the small presence of my own first child, Faith, stillborn but always with me.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian,\u201d I said softly, and touched his hair. \u201cYou might be able to tell, by the way the child looked\u2014but probably not, or not right away.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and sighed. After a moment, he said, \u201cIf I say it\u2019s mine, and I wed her\u2014folk might still talk, but after a time . . .\u201d His voice died away. True, talk might eventually die down. But there would still be those who thought Jamie responsible, others who would call Malva a whore, a liar, or both\u2014which she bloody well was, I reminded myself, but not a nice thing to hear about one\u2019s wife. And what might Ian\u2019s life be like, married under such circumstances, to a woman he could not trust and\u2014I thought\u2014did not especially like?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, rising to my feet and stretching, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything drastic just yet awhile. Let me talk with Jamie; you don\u2019t mind if I tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish ye would, Auntie. I dinna think I could face him, myself.\u201d He still sat on the bench, bony shoulders slumped. Rollo lay on the ground at his feet, the big wolf head resting on Ian\u2019s moccasined foot. Moved with pity, I put my arms round Ian, and he leaned his head against me, simply, like a child.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the end of the world,\u201d I said.</p><p>The sun was touching the edge of the mountain, and the sky burned red and gold, the light of it falling in blazing bars through the palisades.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, but there was no conviction in his voice.</p><p>83</p><p>DECLARATIONS</p><p>Charlotte, Mecklenberg County</p><p>May 20, 1775</p><p>THE ONE THING ROGER HAD NOT envisioned about the making of history was the sheer amount of alcohol involved. He should have, he thought; if there was anything a career in academia had taught him, it was that almost all worthwhile business was conducted in the pub.</p><p>The public houses, taverns, ordinaries, and pothouses in Charlotte were doing a roaring business, as delegates, spectators, and hangers-on seethed through them, men of Loyalist sentiments collecting in the King\u2019s Arms, those of rabidly opposing views in the Blue Boar, with shifting currents of the unallied and undecided eddying to and fro, purling through the Goose and Oyster, Thomas\u2019s ordinary, the Groats, Simon\u2019s, Buchanan\u2019s, Mueller\u2019s, and two or three nameless places that barely qualified as shebeens.</p><p>Jamie visited all of them. And drank in all of them, sharing beer, ale, rum punch, shandy, cordial, porter, stout, cider, brandywine, persimmon beer, rhubarb wine, blackberry wine, cherry bounce, perry, merry brew, and scrumpy. Not all of them were alcoholic, but the great majority were.</p><p>Roger confined himself largely to beer, and found himself glad of his restraint, when he happened to meet with Davy Caldwell in the street, turning from a fruiterer\u2019s stall with a handful of early apricots.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie!\u201d Caldwell cried, his face lighting with welcome. \u201cI had nay thought to meet you here, but what blessing that I have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlessing indeed,\u201d Roger said, shaking the minister\u2019s hand with cordial fervor. Caldwell had married him and Brianna, and had examined him at the Presbyterian Academy regarding his own calling, some months before. \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, Mr. Caldwell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, for myself, well enough\u2014but my heart misgives me for the fate of my poor brethren!\u201d Caldwell shook his head in dismay, gesturing at a group of men crowding into Simon\u2019s ordinary, laughing and talking. \u201cWhat is to come of this, I ask ye, Mr. MacKenzie\u2014what\u2019s to come?\u201d</p><p>Roger was, for an unbalanced instant, tempted to tell him what was to come of it, exactly. As it was, though, he gestured to Jamie\u2014who had been stopped by an acquaintance in the street\u2014to go along without him, and turned away to walk a bit with Caldwell.</p><p>\u201cHave ye come for the conference, then, Mr. Caldwell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have that, Mr. MacKenzie, I have that. Little hope have I that my words will make the slightest difference, but it is my duty to speak as I find, and so I shall.\u201d</p><p>What Davy Caldwell found was a shocking condition of human slothfulness, for which he blamed the entire current situation, convinced that unreflective apathy and \u201ca stupid concern with personal comfort\u201d on the part of the colonists both tempted and provoked the exercise of tyrannical powers on the part of Crown and Parliament.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a point, sure,\u201d Roger said, aware that Caldwell\u2019s impassioned gestures were attracting a certain amount of notice, even amongst the crowds in the street, most of them reasonably argumentative themselves.</p><p>\u201cA point!\u201d Caldwell cried. \u201cAye, it is, and the point entirely. The ignorance, disregard of moral obligation, and the supreme love of ease of the groveling sluggard corresponds exactly\u2014exactly!\u2014with a tyrant\u2019s appetite and cynicism.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at one gentleman who had subsided against the side of a house, taking a brief respite from the noonday heat with his hat over his face.</p><p>\u201cThe spirit of God must redeem the slothful, fill the human frame with activity, poise, and libertarian consciousness!\u201d</p><p>Roger wondered, rather, whether Caldwell would view the escalating war as the result of God\u2019s intervention\u2014but upon reflection, thought that he likely would. Caldwell was a thinker, but a staunch Presbyterian, and thus a believer in predestination.</p><p>\u201cThe slothful encourage and facilitate oppression,\u201d Caldwell explained, with a scornful gesture toward a family of tinkers enjoying an alfresco luncheon in the yard of a house. \u201cTheir own shame and sinking spirits, their own pitiful compliance and submission\u2014these become self-made chains of slavery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Roger said, and coughed. Caldwell was a famous preacher, and rather inclined to want to keep in practice. \u201cWill ye take a whet, Mr. Caldwell?\u201d It was a warm day, and Caldwell\u2019s rather round, cherubic face was becoming very red.</p><p>They went into Thomas\u2019s ordinary, a fairly respectable house, and sat down with tankards of the house beer\u2014for Caldwell, like most, did not regard beer as being in any way \u201cdrink,\u201d like rum or whisky. What else, after all, would one drink? Milk?</p><p>Out of the sun, and with a cooling draught to hand, Davy Caldwell became less heated in his expressions, as well as his countenance.</p><p>\u201cPraise God for the fortune of meeting ye here, Mr. MacKenzie,\u201d he said, breathing deep after lowering his tankard. \u201cI had sent a letter, but doubtless ye will have left home before it could come. I wished to inform ye of the gladsome news\u2014there is to be a Presbytery.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt a sudden leap of the heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen? And where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdenton, early next month. The Reverend Doctor McCorkle is coming from Philadelphia. He\u2019ll remain for a time, before departing on his further journey\u2014he is going to the Indies, to encourage the efforts of the church there. I am, of course, presuming to know your mind\u2014I apologize for the forwardness of my address, Mr. MacKenzie\u2014but is it still your desire to seek ordination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart.\u201d</p><p>Caldwell beamed, and grasped him strongly by the hand.</p><p>\u201cGive ye joy of it, dear man\u2014great joy.\u201d</p><p>He then plunged into a close description of McCorkle, whom he had met in Scotland, and speculations regarding the state of religion in the colony\u2014he spoke of Methodism with some respect, but considered the New Light Baptists \u201csomewhat unregulated\u201d in their effusions of worship, though doubtless well-meaning\u2014and surely sincere belief was an improvement over unbelief, whatever the form it might take. In due course, though, he came back round to their present circumstances.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve come with your father-in-law, have ye?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought I saw him, in the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, and ye did,\u201d Roger assured him, fumbling in his pocket for a coin. The pocket itself was full of coiled horsehair; with his academic experience as guide, he had made provision against possible boredom by bringing the makings of a new fishing line.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Caldwell looked at him keenly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard things of late\u2014is it true, he\u2019s turned Whig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a firm friend to liberty,\u201d Roger said, cautious, and took a breath. \u201cAs am I.\u201d He\u2019d not had occasion to say it out loud before; it gave him a small, breathless feeling, just under the breastbone.</p><p>\u201cAha, aha, very good! I had heard of it, as I say\u2014and yet there are a great many who say otherwise: that he is a Tory, a Loyalist like his relations, and that this protestation of support for the independency movement is but a ruse.\u201d It wasn\u2019t phrased as a question, but Caldwell\u2019s bushy eyebrow, cocked like a swell\u2019s hat, made it clear that it was.</p><p>\u201cJamie Fraser is an honest man,\u201d Roger said, and drained his tankard. \u201cAnd an honorable one,\u201d he added, setting it down. \u201cAnd speaking of the same, I think I must go and find him.\u201d</p><p>Caldwell glanced around; there was an air of restlessness around them, of men calling their accounts and settling up. The official meeting of the convention was to begin at two o\u2019clock, at MacIntyre\u2019s farmhouse. It was past noon now, delegates, speakers, and spectators would be slowly gathering, girding themselves for an afternoon of conflict and decision. The breathless feeling came back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, then. Give him my regards, if ye will\u2014though perhaps I may see him myself. And may the Holy Spirit penetrate the encrustations of habit and lethargy, and convert the souls and rouse the consciences of those who gather here today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d said Roger, smiling in spite of the glances from the men\u2014and not a few women\u2014around them.</p><p>He found Jamie in the Blue Boar, in the company of a number of men in whom the Holy Spirit had already been hard at work on the encrustations, judging from the volume. The chatter near the door died away, though, as he made his way through the room\u2014not in cause of his own presence, but because there was something more interesting going on near the center.</p><p>To wit: Jamie Fraser and Neil Forbes, both red with heat, passion, and a gallon or two of mixed spirits, head to head over a table, and hissing like snakes in the Gaelic.</p> <p>Only a few of the spectators were Gaelic speakers; these were hastily translating the high points of the dialogue for the rest of the crowd.</p><p>Gaelic insult was an art, and one at which his father-in-law excelled, though Roger was obliged to admit that the lawyer was no slouch at it, himself. The translations rendered by the onlookers fell far short of the original; nonetheless, the taproom was rapt, with occasional admiring whistles or whoops from the spectators, or laughter as a particularly pungent point was made.</p><p>Having missed the beginning, Roger had no idea how the conflict had begun, but so far into it as they were, the exchange was focused on cowardice and arrogance, Jamie\u2019s remarks aimed at Forbes\u2019s leading the attack on Fogarty Simms as a low-minded and cowardly attempt to make himself look the big man at the price of a defenseless man\u2019s life, Forbes\u2014shifting into English here, as he realized that they had become the cynosure of the room\u2014taking the view that Jamie\u2019s presence here was an unwarrantable affront to those who truly held the ideals of liberty and justice, as everyone knew he was in truth the King\u2019s man, but he, the puffed-up c*ck o\u2019 the walk, thought that he could pull the wool over everyone\u2019s eyes long enough to betray the whole boiling, but if he, Fraser, thought he, Forbes, was fool enough to be gulled by antic tricks in the public street and a lot of talk with nay more substance than the shrieking of gulls, he, Fraser, had best think again!</p><p>Jamie slapped a hand flat on the table, making it boom like a drum, and rattling the cups. He rose, glaring down at Forbes.</p><p>\u201cDo ye libel my honor, sir?\u201d he cried, also shifting to English. \u201cFor if ye do, let us go out, and we shall settle the matter at once, yea or nay!\u201d</p> <p>Sweat was streaming down Forbes\u2019s broad, flushed face, and his eyes were gleaming with anger, but even overheated as he was, Roger saw belated caution pluck at his sleeve. Roger hadn\u2019t seen the fight in Cross Creek, but Ian had told him the details, meanwhile laughing his head off. The last thing Neil Forbes could desire was a duel.</p><p>\u201cHave ye honor to libel, sir?\u201d Forbes demanded, standing in turn, and drawing himself up as though about to address the jury. \u201cYe come here acting the great one, carousing and showing away like a sailor come ashore with prize money in his pocket\u2014but have we any evidence that your words are more than puffery? Puffery, I say, sir!\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood, both hands braced on the tabletop, surveying Forbes through narrowed eyes. Roger had once seen that expression focused on himself. It had been followed rapidly by the sort of mayhem customary in a Glasgow pub on Saturday night\u2014only more so. The only thing to be thankful for was that Forbes had clearly not heard any whiff of Malva Christie\u2019s accusation, or there would be blood on the floor already.</p><p>Jamie straightened slowly, and his left hand went toward his waist. There were gasps, and Forbes paled. But Jamie had reached for his sporran, not his dirk, and plunged his hand inside.</p><p>\u201cAs to that . . . sir . . .\u201d he said in a low, even voice that carried through the room, \u201cI have made myself clear. I am for liberty, and to that end, I pledge my name, my fortune\u201d\u2014here he withdrew his hand from his sporran and slammed it on the table; a small purse, two golden guineas, and a jewel\u2014\u201cand my sacred honor.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, all eyes focused on the black diamond, which shimmered with a baleful light. Jamie paused for the space of three heartbeats, then drew breath.</p> <p>\u201cIs there any man here who gives me the lie?\u201d he said. It was ostensibly addressed to the room at large, but his eyes were fixed on Forbes. The lawyer had gone a mottled red and gray, like a bad oyster, but said nothing.</p><p>Jamie paused again, looked once round the room, then picked up purse, money, and jewel, and stalked out the door. Outside, the town clock chimed two, the strokes slow and heavy in the humid air.</p><p>L\u2019OIGNON\u2013INTELLIGENCER</p><p>Upon the 20th of this month, a Congress met in Charlotte, composed of Delegates from Mecklenberg County, for the purpose of discussion upon the issue of current Relations with Great Britain. After due Deliberation, a Declaration was proposed and accepted, whose Provisions are Herewith Shown:</p><p>1. That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted or in any way, form or manner countenanced to unchartered &amp; dangerous invasion of our rights as claimed by G. Britain is an enemy to this County\u2014to America &amp; to the inherent &amp; inaliable rights of man.</p><p>2. We the Citizens of Mecklenburg County do hereby desolve the political bands which have connected us to the Mother Country &amp; hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British crown &amp; abjure all political connection, contract or association with that nation who have wantonly trampled on our rights &amp; liberties &amp; inhumanely shed the innocent blood of American patriots at Lexington.</p><p>3. We do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people\u2014are &amp; of right ought to be a sovereign &amp; self-governing association, under the controul of no power other than that of our God &amp; the general government of the congress, to the maintainence of which independence civil &amp; religious we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes &amp; our most sacred honor.</p><p>4. As we now acknowledge the existence &amp; controul of no law or legal officers, civil or military, within this County, we do hereby ordain &amp; adopt as a rule of life, all, each &amp; every of our former laws\u2014wherein nevertheless the crown of Great Britain never can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities, or authority therein.</p> <p>5. It is also further decreed that all, each &amp; every military officer in this County is hereby reinstated in his former command &amp; authority, he acting conformably to these regulations. And that every member present of this delegation shall henceforth be a civil officer, viz. a Justice of the peace in the character of a \u201cCommittee-man\u201d to issue process, hear &amp; determine all matters of controversy according to sd. adopted laws\u2014to preserve peace, union &amp; harmony in sd. County &amp; to use every exertion to spread the love of country &amp; fire of freedom throughout America until a more general &amp; organized government be established in this province. A selection from the members present shall constitute a Committee of public safety for sd. County.</p><p>6. That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted by express to the President of the Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia, to be laid before that body.</p><p>84</p><p>AMONG THE LETTUCES</p><p>SOME IDIOT\u2014OR CHILD\u2014 had left the gate of my garden open. I hurried up the path, hoping that it hadn\u2019t been that way for long. If it had been open overnight, the deer would have eaten every lettuce, onion, and bulb plant in the plot, to say nothing of ruining the\u2014</p><p>I jerked, letting out a small cry. Something like a red-hot hat pin had stabbed me in the neck, and I smacked the place by reflex. An electric jab in the temple made my vision go white, then blur with water, and a fiery stab in the crook of my elbow\u2014bees.</p><p>I blundered off the path, suddenly aware that the air was full of them, frenzied and stinging. I plunged through the brush, barely able to see for the watering of my eyes, aware too late of the low-pitched thrum of a hive at war.</p><p>Bear! God damn it, a bear had got in! In the half-second between the first sting and the next, I had glimpsed one of the bee gums lying on its side in the dirt just inside the gate, combs and honey spilling out of it like entrails.</p><p>I ducked under branches and flung myself into a patch of pokeweed, gasping and cursing incoherently. The sting on my neck throbbed viciously, and the one on my temple was already puffing up, pulling at the eyelid on that side. I felt something crawling on my ankle, and batted it away by reflex before it could sting.</p><p>I wiped tears away, blinking. A few bees sailed past through the yellow-flowered stems above me, aggressive as Spitfires. I crawled a little farther, trying at once to get away, slap at my hair, and shake out my skirts, lest any more of them be trapped in my clothes.</p><p>I was breathing like a steam engine, shaking with adrenaline and fury.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell . . . frigging bear . . . God damn it . . .\u201d</p><p>My strong impulse was to rush in screaming and flapping my skirts, in hopes of panicking the bear. An equally strong impulse of self-preservation overcame it.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, and keeping low in case of enraged bees, thrust my way through the brush uphill, meaning to circle the garden and come down on the other side, away from the ravaged hives. I could get back to the path that way and down to the house, where I could recruit help\u2014preferably armed\u2014to drive away the monster before it destroyed the rest of the hives.</p><p>No point in keeping quiet, and I crashed through bushes and stumbled over logs, panting with rage. I tried to see the bear, but the growth of grapevines over the palisades was too thick to show me anything but rustling leaves and sun shadows. The side of my face felt as though it were on fire, and jolts of pain shot through the trigeminal nerve with each heartbeat, making the muscles twitch and the eye water terribly.</p><p>I reached the path just below the spot where the first bee had stung me\u2014my gardening basket lay where I\u2019d dropped it, tools spilled out. I grabbed the knife I used for everything from pruning to digging roots; it was a stout thing, with a six-inch blade, and while it might not impress the bear, I felt better for having it.</p><p>I glanced at the open gate, ready to run\u2014but saw nothing. The ruined hive lay just as I\u2019d seen it, the wax combs broken and squashed, the smell of honey thick in the air. But the combs were not scattered; shattered pillars of wax still stuck to the exposed wooden base of the hive.</p><p>A bee zoomed menacingly past my ear and I ducked, but didn\u2019t run. It was quiet. I tried to stop panting, trying to hear over the thunder of my own racing pulse. Bears weren\u2019t quiet; they didn\u2019t need to be. I should hear snufflings and gulping noises, at least\u2014rustlings of broken foliage, the lap of a long tongue. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Cautiously, I moved sideways up the path, a step at a time, ready to run. There was a good-size oak, about twenty feet away. Could I make that, if the bear popped out?</p><p>I listened as hard as I could, but heard nothing beyond the soft rustle of the grapevines and the sound of angry bees, now dropped to a whining hum as they gathered thick on the remnants of their combs.</p><p>It was gone. Had to be. Still wary, I edged closer, knife in hand.</p><p>I smelled the blood and saw her in the same instant. She was lying in the salad bed, her skirt flown out like some gigantic, rusty flower blooming amid the young lettuces.</p><p>I was kneeling by her, with no memory of reaching her, and the flesh of her arm was warm when I grasped her wrist\u2014such small, fragile bones\u2014but slack, there was no pulse\u2014Of course not, said the cold small watcher inside, her throat is cut, there\u2019s blood everywhere, but you can see the artery isn\u2019t pumping; she\u2019s dead.</p><p>Malva\u2019s gray eyes were open, blank with surprise, and her cap had fallen off. I clutched her wrist harder, as though I must be able to find the buried pulse, to find some trace of life . . . and did. The bulge of her belly moved, very slightly, and I dropped the flaccid arm at once and seized my knife, scrabbling for the hem of her skirt.</p><p>I acted without thought, without fear, without doubt\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything but the knife and the pressure, the flesh parting and the faint possibility, the panic of absolute need . . .</p><p>I slit the belly from navel to pubis, pushing hard through slack muscle, nicked the womb but no matter, cut quick but careful through the wall of the womb, dropped the knife, and thrust my hands into the depths of Malva Christie, still blood-warm, and seized the child, cupping, turning, wrenching hard in my frenzy to pull it free, bring it out from sure death, bring it into the air, help it breathe. . . . Malva\u2019s body flopped and heaved as I jerked, limp limbs flailing with the force of my yanking.</p><p>It came free with the suddenness of birth, and I was swiping blood and mucus from the tiny sealed face, blowing into its lungs, gently, gently, you have to blow gently, the alveoli of the lungs are like cobwebs, so small, compressing its chest, no more than a hand\u2019s span, two fingers pressing, no more, and felt the tiny spring of it, delicate as a watch spring, felt the movement, small squirms, a faint instinctive struggling\u2014and felt it fade, that flicker, that tiny spark of life, cried out in anguish and clutched the tiny, doll-like body to my breast, still warm, still warm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I said, \u201cdon\u2019t go, don\u2019t go, please don\u2019t go.\u201d But the vibrancy faded, a small blue glow that seemed to light the palms of my hands for an instant, then dwindle like a candle flame, to the coal of a smoldering wick, to the faintest trace of brightness\u2014then everything was dark.</p><p>I was still sitting in the brilliant sun, crying and blood-soaked, the body of the little boy in my lap, the butchered corpse of my Malva beside me, when they found me.</p><p>85</p><p>THE STOLEN BRIDE</p><p>A WEEK PASSED AFTER MALVA\u2019S DEATH, and there was no slightest hint of who had killed her. Whispering, sidelong glances, and a palpable fog of suspicion hung about the Ridge, but despite Jamie\u2019s every effort, no one could be located who knew\u2014or would say\u2014anything at all useful.</p><p>I could see the tension and frustration building up in Jamie, day by day, and knew it must find an outlet. I had no idea what he might do, though.</p><p>After breakfast on the Wednesday, Jamie stood glowering at the window in his study, then slammed down his fist on the table, with a suddenness that made me jump.</p><p>\u201cI have reached the mortal limit of endurance,\u201d he informed me. \u201cOne moment more of this, and I shall run mad. I must do something, and I will.\u201d Without waiting for any response to this statement, he strode to the office door, flung it open, and bellowed, \u201cJoseph!\u201d into the hall.</p><p>Mr. Wemyss appeared out of the kitchen, where he had been sweeping the chimney at Mrs. Bug\u2019s direction, looking startled, pale, soot-smudged, and generally unkempt.</p><p>Jamie ignored the black footprints on the study floor\u2014he had burned the rug\u2014and fixed Mr. Wemyss with a commanding gaze.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want that woman?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWoman?\u201d Mr. Wemyss was understandably bewildered. \u201cWhat\u2014oh. Are you\u2014might you be referring to Fraulein Berrisch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else? D\u2019ye want her?\u201d Jamie repeated.</p><p>It had plainly been a long time since anyone had asked Mr. Wemyss what he wanted, and it took him some time to gather his wits from the shock of it.</p><p>Brutal prodding by Jamie forced him past deprecating murmurs about the Fraulein\u2019s friends no doubt being the best judge of her happiness, his own unsuitability, poverty, and general unworthiness as a husband, and into\u2014at long last\u2014a reckless admission that, well, if the Fraulein should not be terribly averse to the prospect, perhaps . . . well . . . in a word . . .</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d he said, looking terrified at his own boldness. \u201cI do. Very much!\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jamie nodded, pleased. \u201cWe\u2019ll go and get her, then.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss was open-mouthed with astonishment; so was I. Jamie swung round to me, issuing orders with the confidence and joie de vivre of a sea-captain with a fat prize in view.</p><p>\u201cGo and find Young Ian for me, will ye, Sassenach? And tell Mrs. Bug to put up food, enough for a week\u2019s travel for four men. And then fetch Roger Mac; we\u2019ll need a minister.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands together in satisfaction, then clapped Mr. Wemyss on the shoulder, causing a small puff of soot to rise from his clothes.</p><p>\u201cGo fettle yourself, Joseph,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd comb your hair. We\u2019re going to go and steal ye a bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . AND PUT A PISTOL TO his breest, his breest,\u201d Young Ian chanted, \u201cMarry me, marry me, minister, or else I\u2019ll be your priest, your priest\u2014or else I\u2019ll be your priest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Roger said, dropping the song, in which a bold young man named Willie rides with his friends to abduct and forcibly marry a young woman who proves bolder yet, \u201cwe\u2019ll hope ye prove a wee bit more capable than Willie upon the night, aye, Joseph?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss, scrubbed, dressed, and fairly vibrating with excitement, gave him a glance of complete incomprehension. Roger grinned, tightening the strap of his saddlebag.</p><p>\u201cYoung Willie obliges a minister to marry him to the young woman at gunpoint,\u201d he explained to Mr. Wemyss, \u201cbut then, when he takes his stolen bride to bed, she\u2019ll have none of him\u2014and his best efforts will not avail to force her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so return me, Willie, to my hame, as virgin as I came, I came\u2014as virgin as I came!\u201d Ian caroled.</p><p>\u201cNow, mind,\u201d Roger said warningly to Jamie, who was heaving his own saddlebags over Gideon\u2019s back. \u201cIf the Fraulein is at all unwilling . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, unwilling to be wed to Joseph?\u201d Jamie clapped Mr. Wemyss on the back, then bent to give him a foot up and fairly heaved the smaller man into the saddle. \u201cI canna see any woman of sense turning from such an opportunity, can you, a charaid?\u201d</p><p>He took a quick look round the clearing, to see all was well, then ran up the steps and kissed me in quick farewell, before running down again to mount Gideon, who for once seemed amenable and made no effort to bite him.</p><p>\u201cKeep well, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said, smiling into my eyes. And then they were gone, thundering out of the clearing like a gang of Highland raiders, Ian\u2019s ear-splitting whoops ringing from the trees.</p><p>ODDLY ENOUGH, the departure of the men seemed to ease things slightly. The talk, of course, went merrily on\u2014but without Jamie or Ian there to serve as a lightning-rod, it merely crackled to and fro like St. Elmo\u2019s fire; spitting, fizzing, and making everyone\u2019s hair stand on end, but essentially a harmless phenomenon, unless touched directly.</p><p>The house felt less an embattled fortress, and more the eye of a storm.</p><p>Also, with Mr. Wemyss out of the house, Lizzie came to visit, bringing little Rodney Joseph, as the baby was called\u2014Roger having set his face firmly against the young fathers\u2019 enthusiastic suggestions of Tilgath-pileser and Ichabod. Wee Rogerina had come out of it all right, being now commonly known as Rory, but Roger declined entirely to hear of a child being christened anything that might result in his being known to the world at large as Icky.</p><p>Rodney seemed a very congenial child, in part because he had never quite lost that air of round-eyed astonishment that made him seem agog to hear what you had to say. Lizzie\u2019s astonishment at his birth had mutated into an enchantment that might have completely eclipsed Jo and Kezzie, were it not for the fact that they shared it.</p><p>Either one of them would\u2014unless forcibly stopped\u2014spend half an hour discussing Rodney\u2019s bowel habits with the intensity heretofore reserved for new snares and the peculiar things found inside the stomachs of animals they had killed. Pigs, it seemed, really would eat anything; so would Rodney.</p><p>A few days after the men\u2019s departure on their bride-stealing expedition, Brianna had come up from her cabin with Jemmy to visit, and Lizzie likewise had brought Rodney. The two of them joined Amy McCallum and me in the kitchen, where we were spending a pleasant evening sewing by the light of the fire, admiring Rodney, keeping a negligent eye on Jemmy and Aidan\u2014and after a certain amount of cautious exploration, devoting ourselves wholeheartedly to a rundown of the male population of the Ridge, viewed in the light of suspects.</p><p>I, of course, had a more personal and painful interest in the topic, but all three of the young women were solidly on the side of justice\u2014i.e., the side that refused even to contemplate the notion that either Jamie or I might have had anything to do with the murder of Malva Christie.</p><p>For myself, I found such open speculation rather a comfort. I had, of course, been engaging in private conjecture nonstop\u2014and an exhausting business it was, too. Not only was it unpleasant to visualize every man I knew in the role of cold-blooded murderer\u2014the process obliged me continuously to reimagine the murder itself, and relive the moment when I had found her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really hate to think it might have been Bobby,\u201d Bree said, frowning as she pushed a wooden darning egg into the heel of a sock. \u201cHe seems just such a nice boy.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie drew down her chin at this, pursing her lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, he\u2019s a sweet lad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what ye might call warm-blooded.\u201d</p><p>All of us looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said mildly, \u201cI didna let him, but he tried hard enough. And when I said no, he did go off and kick a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband would do that sometimes, if I refused him,\u201d Amy said, thoughtful. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he wouldna have cut my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but Malva didn\u2019t refuse whoever it was,\u201d Bree pointed out, squinting as she threaded her darning needle. \u201cThat was the problem. He killed her because she was pregnant, and he was afraid she\u2019d tell everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo!\u201d Lizzie said, triumphant. \u201cWell, then\u2014it canna have been Bobby at all, can it? For when my Da turned him awa\u2019\u2014\u201d A brief shadow crossed her face at mention of her father, who still had not spoken a word to her nor acknowledged the birth of little Rodney. \u201cDid he not think of speiring for Malva Christie? Ian said he meant to. And if she were with child by him\u2014well, then, her father would be obliged to agree, would he not?\u201d</p><p>Amy nodded, finding this convincing, but Bree had objections.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but she was insisting that it wasn\u2019t his baby. And he threw up in the blackberry bushes when he heard that she was\u201d\u2014her lips compressed momentarily\u2014\u201cwell, he wasn\u2019t happy at all. So he might have killed her out of jealousy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Lizzie and Amy hmm\u2019d dubiously at this\u2014both of them were fond of Bobby\u2014but were obliged to admit the possibility.</p><p>\u201cWhat I wonder about,\u201d I said a little hesitantly, \u201cis the older men. The married ones. Everyone knows about the young men who were interested in her\u2014but I\u2019ve certainly seen more than one married man glance at her in passing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nominate Hiram Crombie,\u201d Bree said at once, stabbing her needle into the heel of the sock. Everyone laughed, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s always the really religious, very uptight ones that turn out to have secret drawers full of women\u2019s underwear, and slink around molesting choirboys.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cDrawers full of women\u2019s underwear?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat . . . shifts and stays? Whatever would he do wi\u2019 them?\u201d</p><p>Brianna flushed at that, having forgotten her audience. She coughed, but there was no good way out.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . well. I was thinking more of French women\u2019s underwear,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cUm . . . lacy sorts of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, French,\u201d Lizzie said, nodding wisely. Everyone knew about the notorious reputation of French ladies\u2014though I doubted that any woman on Fraser\u2019s Ridge save myself had ever seen one. In the interests of covering Bree\u2019s lapse, though, I obligingly told them about La Nestl\u00e9, the King of France\u2019s mistress, who had had her n**ples pierced and appeared at court with her br**sts exposed, sporting gold hoops through them.</p><p>\u201cAnother few months o\u2019 this,\u201d Lizzie said darkly, looking down at Rodney, who was nursing fiercely at her breast, tiny fists clenched with effort, \u201cand I shall be able to do the same. I\u2019ll tell Jo and Kezzie to fetch me back some hoops when they sell their hides, aye?\u201d</p><p>In the midst of the laughter at this, the sound of a knock at the front door passed unnoticed\u2014or would have, if not for Jemmy and Aidan, who had been playing in Jamie\u2019s study, rushing into the kitchen to tell us about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Bree set down her darning, but I was already on my feet.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go.\u201d I waved her back, picked up a candlestick, and went down the dark hallway, heart beating fast. Visitors after dark were almost always an emergency of one kind or another.</p><p>So was this one, though not any kind I might have expected. For a moment, I didn\u2019t even recognize the tall woman who stood swaying on the stoop, white-faced and gaunt. Then she whispered, \u201cFrau Fraser? I may\u2014may I komm?\u201d and fell into my arms.</p><p>The noise of it brought all the young women rushing to help, and we had Monika Berrisch\u2014for it was indeed Mr. Wemyss\u2019s putative bride\u2014laid on the settle, covered with quilts, and plied with hot toddy in nothing flat.</p><p>She recovered quickly\u2014there was nothing wrong with her, really, save exhaustion and hunger\u2014she said she hadn\u2019t eaten in three days\u2014and within a short time, was able to sit up eating soup, and explain her astonishing presence.</p><p>\u201cIt wass my husband\u2019s sister,\u201d she said, closing her eyes in momentary bliss at the aroma of split-pea soup with ham. \u201cShe did not want me, effer, and when her husband had the bad accident and lost his wagon, so there was not so much money to keep us all, she did not want me more.\u201d</p><p>She had, she said, yearned for Joseph, but had not had either the strength nor yet the means to withstand her family\u2019s opposition and insist upon returning to him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Lizzie was examining her in a close, but not unfriendly manner. \u201cWhat happpened, then?\u201d</p><p>Fraulein Berrisch turned large, gentle eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cI could not bear it more,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI wish so much to be with Joseph. My husband\u2019s sister, she wish me to be gone, so she will give a small bit of money. So I came,\u201d she concluded, with a shrug, and took another small, greedy spoonful of soup.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . walked?\u201d Brianna said. \u201cFrom Halifax?\u201d</p><p>Fraulein Berrisch nodded, licking the spoon, and put out a foot from under the quilts. Her shoes had worn entirely through at the sole; she had wrapped them with random scraps of leather and strips of fabric torn from her shift, so her feet looked like bundles of filthy rags.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d she said, looking earnestly at Lizzie. \u201cI hope you do not mind I komm. Your father\u2014he is hier? I hope so much he does not mind, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, no,\u201d I said, exchanging a glance with Lizzie. \u201cHe isn\u2019t here\u2014but I\u2019m sure that he\u2019ll be delighted to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her gaunt face, which had shown alarm at hearing that Mr. Wemyss was not here, grew radiant when we told her where he was.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed, clasping the spoon to her bosom as though it were Mr. Wemyss\u2019s head. \u201cOh, mein Kavalier!\u201d Beaming with joy, she looked round at all of us\u2014and for the first time, noticed Rodney, snoozing in his basket at Lizzie\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cBut who is this?\u201d she cried, and leaned forward to look at him. Not quite asleep, Rodney opened round, dark eyes and regarded her with a solemn, sleepy interest.</p><p>\u201cThis is my wee bairnie. Rodney Joseph, he\u2019s called\u2014for my Da, ken?\u201d Lizzie hoisted him out of his basket, chubby knees pulled up under his chin, and laid him gently in Monika\u2019s arms.</p><p>She cooed over him in German, face alight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGranny lust,\u201d Bree muttered to me, out of the side of her mouth, and I felt laughter bubble up under my stays. I hadn\u2019t laughed since before Malva\u2019s death, and found it balm to the spirit.</p><p>Lizzie was explaining earnestly to Monika the estrangement resulting from her unorthodox marriage, to which Monika was nodding, clicking her tongue in sympathetic understanding\u2014and I did wonder how much of it she grasped\u2014and talking baby-talk to Rodney all at once.</p><p>\u201cFat chance of Mr. Wemyss staying estranged,\u201d I said out of the side of my own mouth. \u201cKeep his new wife from her new grandson? Ha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what\u2019s a little matter of dual sons-in-law?\u201d Bree agreed.</p> <p>Amy was regarding the tender scene with a slight sense of wistfulness. She reached out and put an arm round Aidan\u2019s skinny shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell, they do say, the more, the merrier,\u201d she said.</p><p>86</p><p>PRIORITIES</p><p>THREE SHIRTS, AN EXTRA PAIR of decent breeches, two pair of stockings, one lisle, one silk\u2014wait, where were the silk ones?</p> <p>Brianna stepped to the door and called to her husband, who was industriously laying segments of clay pipe into the trench he had dug, assisted by Jemmy and Aidan.</p><p>\u201cRoger! What have you done with your silk stockings?\u201d</p><p>He paused, frowning, and rubbed his head. Then, handing the shovel to Aidan, he came across to the house, leaping over the open trench.</p><p>\u201cI wore them last Sunday to preach, no?\u201d he asked, reaching her. \u201cWhat did I . . . oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said suspiciously, seeing his face change from puzzlement to guilt. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018oh\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . well, you\u2019d stayed to home with Jem and his stomachache\u201d\u2014a tactically helpful ailment, greatly exaggerated in order to keep her from having to sit through two hours of staring and whispering\u2014\u201cso when Jocky Abernathy asked me would I care to go fishing with him . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoger MacKenzie,\u201d she said, fixing him with a look of wrath, \u201cif you put your good silk stockings in a creel full of smelly fish and forgot them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just nip up to the house and borrow a pair from your Da, shall I?\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019m sure mine will turn up, somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will your head,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably under a rock!\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh, which was not what she had intended, but which had the effect of easing her temper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, leaning forward to kiss her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s probably Freudian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what does leaving your stockings wrapped around a dead trout symbolize?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGeneralized guilt and divided loyalties, I imagine,\u201d he said, still joking, but not so much. \u201cBree\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking. I really don\u2019t think I should go. I don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d she said, as firmly as possible. \u201cDa says so, Mama says so, and so do I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, well, then.\u201d He smiled, but she could see the uneasiness under his humor\u2014the more so because she shared it. Malva Christie\u2019s murder had caused an uproar on the Ridge\u2014alarm, hysteria, suspicion, and finger-pointing in every direction. Several young men\u2014Bobby Higgins among them\u2014had simply disappeared from the Ridge, whether from a sense of guilt, or merely from a sense of self-preservation.</p><p>There had been accusations enough to go around; even she herself had come in for her share of gossip and suspicion, some of her unguarded remarks about Malva Christie having been repeated. But by far the greatest weight of suspicion rested squarely on her parents.</p><p>Both of them were doing their best to go about their daily business, grimly ignoring the gossip and the pointed looks\u2014but it was getting harder; anyone could see that.</p><p>Roger had gone at once to visit the Christies\u2014had gone every day since Malva\u2019s death save for his hasty expedition to Halifax\u2014had buried the girl with simplicity and tears\u2014and had since worn himself out with being reasonable and soothing and firm to everyone else on the Ridge. He had immediately put aside his plan to go to Edenton for ordination, but Jamie, hearing of it, had insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done everything here you could possibly do,\u201d Brianna said, for the hundredth time. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you can do to help\u2014and it might be years before you have another chance.\u201d</p><p>She knew how urgently he wished to be ordained, and would have done anything to further that wish. For herself, she wished that she could see it; but without a great deal of talk, they had agreed that it was best for her and Jem to go to River Run, and wait there for Roger to make the trip to Edenton and then return. It couldn\u2019t do a candidate for ordination any good to turn up with a Catholic wife and child.</p><p>The guilt of leaving, though, with her parents standing in the eye of the whirlwind . . .</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut maybe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped her with a look.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ve done that.\u201d His argument was that her presence couldn\u2019t affect public opinion, which was probably true. She realized that his real reason\u2014shared by her parents\u2014was a desire to get her and Jem away from the situation on the Ridge, out of the uproar and safe, preferably before Jem realized that a good many of the neighbors thought that one, if not both, of his grandparents was a cold-blooded murderer.</p><p>And, to her private shame, she was eager to go.</p><p>Someone had killed Malva\u2014and her baby. Every time she thought of it, the possibilities swam before her, the litany of names. And every time, she was forced to see her cousin\u2019s name among them. Ian had not run away, and she couldn\u2019t\u2014could not\u2014think that it had been him. And yet every day she was obliged to see Ian, and to contemplate the possibility.</p><p>She stood staring into the bag she was packing, folding and refolding the shirt in her hands, looking for reasons to go, reasons to stay\u2014and knowing that no reason had any power at all, not now.</p><p>A dull thunk! from outside jerked her from her mire of indecision.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d She reached the door in two steps, fast enough to see Jem and Aidan disappearing into the woods like a pair of rabbits. On the edge of the trench lay the cracked pieces of the pipe segment they had just dropped.</p><p>\u201cYou little snot-rags!\u201d she bellowed, and grabbed for a broom\u2014intending what she didn\u2019t know, but violence seemed the only outlet for the frustration that had just erupted like a volcano, searing through her.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d Roger said softly, and put a hand on her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away and rounded on him, the blood roaring in her ears.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long it takes to make one of those? How many firings it takes to get one that\u2019s not cracked? How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do know,\u201d he said, his voice level. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still not important.\u201d</p><p>She stood trembling, breathing hard. Very gently, he reached out and took the broom from her, standing it neatly back in its place.</p><p>\u201cI need\u2014to go,\u201d she said, when she could form words again, and he nodded, his eyes tinged with the sadness he had carried ever since the day of Malva\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>He came behind her, put his arms around her, his chin resting on her shoulder, and gradually she stopped shaking. Across the clearing, she saw Mrs. Bug come down the path from the garden with an apron full of cabbages and carrots; Claire had not set foot in her garden since . . .</p><p>\u201cWill they be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pray that they will,\u201d he said, and tightened his arms around her. She was comforted by his touch, and didn\u2019t notice until later that he had not in fact reassured her that they would.</p><p>87</p><p>JUSTICE IS MINE,</p><p>SAYETH THE LORD</p><p>I POKED AT THE LAST PACKAGE from Lord John, trying to work up enough enthusiasm to open it. It was a small wooden crate; perhaps more vitriol. I supposed I should make a fresh batch of ether\u2014but then, what was the point? People had stopped coming to my surgery, even for the treatment of minor cuts and bruises, let alone the odd appendectomy.</p><p>I ran a finger through the dust on the counter, and thought that I should at least take care of that; Mrs. Bug kept the rest of the house spotless, but wouldn\u2019t come into the surgery. I added dusting to the long list of things that I should do, but made no move to go and find a dust cloth.</p><p>Sighing, I got up and went across the hall. Jamie was sitting at his desk, twiddling a quill and staring at a half-finished letter. He put down the quill when he saw me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, and he nodded, accepting it at face value. His face showed the lines of strain, and I knew that he was no more all right than I was. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Ian all day. Did he say he was going?\u201d To the Cherokee, I meant. Little wonder if he wanted to get away from the Ridge; I thought it had taken a good deal of fortitude for him to stay as long as he had, bearing the stares and murmurs\u2014and the outright accusations.</p><p>Jamie nodded again, and dropped the quill back into its jar.</p><p>\u201cAye, I told him to go. No purpose to him staying any longer; there\u2019d only be more fights.\u201d Ian didn\u2019t say anything about the fights, but had more than once turned up to supper with the marks of battle on him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, I\u2019d better tell Mrs. Bug before she starts the supper.\u201d Still, I made no motion to get up, finding some small sense of comfort in Jamie\u2019s presence, some surcease from the constant memory of the small, bloody weight in my lap, inert as a lump of meat\u2014and the sight of Malva\u2019s eyes, so surprised.</p><p>I heard horses in the yard, several of them. I glanced at Jamie, who shook his head, brows raised, then rose to go and meet the visitors, whoever they were. I followed him down the hall, wiping my hands on my apron and mentally revising the supper menu to accommodate what sounded like at least a dozen guests, from the whickering and murmuring I heard in the dooryard.</p><p>Jamie opened the door, and stopped dead. I looked over his shoulder, and felt terror seize me. Horsemen, black against the sinking sun, and in that moment, I was back in the whisky clearing, damp with sweat and clad in nothing but my shift. Jamie heard my gasp, and put back a hand, to keep me away.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye want, Brown?\u201d he said, sounding most unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come for your wife,\u201d said Richard Brown. There was an unmistakable note of gloating in his voice, and hearing it, the down hairs on my body rippled with cold, and black spots floated in my field of vision. I stepped back, hardly feeling my feet, and took hold of the doorjamb to my surgery, clinging to it for support.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye can just be on your way, then,\u201d Jamie replied, with the same unfriendly tone. \u201cYe\u2019ve nothing to do with my wife, nor she with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now, there you\u2019re wrong, Mister Fraser.\u201d My vision had cleared, and I saw him urge his horse up closer to the stoop. He leaned down, peering through the door, and evidently saw me, for he smiled, in a most unpleasant fashion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to arrest your wife, for the dastard crime of murder.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand tensed where he gripped the door, and he drew himself slowly to his fullest height, seeming to expand as he did so.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll leave my land, sir,\u201d he said, and his voice had dropped to a level just above the rustlings of horses and harness. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p><p>I felt, rather than heard, footsteps behind me. Mrs. Bug, coming to see what was afoot.</p><p>\u201cBride save us,\u201d she whispered, seeing the men. Then she was gone, running back through the house, light-footed as a deer. I should follow her, I knew, escape through the back door, run up into the forest, hide. But my limbs were frozen. I could barely breathe, let alone move.</p><p>And Richard Brown was looking at me over Jamie\u2019s shoulder, open dislike mingling with triumph.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll leave,\u201d he said, straightening up. \u201cHand her over, and we\u2019ll be gone. Vanished like the morning dew,\u201d he said, and laughed. Dimly, I wondered whether he was drunk.</p><p>\u201cBy what right do you come here?\u201d Jamie demanded. His left hand rose, rested on the hilt of his dirk in plain threat. The sight of it galvanized me, finally, and I stumbled down the hall, toward the kitchen where the guns were kept.</p><p>\u201c. . . Committee of Safety.\u201d I caught those words in Brown\u2019s voice, raised in threat, and then was through into the kitchen. I grabbed the fowling piece from its hooks above the hearth, and wrenching open the drawer of the sideboard, hastily bundled the three pistols there into the large pockets of my surgical apron, made to hold instruments while I worked.</p><p>My hands were shaking. I hesitated\u2014the pistols were primed and loaded; Jamie checked them every night\u2014should I take the shot pouch, the powder horn? No time. I heard Jamie\u2019s voice and Richard Brown\u2019s, shouting now at the front of the house.</p><p>The sound of the back door opening jerked my head up, and I saw an unfamiliar man pause in the doorway, looking round. He saw me and started toward me, grinning, hand out to seize my arm.</p><p>I lifted a pistol from my apron and shot him, point-blank. The grin didn\u2019t leave his face, but took on a slightly puzzled air. He blinked once or twice, then put a hand to his side, where a reddening spot was beginning to spread on his shirt. He looked at his blood-smeared fingers, and his jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cWell, goddamn!\u201d he said. \u201cYou shot me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said, breathless. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bloody do it again, if you don\u2019t get out of here!\u201d I dropped the empty pistol on the floor with a crash, and scrabbled one-handed in my apron pocket for another, still holding the fowling piece in a death grip.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see if I meant it, but whirled and crashed into the door frame, then stumbled through it, leaving a smear of blood on the wood.</p><p>Wisps of black-powder smoke floated in the air, mingling oddly with the scent of roasting fish, and I thought for an instant that I might throw up, but managed despite my nausea to set down the fowling piece for a moment and bar the door, my hands shaking so that it took several tries.</p><p>Sudden sounds from the front of the house drove nerves and everything else from my mind, and I was running down the hall, gun in hand, before I had made a conscious decision to move, the heavy pistols in my apron banging against my thighs.</p><p>They\u2019d dragged Jamie off the porch; I caught a brief glimpse of him in the midst of a surging melee of bodies. They\u2019d stopped shouting. There wasn\u2019t any noise at all, save for small grunts and the impact of flesh, the scuffling of myriad feet in the dust. It was deadly earnest, that struggle, and I knew at once that they meant to kill him.</p><p>I leveled the fowling piece at the edge of the crowd farthest from Jamie, and pulled the trigger. The crash of the gun and the startled screams seemed to come together, and the scene before me flew apart, the knot of men dissolving, peppered with bird shot. Jamie had kept hold of his dirk; with a little room around him now, I saw him drive it into one man\u2019s side, wrench it back and lash sideways in the same motion, scoring a bloody furrow across the forehead of a man who had fallen back a little.</p><p>Then I caught a glimpse of metal to one side and by reflex shrieked \u201cDUCK!\u201d an instant before Brown\u2019s pistol fired. There was a small tchoong past my ear, and I realized, in a very calm sort of way, that Brown had fired at me, not Jamie.</p><p>Jamie had, however, ducked. So had everyone else in the yard, and men were now scrambling to their feet, confused, the impetus of the attack dispersed. Jamie had dived toward the porch; he was up and stumbling toward me, striking viciously with the hilt of his dirk at a man who grabbed at his sleeve, so the man fell back with a cry.</p><p>We might have rehearsed it a dozen times. He took the steps of the porch in one leap and flung himself into me, carrying us both through the door, then spun on his heel and slammed the door, throwing himself against it and holding it against the frenzied impact of bodies for the instant it took me to drop the fowling piece, seize the bolt, and lift it into place.</p><p>It fell into its hooks with a thunk.</p><p>The door vibrated to the blows of fists and shoulders, and the shouting had started up again, but with a different sound. No gloating, no taunting. Cursing still, but with a set, malign intent.</p><p>Neither of us paused to listen.</p><p>\u201cI barred the kitchen door,\u201d I gasped, and Jamie nodded, diving into my surgery to secure the bolts of the inside shutters there. I heard the crash of breaking glass in the surgery behind me as I ran into his study; the windows there were smaller, and not glass, placed high in the wall. I slammed the shutters to and bolted them, then ran back into the suddenly darkened hallway to find the gun.</p><p>Jamie had it already; he was in the kitchen, grabbing things, and as I started toward the kitchen door, he came out of it, hung about with shot pouches, powder horns, and the like, fowling piece in his hand, and with a jerk of the head, motioned me before him up the stairs.</p><p>The rooms above were still filled with light; it was like bursting up from underwater, and I gulped the light as though it were air, dazzled and eyes watering as I rushed to bolt the shutters in the boxroom and Amy McCallum\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t know where Amy and her sons were; I could only be grateful that they weren\u2019t in the house at the moment.</p><p>I ran into the bedroom, gasping. Jamie was kneeling by the window, methodically loading guns and saying something under his breath in Gaelic\u2014prayer or cursing, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask if he was hurt. His face was bruised, his lip was split, and blood had run down his chin onto his shirt, he was covered with dirt and what I assumed to be smears of other peoples\u2019 blood, and the ear on the side closest me was swollen. But he was steady in his movements, and anything short of a fractured skull would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cThey mean to kill us,\u201d I said, and didn\u2019t mean it as a question.</p><p>He nodded, eyes on his work, then handed me a spare pistol to load.</p><p>\u201cAye, they do. Good job the weans are all safe away, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiled at me suddenly, bloody-toothed and fierce, and I felt steadier than I had for a long time.</p><p>He\u2019d left one side of the shutter ajar. I moved carefully back behind him and peered out, the loaded pistol primed and in my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo bodies lying in the dooryard,\u201d I reported. \u201cI suppose you didn\u2019t kill any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for want of trying,\u201d he replied. \u201cGod, what I\u2019d give for a rifle!\u201d He rose cautiously to his knees, the barrel of the fowling piece protruding over the sill, and surveyed the state of the attack.</p><p>They had withdrawn for the moment; a small group was visible under the chestnut trees at the far side of the clearing, and they\u2019d taken the horses down toward Bree and Roger\u2019s cabin, safely out of range of flying bullets. Brown and his minions were clearly planning what to do next.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose they would have done, if I\u2019d agreed to go with them?\u201d I could feel my heart again, at least. It was going a mile a minute, but I could breathe, and some feeling was coming back into my extremities.</p><p>\u201cI should never ha\u2019 let ye go,\u201d he replied shortly.</p><p>\u201cAnd quite possibly Richard Brown knows that,\u201d I said. He nodded; he\u2019d been thinking along the same lines. Brown had never intended actually to arrest me; only to provoke an incident in which we could both be killed under circumstances dubious enough as to prevent wholesale retaliation by Jamie\u2019s tenants.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bug got out, did she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. If they didn\u2019t catch her outside the house.\u201d I narrowed my eyes against the brilliant afternoon sun, searching for a short, broad figure in skirts among the group by the chestnut trees, but I saw only men.</p><p>Jamie nodded again, hissing gently through his back teeth as he swiveled the gun barrel slowly through an arc that covered the dooryard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, then\u201d was all he said. \u201cCome that wee bit closer, man,\u201d he murmured, as one man started cautiously across the yard toward the house. \u201cOne shot; that\u2019s all I ask. Here, Sassenach, take this.\u201d He pushed the fowling piece into my hands, and selected his favorite of the pistols, a long-barreled Highland dag with a scroll butt.</p><p>The man\u2014it was Richard Brown, I saw\u2014stopped some distance away, pulled a handkerchief from the waist of his breeches, and waved it slowly overhead. Jamie snorted briefly, but let him come on.</p><p>\u201cFraser!\u201d he called, coming to a stop at a distance of forty yards or so. \u201cFraser! D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighted carefully and fired. The ball struck the ground a few feet in front of Brown, raising a sudden puff of dust from the path, and Brown leapt in the air as though stung by a bee.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he yelled indignantly. \u201cHave ye never heard of a flag o\u2019 truce, you horse-stealin\u2019 Scotcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted ye dead, Brown, ye\u2019d be coolin\u2019 this minute!\u201d Jamie shouted back. \u201cSpeak your piece.\u201d What he did want was plain: he wanted them wary of coming closer to the house; it was impossible to hit anything accurately with a pistol at forty yards, and not that easy with a musket.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want!\u201d Brown called. He took off his hat, wiping sweat and dirt from his face. \u201cI want that goddamn murderous witch of yours.\u201d</p><p>The answer to that was another carefully aimed pistol ball. Brown jumped again, but not so high.</p><p>\u201cLook you,\u201d he tried again, with a conciliating note in his voice. \u201cWe ain\u2019t going to hurt her. We mean to take her to Hillsboro for trial. A fair trial. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Jamie handed me the second pistol to reload, took another, and fired.</p><p>You had to give Brown credit for persistence, I thought. Of course, it had probably dawned on him that Jamie either couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t actually hit him, and he doggedly stood his ground through two more shots, yelling that they meant to take me to Hillsboro, and surely to God if I were innocent, Jamie should want a trial, shouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>It was hot upstairs, and sweat was trickling down between my br**sts. I blotted the fabric of my shift against my chest.</p><p>With no answer save the whine of pistol balls, Brown threw up his hands in exaggerated pantomime of a reasonable man tried beyond endurance, and stamped back to his men beneath the chestnut trees. Nothing had changed, but seeing the narrow back of him made me breathe a little easier.</p><p>Jamie was still crouched in the window, pistol at the ready, but seeing Brown go back, he relaxed and sat back on his heels, sighing.</p><p>\u201cIs there water, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The bedroom ewer was full; I poured him a cup and he drank it thirstily. We had food, water, and a fair amount of shot and powder. I did not, however, foresee a long siege ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose they\u2019ll do?\u201d I didn\u2019t go near the window, but by standing to one side, I could see them clearly, gathered in conference under the trees. The air was still and heavy, and the leaves above them hung like damp rags.</p><p>Jamie came to stand behind me, dabbing at his lip with the tail of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFire the house as soon as it\u2019s dark, I suppose,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cI would. Though I suppose they might try draggin\u2019 Gideon out and threatening to put a ball through his head, and I didna give ye up.\u201d He seemed to think this last was a joke, but I failed to see the humor in it.</p><p>He saw my face and put a hand behind my back, drawing me close for a moment. The air was hot and sticky, and we were both wringing wet, but the nearness of him was a comfort, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cIt all depends on whether Mrs. Bug got away\u2014and who she\u2019s told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll ha\u2019 gone for Arch, first thing.\u201d Jamie patted me gently, and sat down on the bed. \u201cIf he\u2019s to home, he\u2019ll run for Kenny Lindsay; he\u2019s nearest. After that . . .\u201d He shrugged, and closed his eyes, and I saw that his face was pale under the sunburn and the smears of dirt and blood.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and gave me a small, one-sided smile, trying not to stretch his torn lip.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve broken my bloody finger again, is all.\u201d He raised a shoulder in deprecation, but let me lift his right hand to look.</p><p>It was a clean break; that was all that could be said for it. The fourth finger was stiff, the joints fused from being so badly broken long ago, in Wentworth Prison. He couldn\u2019t bend it, and it therefore stuck out awkwardly; this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d snapped it.</p><p>He swallowed as I felt gently for the break, and closed his eyes again, sweating.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s laudanum in the surgery,\u201d I said. \u201cOr whisky.\u201d I knew he would refuse, though, and he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want a clear head,\u201d he said, \u201cwhatever happens.\u201d He opened his eyes and gave me the ghost of a smile. The room was sweltering and airless, despite the open shutter. The sun was more than halfway down the sky, and the first shadows were gathering in the corners of the room.</p><p>I went down to the surgery to fetch a splint and bandage; it wouldn\u2019t help a lot, but it was something to do.</p><p>The surgery was dark, with the shutters closed, but with the windows broken, air came through them, making the room seem oddly exposed and vulnerable. I walked in like a mouse, quiet, stopping abruptly, listening for danger, whiskers twitching. Everything was quiet, though.</p><p>\u201cToo quiet,\u201d I said aloud, and laughed. Moving with purpose and ignoring the noise, I set my feet down firmly and opened cupboard doors with abandon, banging instruments and rattling bottles as I looked out what I needed.</p><p>I stopped into the kitchen before returning upstairs. Partly to reassure myself that the back door was firmly bolted, and partly to see what bits of food Mrs. Bug might have left out. He hadn\u2019t said so, but I knew the pain of the broken finger was making Jamie mildly nauseated\u2014and in him, food generally quelled that sort of disturbance, and made him feel more settled.</p><p>The cauldron was still over the coals, but the fire, untended, had burned down so far that the soup had luckily not boiled away. I poked up the embers and put on three sticks of fat pine, as much by way of thumbing my nose at the besiegers outside as from the long-ingrained habit of never letting a fire die. Let them see the spray of sparks from the chimney, I thought, and imagine us sitting peacefully down to eat by our hearth. Or better yet, imagine us sitting by the blazing fire, melting lead and molding bullets.</p><p>In this defiant frame of mind, I went back upstairs, equipped with medical supplies, an alfresco lunch, and a large bottle of black ale. I couldn\u2019t help but notice, though, the echo of my footsteps on the stair, and the silence that settled quickly back into place behind me, like water when one steps out of it.</p><p>I heard a shot, just as I approached the head of the stair, and took the last steps so fast that I tripped and would have fallen headlong, save for reeling into the wall.</p><p>Jamie appeared from Mr. Wemyss\u2019s room, fowling piece in hand, looking startled.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said crossly, wiping spilled soup off my hand with my apron. \u201cWhat in the name of God are you shooting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I only wanted to make the point that the back of the house is nay safer than the front, if they thought of creeping up that way. Just to ensure that they do wait for dark to fall.\u201d</p><p>I bound up his finger, which seemed to help a little. The food, as I\u2019d hoped, helped considerably more. He ate like a wolf, and rather to my surprise, so did I.</p><p>\u201cThe condemned ate a hearty meal,\u201d I observed, picking up crumbs of bread and cheese. \u201cI\u2019d always thought being in danger of death would make one too nervous to eat, but apparently not.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, took a swallow of ale, and passed me the bottle.</p><p>\u201cA friend once told me, \u2018The body has nay conscience.\u2019 I dinna ken that that\u2019s entirely so\u2014but it is true that the body doesna generally admit the possibility of nonexistence. And if ye exist\u2014well, ye need food, that\u2019s all.\u201d He grinned one-sided at me, and tearing the last of the sweet rolls in half, gave one to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took it, but didn\u2019t eat it immediately. There was no sound outside, save the buzzing of cicadas, though the air had a sultry thickness to it that often presaged rain. It was early in the summer for storms, but one could only hope.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thought of it, too, haven\u2019t you?\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He made no pretense of misunderstanding me.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is the twenty-first o\u2019 the month,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s June, for heaven\u2019s sake! And the wrong year, as well. That newspaper clipping said January, of 1776!\u201d I was absurdly indignant, as though I had somehow been cheated.</p><p>He found that funny.</p><p>\u201cI was a printer myself, Sassenach,\u201d he said, laughing through a mouthful of sweet roll. \u201cYe dinna want to believe everything ye read in the newspapers, aye?\u201d</p><p>When I looked out again, only a few men were visible under the chestnut trees. One of them saw my movement; he waved his arm slowly to and fro above his head\u2014then drew the edge of his hand flat across his throat.</p><p>The sun was just above the treetops; two hours, perhaps, to nightfall. Two hours surely was enough time for Mrs. Bug to have summoned help, though\u2014always assuming she had found anyone who would come. Arch might have gone to Cross Creek\u2014he went once a month; Kenny might be hunting. As for the newer tenants . . . without Roger to keep them in order, their suspicion and dislike of me had become blatant. I had the feeling that they might come if summoned\u2014but only to cheer as I was dragged away.</p> <p>If anyone did come\u2014what then? I didn\u2019t want to be dragged away, much less shot or burnt alive in the ashes of my house\u2014but I didn\u2019t want anyone else injured or killed in an effort to prevent it, either.</p><p>\u201cCome away from the window, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said. He held out a hand to me, and I went, sitting on the bed beside him. I felt all at once exhausted, the adrenaline of emergency having burned away, leaving my muscles feeling like heat-softened rubber.</p><p>\u201cLie down, a Sorcha,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLay your head in my lap.\u201d</p><p>Hot as it was, I did so, finding it a comfort to stretch out, even more to hear his heart, thumping slow and solid above my ear, and feel his hand, light on my head.</p><p>All the weapons were laid out, ranged on the floor beside the window, all loaded, primed, and ready for use. He\u2019d taken his sword down from the armoire; it stood by the door, a last resort.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do now, is there?\u201d I said after a little. \u201cNothing but wait.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers moved idly through the damp curls of my hair; it fell to just above my shoulders now, long enough\u2014barely\u2014to tie back or pin up.</p><p>\u201cWell, we might say an Act of Contrition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did that, always, the night before a battle. Just in case,\u201d he added, smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said after a pause. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and his good hand closed round mine.</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu, je regrette . . .\u201d he began, and I remembered that he said this prayer in French, harking back to those days as a mercenary in France; how often had he said it then, a necessary precaution, cleansing the soul at night in expectation of the possibility of death in the morning?</p><p>I said it, too, in English, and we fell silent. The cicadas had stopped. Far, far away, I thought I heard a sound that might be thunder.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d I said after a long while, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for a great many things and people. Rupert, Murtagh, Dougal . . . Frank. Malva,\u201d I added softly, with a catch in my throat. \u201cBut speaking only for myself . . .\u201d I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything,\u201d I said, watching the shadows creep in from the corners of the room. \u201cNot one bloody thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNor do I, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said, and his fingers stilled, warm against my skin. \u201cNor do I.\u201d</p><p>I WOKE FROM A DOZE with the smell of smoke in my nostrils. Being in a state of grace is all very well, but I imagine even Joan of Arc had qualms when they lit the first brand. I sat bolt upright, heart pounding, to see Jamie at the window.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite dark yet; streaks of orange and gold and rose lit the sky to the west, and touched his face with a fiery light. He looked long-nosed and fierce, the lines of strain cut deep.</p><p>\u201cFolk are coming,\u201d he said. His voice was matter-of-fact, but his good hand was clenched hard round the edge of the shutter, as though he would have liked to slam and bolt it.</p><p>I came to stand by him, combing my fingers hastily through my hair. I could still make out figures under the chestnut trees, though they now were no more than silhouettes. They\u2019d built a bonfire there, at the far edge of the dooryard; that\u2019s what I\u2019d smelled. There were more people coming into the dooryard, though; I was sure I made out the squat figure of Mrs. Bug among them. The sound of voices floated up, but they weren\u2019t talking loudly enough to make out words.</p><p>\u201cWill ye plait my hair, Sassenach? I canna manage, wi\u2019 this.\u201d He gave his broken finger a cursory glance.</p><p>I lit a candle, and he moved a stool to the window, so he could keep watch while I combed his hair and braided it into a tight, thick queue, which I clubbed at the base of his neck and tied with a neat black ribbon.</p><p>I knew his reasons were twofold: not only to appear well-groomed and gentlemanly, but to be ready to fight if he had to. I was less worried about someone seizing me by the hair as I attempted to cleave them in half with a sword, but supposed that if this were my last appearance as the lady of the Ridge, I should not appear unkempt.</p><p>I heard him mutter something under his breath, as I brushed my own hair by candlelight, and turned on my stool to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHiram\u2019s come,\u201d he informed me. \u201cI hear his voice. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d I said dubiously, recollecting Hiram Crombie\u2019s denunciations in church a week before\u2014thinly veiled remarks clearly aimed at us. Roger hadn\u2019t mentioned them; Amy McCallum had told me.</p><p>Jamie turned his head to look at me, and smiled, an expression of extraordinary sweetness coming over his face.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re verra lovely, Sassenach,\u201d he said as though surprised. \u201cBut, aye, it\u2019s good. Whatever he thinks, he wouldna countenance Brown hanging us in the dooryard, nor yet setting the house afire to drive us out.\u201d</p><p>There were more voices outside; the crowd was growing quickly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, took the candle from the table, and threw open the shutter, holding the candle near his face so they could see him.</p><p>It was almost full dark, but several of the crowd were holding torches, which gave me uneasy visions of the mob coming to burn Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2014but did at least allow me to make out the faces below. There were at least thirty men\u2014and not a few women\u2014there, in addition to Brown and his thugs. Hiram Crombie was indeed there, standing beside Richard Brown, and looking like something out of the Old Testament.</p><p>\u201cWe require ye to come down, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he called. \u201cAnd your wife\u2014if ye please.\u201d</p><p>I caught sight of Mrs. Bug, plump and clearly terrified, her face streaked with tears. Then Jamie closed the shutters, gently, and offered me his arm.</p><p>JAMIE HAD WORN BOTH dirk and sword, and had not changed his clothes. He stood on the porch, bloodstained and battered, and dared them to harm us further.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll take my wife over my dead body,\u201d he said, raising his powerful voice enough to be heard across the clearing. I was rather afraid they would. He\u2019d been right\u2014so far\u2014about Hiram not countenancing lynching, but it was clear that public opinion was not in our favor.</p><p>\u201cThou shalt not suffer a witch to live!\u201d someone shouted from the back of the crowd, and a stone whistled through the air, bouncing off the front of the house with a sharp report, like a gunshot. It struck no more than a foot from my head, and I flinched, instantly regretting it.</p><p>Angry murmurs had risen from the moment Jamie had opened the door, and this encouraged them. There were shouts of \u201cMurderers!\u201d and \u201cHeartless! Heartless!\u201d and a number of Gaelic insults that I didn\u2019t try to understand.</p><p>\u201cIf she didn\u2019t do it, breugaire, who did?\u201d someone bellowed. \u201cLiar\u201d it meant.</p><p>The man Jamie had slashed across the face with his dirk was in the forefront of the crowd; the open wound gaped, still oozing, and his face was a mask of dried blood.</p><p>\u201cIf \u2019twasn\u2019t her, \u2019twas him!\u201d he shouted, pointing at Jamie. \u201cFear-si\u00fbrsachd!\u201d Lecher.</p><p>There was an ugly rumble of agreement at that, and I saw Jamie shift his weight and set his hand to his sword, ready to draw if they charged him.</p><p>\u201cBe still!\u201d Hiram\u2019s voice was rather shrill, but penetrating. \u201cBe still, I tell ye!\u201d He pushed Brown aside and came up the steps, very deliberately. At the top, he gave me a look of revulsion, but then turned to the crowd.</p><p>\u201cJustice!\u201d one of Brown\u2019s men yelled, before he could speak. \u201cWe want justice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we do!\u201d Hiram shouted back. \u201cAnd justice we shall have, for the puir raped lass and her bairn unborn!\u201d</p><p>A satisfied growl greeted this, and icy terror ran down my legs, so that I feared my knees would give way.</p><p>\u201cJustice! Justice!\u201d Various people were taking up the chant, but Hiram stopped them, raising both hands as though he were bloody Moses parting the Red Sea.</p><p>\u201cJustice is mine, sayeth the Lord,\u201d Jamie remarked, in a voice just loud enough to be generally heard. Hiram, who had evidently been about to say the same thing, gave him a furious look, but couldn\u2019t very well contradict him.</p><p>\u201cAnd justice you\u2019ll have, Mister Fraser!\u201d Brown said very loudly. He lifted his face, narrow-eyed and malicious with triumph. \u201cI wish to take her for trial. Anyone accused is entitled to that, nay? If she is innocent\u2014if you are innocent\u2014how can you refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly a point,\u201d Hiram observed, very dry. \u201cIf your wife be clean o\u2019 the crime, she\u2019s naught to fear. How say ye, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that should I surrender her to the hands of this man, she willna live to stand a trial,\u201d Jamie replied hotly. \u201cHe holds me to blame for the death of his brother\u2014and some of ye here will ken well enough the truth o\u2019 that affair!\u201d he added, lifting his chin to the crowd.</p><p>Here and there, heads nodded\u2014but they were few. No more than a dozen of his Ardsmuir men had been on the expedition that rescued me; in the wake of gossip following it, many of the new tenants would have known only that I had been abducted, assaulted in some scandalous fashion, and that men had died on my account. The mind of the times being what it was, I was well aware that an obscure sense of blame attached to the victim of any sexual crime\u2014unless the woman died, in which case she became at once a spotless angel.</p><p>\u201cHe will slaughter her out of hand, for the sake of revenge upon me,\u201d Jamie said, raising his voice. He changed abruptly to Gaelic, pointing at Brown. \u201cLook at yon man, and see the truth of the matter writ upon his face! He has no more to do with justice than with honor, and he would not recognize honor by the smell of its arse!\u201d</p><p>That made a few of them laugh, in sheer surprise. Brown, disconcerted, looked round to see what they were laughing at, which made more of them laugh.</p><p>The mood of the assembly was still against us, but they were not yet with Brown\u2014who was, after all, a stranger. Hiram\u2019s narrow brow creased in consideration.</p><p>\u201cWhat would ye offer by way of guarantee for the woman\u2019s safety?\u201d Hiram asked Brown.</p><p>\u201cA dozen hogsheads of beer and three dozen prime hides,\u201d Brown replied promptly. \u201cFour dozen!\u201d His eagerness gleamed in his eyes, and it was all he could do to keep his voice from shaking with the lust to take me. I had a sudden, unpleasant conviction that while my death was his ultimate goal, he didn\u2019t intend that it should be a quick one, unless circumstances demanded it.</p><p>\u201cIt would be worth far more than that to ye, breugaire, to have your revenge upon me with her death,\u201d Jamie said evenly.</p><p>Hiram glanced from one to the other, unsure what to do. I looked out into the crowd, keeping my face impassive. In truth, it was not difficult to do; I felt completely numb.</p><p>There were a few friendly faces, glancing anxiously to Jamie, to see what to do. Kenny and his brothers, Murdo and Evan, stood in a tight group, hands on their dirks and faces set. I didn\u2019t know whether Richard Brown had chosen his timing, or merely been lucky. Ian was gone, hunting with his Cherokee friends. Arch was plainly gone, as well, or he would be visible\u2014Arch and his ax would be uncommonly handy just now, I thought.</p><p>Fergus and Marsali were gone\u2014they, too, would have helped to stem the tide. But the most important absence was Roger\u2019s. He alone had been keeping the Presbyterians more or less under control since the day of Malva\u2019s accusation, or at least keeping a lid on the simmering pot of gossip and animosity. He might have cowed them now\u2014had he been here.</p><p>The conversation had devolved from high drama to a three-way wrangle among Jamie, Brown, and Hiram, the former two adamant in their positions, and poor Hiram, quite unsuited to the task, trying to adjudicate. Insofar as I had feelings to spare, I felt rather sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cTake him!\u201d a voice called suddenly. Allan Christie pushed his way to the front of the crowd, and pointed at Jamie. His voice trembled and broke with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s him debauched my sister, him that kilt her! If ye\u2019ll put someone to the trial, take him!\u201d</p><p>There was a subterranean rumble of agreement at that, and I saw John MacNeill and young Hugh Abernathy draw close together, glancing uneasily from Jamie to the three Lindsay brothers, and back again.</p><p>\u201cNay, it\u2019s her!\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called in contradiction, high and shrill. One of the fishers\u2019 wives; she stabbed a finger at me, face pinched with malevolence. \u201cA man might kill a lass he\u2019d got wi\u2019 child\u2014but no man would do sich wickedness as to steal a babe unborn frae the womb! No but a witch would do that\u2014and she found wi\u2019 the puir wee corpse in her hands!\u201d</p><p>A higher susurrus of condemnation greeted that. The men might possibly give me the benefit of doubt\u2014no woman would.</p><p>\u201cBy the name of the Almighty!\u201d Hiram was losing his grip on the situation, and becoming panicky. The situation was perilously close to degenerating into riot; anyone could feel the currents of hysteria and violence in the air. He cast his eyes up to heaven, looking for inspiration\u2014and found some.</p><p>\u201cTake them both!\u201d he said suddenly. He looked at Brown, then Jamie. \u201cTake them both,\u201d he repeated, testing the notion and finding it good. \u201cYe\u2019ll go along, to see that nay harm comes to your wife,\u201d he said reasonably to Jamie. \u201cAnd if it should be proved that she is innocent . . .\u201d His voice died away on that, as it dawned on him that what he was saying was that if I were proven innocent, Jamie must be guilty, and what a good idea it would be to have him on the spot to be hanged instead.</p><p>\u201cShe is innocent; so am I.\u201d Jamie spoke without heat, doggedly repeating it. He had no real hope of convincing anyone; the only doubt among the crowd was whether he or I was the guilty party\u2014or whether we had plotted together to destroy Malva Christie.</p><p>He turned suddenly to face the crowd, and cried out to them in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cIf you will deliver us into the stranger\u2019s hand, then our blood be upon your heads, and you will answer for our lives upon the Day of Judgment!\u201d</p><p>A sudden hush fell on the crowd at that. Men glanced uncertainly at their neighbors, measured Brown and his cohort with doubtful eyes.</p><p>They were known to the community, but strangers\u2014Sassenachs\u2014in the Scottish sense. So was I, and a witch, to boot. Lecher, rapist, and Papist murderer he might be\u2014but Jamie at least was not a stranger.</p><p>The man I had shot was grinning at me evilly over Brown\u2019s shoulder; evidently, I had no more than grazed him, worse luck. I gave him stare for stare, sweat gathering between my br**sts, moisture slick and hot beneath the veil of my hair.</p><p>A murmur was rising among the crowd; argument and disputation, and I could see the Ardsmuir men begin to make their way slowly toward the porch, pushing through the mob. Kenny Lindsay\u2019s eyes were fixed on Jamie\u2019s face, and I felt Jamie take a deep breath beside me.</p><p>They would fight for him, if he called them. But there were too few of them, and poorly armed, by contrast with Brown\u2019s mob. They would not win\u2014and there were women and children in the crowd. To call his men would provoke only bloody riot, and leave the deaths of innocents upon his conscience. That was not a burden he could bear; not now.</p><p>I saw him come to this conclusion, and his mouth tighten. I had no idea what he might be about to do, but he was forestalled. There was a disturbance at the edge of the crowd; people turned to look, then froze, stricken silent.</p><p>Thomas Christie came through the crowd; in spite of the darkness and wavering torchlight, I knew at once it was him. He walked like an old man, hunched and halting, looking at no one. The crowd gave way before him at once, deeply respectful of his grief.</p><p>The grief was plainly marked on his face. He had let his beard and hair go untrimmed, uncombed, and both were matted. His eyes were pouched and bloodshot, the lines from nose to mouth black furrows through his beard. His eyes were alive, though, alert and intelligent. He walked through the crowd, past his son, as though he were alone, and came up the steps onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cI will go with them to Hillsboro,\u201d he said quietly to Hiram Crombie. \u201cLet them both be taken, if ye will\u2014but I will travel with them, as surety that no further evil may be done. Surely justice is mine, if it be anyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Brown looked much taken aback by this declaration; plainly it wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d had in mind at all. But the crowd was in instant sympathy, murmuring agreement at the proposed solution. Everyone had the greatest compassion and respect for Tom Christie in the wake of his daughter\u2019s murder, and the general feeling seemed to be that this gesture was one of the greatest magnanimity.</p><p>It was, too, as he had in all likelihood just saved our lives\u2014at least for the moment. From the look in his eye, Jamie would strongly have preferred simply to take his chances on killing Richard Brown, but realized that beggars could not be choosers, and acquiesced as gracefully as possible, with a nod of the head.</p><p>Christie\u2019s gaze rested on me for a moment, then turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIf it will suit your convenience, Mr. Fraser, perhaps we will leave in the morning? There is no reason why you and your wife should not rest in your own beds.\u201d</p><p>Jamie bowed to him.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, sir,\u201d he said with great formality. Christie nodded back, then turned and went back down the steps, completely ignoring Richard Brown, who was looking at once irritated and confounded.</p><p>I saw Kenny Lindsay close his eyes, shoulders slumping in relief. Then Jamie put his hand under my elbow, and we turned, going into our house for what might be the final night spent under its roof.</p><p>88</p><p>IN THE WAKE OF SCANDAL</p><p>THE RAIN THAT HAD THREATENED arrived in the night, and the day dawned gray, bleak, and wet. Mrs. Bug was in a similar state, sniffling into her apron and repeating over and over, \u201cOh, if only Arch had been here! But I couldna find anyone save Kenny Lindsay, and by the time he\u2019d run for MacNeill and Abernathy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself for it, a leannan,\u201d Jamie said, and kissed her affectionately on the brow. \u201cIt may be for the best. No one was damaged, the house is still standing\u201d\u2014he cast a wistful eye toward the rafters, every beam shaped by his own hand\u2014\u201cand it may be we\u2019ll have this wretched matter settled soon, God willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod willing,\u201d she echoed fervently, crossing herself. She sniffed and wiped her eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve packed a wee bit of food, that ye shouldna starve on the way, sir.\u201d</p><p>Richard Brown and his men had sheltered under the trees as best they could; no one had offered them hospitality, which was as damning an indication of their unpopularity as could be imagined, Highland standards being what they were in such matters. And as clear an indication of our own unpopularity, that Brown should be permitted to take us into custody.</p><p>In consequence, Brown\u2019s men were soaking wet, ill-fed, sleepless, and short-tempered. I hadn\u2019t slept, either, but I was at least full of breakfast, warm, and\u2014for the moment\u2014dry, which made me feel a little better, though my heart felt hollow and my bones filled with lead as we reached the head of the trail and I looked back across the clearing at the house, with Mrs. Bug standing waving on the porch. I waved back, and then my horse plunged into the darkness of the dripping trees.</p><p>It was a grim journey, and silent for the most part. Jamie and I rode close together, but couldn\u2019t speak of anything important, in hearing of Brown\u2019s men. As for Richard Brown, he was seriously out of countenance.</p><p>It was reasonably clear that he had never intended to take me anywhere for trial, but had merely seized upon the pretext as a means of revenging himself on Jamie for Lionel\u2019s death\u2014and God knew what he would have done, I reflected, had he known what had really happened to his brother, and Mrs. Bug there within arm\u2019s length of him. With Tom Christie along, though, there was nothing he could do; he was obliged to take us to Hillsboro, and he did so with bad grace.</p><p>Tom Christie rode like a man in a dream\u2014a bad dream\u2014his face closed and inward-looking, speaking to no one.</p><p>The man Jamie had slashed was not there; I supposed he had gone home to Brownsville. The gentleman I had shot was still with us, though.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell how bad the wound was, nor yet whether the bullet had gone into him or merely grazed his side. He wasn\u2019t incapacitated, but it was plain from the way he hunched to one side, his face contorting now and then, that he was in pain.</p><p>I hesitated for some time. I had brought a small medical kit with me, as well as saddlebags and bedroll. Under the circumstances, I felt relatively little sense of compassion for the man. On the other hand, instinct was strong\u2014and as I said to Jamie in an undertone when we stopped to make camp for the evening, it wouldn\u2019t help matters if he died of infection.</p><p>I steeled myself to offer to examine and dress the wound, as soon as the opportunity should occur. The man\u2014his name seemed to be Ezra, though under the circumstances, no formal introductions had been made\u2014was in charge of distributing bowls of food at supper, and I waited under the pine where Jamie and I had taken shelter, intending to speak kindly to him when he brought our food.</p><p>He came over, a bowl in each hand, shoulders hunched under a leather coat against the rain. Before I could speak, though, he grinned nastily, spat thickly in one bowl, and handed it to me. The other he dropped at Jamie\u2019s feet, spattering his legs with dried-venison stew.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d he said mildly, and turned on his heel.</p><p>Jamie contracted sharply, like a big snake coiling, but I got hold of his arm before he could strike.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said, and raising my voice just a little, said, \u201cLet him rot.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s head snapped round, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cLet him rot,\u201d I repeated, staring at him. I\u2019d seen the flush of fever in his face when he came near, and smelled the faint sweet scent of pus.</p><p>Ezra looked completely taken back. He hurried back to the sputtering fire, and refused to look in my direction.</p><p>I was still holding the bowl he\u2019d given me, and was startled to have it taken from my hand. Tom Christie threw the contents of the bowl into a bush, and handed me his own, then turned away without speaking.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I started after him, meaning to give it back. We wouldn\u2019t starve, thanks to Mrs. Bug\u2019s \u201cwee bit of food,\u201d which filled one entire saddlebag. Jamie\u2019s hand on my arm stopped me, though.</p><p>\u201cEat it, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s kindly meant.\u201d</p><p>More than kind, I thought. I was aware of hostile eyes upon me, from the group around the fire. My throat was tight, and I had no appetite, but I took my spoon from my pocket and ate.</p><p>Beneath a nearby hemlock tree, Tom Christie had wrapped himself in a blanket and lain down alone, his hat pulled down over his face.</p><p>IT RAINED ALL THE WAY to Salisbury. We found shelter in an inn there, and seldom had a fire seemed so welcome. Jamie had brought what cash we had, and in consequence, we could afford a room to ourselves. Brown posted a guard on the stair, but that was merely for show; after all, where would we go?</p><p>I stood in front of the fire in my shift, my wet cloak and gown spread over a bench to dry.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I observed, \u201cRichard Brown hasn\u2019t thought this out at all.\u201d Not surprising, that, since he hadn\u2019t actually intended to take me or us to trial. \u201cWho, exactly, does he mean to hand us over to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff of the county,\u201d Jamie replied, untying his hair and shaking it out over the hearth, so that droplets of water sizzled and popped in the fire. \u201cOr failing that, a justice of the peace, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what then? He\u2019s got no evidence\u2014no witnesses. How can there be any semblance of a trial?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked at me curiously.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve never been tried for anything, have ye, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have. For treason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? And what happened?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his damp hair, considering.</p><p>\u201cThey made me stand up, and asked my name. I gave it, the judge muttered to his friend for a bit, and then he said, \u2018Condemned. Imprisonment for life. Put him in irons.\u2019 And they took me out to the courtyard and had a blacksmith hammer fetters onto my wrists. The next day we began walking to Ardsmuir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made you walk there? From Inverness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasna in any great hurry, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to stem the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well . . . but surely\u2014wouldn\u2019t m-murder\u201d\u2014I could just about say it without stammering, but not quite, yet\u2014\u201cbe a matter for a jury trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might, and certainly I shall insist upon it\u2014if things go so far. Mr. Brown seems to think they may; he\u2019s telling everyone in the taproom the story, making us out to be monsters of depravity. Which I must say is no great feat,\u201d he added ruefully, \u201cconsidering the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips tight together, to avoid giving a hasty answer. I knew he knew that I had had no choice\u2014he knew that I knew he had had nothing to do with Malva in the first place\u2014but I could not help but feel a sense of blame in both directions, for this desperate muddle in which we found ourselves. Both for what had happened afterward, and for Malva\u2019s death itself\u2014though God knew I would give anything to have her alive again.</p><p>He was right about Brown, I realized. Cold and wet, I\u2019d paid little attention to the noises from the taproom below, but I could hear Brown\u2019s voice, echoing up the chimney, and from the random words that came through, it was apparent that he was doing exactly what Jamie said\u2014blackening our characters, making it out that he and his Committee of Safety had undertaken the ignoble but necessary job of apprehending us and committing us to justice. And, just incidentally, carefully prejudicing any potential jury members by making sure the story spread abroad in all its scandalous detail.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything to be done?\u201d I asked, having listened to as much of this nonsense as I could stomach.</p><p>He nodded, and pulled a clean shirt from his saddlebag.</p><p>\u201cGo down for supper, and look as little like depraved murderers as possible, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, and with a sigh, withdrew the ribbon-trimmed cap I had packed.</p><p>I SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE been surprised. I had lived long enough to have a fairly cynical view of human nature\u2014and lived long enough in this time to know how directly public opinion expressed itself. And yet I was still shocked, when the first stone hit me in the thigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were some distance south of Hillsboro. The weather continued wet, the roads muddy, and the travel difficult. I think Richard Brown would have been pleased to relinquish us to the sheriff of Rowan county\u2014if such a person had been available. The office, he was informed, was currently unfilled, the last occupant having decamped hurriedly overnight and no one yet found willing to replace him.</p><p>A matter of politics, I gathered, the recent sheriff having leaned toward independency, whilst the majority of persons in the county were still strongly Loyalist. I didn\u2019t learn the specifics of the incident that had triggered the recent sheriff\u2019s hasty departure, but the taverns and inns near Hillsboro were buzzing like hornets\u2019 nests in the wake of it.</p><p>The Circuit Court had ceased to meet some months before, Brown was informed, the justices who attended it feeling it too dangerous to appear in the present unsettled state of things. The sole justice of the peace he was able to discover felt similarly, and declined point-blank to take custody of us, informing Brown that it was more than his life was worth, to be involved in anything even faintly controversial at the moment.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s nothing to do with politics!\u201d Brown had shouted at him, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s murder, for God\u2019s sake\u2014black murder!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything and everything\u2019s political these days, sir,\u201d the JP, one Harvey Mickelgrass, informed him sadly, shaking his head. \u201cI should not venture to address even a case of drunk and disorderly, for fear of having my house pulled down around my ears and my wife left widowed. The sheriff attempted to sell his office, but could find no one willing to purchase it. No, sir\u2014you will have to go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Brown would by no means take us to Cross Creek or Campbelton, where Jocasta Cameron\u2019s influence was strong, and where the local justice was her good friend, Farquard Campbell. And so we headed south, toward Wilmington.</p><p>Brown\u2019s men were disedified; they had expected a simple lynching and house-burning, perhaps the odd bit of looting\u2014not this long-drawn-out and tedious plodding from place to place. Their spirits were further lowered when Ezra, who had been clinging to his horse in a dogged daze of fever, fell suddenly into the road and was picked up dead.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask to examine the body\u2014and wouldn\u2019t have been given leave in any case\u2014but I rather thought from the lolling looks of him that he had simply lost consciousness, tumbled off, and broken his neck.</p><p>Not a few of the others cast looks of open fear toward me in the wake of this occurrence, though, and their sense of enthusiasm for the venture diminished visibly.</p> <p>Richard Brown was not deterred; he would, I was sure, have shot us without mercy long since, had it not been for Tom Christie, silent and gray as the morning fog on the roads. He said little, and that little confined to necessities. I should have thought him moving mechanically, in the numb haze of grief\u2014had I not turned one evening as we camped by the road, to see his eyes fixed upon me, with a look of such nak*d anguish in them that I glanced hastily away, only to see Jamie, sitting beside me, watching Tom Christie with a very thoughtful expression.</p><p>For the most part, though, he kept his face impassive\u2014what could be seen of it, under the shade of his leather slouch hat. And Richard Brown, prevented by Christie\u2019s presence from doing us active harm, took every opportunity to spread his version of the tale of Malva\u2019s murder\u2014perhaps as much to harrow Tom Christie in the hearing of it, over and over again, as for its effect on our reputations.</p><p>At any rate, I should not have been surprised when they stoned us, in a small, nameless hamlet south of Hillsboro\u2014but I was. A young boy had seen us on the road, stared as we rode by\u2014then vanished like a fox, scampering down a bank with the news. And ten minutes later, we rode around a bend in the road and into a fusillade of stones and shrieks.</p><p>One struck my mare on the shoulder and she shied violently. I kept my seat narrowly, but was off-balance; another hit me in the thigh, and another high in the chest, knocking the breath from me, and when one more bounced painfully off my head, I lost my grip on the reins, and as the horse, panicked, curvetted and spun, I flew off, landing on the ground with a bone-shaking thud.</p><p>I should have been terrified; in fact, I was furious. The stone that had hit me in the head had glanced off\u2014thanks to the thickness of my hair and the cap I wore\u2014but with the infuriating sting of a slap or a pinch, rather than true impact. I was on my feet by reflex, staggering, but caught sight of a jeering boy on the bank above me, hooting and dancing in triumph. I lunged, caught him by the foot and jerked.</p><p>He yelped, slipped, and fell on top of me. We crashed to the ground together, and rolled in a tangle of skirts and cloak. I was older, heavier, and completely berserk. All the fear, misery, and uncertainty of the last weeks came to an instant boil, and I punched his sneering face, twice, as hard as I could. I felt something crack in my hand, and pain shot up my arm.</p> <p>He bellowed, and wriggled to escape\u2014he was smaller than I was, but strong with panic. I struggled to keep a grip on him, got him by the hair\u2014he struck out at me, flailing, and knocked off my cap, getting one hand in my hair and yanking hard.</p><p>The pain reignited my fury and I jammed a knee into him, anywhere I could, again, and once more, blindly seeking his soft parts. His mouth opened in a soundless \u201cO\u201d and his eyes bulged; his fingers relaxed and let go of my hair, and I reared up over him and slapped him as hard as I possibly could.</p><p>A big rock struck my shoulder with a numbing blow and I was knocked sideways by the impact. I tried to hit him again, but couldn\u2019t lift my arm. Panting and sobbing, he writhed free of my cloak and scrambled away on hands and knees, nose bleeding. I whirled on my knees to look after him, and looked straight into the eyes of a young man, his face intent and blazing with excitement, rock at the ready.</p><p>It hit me in the cheekbone and I swayed, my vision gone blurry. Then something very large hit me from behind, and I found myself flat on my face, pressed into the ground, the weight of a body on top of mine. It was Jamie; I could tell by the breathless \u201cHoly Mother.\u201d His body jerked as the stones hit him; I could hear the horrifying thud of them into his flesh.</p><p>There was a lot of shouting going on. I heard Tom Christie\u2019s hoarse voice, then the firing of a single shot. More yelling, but of a different character. One or two soft thumps, stones striking earth nearby, a last grunt from Jamie as one slammed into him.</p><p>We lay pressed flat for a few moments, and I became aware of the uncomfortably spiky plant squashed under my cheek, the scent of its leaves harsh and bitter in my nose.</p><p>Then Jamie sat up, slowly, drawing in his breath with a catch, and I rose in turn on a shaky arm, nearly falling. My cheek was puffed and my hand and shoulder throbbed, but I had no attention to spare for that.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Jamie had got halfway to his feet, then sat down again, suddenly. He was pale, and a trickle of blood ran down the side of his face from a cut in his scalp, but he nodded, a hand pressed to his side.</p> <p>\u201cAye, fine,\u201d he said, but with a breathlessness that told me he likely had cracked ribs. \u201cYe\u2019re all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I managed to get to my feet, trembling. Brown\u2019s men were scattered, some chasing the horses who had fled in the melee, others cursing, gathering up scattered bits of belongings from the road. Tom Christie was vomiting into the bushes by the road. Richard Brown stood under a tree, watching, his face white. He glanced at me sharply, then away.</p><p>We stopped at no more taverns on the way.</p><p>89</p><p>A MOONLICHT FLICHT</p><p>WHEN YE GO TO HIT SOMEONE, Sassenach, ye want to do it in the soft parts. Faces have too many bones. And then there\u2019s the teeth to be thinkin\u2019 of.\u201d</p><p>Jamie spread her fingers, gently pressing the scraped, swollen knuckles, and air hissed between her own teeth.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for the advice. And you\u2019ve broken your hand how many times, hitting people?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to laugh; the vision of her pounding that wee boy in a fury of berserk rage, hair flying in the wind and a look of blood in her eye, was one he would treasure. He didn\u2019t, though.</p><p>\u201cYour hand\u2019s not broken, a nighean.\u201d He curled her fingers, cupping her loose fist with both of his.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m the doctor here.\u201d</p><p>He stopped trying to hide his smile.</p><p>\u201cIf it were broken,\u201d he said, \u201cye\u2019d be white and puking, not red-faced and crankit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrankit, my arse!\u201d She pulled her hand free, glaring at him as she nursed it against her bosom. She was in fact only slightly flushed, and most attractive, with her hair curling out in a wild mass round her head. One of Brown\u2019s men had picked up her fallen cap after the attack, timidly offering it to her. Enraged, she had snatched it from him and stuffed it violently into a saddlebag.</p><p>\u201cAre ye hungry, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted grudgingly, as aware as he was that folk with broken bones generally had little appetite immediately, though they ate amazingly, once the pain had backed a bit.</p><p>He rummaged in the saddlebag, blessing Mrs. Bug as he came out with a handful of dried apricots and a large wrapped wedge of goat\u2019s cheese. Brown\u2019s men were cooking something over their fire, but he and Claire had not touched any food but their own, not since the first night.</p><p>How much longer might this farce go on? he wondered, breaking off a bit of cheese and handing it to his wife. They had food for perhaps a week, with care. Long enough, maybe, to reach the coast, and the weather held good. And what then?</p><p>It had been plain to him from the first that Brown had no plan, and was attempting to deal with a situation that had been out of his control since the first moment. Brown had ambition, greed, and a respectable sense of revenge, but almost no capacity of forethought, that much was clear.</p><p>Now, here he was, saddled with the two of them, forced to travel on and on, the unwelcome responsibility dragging like a worn-out shoe tied to a dog\u2019s tail. And Brown the hindered dog, snarling and turning in circles, snapping at the thing that hampered him, and biting his own tail in consequence. Half his men had been wounded by the flung stones. Jamie thoughtfully touched a large, painful bruise on the point of his elbow.</p><p>He himself had had no choice; now Brown hadn\u2019t, either. His men were growing restive; they had crops to tend, and hadn\u2019t bargained for what they must see now as a fool\u2019s errand.</p><p>It would be a simple matter to escape by himself. But then what? He could not leave Claire in Brown\u2019s hands, and even were he able to get her safe away, they could not return to the Ridge with matters as they were; to do so would be to find themselves straight back in the pot.</p><p>He sighed, then caught his breath and let it out gingerly. He didn\u2019t think his ribs were cracked, but they hurt.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve a bit of ointment, I expect?\u201d he said, nodding at the bag that held her bits of medicine.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She swallowed her bite of cheese, reaching for the bag. \u201cI\u2019ll put some on that cut on your head.\u201d</p><p>He let her do that, but then insisted upon anointing her hand in turn. She objected, insisting that she was perfectly fine, needed no such thing, they should save the ointment in case of future need\u2014and yet she let him take her hand and smooth the sweet-smelling cream into her knuckles, the small fine bones of her hand hard under his fingers.</p><p>She so hated being helpless in any way\u2014but the armor of righteous fury was wearing off, and while she kept a fierce face for Brown and the rest, he knew she was afraid. Not without reason, either.</p><p>Brown was uneasy, unable to settle. He moved to and fro, talking aimlessly with one man or another, needlessly checking the hobbled horses, pouring a cup of chicory coffee and holding it undrunk until it grew cold, then flinging it into the weeds. And all the time, his restless gaze returned to them.</p><p>Brown was hasty, impetuous, and half-baked. He was not entirely stupid, Jamie thought. And clearly he had realized that his strategy of spreading gossip and scandal concerning his prisoners in order to endanger them had severe defects, so long as he was himself obliged to continue in close proximity to said prisoners.</p><p>Their simple meal finished, Jamie lay down, carefully, and Claire curled herself into him spoonwise, wanting comfort.</p><p>Fighting was an exhausting business, and so was fear; she was asleep in moments. Jamie felt the pull of sleep, but would not yield to it yet. He occupied himself instead in reciting some of the poems Brianna had told him\u2014he quite liked the one about the silversmith in Boston, riding to spread the alarm to Lexington, which he considered a handsome piece.</p><p>The company was beginning to settle for the night. Brown was still a-fidget, sitting staring darkly at the ground, then leaping to his feet to stride up and down. By contrast, Christie had barely stirred, though he made no move to go to bed. He sat on a rock, his supper barely touched.</p><p>A flicker of movement near Christie\u2019s boot; a wee small mouse, making feints toward the neglected plate that sat on the ground, filled with bounty.</p><p>It had occurred to Jamie a couple of days before, in the vague way that one recognizes a fact unconsciously known for some time, that Tom Christie was in love with his wife.</p><p>Poor bugger, he thought. Surely Christie did not believe that Claire had had aught to do with the death of his daughter; if so, he would not be here. Did he think that Jamie, though . . . ?</p><p>He lay in the shelter of the darkness, watching the fire play across Christie\u2019s haggard features, his eyes half-hooded, giving no hint of his thoughts. There were men who could be read like books; Tom Christie wasn\u2019t one of them. But if ever he had seen a man being eaten alive before his eyes . . .</p><p>Was it the fate of his daughter, alone\u2014or also the desperate need of a woman? He\u2019d seen that need before, that gnawing at the soul, and knew it personally. Or did Christie think that Claire had killed wee Malva, or been in some way involved? There would be a quandary for an honorable man.</p><p>The need of a woman . . . the thought brought him back to the moment, and the awareness that the sounds he had been listening for in the wood behind him were now there. He had known for the past two days that they were followed, but last night they had camped in an open meadow, with no cover at all.</p><p>Moving slowly, but with no attempt at furtiveness, he rose, covered Claire with his cloak, and stepped into the wood, like one called by nature.</p><p>The moon was pale and hunchbacked and there was little light beneath the trees. He closed his eyes to damp the fire shadow and opened them again to the dark world, that place of shapes that lacked dimension and air that held spirits.</p><p>It was no spirit that stepped out from behind the blur of a pine tree, though.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Michael defend us,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe blessed host of angels and archangels be with ye, Uncle,\u201d said Ian, in the same soft tone. \u201cThough I am thinking that a few thrones and dominations wouldna come amiss, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldna argue, if Divine Intervention chose to take a hand,\u201d Jamie said, heartened most amazingly by his nephew\u2019s presence. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve no notion how else we shall escape this foolish coil.\u201d</p><p>Ian grunted at that; Jamie saw his nephew\u2019s head turn, checking the faint glow of the camp. Without discussion, they moved further into the wood.</p><p>\u201cI canna be gone for long, without they come after me,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, then\u2014is all well wi\u2019 the Ridge?\u201d</p><p>Ian lifted a shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s talk,\u201d he said, the tone of his voice indicating that \u201ctalk\u201d covered everything from auld wives\u2019 gossip to the sort of insult that must be settled by violence. \u201cNo one killed yet, though. What shall I do, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard Brown. He\u2019s thinking, and God only kens what that will lead to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks too much; such men are dangerous,\u201d Ian said, and laughed. Jamie, who had never known his nephew to read a book willingly, gave him a look of disbelief, but dismissed questions in favor of the pressing concerns of the moment.</p><p>\u201cAye, he is,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cHe\u2019s been spreading the story in pothouses and inns as we go\u2014at a guess, in hopes of rousing public indignation to the point that some poor fool of a constable can be pushed into taking us off his hands, or better yet, that a mob might be stirred up to seize us and hang us out of hand, thus resolving his difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Well, if that\u2019s what he had in mind, Uncle, it\u2019s working. Ye wouldna countenance some of the things I\u2019ve heard, following in your tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jamie stretched gently, easing his painful ribs. It was only the mercy of God that it hadn\u2019t been worse\u2014that, and Claire\u2019s rage, which had interrupted the attack, as everyone stopped to watch the engrossing spectacle of her hatcheling her assailant like a bundle of flax.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s come home to him, though, that if ye mean to pin a target on someone, it\u2019s wise to step away smartly thereafter. He\u2019s thinking, as I say. Should he go off, then, or send someone . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow, aye, and see what\u2019s to do.\u201d</p><p>He sensed rather than saw Ian\u2019s nod; they stood in black shadow, the faint haze of moonlight like fog in the space between the trees. The lad moved, as though to go, then hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re sure, Uncle, as it wouldna be better to wait a bit, then creep away? There\u2019s nay bracken, but there\u2019s decent cover in the hills nearby; we could be safe hidden by dawn.\u201d</p><p>It was a great temptation. He felt the pull of the dark wild forest, above all, the lure of freedom. If he could but walk away into the greenwood, and stay there . . . But he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldna do, Ian,\u201d he said, though he let regret show in his voice. \u201cWe should be fugitives, then\u2014and doubtless wi\u2019 a price on our heads. With the countryside already roused against us\u2014broadsides, posted bills? The public would do Brown\u2019s work for him, promptly. And then, to run would seem an admission of guilt, forbye.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed, but nodded agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. He stepped forward and embraced Jamie, squeezing hard for an instant, and then was gone.</p><p>Jamie let out a long, tentative breath against the pain of his injured ribs.</p><p>\u201cGod go with ye, Ian,\u201d he said to the dark, and turned back.</p><p>When he lay down again beside his wife, the camp was silent. The men lay like logs, wrapped in their blankets. Two figures, though, remained by the embers of the dying fire: Richard Brown and Thomas Christie, each alone on a rock with his thoughts.</p><p>Ought he to wake Claire, tell her? He considered for a moment, his cheek against the warm softness of her hair, and reluctantly decided no. It might hearten her a little to know of Ian\u2019s presence\u2014but he dare not risk rousing Brown\u2019s suspicion; and if Brown were to perceive by any change in Claire\u2019s mood or face that something had happened . . . no, best not. At least not yet.</p><p>He glanced along the ground at Christie\u2019s feet, and saw the faint pale scurry of movement in the dark; the mouse had brought friends to share her feast.</p><p>90</p><p>FORTY-SIX BEANS</p><p>TO THE GOOD</p><p>AT DAWN, RICHARD BROWN WAS GONE. The rest of the men seemed grim, but resigned, and under the command of a squatty, morose sort of fellow named Oakes, we resumed our push south.</p><p>Something had changed in the night; Jamie had lost a little of the tension that had infused him since our departure from the Ridge. Stiff, sore, and disheartened as I was, I found this change some comfort, though wondering what had caused it. Was it the same thing that had caused Richard Brown to leave on his mysterious errand?</p><p>Jamie said nothing, though, beyond inquiring after my hand\u2014which was tender, and so stiff that I couldn\u2019t immediately flex my fingers. He continued to keep a watchful eye on our companions, but the lessening of tension had affected them, too; I began to lose my fear that they might suddenly lose patience and string us up, Tom Christie\u2019s dour presence notwithstanding.</p><p>As though in accord with this more relaxed atmosphere, the weather suddenly cleared, which heartened everyone further. It would have been stretching things to say that there was any sense of rapprochement, but without Richard Brown\u2019s constant malevolence, the other men at least became occasionally civil. And as it always did, the tedium and hardships of travel wore everyone down, so that we rolled down the rutted roads like a pack of marbles, occasionally caroming off one another, dusty, silent, and united in exhaustion, if nothing else, by the end of each day.</p><p>This neutral state of affairs changed abruptly in Brunswick. For a day or two before, Oakes had been plainly anticipating something, and when we reached the first houses, I could see him beginning to draw great breaths of relief.</p><p>It was therefore no surprise when we stopped to refresh ourselves at a pothouse on the edge of the tiny, half-abandoned settlement, to find Richard Brown awaiting us. It was a surprise when, without more than a murmured word from Brown, Oakes and two others suddenly seized Jamie, knocking the cup of water from his hand and slamming him against the wall of the building.</p><p>I dropped my own cup and flung myself toward them, but Richard Brown grabbed my arm in a viselike grip and dragged me toward the horses.</p><p>\u201cLet go! What are you doing? Let go, I say!\u201d I kicked him, and had a good go at scratching out his eyes, but he got hold of both my wrists, and shouted for one of the other men to help. Between the two of them, they got me\u2014still screaming at the top of my lungs\u2014on a horse in front of another of Brown\u2019s men. There was a deal of shouting from Jamie\u2019s direction, and general hubbub, as a few people came out of the pothouse, staring. None of them seemed disposed to interfere with a large group of armed men, though.</p><p>Tom Christie was shouting protests; I glimpsed him hammering on the back of one man, but to no avail. The man behind me wrapped an arm round my middle and jerked it tight, knocking out what breath I had left.</p><p>Then we were thundering down the road, Brunswick\u2014and Jamie\u2014disappearing in the dust.</p><p>My furious protests, demands, and questions brought no response, of course, beyond an order to be quiet, this accompanied by another warning squeeze of the restraining arm around me.</p><p>Shaking with rage and terror, I subsided, and at that point, saw that Tom Christie was still with us, looking shaken and disturbed.</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d I shouted. \u201cTom, go back! Don\u2019t let them kill him! Please!\u201d</p><p>He looked in my direction, startled, rose in his stirrups, and looked back toward Brunswick, then turned toward Richard Brown, shouting something.</p><p>Brown shook his head, reined his mount in so that Christie could come up alongside, and leaning over, yelled something at him that must have passed for explanation. Christie clearly didn\u2019t like the situation, but after a few impassioned exchanges, he subsided, scowling, and dropped back. He pulled his horse\u2019s head aside and circled back to come within speaking distance of me.</p><p>\u201cThey will not kill nor harm him,\u201d he said, raising his voice to be heard over the rumble of hooves and rattle of harness. \u201cBrown\u2019s word of honor upon it, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>He looked disconcerted at that, glanced again at Brown, who had spurred up to ride ahead, then back at Brunswick. Indecision played across his features, but then his lips firmed and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d he said. But he would not meet my eyes, and in spite of my continued entreaties to him to go back, to stop them, he slackened his pace, falling back so that I couldn\u2019t see him anymore.</p><p>My throat was raw from screaming, and my stomach hurt, bruised and clenched in a knot of fear. Our speed had slowed, now that we had left Brunswick behind, and I concentrated on breathing; I wouldn\u2019t speak until I was sure I could do so without my voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d I asked finally. I sat stiff in the saddle, enduring an unwanted intimacy with the man behind me.</p><p>\u201cNew Bern,\u201d he said, with a note of grim satisfaction. \u201cAnd then, thank God, we\u2019ll be shut of you at last.\u201d</p><p>THE JOURNEY TO NEW BERN passed in a blur of fear, agitation, and physical discomfort. While I did wonder what was about to happen to me, all such speculations were drowned by my anxiety about Jamie.</p><p>Tom Christie was plainly my only hope of finding out anything, but he avoided me, keeping his distance\u2014and I found that as alarming as anything else. He was clearly troubled, even more so than he had been since Malva\u2019s death, but he no longer bore a look of dull suffering; he was actively agitated. I was terribly afraid that he knew or suspected Jamie was dead, but would not admit it\u2014either to me, or to himself.</p><p>All of the men clearly shared my captor\u2019s urge to be rid of me as soon as possible; we stopped only briefly, when absolutely necessary for the horses to rest. I was offered food, but could not eat. By the time we reached New Bern, I was completely drained from the sheer physical exertion of the ride, but much more so from the constant strain of apprehension.</p><p>Most of the men remained at a tavern on the outskirts of the town; Brown and one of the other men took me through the streets, accompanied by a silent Tom Christie, arriving at last at a large house of whitewashed brick. The home, as Brown informed me with a sense of lively pleasure, of Sheriff Tolliver\u2014also, the town gaol.</p><p>The sheriff, a darkly handsome sort, viewed me with a sort of interested speculation, mingled with a growing disgust as he heard the crime of which I was accused. I made no attempt at rebuttal or defense; the room was going in and out of focus, and all my attention was required to keep my knees from giving way.</p><p>I barely heard most of the exchange between Brown and the sheriff. At the last, though, just before I was led away into the house, I found Tom Christie suddenly beside me.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, very low. \u201cBelieve me, he is safe. I would not have his death on my conscience\u2014nor yours.\u201d He was looking at me directly, for the first time in . . . days? weeks? . . . and I found the intensity of his gray eyes both disconcerting and oddly comforting.</p><p>\u201cTrust in God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHe will deliver the righteous out of all his dangers.\u201d And with a sudden hard and unexpected squeeze of my hand, he was gone.</p><p>AS EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY gaols went, it could have been worse. The women\u2019s quarters consisted of a small room at the back of the sheriff\u2019s house, which had likely been a storeroom of sorts originally. The walls were roughly plastered, though some escape-minded former occupant had chipped away a large chunk of the plaster, before discovering that beneath it lay a layer of lath, and beneath that an impenetrable wall of baked-clay brick, which confronted me at once with its bland impenetrability when the door was opened.</p><p>There was no window, but an oil dip burned on a ledge by the door, casting a faint circle of light that illuminated the daunting bare patch of brick, but left the corners of the room in deep shadow. I couldn\u2019t see the night-soil bucket, but knew there was one; the thick, acrid tang of it stung my nose, and I automatically began breathing through my mouth as the sheriff pushed me into the room.</p><p>The door closed firmly behind me, and a key grated in the lock.</p><p>There was a single, narrow bedstead in the shadows, occupied by a large lump under a threadbare blanket. The lump took its time, but eventually stirred and sat up, resolving itself into a small, plump woman, capless and frowsy with sleep, who sat blinking at me like a dormouse.</p><p>\u201cErmp,\u201d she said, and rubbed her eyes with her fists, like a small child.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry to disturb you,\u201d I said politely. My heart had slowed a bit by now, though I was still shaking and short of breath. I pressed my hands flat against the door to stop them trembling.</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d she said, and yawned suddenly, like a hippopotamus, showing me a set of worn but serviceable molars. Blinking and smacking her lips absently, she reached down beside her, pulled out a battered pair of spectacles, and set them firmly on her nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were blue, and hugely magnified by the lenses, enormous with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cClaire Fraser,\u201d I said, watching her narrowly, in case she too might already have heard all about my supposed crime. The bruise on my breast left by the stone that had struck me was still visible, beginning to yellow above the edge of my gown.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She squinted, as though trying to place me, but evidently failed, for she shrugged away the effort. \u201cGot any money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA bit.\u201d Jamie had forced me to take almost all the money\u2014not a great deal, but there was a small weight of coin at the bottom of each of the pockets tied around my waist, and a couple of proclamation notes tucked inside my stays.</p><p>The woman was a good deal shorter than I, and pillowy in aspect, with large, drooping br**sts and several comfortable rolls corrugating her uncorseted middle; she was in her shift, with her gown and stays hung from a nail in the wall. She seemed harmless\u2014and I began to breathe a little more easily, beginning to grasp the fact that at least I was safe for the moment, no longer in danger of sudden, random violence.</p><p>The other prisoner made no offensive moves toward me, but hopped down off the bed, bare feet thumping softly in what I realized now was a matted layer of moldy straw.</p><p>\u201cWell, call the old bizzom and send for some Holland, then, why don\u2019t you?\u201d she suggested cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cThe . . who?\u201d</p> <p>Instead of answering, she trundled to the door and banged on it, shouting, \u201cMrs. Tolliver! Mrs. Tolliver!\u201d</p><p>The door opened almost immediately, revealing a tall, thin woman, looking like an annoyed stork.</p><p>\u201cReally, Mrs. Ferguson,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are the most dreadful nuisance. I was just coming to pay my respects to Mrs. Fraser, in any case.\u201d She turned her back on Mrs. Ferguson with magisterial dignity and inclined her head a bare inch toward me.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser. I am Mrs. Tolliver.\u201d</p><p>I had a split second in which to decide how to react, and chose the prudent\u2014if galling\u2014course of genteel submission, bowing to her as though she were the Governor\u2019s lady.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tolliver,\u201d I murmured, careful not to meet her eyes. \u201cHow kind of you.\u201d</p> <p>She twitched, sharp-eyed, like a bird spotting the stealthy progress of a worm through the grass\u2014but I had firm control of my features by now, and she relaxed, detecting no sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome,\u201d she said with chilly courtesy. \u201cI am to see to your welfare, and acquaint you with our custom. You will receive one meal each day, unless you wish to send to the ordinary for more\u2014at your own expense. I will bring you a basin for washing once each day. You\u2019ll carry your own slops. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stuff your custom, Maisie,\u201d said Mrs. Ferguson, butting into Mrs. Tolliver\u2019s set speech with the comfortable assumption of long acquaintance. \u201cShe\u2019s got some money. Fetch us a bottle of geneva, there\u2019s a good girl, and then if you must, you can tell her what\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Tolliver\u2019s narrow face tightened in disapproval, but her eyes twitched toward me, bright in the dim light of the rush dip. I ventured a hesitant gesture toward my pocket, and her lower lip sucked in. She glanced over her shoulder, then took a quick step toward me.</p><p>\u201cA shilling, then,\u201d she whispered, hand held open between us. I dropped the coin into her palm, and it disappeared at once beneath her apron.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed supper,\u201d she announced in her normal disapproving tones, stepping backward. \u201cHowever, as you\u2019ve just come, I shall make an allowance and bring you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d I said again.</p><p>The door closed firmly behind her, shutting out light and air, and the key turned in the lock.</p> <p>The sound of it set off a tiny spark of panic, and I stamped on it hard. I felt like a dried skin, stuffed to the eyeballs with the tinder of fear, uncertainty, and loss. It would take no more than a spark to ignite that and burn me to ashes\u2014and neither I nor Jamie could afford that.</p><p>\u201cShe drinks?\u201d I asked, turning back to my new roommate with an assumption of coolness.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone who doesn\u2019t, given the chance?\u201d Mrs. Ferguson asked reasonably. She scratched her ribs. \u201cFraser, she said. You aren\u2019t the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said, rather rudely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up, but she nodded equably.</p><p>\u201cJust as you like,\u201d she said. \u201cAny good at cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoo or whist?\u201d I asked warily.</p><p>\u201cKnow a game called brag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie and Brianna played it now and then, but I had never acquainted myself with the rules.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right; I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Reaching under the mattress, she pulled out a rather limp deck of pasteboards and fanned them expertly, waving them gently under her nose as she smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re in here for cheating at cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheat? Me? Not a bit of it,\u201d she said, evidently unoffended. \u201cForgery.\u201d</p><p>Rather to my own surprise, I laughed. I was still feeling shaky, but Mrs. Ferguson was definitely proving a welcome distraction.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She scratched at her head, realized that she wasn\u2019t wearing a cap, and turned to pull one out of the rumpled bedding.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014a month, just about.\u201d Putting on the crumpled cap, she nodded at the doorpost beside me. Turning to look, I saw that it was crosshatched with dozens of small nicks, some old and dark with dirt, some freshly scratched, showing raw yellow wood. The sight of the marks made my stomach plunge again, but I took a deep breath and turned my back on them.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a trial yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, light glinting off her spectacles.</p><p>\u201cNo, praise God. I hear from Maisie that the court\u2019s shut down; all the justices gone into hiding. Hasn\u2019t been anybody tried in the last two months.\u201d</p><p>This was not good news. Evidently the thought showed on my face, for she leaned forward and patted my arm sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in a hurry, dearie. Not in your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t. If they\u2019ve not tried you, they can\u2019t hang you. And while I have met those as say the waiting\u2019s like to kill them, I\u2019ve not seen anybody die of it. And I have seen them die at the end of a rope. Nasty business, that is.\u201d</p><p>She spoke almost negligently, but her own hand rose, as though by itself, and touched the soft white flesh of her neck. She swallowed, the tiny bump of her Adam\u2019s apple bobbing.</p><p>I swallowed, too, an unpleasantly constricted feeling in my own throat.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m innocent,\u201d I said, wondering even as I said it how I could sound so uncertain.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Course you are,\u201d she said stoutly, giving my arm a squeeze. \u201cYou stick to it, dearie\u2014don\u2019t you let \u2019em bully-whack you into admitting the least little thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I assured her dryly.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days, a mob\u2019s like to come here,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cString up the sheriff, if he don\u2019t look sharp. He\u2019s not popular, Tolliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why not\u2014a charming fellow like that.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about the prospect of a mob storming the house. Stringing up Sheriff Tolliver was all very well, so far as that went\u2014but with the memory of the hostile crowds in Salisbury and Hillsboro fresh in mind, I wasn\u2019t sure at all that they\u2019d stop with the sheriff. Dying at the hands of a lynch mob wasn\u2019t at all preferable to the slower sort of judicial murder I likely faced. Though I supposed there was always a possibility of escaping in the riot.</p><p>And go where, if you did? I wondered.</p><p>With no good answer to that question, I shoved it to the back of my mind and turned my attention back to Mrs. Ferguson, who was still holding out the cards invitingly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Mrs. Ferguson assured me. \u201cPerish the thought. But we must have some sort of stake to make it interesting. We\u2019ll play for beans, shall we?\u201d She set down the cards, and digging under the pillow, withdrew a small pouch, from which she poured a handful of small white beans.</p><p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd when we\u2019re finished, we\u2019ll plant them, shall we, and hope for a giant beanstalk to spring up and burst through the roof, so we can escape up it.\u201d</p><p>She burst into giggles at that, which somehow made me feel very slightly better.</p><p>\u201cFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ear, dearie!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll deal first, shall I?\u201d</p><p>BRAG APPEARED TO BE a form of poker. And while I had lived with a cardsharp long enough to know one when I saw one, Mrs. Ferguson appeared to be playing honestly\u2014for the moment. I was forty-six beans to the good, by the time Mrs. Tolliver returned.</p><p>The door opened without ceremony, and she came in, holding a three-legged stool and a chunk of bread. This latter appeared to be both my supper and her ostensible excuse for visiting the cell, for she shoved it at me with a loud, \u201cThis will have to keep you \u2019til tomorrow, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said mildly. It was fresh, and appeared to have been hastily dragged through bacon drippings, in lieu of butter. I bit into it without hesitation, having sufficiently recovered from shock now as to feel very hungry indeed.</p><p>Mrs. Tolliver, glancing over her shoulder to be sure the coast was clear, shut the door quietly, put down the stool, and drew a squat bottle from her pocket, blue glass and filled with some clear liquid.</p><p>She pulled the cork from it, tilted it, and drank deeply, her long, lean throat moving convulsively.</p><p>Mrs. Ferguson said nothing, but watched the process with a sort of analytic attention, light glinting from her spectacles, as though comparing Mrs. Tolliver\u2019s behavior with that of previous occasions.</p><p>Mrs. Tolliver lowered the bottle and stood for a moment grasping it, then handed it abruptly to me and sat down suddenly on the stool, breathing heavily.</p><p>I wiped the neck of the bottle as inconspicuously as possible on my sleeve, then took a token sip. It was gin, all right\u2014heavily flavored with juniper berries to hide the poor quality, but powerfully alcoholic.</p><p>Mrs. Ferguson took a healthy guzzle in her turn, and so we continued, passing the bottle from hand to hand, exchanging small cordialities with it. Her first thirst slaked, Mrs. Tolliver became almost affable, her frosty manner thawing substantially. Even so, I waited until the bottle was nearly empty before asking the question foremost in my mind.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tolliver, the men who brought me\u2014did you happen to hear them say anything about my husband?\u201d</p><p>She put a fist to her mouth to stifle a belch.</p><p>\u201cSay anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout where he is,\u201d I amended.</p><p>She blinked a little, looking blank.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I suppose they may have told Tolly.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Ferguson handed down the bottle to her\u2014we were sitting side by side on the bed, that being the only place to sit in the small room\u2014nearly falling off the bed in the process.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019pose you could ask him, could you, Maisie?\u201d she said.</p><p>An uneasy look came into Mrs. Tolliver\u2019s eyes, glazed as they were.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk to me about such things. Not my business.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged a glance with Mrs. Ferguson, and she shook her head slightly; best not to press the matter now.</p><p>Worried as I was, I found it difficult to abandon the subject, but plainly there was nothing to be done. I gathered what shreds of patience I had, estimating how many bottles of gin I could afford before my money ran out\u2014and what I might accomplish with them.</p><p>I LAY STILL THAT NIGHT, breathing the damp, thick air with its scents of mold and urine. I could smell Sadie Ferguson next to me, too: a faint miasma of stale sweat, overlaid with a strong perfume of gin. I tried to close my eyes, but every time I did, small waves of claustrophobia washed over me; I could feel the sweating plaster walls draw closer, and gripped my fists in the cloth of the mattress ticking, to keep from throwing myself at the locked door. I had a nasty vision of myself, pounding and shrieking, my nails torn and bloody from clawing at the unyielding wood, my cries unheard in the darkness\u2014and no one ever coming.</p><p>I thought it a distinct possibility. I had heard more from Mrs. Ferguson regarding Sheriff Tolliver\u2019s unpopularity. If he were to be attacked and dragged from his home by a mob\u2014or to lose his nerve and run\u2014the chances of him or his wife remembering the prisoners were remote.</p><p>A mob might find us\u2014and kill us, in the madness of the moment. Or not find us, and fire the house. The storeroom was clay brick, but the adjoining kitchen was timber; damp or not, the place would burn like a torch, leaving nothing but that bloody brick wall standing.</p><p>I took an especially deep breath, smell notwithstanding, exhaled, and shut my eyes with decision.</p><p>Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. That had been one of Frank\u2019s favorite expressions, and by and large, a good sentiment.</p><p>Depends a bit on the day, though, doesn\u2019t it? I thought in his direction.</p><p>Does it? You tell me. The thought was there, vivid enough that I might have heard it\u2014or only imagined it. If I had imagined it, though, I had imagined also a tone of dry amusement that was particularly Frank\u2019s.</p><p>Fine, I thought. Reduced to having philosophical arguments with a ghost. It\u2019s been a worse day than I thought.</p><p>Imagination or not, the thought had succeeded in wrenching my attention off the single-minded track of worry. I felt a sense of invitation\u2014or temptation, perhaps. The urge to talk to him. The need to escape into conversation, even if one-sided . . . and imaginary.</p><p>No. I won\u2019t use you that way, I thought, a little sadly. Not right that I should only think of you when I need distraction, and not for your own sake.</p><p>And do you never think of me, for my own sake? The question floated in the darkness of my eyelids. I could see his face, quite clearly, the lines of it curved in humor, one dark eyebrow raised. I was dimly surprised; it had been so long since I thought of him in any focused way that I should have long since forgotten exactly what he looked like. But I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>And I suppose that\u2019s the answer to your question, then, I thought silently to him. Good night, Frank.</p><p>I turned onto my side, facing the door. I felt a little calmer now. I could just make out the outlines of the door, and being able to see it lessened that feeling of being buried alive.</p><p>I closed my eyes again, and tried to concentrate on the processes of my own body. That often helped, bringing me a sense of quiet, listening to the purling of blood through my vessels and the subterranean gurglings of organs all carrying peacefully on without the slightest need of my conscious direction. Rather like sitting in the garden, listening to the bees hum in their hives\u2014</p><p>I stopped that thought in its tracks, feeling my heart jolt in memory, electric as a bee sting.</p><p>I thought quite fiercely about my heart, the physical organ, its thick soft chambers and delicate valves\u2014but what I felt was a soreness there. There were hollow places in my heart.</p><p>Jamie. A gaping, echoing hollow, cold and deep as the crevasse of a glacier. Bree. Jemmy. Roger. And Malva, like a tiny, deep-drilled sore, an ulcer that wouldn\u2019t heal.</p><p>I had managed so far to ignore the rustlings and heavy breathings of my companion. I couldn\u2019t ignore the hand that brushed my neck, then slipped down my chest and rested lightly, cupped around my breast.</p><p>I stopped breathing. Then, very slowly, exhaled. Entirely without my intent, my breast settled into her cupped palm. I felt a touch on my back; a thumb, gently tracing the groove of my spine through my shift.</p><p>I understood the need of human comfort, the sheer hunger for touch. I had taken it, often, and given it, part of the fragile web of humanity, constantly torn, constantly made new. But there was that in Sadie Ferguson\u2019s touch that spoke of more than simple warmth, or the need of company in the dark.</p><p>I took hold of her hand, and lifting it from my breast, squeezed the fingers gently shut, and put it firmly away from me, folded back against her own bosom.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>She hesitated, moved her h*ps so that her body curved behind me, thighs warm and round against mine, offering encompassment and refuge.</p><p>\u201cNo one would know,\u201d she whispered, still hopeful. \u201cI could make you forget\u2014for a bit.\u201d Her hand stroked my hip, gentle, insinuating.</p><p>If she could, I thought wryly, I might be tempted. But that pathway was not one I could take.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said more firmly, and shifted, rolling onto my back, as far away as I could get\u2014which was roughly an inch and a half. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014but no.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, then sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Perhaps a bit later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The noises from the kitchen had ceased, and the house settled into silence. It wasn\u2019t the silence of the mountains, though, that cradle of boughs and whispering winds and the vast deep of the starry sky. It was the silence of a town, disturbed by smoke and the fogged dim glow of hearth and candle; filled with slumbering thoughts unleashed from waking reason, roaming and uneasy in the dark.</p><p>\u201cCould I hold you?\u201d she asked wistfully, and her fingers brushed my cheek. \u201cOnly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again. But I reached for her hand, and held it. And so we fell asleep, hands chastely\u2014and firmly\u2014linked between us.</p><p>WE WERE ROUSED BY what I thought at first was the wind, moaning in the chimney whose back bulged into our cubbyhole. The moaning grew louder, though, broke into a full-throated scream, then stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYe gods and little fishes!\u201d Sadie Ferguson sat up, eyes wide and blinking, groping for her spectacles. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman in labor,\u201d I said, having heard that particular pattern of sounds fairly often. The moaning was starting up again. \u201cAnd very near her time.\u201d I slid off the bed and shook my shoes, dislodging a small roach and a couple of silverfish who had taken shelter in the toes.</p><p>We sat for nearly an hour, listening to the alternate moaning and screaming.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it stop?\u201d Sadie said, swallowing nervously. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the child be birthed by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said absently. \u201cSome babies take longer than others.\u201d I had my ear pressed to the door, trying to make out what was going on on the other side. The woman, whoever she was, was in the kitchen, and no more than ten feet away from me. I heard Maisie Tolliver\u2019s voice now and then, muffled and sounding doubtful. But for the most part, only the rhythmic panting, moaning, and screaming.</p><p>Another hour of it, and my nerves were becoming frayed. Sadie was on the bed, the pillow pressed down hard over her head, in hopes of blocking the noise.</p><p>Enough of this, I thought, and when next I heard Mrs. Tolliver\u2019s voice, I banged on the door with the heel of my shoe, shouting, \u201cMrs. Tolliver!\u201d as loudly as I could, to be heard over the noise.</p><p>She did hear me, and after a moment, the key grated in the lock and a wave of light and air fell into the cell. I was momentarily blinded by the daylight, but blinked and made out the shape of a woman on her hands and knees by the hearth, facing me. She was black, bathed in sweat, and, raising her head, howled like a wolf. Mrs. Tolliver started as though someone had run a pin into her from behind.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, pushing past her. She made no move to stop me, and I caught a strong blast of juniper-scented gin fumes as I brushed by her.</p><p>The black woman sank down on her elbows, panting, her uncovered rear in the air. Her belly hung like a ripe guava, pale in the sweat-soaked shift that clung to it.</p><p>I asked sharp questions in the brief interval before the next howl, and ascertained that this was her fourth child and that she had been laboring since her water had broken the night before. Mrs. Tolliver contributed the information that she was also a prisoner, and a slave. I might have guessed that, from the purplish weals on her back and buttocks.</p><p>Mrs. Tolliver was of little other use, swaying glassy-eyed over me, but had managed to provide a small pile of rags and a basin of water, which I used to mop the woman\u2019s sweating face. Sadie Ferguson poked her bespectacled nose cautiously out of the cell, but drew back hastily when the next howl broke forth.</p><p>It was a breech birth, which accounted for the difficulty, and the next quarter-hour was hair-raising for all concerned. At length, though, I eased a small baby into the world, feet first, slimy, motionless, and the most unearthly shade of pale blue.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Tolliver, sounding disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said the mother, in a hoarse, deep voice, and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamned if he is,\u201d I said, and turned the child hastily facedown, tapping its back. No movement, and I brought the sealed, waxy face to my own, covered nose and mouth with my own mouth, and sucked hard, then turned my head to spit away the mucus and fluid. Face slimy and the taste of silver in my mouth, I blew gently into him, paused, holding him, limp and slippery as a fresh fish, blew\u2014and saw his eyes open, a deeper blue than his skin, vaguely interested.</p><p>He took a startled, gasping breath and I laughed, a sudden wellspring of joy bubbling up from my depths. The nightmare memory of another child, a flicker of life blinking out between my hand, faded away. This child was well and truly lit, burning like a candle with a soft, clear flame.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Tolliver, again. She leaned forward to look, and an enormous smile spread across her face. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d</p><p>The baby started crying. I cut the cord, wrapped him in some of the rags, and with some reservation, handed him to Mrs. Tolliver, hoping she wouldn\u2019t drop him in the fire. Then I turned my attention to the mother, who was drinking thirstily from the basin, water spilling down her front and soaking the already wet shift further.</p><p>She lay back and allowed me to tend her, but without speaking, rolling her eyes occasionally toward the child with a brooding, hostile look.</p><p>I heard footsteps coming through the house, and the sheriff appeared, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tolly!\u201d Mrs. Tolliver, smeared with birth fluids and reeking of gin, turned to him happily, holding out the baby to him. \u201cLook, Tolly, it\u2019s alive!\u201d</p><p>The sheriff looked quite taken aback, and his brow furrowed as he looked at his wife, but then he seemed to catch the scent of her happiness, above the gin. He leaned forward and touched the little bundle gently, his stern face relaxing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Maisie,\u201d he said. \u201cHallo, little fellow.\u201d He caught sight of me, then, kneeling on the hearth, doing my best to clean up with a rag and what was left of the water.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser brought the child,\u201d Mrs. Tolliver explained eagerly. \u201cIt was laid catty-wumpus, but she brought it so cleverly, and made it breathe\u2014we thought \u2019twas dead, it was so still, but it wasn\u2019t! Isn\u2019t that wonderful, Tolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d the sheriff repeated a little bleakly. He gave me a hard look, then transferred the same look to the new mother, who gazed back with a sullen indifference. He beckoned me to my feet, then, and with a curt bow, gestured me back into the cell and shut the door.</p><p>Only then did I recall what it was he thought I\u2019d done. Little wonder if my juxtaposition with a newborn child made him a trifle nervous, I supposed. I was wet and filthy, and the cell seemed particularly hot and airless. Nonetheless, the miracle of birth was still tingling through my synapses, and I sat down on the bed, still smiling, a wet rag in my hand.</p><p>Sadie was regarding me with respect, mingled with a slight revulsion.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the messiest business I ever did see,\u201d she said. \u201cHeavens above, is it always like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. Haven\u2019t you ever seen a child born? You\u2019ve never had one yourself?\u201d I asked curiously. She shook her head vigorously, and made the sign of the horns, which made me laugh, giddy as I was.</p><p>\u201cHad I ever been disposed to let a man near me, the thought of that would dissuade me,\u201d she assured me fervently.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d I said, belatedly recalling her overtures of the night before. It wasn\u2019t merely comfort she\u2019d been offering, then. \u201cAnd what about Mister Ferguson?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a demure look, blinking through her spectacles.</p><p>\u201cOh, he was a farmer\u2014much older than I. Dead of the pleurisy, these five years gone.\u201d</p><p>And totally fictitious, I was inclined to think. But a widow had a great deal more freedom than did a maid or a wife, and if ever I saw a woman capable of taking care of herself . . .</p><p>I had been paying no attention to the sounds in the kitchen, but at this point, there was a heavy crash and the sheriff\u2019s voice, cursing. No sound of the child or Mrs. Tolliver.</p><p>\u201cTaking the black bitch back to her quarters,\u201d Sadie said, with such a hostile intonation that I glanced at her in amazement.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d she said, seeing my surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s killed her babies. They can hang her, now she\u2019s borne this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said a little blankly. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d The noises in the kitchen receded, and I sat staring at the rush dip, the sense of life still moving in my hands.</p><p>91</p><p>A REASONABLY</p><p>NEAT SCHEME</p><p>WATER LAPPED JUST UNDER JAMIE\u2019S EAR, Jamie\u2019s ear, the mere sound of it making him feel queasy. The reek of decaying mud and dead fish didn\u2019t help, nor did the dunt he\u2019d taken when he fell against the wall.</p><p>He shifted, trying to find some position that would ease head, stomach, or both. They\u2019d trussed him like a boiled fowl, but he managed with some effort to roll onto his side and bring his knees up, which helped a bit.</p><p>He was in a dilapidated boat shed of some sort; he\u2019d seen it in the last of the twilight, when they\u2019d brought him down to the shore\u2014he\u2019d thought at first they meant to drown him\u2014and carried him inside, dropping him on the floor like a sack of flour.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, Ian,\u201d he muttered, shifting again, in increasing discomfort. \u201cI\u2019m a great deal too old for this sort of nonsense.\u201d</p><p>He could only hope his nephew had been close enough when Brown moved to have been able to follow, and to have some notion where he was now; certainly the lad would be looking. The shore where the shed stood was open, no cover, but there was plenty among the brush below Fort Johnston, standing on the headland a little way above him.</p><p>The back of his head throbbed dully, giving him a nasty taste in the back of the mouth, and a disquieting echo of the shattering headaches he used to suffer in the wake of an ax wound that had cracked his skull, many years before. He was shocked at how easily the recollection of those headaches came back; it had happened a lifetime ago, and he had thought even the memory of it dead and buried. His skull clearly had a much more vivid memory of its own, though, and was determined to make him sick by way of revenge for his forgetfulness.</p><p>The moon was up, and bright; the light shone soft through the cracks between the crude boards of the wall. Dim as it was, it seemed to shift, wavering in a disturbingly qualmish fashion, and he shut his eyes, concentrating grimly on what he might do to Richard Brown, and he got the man alone someday.</p><p>Where in the name of Michael and all the saints had he taken Claire, and why? Jamie\u2019s only comfort was that Tom Christie had gone with them. He was fairly sure that Christie wouldn\u2019t let them kill her\u2014and if Jamie could find him, he would lead him to her.</p><p>A sound reached him above the nauseating lapping of the tide. Faint whistling\u2014then singing. He could just make out the words, and smiled a little, in spite of everything. \u201cMarry me, marry me, minister\u2014or else I\u2019ll be your priest, your priest\u2014or else I\u2019ll be your priest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shouted, though it hurt his head, and within a few moments, Ian, the dear wee lad, was beside him, cutting through the ropes. He rolled over, unable for a moment to make his cramped muscles work, then managed to get his hands under him and rise enough to vomit.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Uncle Jamie?\u201d Ian sounded vaguely amused, damn him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do. D\u2019ye ken where Claire is?\u201d He got to his feet, swaying, and was fumbling at his breeches; his fingers felt like sausages, and the broken one was throbbing, the pins and needles of returning circulation stabbing through the jagged ends of bone. All discomfort was forgotten for an instant, though, in the rush of overwhelming relief.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian said, impressed. \u201cAye, I do. They\u2019ve taken her to New Bern. There\u2019s a sheriff there that Forbes says might take her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForbes?\u201d He swung round in his astonishment, and nearly fell, saving himself with a hand on the creaking wood wall. \u201cNeil Forbes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very same.\u201d Ian caught him with a hand beneath his elbow to steady him; the flimsy board had cracked under his weight. \u201cBrown went here and there and talked to this one and that\u2014but it was Forbes he did business with at last, in Cross Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe heard what they said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice was casual, but with an underlying excitement\u2014and no little pride in his accomplishment.</p><p>Brown\u2019s aim was simple at this point\u2014to rid himself of the encumbrance the Frasers had become. He knew of Forbes and his relations with Jamie, owing to all the gossip after the tar incident in the summer of last year, and the confrontation at Mecklenberg in May. And so he offered to hand the two of them over to Forbes, for what use the lawyer might make of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cSo he strode to and fro a bit, thinking\u2014Forbes, I mean\u2014they were in his warehouse, ken, by the river, and me hiding behind the barrels o\u2019 tar. And then he laughs, as though he\u2019s just thought of something clever.\u201d</p><p>Forbes\u2019s suggestion was that Brown\u2019s men should take Jamie, suitably bound, to a small landing that he owned, near Brunswick. From there, he would be taken onto a ship headed for England, and thus safely removed from interference in the affairs of either Forbes or Brown\u2014and, incidentally, rendered unable to defend his wife.</p><p>Claire, meanwhile, should be committed to the mercies of the law. If she were to be found guilty, well, that would be the end of her. If not, the scandal attendant upon a trial would both occupy the attention of anyone connected to her and destroy any influence they might have\u2014thus leaving Fraser\u2019s Ridge ripe for the pickings, and Neil Forbes a clear field toward claiming leadership of the Scottish Whigs in the colony.</p><p>Jamie listened to this in silence, torn between anger and a reluctant admiration.</p><p>\u201cA reasonably neat scheme,\u201d he said. He was feeling steadier now, the queasiness disappearing with the cleansing flow of anger through his blood.</p><p>\u201cOh, it gets better, Uncle,\u201d Ian assured him. \u201cYe recall a gentleman named Stephen Bonnet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. What about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Bonnet\u2019s ship, Uncle, that\u2019s to take ye to England.\u201d Amusement was beginning to show in his nephew\u2019s voice again. \u201cIt seems Lawyer Forbes has had a verra profitable partnership with Bonnet for some time\u2014him and some merchant friends in Wilmington. They\u2019ve shares in both the ship and its cargoes. And since the English blockade, the profits have been greater still; I take it that our Mr. Bonnet is a most experienced smuggler.\u201d</p><p>Jamie said something extremely foul in French, and went quickly to look out of the shed. The water lay calm and beautiful, a moon path stretching silver out to sea. There was a ship out there; small and black and perfect as a spider on a sheet of paper. Bonnet\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen will they come in, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d Ian said, sounding unsure for the first time. \u201cIs the tide coming in, would ye say, Uncle? Or going out?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced down at the water rippling under the boathouse, as though it might offer some clue.</p><p>\u201cHow would I know, for God\u2019s sake? And what difference would it make?\u201d He rubbed a hand hard over his face, trying to think. They\u2019d taken his dirk, of course. He had a sgian dhu, carried in his stocking, but somehow doubted that its three-inch blade would offer much help in the present situation.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye got by way of weapons, Ian? Ye dinna have your bow with ye, I don\u2019t suppose?\u201d</p> <p>Ian shook his head regretfully. He had joined Jamie in the door of the boathouse, and the moon showed the hunger in his face as he eyed the ship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve two decent knives, a dirk, and a pistol. There\u2019s my rifle, but I left it with the horse.\u201d He jerked his head toward the dark line of the distant wood. \u201cShall I fetch it? They might see me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie thought for a moment, tapping his fingers against the jamb of the door, \u2019til the pain of the broken one made him stop. The urge to lie in wait for Bonnet and take him was a physical thing; he understood Ian\u2019s hunger, and shared it. But his rational mind was busy reckoning the odds, and would insist upon presenting them, little as the vengefully animal part of him wished to know them.</p><p>There was not yet any sign of a boat coming from the ship. Always assuming that the ship out there was indeed Bonnet\u2019s\u2014and that, they didn\u2019t know for sure\u2014it might still be hours before anyone came to fetch him away. And when they did, what odds that Bonnet himself would come? He was the ship\u2019s captain; would he come on such an errand, or send minions?</p><p>With a rifle, if Bonnet were in the boat, Jamie would wager any amount that he could shoot the man from ambush. If he were in the boat. If he were recognizable in the dark. And while he could hit him, he might not kill him.</p><p>If Bonnet were not in the boat, though . . . then it would be a matter of waiting \u2019til the boat came close enough, leaping aboard, and overpowering whoever was aboard\u2014how many would come on such an errand? Two, three, four? They must all be killed or disabled, and then it would be a matter of rowing the damn boat back out to the ship\u2014where all aboard would doubtless have noticed the stramash taking place on shore, and be prepared either to drop a cannonball through the bottom of the boat or to wait for them to haul alongside and then pick them off from the rail with small-arms fire, like sitting ducks.</p><p>And if they should somehow succeed in getting aboard without notice\u2014then searching the goddamn ship for Bonnet himself, hunting him down, and killing him, without attracting undue notice from the crew . . .</p><p>This laborious analysis ran through his mind in the time it took to breathe, and was as quickly dismissed. If they were to be captured or killed, Claire would be alone and defenseless. He could not risk it. Still, he thought, trying to comfort himself, he could find Forbes\u2014and would, when the time came.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, then,\u201d he said, and turned away with a sigh. \u201cHave ye but the one horse, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Ian said with a matching sigh. \u201cBut I ken where we can maybe steal another.\u201d</p><p>92</p><p>AMANUENSIS</p><p>TWO DAYS PASSED. Hot, damp days in the sweltering dark, and I could feel various kinds of mold, fungus, and rot trying to take hold in my crevices\u2014to say nothing of the omnivorous, omnipresent cockroaches, who seemed determined to nibble my eyebrows the moment the light was put out. The leather of my shoes was clammy and limp, my hair hung lank and dirty, and\u2014like Sadie Ferguson\u2014I took to spending most of my time in my shift.</p><p>When Mrs. Tolliver appeared and ordered us to come assist with the washing, therefore, we abandoned the latest game of loo\u2014she was winning\u2014and nearly pushed each other over in our haste to oblige.</p><p>It was much hotter in the yard, with the laundry fire roaring, and quite as damp as it had been in the cell, with the thick clouds of moisture boiling off the big kettle of clothes and plastering strands of hair to our faces. Our shifts already clung to our bodies, the grubby linen almost transparent with sweat\u2014laundry was heavy work. There were, however, no bugs, and if the sun shone blinding, and fierce enough to redden my nose and arms\u2014well, it shone, and that was something to be grateful for.</p><p>I asked Mrs. Tolliver about my erstwhile patient and her child, but she merely pressed her lips tight and shook her head, looking pinched and severe. The sheriff had been absent the night before; there had been no sound of his booming voice in the kitchen. And from the green-gilled looks of Maisie Tolliver herself, I diagnosed a long and solitary night with the gin bottle, followed by a fairly ghastly dawn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel much better if you sit in the shade and sip . . . water,\u201d I said. \u201cLots of water.\u201d Tea or coffee would be better, but these substances were more costly than gold in the colony, and I doubted a sheriff\u2019s wife would have any. \u201cIf you have any ipecacuanha . . . or perhaps some mint . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your valuable opinion, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d she snapped, though she swayed, rather, and her cheeks were pale and glossy with sweat.</p><p>I shrugged, and bent my attention to the task of levering a wad of sopping, steaming clothes from the filthy suds with a five-foot wooden laundry spoon, so worn with use that my sweaty hands slipped on the smooth wood.</p><p>We got the lot laboriously washed, rinsed, scaldingly wrung, and hung upon a line to dry, then sank gasping into the thin line of shade afforded by the side of the house, and took turns passing a tin dipper back and forth, gulping lukewarm water from the well bucket. Mrs. Tolliver, disregarding her elevated social position, sat down, too, very suddenly.</p><p>I turned to offer her the dipper, only to see her eyes roll back into her head. She didn\u2019t so much fall as dissolve backward, subsiding slowly into a heap of damp, checked gingham.</p><p>\u201cIs she dead?\u201d Sadie Ferguson inquired with interest. She glanced to and fro, obviously estimating the chances of making a run for it.</p><p>\u201cNo. Bad hangover, possibly aggravated by a slight case of sunstroke.\u201d I\u2019d got hold of her pulse, which was light and fast, but quite steady. I was myself debating the wisdom of abandoning Mrs. Tolliver to the dangers of aspirating her own vomit and absconding, even barefoot and in my shift, but was forestalled by male voices coming round the corner of the house.</p><p>Two men\u2014one was Tolliver\u2019s constable, whom I\u2019d seen briefly when Brown\u2019s men had delivered me to the gaol. The other was a stranger, very well dressed, with silver coat buttons and a silk waistcoat, rather the worse for sweat stains. This gentleman, a heavyset sort of about forty, frowned at the scene of dissipation before him.</p><p>\u201cAre these the prisoners?\u201d he asked in tones of distaste.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d the constable said. \u201cLeastwise, the two in their shifts is. \u2019Tother one\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Silver Buttons\u2019s nostrils pinched in briefly in receipt of this intelligence, then flared.</p><p>\u201cWhich is the midwife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be me,\u201d I said, straightening up and trying for an air of dignity. \u201cI am Mrs. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you,\u201d he said, his tone indicating that I might have said I was Queen Charlotte, for all it mattered to him. He looked me up and down in a disparaging fashion, shook his head, then turned to the sweating constable.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she charged with?\u201d</p><p>The constable, a rather dim young man, pursed his lips at this, looking dubiously back and forth between us.</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . well, one of \u2019em\u2019s a forger,\u201d he said, \u201cand \u2019tother\u2019s a murderess. But as to which bein\u2019 which . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the murderess,\u201d Sadie said bravely, adding loyally, \u201cShe\u2019s a very fine midwife!\u201d I looked at her in surprise, but she shook her head slightly and compressed her lips, adjuring me to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hmm. All right, then. Have you a gown . . . madam?\u201d At my nod, he said briefly, \u201cGet dressed,\u201d and turned to the constable, taking out a vast silk handkerchief from his pocket, with which to wipe his broad pink face. \u201cI\u2019ll take her, then. You\u2019ll tell Mr. Tolliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, sir,\u201d the constable assured him, more or less bowing and scraping. He glanced down at the unconscious form of Mrs. Tolliver, then frowned at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cYou, there. Take her inside and see to her. Hop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d Sadie said, and gravely pushed up her sweat-fogged spectacles with one forefinger. \u201cRight away, sir!\u201d</p><p>I had no opportunity to speak with Sadie, and barely time enough to struggle into my bedraggled gown and stays and seize my small bag before being escorted into a carriage\u2014rather bedraggled itself, but once of good quality.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind telling me who you are, and where you\u2019re taking me?\u201d I inquired, after we had rattled through two or three cross streets, my companion gazing out the window with an abstracted sort of frown.</p><p>My question roused him, and he blinked at me, only then seeming to realize that I was not in fact an inanimate object.</p><p>\u201cOh. Beg pardon, madam. We are going to the Governor\u2019s Palace. Have you not a cap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, as though he\u2019d expected nothing else, and resumed his private thoughts.</p><p>They\u2019d finished the place, and very nicely, too. William Tryon, the previous governor, had built the Governor\u2019s Palace, but had been sent to New York before construction had been finished. Now the enormous brick edifice with its graceful spreading wings was complete, even to the lawns and ivy beds that lined the drive, though the stately trees that would eventually surround it were mere saplings. The carriage pulled up on the drive, but we did not\u2014of course\u2014enter by the imposing front entrance, but rather scuttled round the back and down the stairs to the servants\u2019 quarters in the basement.</p><p>Here I was hastily shoved into a maid\u2019s room, handed a comb, basin, and ewer, and a borrowed cap, and urged to make myself look less like a slattern, as quickly as possible.</p><p>My guide\u2014Mr. Webb was his name, as I learned from the cook\u2019s respectful greeting to him\u2014waited with obvious impatience while I made my hasty ablutions, then grasped my arm and urged me upstairs. We ascended by a narrow back stair to the second floor, where a very young and frightened-looking maidservant was waiting.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve come, sir, at last!\u201d She bobbed a curtsy to Mr. Webb, giving me a curious glance. \u201cIs this the midwife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mrs. Fraser\u2014Dilman.\u201d He nodded at the girl, giving only her surname, the English fashion for house servants. She curtsied to me in turn, then beckoned me toward a door that stood ajar.</p><p>The room was large and gracious, furnished with a canopied bed, a walnut commode, armoire, and armchair, though the air of elegant refinement was somewhat impaired by a heap of mending, a ratty sewing basket overturned and spilling its threads, and a basket of children\u2019s toys. In the bed was a large mound, which\u2014given the evidence to hand\u2014I rather supposed must be Mrs. Martin, the Governor\u2019s wife.</p><p>This proved to be the case when Dilman curtsied again, murmuring my name to her. She was round\u2014very round, given her advanced state of pregnancy\u2014with a small, sharp nose and a nearsighted way of peering that reminded me irresistibly of Beatrix Potter\u2019s Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. In terms of personality, not quite so much.</p><p>\u201cWho the devil is this?\u201d she demanded, poking a frowsy, capped head out of the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cMidwife, mum,\u201d Dilman said, bobbing again. \u201cHave you slept well, mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Mrs. Martin said crossly. \u201cThis beastly child\u2019s kicked my liver black and blue, I\u2019ve puked all night, I\u2019ve sweated through my sheets, and I have a shaking ague. I was told there was no midwife to be found within the county.\u201d She gave me a dyspeptic look. \u201cWhere did you discover this person, the local prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d I said, unslinging my bag from my shoulder. \u201cHow far gone are you, how long have you been ill, and when\u2019s the last time you moved your bowels?\u201d</p><p>She looked marginally more interested, and waved Dilman out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say your name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFraser. Are you experiencing any symptoms of early labor? Cramping? Bleeding? Intermittent pain in the back?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sideways look, but did begin to answer my questions. From which, in the fullness of time, I eventually was able to diagnose an acute case of food poisoning, likely caused by a leftover slice of oyster pie, consumed\u2014with quite a lot of other edibles\u2014in a fit of pregnancy-induced greed the day before.</p><p>\u201cI have not an ague?\u201d She withdrew the tongue she had allowed me to inspect, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou have not. Not yet, anyway,\u201d honesty compelled me to add. It was no wonder she thought she had; I had learned in the course of the examination that a particularly virulent sort of fever was abroad in the town\u2014and in the palace. The Governor\u2019s secretary had died of it two days before, and Dilman was the only upstairs servant still on her feet.</p><p>I got her out of bed, and helped her to the armchair, where she subsided, looking like a squashed cream cake. The room was hot and stuffy, and I opened the window in hopes of a breeze.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, Mrs. Fraser, do you mean to kill me?\u201d She clutched her wrapper tight around her belly, hunching her shoulders as though I had admitted a howling blizzard.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the miasma!\u201d She waved a hand at the window, scandalized. In all truth, mosquitoes were a danger. But it was still several hours \u2019til sunset, when they would begin to rise.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll close it in a bit. For the moment, you need air. And possibly something light. Could you stomach a bit of dry toast, do you think?\u201d</p><p>She thought that one over, tasting the corners of her mouth with a tentative tongue tip.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she decided. \u201cAnd a cup of tea. Dilman!\u201d</p><p>Dilman dismissed to fetch the tea and toast\u2014how long was it since I had even seen real tea? I wondered\u2014I settled down to take a more complete medical history.</p><p>How many earlier pregnancies? Six, but a shadow crossed her face, and I saw her glance involuntarily at a wooden puppet, lying near the hearth.</p><p>\u201cAre your children in the palace?\u201d I asked, curious. I had heard no sign of any children, and even in a place the size of the palace, it would be difficult to hide six of them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a sigh, and put her hands on her belly, holding it almost absently. \u201cWe sent the girls to my sister in New Jersey, a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>A few more questions, and the tea and toast arrived. I left her to eat it in peace, and went to shake out the damp, crumpled bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Mrs. Martin asked suddenly, startling me.</p><p>\u201cIs what true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say you murdered your husband\u2019s pregnant young mistress, and cut the baby from her womb. Did you?\u201d</p><p>I put the heel of my hand against my brow and pressed, closing my eyes. How on earth had she heard that? When I thought I could speak, I lowered my hands and opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t his mistress, and I didn\u2019t kill her. As for the rest\u2014yes, I did,\u201d I said as calmly as I could.</p><p>She stared at me for a moment, her mouth hanging open. Then she shut it with a snap and crossed her forearms over her belly.</p><p>\u201cTrust George Webb to choose me a proper midwife!\u201d she said\u2014and much to my surprise, began to laugh. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would assume not,\u201d I said with extreme dryness. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him. Who told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are quite notorious, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d she assured me. \u201cEveryone has been talking of it. George has no time for gossip, but even he must have heard of it. He has no memory for names, though. I do.\u201d</p><p>A little color was coming back into her face. She took another nibble of toast, chewed, and swallowed gingerly.</p><p>\u201cI was not sure that it was you, though,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNot until I asked.\u201d She closed her eyes, grimacing doubtfully, but evidently the toast hit bottom, for she opened them and resumed her nibbling.</p><p>\u201cSo now that you do know . . . ?\u201d I asked delicately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never known a murderess before.\u201d She swallowed the last of the toast and licked the tips of her fingers before wiping them on the napkin.</p><p>\u201cI am not a murderess,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you\u2019d say so,\u201d she agreed. She took up the cup of tea, surveying me over it with interest. \u201cYou don\u2019t look depraved\u2014though I must say, you don\u2019t look quite respectable, either.\u201d She raised the fragrant cup and drank, with a look of bliss that made me conscious that I hadn\u2019t eaten anything since the rather meager bowl of unsalted, unbuttered porridge provided for breakfast by Mrs. Tolliver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d Mrs. Martin said, setting down her cup with a clink. \u201cTake that back to the kitchen,\u201d she said, waving at the tray, \u201cand have them send me up some soup, and perhaps a few sandwiches. I do believe my appetite has come back!\u201d</p><p>WELL, NOW BLOODY WHAT? I had been whisked so abruptly from gaol to palace that I felt like a sailor decanted onto land after months at sea, staggering and off-balance. I went obediently down to the kitchen, as instructed, obtained a tray\u2014with a most delectable-smelling bowl of soup\u2014and took it back to Mrs. Martin, walking like an automaton. By the time she dismissed me, my brain had begun to function again, if not yet at full capacity.</p><p>I was in New Bern. And, thanks be to God and Sadie Ferguson, out of Sheriff Tolliver\u2019s noisome gaol. Fergus and Marsali were in New Bern. Ergo, the obvious\u2014in fact, the only\u2014thing to do was plainly to escape and find my way to them. They could help me to find Jamie. I clung firmly to Tom Christie\u2019s promise that Jamie wasn\u2019t dead and to the notion that he was findable, because nothing else was tolerable.</p><p>Escaping from the Governor\u2019s Palace, though, proved more difficult than I had anticipated. There were guards posted at all the doors, and my attempt to talk my way past one of them failed utterly, leading to the abrupt appearance of Mr. Webb, who took me by the arm and escorted me firmly up the stairs to a hot, stuffy little garret, where he locked me in.</p><p>It was better than the gaol, but that was all that could be said for it. There was a cot, a chamber pot, a basin, ewer, and chest of drawers, the latter containing meager bits of clothing. The room showed signs of recent occupancy\u2014but not immediately recent. A film of fine summer dust lay over everything, and while the ewer was full of water, it had obviously been there for some time; a number of moths and other small insects had drowned in it, and a film of the same fine dust floated on the surface.</p><p>There was also a small window, painted shut, but determined banging and heaving got it open, and I breathed a heady lungful of hot, muggy air.</p><p>I stripped off, removed the dead moths from the pitcher, and washed, a blissful experience that made me feel immensely better, after the last week of unalloyed grime, sweat, and filth. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, I helped myself to a worn linen shift from the chest of drawers, unable to bear the thought of putting my own filthy, sweat-soaked chemise back on.</p><p>I could do only so much without soap or shampoo, but even so, felt much improved, and stood by the window, combing out my wet hair\u2014there had been a wooden comb on the chest, though no looking glass\u2014and surveying what I could see from my perch.</p><p>There were more guards, posted round the edge of the property. Was that usual? I wondered. I thought perhaps it was not; they seemed uneasy, and very alert; I saw one challenge a man who approached the gate, presenting his weapon in rather belligerent fashion. The man seemed startled and backed up, then turned and walked away fast, glancing backward as he went.</p><p>There were a number of uniformed guards\u2014I thought they were perhaps Marines, though I wasn\u2019t sufficiently familiar with uniforms as to be sure of it\u2014clustered round six cannon, these situated on a slight rise before the palace, commanding the town and the harbor\u2019s edge.</p><p>There were two nonuniformed men among them; leaning out a bit, I made out the tall, heavyset figure of Mr. Webb, and a shorter man beside him. The shorter man was strolling along the line of cannon, hands folded beneath his coattails, and the Marines, or whatever they were, were saluting him. At a guess, this was the Governor, then: Josiah Martin.</p><p>I watched for a little while, but nothing of interest happened, and I found myself overwhelmed with sudden sleepiness, borne down by the strains of the last month and the hot, still air that seemed to press upon me like a hand.</p><p>I lay down on the cot in my borrowed shift, and fell instantly asleep.</p><p>I SLEPT UNTIL THE middle of the night, when I was again called to attend Mrs. Martin, who seemed to be having a relapse of her digestive difficulties. A slightly pudgy, long-nosed man in nightshirt and cap lurked in the doorway with a candle, looking worried; I took this to be the Governor. He looked hard at me, but made no move to interfere, and I had no time to take much notice of him. By the time the crisis had passed, the Governor\u2014if indeed it was he\u2014had disappeared. The patient now safely asleep, I lay down like a dog on the rug beside her bed, with a rolled-up petticoat as pillow, and went thankfully back to sleep.</p><p>It was full daylight when I woke again, and the fire was out. Mrs. Martin was out of bed, calling fretfully into the passage for Dilman.</p><p>\u201cWretched girl,\u201d she said, turning back as I got awkwardly to my feet. \u201cGot the ague, I suppose, like the rest. Or run away.\u201d</p><p>I gathered that while several servants were down with the fever, a good many of the others had simply decamped out of fear of contagion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure I have not got the tertian ague, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d Mrs. Martin squinted at herself in her looking glass, putting out her tongue and surveying it critically. \u201cI do believe I look yellow.\u201d</p><p>In fact, her complexion was a soft English pink, though rather pale from throwing up.</p><p>\u201cKeep off the cream cakes and oyster pie in hot weather, don\u2019t eat anything larger than your head at one sitting, and you should be quite all right,\u201d I said, suppressing a yawn. I caught a look at myself in the glass, over her shoulder, and shuddered. I was nearly as pale as she was, with dark circles under my eyes, and my hair . . . well, it was almost clean, that was all that could be said for it.</p><p>\u201cI should be let blood,\u201d Mrs. Martin declared. \u201cThat is the proper treatment for a plethory; dear Dr. Sibelius always says so. Three or four ounces, perhaps, to be followed by the black draught. Dr. Sibelius says he finds the black-draught answer very well in such cases.\u201d She moved to an armchair and reclined, her belly bulging under her wrapper. She pulled up the sleeve of the wrapper, extending her arm in languorous fashion. \u201cThere is a fleam and bowl in the top left drawer, Mrs. Fraser. If you would oblige me?\u201d</p><p>The mere thought of letting blood first thing in the morning was enough to make me want to vomit. As for Dr. Sibelius\u2019s black draught, that was laudanum\u2014an alcoholic tincture of opium, and not my treatment of choice for a pregnant woman.</p><p>The subsequent acrimonious discussion over the virtues of blood-letting\u2014and I began to think, from the anticipatory gleam in her eye, that the thrill of having a vein opened by a murderess was what she actually desired\u2014was interrupted by the unceremonious entry of Mr. Webb.</p><p>\u201cDo I disturb you, mum? My apologies.\u201d He bowed perfunctorily to Mrs. Martin, then turned to me. \u201cYou\u2014put on your cap and come with me.\u201d</p><p>I did so without protest, leaving Mrs. Martin indignantly unperforated.</p><p>Webb ushered me down the gleamingly polished front stair this time, and into a large, gracious, book-lined room. The Governor, now properly wigged, powdered, and elegantly suited, was seated behind a desk overflowing with papers, dockets, scattered quills, blotters, sand-shakers, sealing wax, and all the other impedimenta of an eighteenth-century bureaucrat. He looked hot, bothered, and quite as indignant as his wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, Webb?\u201d he demanded, scowling at me. \u201cI need a secretary, and you bring me a midwife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a forger,\u201d Webb said baldly. That stopped whatever complaint the Governor had been going to bring forth. He paused, mouth slightly open, still frowning at me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said in an altered tone. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccused of forgery,\u201d I said politely. \u201cI haven\u2019t been tried, let alone convicted, you know.\u201d</p> <p>The Governor\u2019s eyebrows went up, hearing my educated accent.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he said again, more slowly. He looked me up and down, squinting dubiously. \u201cWhere on earth did you get her, Webb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the gaol.\u201d Webb cast me an indifferent glance, as though I might be some unprepossessing yet useful bit of furniture, like a chamber pot. \u201cWhen I made inquiries for a midwife, someone told me that this woman had done prodigies with a slave, another prisoner, having a difficult lying-in. And as the matter was urgent, and no other cunning woman to be found . . .\u201d He shrugged, with a faint grimace.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm.\u201d The Governor pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve and dabbed thoughtfully at the plump flesh beneath his chin. \u201cCan you write a fair hand?\u201d</p><p>I supposed it would be a poor forger who couldn\u2019t, but contented myself with saying, \u201cYes.\u201d Fortunately, it was true; in my own time, I had scribbled ball-point prescriptions with the best of them, but now I had trained myself to write clearly with a quill, so that my medical records and case notes should be legible, for the benefit of whoever should read them after me. Once again, I felt a sharp pang at the thought of Malva\u2014but there was no time to think of her.</p> <p>Still eyeing me speculatively, the Governor nodded toward a straight-backed chair and a smaller desk at the side of the room.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He rose, scrabbled among the papers on his desk, and deposited one in front of me. \u201cLet me see you make a fair copy of that, if you please.\u201d</p><p>It was a brief letter to the Royal Council, outlining the Governor\u2019s concerns regarding recent threats to that body, and postponing the next scheduled meeting of the council. I chose a quill from the cut-glass holder on the desk, found a silver penknife by it, trimmed the quill to my liking, uncorked the inkwell, and set about the business, deeply aware of the scrutiny of the two men.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how long my imposture might hold up\u2014Mrs. Governor could blow the gaff at any time\u2014but for the nonce, I thought I probably had a better chance of escape as an accused forger than as an accused murderer.</p><p>The Governor took my finished copy, surveyed it, and laid it on the desk with a small grunt of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d he said. \u201cMake eight further copies of that, and then you can go on with these.\u201d Turning back to his own desk, he shuffled together a large sheaf of correspondence, which he deposited in front of me.</p> <p>The two men\u2014I had no notion of Webb\u2019s office, but he was obviously the Governor\u2019s close friend\u2014returned to a discussion of current business, ignoring me completely.</p><p>I went about my assigned task mechanically, finding the scratch of the quill, the ritual of sanding, blotting, shaking, soothing. Copying occupied a very small part of my mind; the rest was free to worry about Jamie, and to think how best to engineer an escape.</p><p>I could\u2014and doubtless should\u2014make an excuse after a bit to go and see how Mrs. Martin did. If I could make shift to do so unaccompanied, I would have a few moments of unobserved freedom, during which to make a surreptitious dash for the nearest exit. So far, though, every door I\u2019d seen had been guarded. The Governor\u2019s Palace had a very well-stocked simples closet, alas; it would be hard to invent a need for anything from an apothecary\u2014and even then, unlikely that they\u2019d let me go alone to fetch it.</p><p>Waiting for nightfall seemed the best notion; at least if I did get out of the palace, I would have several hours before my absence was noted. If they locked me in again, though . . .</p><p>I scratched away assiduously, turning over various unsatisfactory plans, and trying very hard not to envision Jamie\u2019s body turning slowly in the wind, hanging from a tree in some lonely hollow. Christie had given me his word; I clung to that, having nothing else to cling to.</p><p>Webb and the Governor murmured together, but their talk was of things I had no notion of, and for the most part, it washed over me like the sound of the sea, meaningless and soothing. After some time, though, Webb came over to instruct me in the sealing and direction of those letters to be sent. I thought of asking why he didn\u2019t lend a hand himself in this clerical emergency, but then saw his hands\u2014both badly twisted with arthritis.</p><p>\u201cYou write a very fair hand, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he unbent enough to say, at one point, and gave me a brief, wintry smile. \u201cIt is unfortunate that you should have been the forger, rather than the murderess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, rather astonished at that.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, you are plainly literate,\u201d he said, surprised in turn at my astonishment. \u201cIf convicted of murder, you could plead benefit of clergy, and be let off with a public whipping and branding in the face. Forgery, though\u2014\u201d He shook his head, pursing his lips. \u201cCapital crime, no pardon possible. If convicted of forgery, Mrs. Fraser, I am afraid you must be hanged.\u201d</p><p>My feelings of gratitude toward Sadie Ferguson underwent an abrupt reappraisal.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said as coolly as possible, though my heart had given a convulsive leap and was now trying to burrow out of my chest. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll hope that justice is served then, and I am released, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He made a choked sound that I thought passed for a laugh.</p><p>\u201cTo be sure. If only for the Governor\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>After that, we resumed work silently. The gilded clock behind me struck noon, and as though summoned by the sound, a servant whom I took to be the butler came in, to inquire whether the Governor would receive a delegation of the town\u2019s citizens?</p><p>The Governor\u2019s mouth compressed a bit, but he nodded in resignation, and a group of six or seven men came in, all attired in their best coats, but plainly tradesmen, rather than merchants or lawyers. None I recognized, thank God.</p><p>\u201cWe have come, sir,\u201d said one, who introduced himself as George Herbert, \u201cto ask the meaning of this movement of the cannon.\u201d</p><p>Webb, sitting next to me, stiffened a little, but the Governor seemed to have been prepared for this.</p><p>\u201cThe cannon?\u201d he said with every evidence of innocent surprise. \u201cWhy\u2014the mountings are being repaired. We shall fire a royal salute\u2014as usual\u2014in honor of the Queen\u2019s birthday, later in the month. Upon inspecting the cannon in anticipation of this, though, it was discovered that the wood of the caissons had rotted away in spots. Firing the cannon is of course impossible until repairs shall be effected. Would you wish to inspect the mountings for yourself, sir?\u201d</p><p>He half-rose from his seat as he said this, as though personally to escort them outside, but spoke with such a tinge of irony to his courtesy that they flushed and muttered refusals.</p><p>There was a bit more back and forth, in the name of courtesy, but the delegation then left, exhibiting only marginally less suspicion than that with which they\u2019d come in. Webb closed his eyes and exhaled audibly, as the door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cGod damn them,\u201d said the Governor very softly. I didn\u2019t think he meant it to be heard, and pretended I hadn\u2019t, busying myself with the papers and keeping my head lowered.</p><p>Webb got up and went to the window that overlooked the lawn, presumably to assure himself that the cannon were where he thought they should be. By craning a bit, I could see past him; sure enough, the six cannon had been removed from their mountings and lay on the grass, harmless logs of bronze.</p><p>From the subsequent conversation\u2014salted with strong remarks regarding rebellious dogs who had the temerity to put the question to a Royal Governor as though he were a bootblack, by God!\u2014I gathered that in fact, the cannon had been removed because of a very real fear that the townspeople might seize them and turn them upon the palace itself.</p><p>It dawned on me, listening to all this, that things had gone further and moved faster than I had expected. It was mid-July, but of 1775\u2014nearly a year before a larger and more forceful version of the Mecklenberg Declaration would flower into an official declaration of independence for the united colonies. And yet here was a Royal Governor, in obvious fear of open revolt.</p><p>If what we had seen on our journey south from the Ridge had not been enough to convince me that war was now upon us, a day spent with Governor Martin left no doubt.</p><p>I did go up in the afternoon\u2014accompanied by the watchful Webb, alas\u2014to check my patient, and to make inquiries regarding anyone else who might be ill. Mrs. Martin was torpid and low in spirits, complaining of the heat and the pestilential, wretched climate, missing her daughters, and suffering severely from a lack of personal service, having been obliged to brush her own hair in the absence of Dilman, who had vanished. She was, however, in good health, as I was able to report to the Governor, who asked me of it upon my return.</p><p>\u201cWould she stand a journey, do you think?\u201d he asked, frowning a bit.</p><p>I considered for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think so. She\u2019s a bit wobbly, still, from the digestive upset\u2014but she should be quite well again by tomorrow. I see no difficulties with the pregnancy\u2014tell me, had she any trouble with previous confinements?\u201d</p><p>The Governor\u2019s face flushed rosily at that, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI thank you, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said with a slight inclination of the head. \u201cYou will excuse me, George\u2014I must go and speak to Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he thinking of sending his wife away?\u201d I asked Webb, in the wake of the Governor\u2019s departure. Despite the heat, a small qualm of uneasiness stirred beneath my skin.</p><p>For once, Webb seemed quite human; he was frowning after the Governor, and nodded absently.</p><p>\u201cHe has family in New York and New Jersey. She\u2019ll be safe there, with the girls. Her three daughters,\u201d he explained, catching my eye.</p><p>\u201cThree? She said she\u2019d had six\u2014ah.\u201d I stopped abruptly. She said she had borne six children, not that she had six living children.</p><p>\u201cThey have lost three small sons to the fevers here,\u201d Webb said, still looking after his friend. He shook his head, sighing. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a fortunate place for them.\u201d</p><p>He seemed then to recover himself, and the man disappeared back behind the mask of the chilly bureaucrat. He handed me another sheaf of papers, and went out, not bothering to bow.</p><p>93</p><p>IN WHICH I IMPERSONATE</p><p>A LADY</p><p>I ATE SUPPER ALONE IN MY ROOM; the cook seemed still to be functioning, at least, though the atmosphere of disorder in the house was a palpable thing. I could feel the uneasiness, bordering on panic\u2014and had the thought that it wasn\u2019t fear of fever or ague that had caused the servants to leave, but more likely that sense of self-preservation that causes rats to flee a sinking ship.</p><p>From my tiny window, I could see a small portion of the town, apparently serene in the gathering twilight. The light was very different here from that in the mountains\u2014a flat, dimensionless light that limned the houses and the fishing boats in the harbor with a hard-edged clarity, but faded into a haze that hid the farther shore completely, so that I looked beyond the immediate prospect into featureless infinity.</p><p>I shook off the notion, and took from my pocket the ink, quill, and paper I had abstracted from the library earlier. I had no idea whether or how I might get a note out of the palace\u2014but I did have a little money, still, and if the opportunity offered . . .</p><p>I wrote quickly to Fergus and Marsali, telling them briefly what had happened, urging Fergus to make inquiries for Jamie in Brunswick and Wilmington.</p><p>I thought myself that if Jamie was alive, that he was most likely in the Wilmington gaol. Brunswick was a tiny settlement, dominated by the looming presence of the log-built Fort Johnston, but the fort was a militia garrison; there would be no good reason to take Jamie there\u2014though if they had . . . the fort was under the command of a Captain Collet, a Swiss emigrant who knew him. At least he would be safe there.</p><p>Who else did he know? He had a good many acquaintances on the coast, from the days of the Regulation. John Ashe, for one; they had marched side by side to Alamance, and Ashe\u2019s company had camped next to ours every night; we had entertained him at our campfire many times. And Ashe was from Wilmington.</p><p>I had just finished a brief plea to John Ashe, when I heard footsteps coming down the hallway toward my room. I folded it hastily, not worrying about smearing, and thrust it with the other note into my pocket. There was no time to do anything with the contraband ink and paper, save push it under the bed.</p><p>It was Webb, of course, my customary jailer. Evidently, I was now considered the general dogsbody of the establishment; I was escorted to Mrs. Martin\u2019s room and desired to pack her things.</p><p>I might have expected complaint or hysteria, but in fact, she was not only dressed but pale-faced and composed, directing and even assisting the process with a sense of clear-minded order.</p><p>The reason for her self-possession was the Governor, who came in midway through the packing, his face drawn with worry. She went at once to him, and put her hands affectionately on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cPoor Jo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHave you had any supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll have a bite later.\u201d He kissed her briefly on the forehead, his look of worry lightening a little as he looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re quite well now, Betsy? You\u2019re sure of it?\u201d I realized suddenly that he was Irish\u2014Anglo-Irish, at least; he had no hint of an accent, but his unguarded speech held a faint lilt.</p><p>\u201cEntirely recovered,\u201d she assured him. She took his hand and pressed it to her bulge, smiling. \u201cSee how he kicks?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, raised her hand to his lips, and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, darling,\u201d she said very softly. \u201cYou will take very great care?\u201d</p><p>He blinked rapidly, and looked down, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cDear Betsy. You know I could not bear to part with you, unless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. That\u2019s why I fear so greatly for you. I\u2014\u201d At this point, she looked up, and realized suddenly that I was there. \u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d she said in quite a different tone. \u201cGo down to the kitchen, please, and have a tray prepared for the Governor. You may take it to the library.\u201d</p><p>I bobbed slightly, and went. Was this the chance I had been waiting for?</p><p>The halls and stairway were deserted, lit only by flickering tin sconces\u2014burning fish oil, by the smell. The brick-walled kitchen was, course, in the basement, and the eerie silence in what should ordinarily be a hive of activity made the unlighted kitchen stairway seem like the descent into a dungeon.</p><p>There was no light in the kitchen now save the hearth fire, burning low\u2014but it was burning, three servants clustered near it despite the smothering heat. They turned at my footsteps, startled and faceless in silhouette. With steam rising from the cauldron behind them, I had the momentary delusion that I was facing Macbeth\u2019s three witches, met in dreadful prophecy.</p><p>\u201cDouble, double, toil and trouble,\u201d I said pleasantly, though my heart beat a little faster as I approached them. \u201cFire burn, and cauldron bubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToil and trouble, that be right,\u201d said a soft female voice, and laughed. Closer now, I could see that they had appeared faceless in the shadows because they were all black; slaves, likely, and thus unable to flee the house.</p><p>Unable also to carry a message for me. Still, it never hurt to be friendly, and I smiled at them.</p><p>They smiled shyly back, looking at me with curiosity. I had not seen any of them before\u2014nor they me, though \u201cdownstairs\u201d being what it was, I thought it likely they knew who I was.</p><p>\u201cGovernor be sendin\u2019 his lady away?\u201d asked the one who had laughed, moving to fetch down a tray from a shelf in response to my request for something light.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I realized the value of gossip as currency, and related everything that I decently could, as the three of them moved efficiently about, dark as shadows, their darting hands slicing, spreading, arranging.</p><p>Molly, the cook, shook her head, her white cap like a sunset cloud in the fire\u2019s glow.</p><p>\u201cBad times, bad times,\u201d she said, clicking her tongue, and the other two murmured assent. I thought, from their attitude, that they liked the Governor\u2014but then, as slaves, their fate was inextricably linked with his, regardless of their feelings.</p><p>It occurred to me, as we chatted, that even if they could not reasonably flee the house altogether, they might at least leave the premises now and again; someone had to do the marketing, and there seemed to be no one else left. In fact, this proved to be the case; Sukie, the one who had laughed, went out to buy fish and fresh vegetables in the mornings, and tactfully approached, was not averse to delivering my notes to the printshop\u2014she said she knew where it was, the place with all the books in the window\u2014for a small consideration.</p><p>She tucked away the paper and money in her bosom, giving me a knowing look, and winked. God knew what she thought it was, but I winked back, and hefting the loaded tray, made my way back up into the fishy-smelling realms of light.</p><p>I found the Governor alone in the library, burning papers. He nodded absently at the tray I set on the desk, but did not touch it. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, and after a moment\u2019s awkward standing about, sat down at my accustomed place.</p><p>The Governor thrust a final sheaf of documents into the fire, then stood looking bleakly after them, as they blackened and curled. The room had cooled a little, with the setting sun, but the windows were tightly shut\u2014of course\u2014and rivulets of condensing moisture rolled down the ornamental panes of glass. Blotting a similar condensation from my cheeks and nose, I got up and threw open the window closest to me, drawing in a deep gulp of the evening air, cloyingly warm, but fresh, and sweet with honeysuckle and roses from the garden, undercut with dankness from the distant shore.</p><p>Woodsmoke, too; there were fires burning outside. The soldiers who guarded the palace had watch fires burning, evenly spaced around the perimeter of the grounds. Well, that would help with the mosquitoes\u2014and we would not be completely surprised, if an attack should come.</p><p>The Governor came to stand behind me. I expected him to tell me to shut the window, but he merely stood, looking out across his lawns and the long, graveled drive. The moon had risen, and the dismounted cannon were dimly visible, lying in the shadows like dead men in a row.</p><p>After a moment, the Governor moved back to his desk, and calling me over, handed me a sheaf of official correspondence for copying, another for sorting and filing. He left the window open; I thought that he wished to hear, if anything should happen.</p><p>I wondered where the omnipresent Webb was. There was no sound from elsewhere in the Palace; presumably Mrs. Martin had finished her packing alone, and gone to bed.</p><p>We worked on, through the intermittent chiming of the clock, the Governor getting up now and then to commit another batch of papers to the fire, taking my copies and bundling them into large leather folders that he bound with tape, stacking them on his desk. He had taken off his wig; his hair was brown, short but curly\u2014rather like my own had been, after the fever. Now and then he paused, head turned, listening.</p><p>I had faced a mob, and knew what he was listening for. I didn\u2019t know what to hope for, at this point, or to fear. And so I worked on, welcoming the work for the numbing distraction it was, though my hand had grown desperately cramped, and I had to pause every few moments to rub it.</p><p>The Governor was writing now; he shifted in his chair, grimacing with discomfort in spite of the cushion. Mrs. Martin had told me that he suffered from a fistula. I doubted very much that he\u2019d let me treat it.</p><p>He eased himself onto one buttock, and rubbed a hand down his face. It was late, and he was plainly tired, as well as uncomfortable. I was tired, too, stifling yawns that threatened to dislocate my jaw and left my eyes watering. He kept doggedly working, though, with occasional glances at the door. Who was he expecting?</p><p>The window at my back was still open, and the soft air caressed me, warm as blood, but moving enough to stir the wisps of hair on my neck and make the candle flame waver wildly. It bent to one side and flickered, as though it would go out, and the Governor reached quickly to shelter it with a cupped hand.</p><p>The breeze passed and the air fell still again, save for the sound of crickets outside. The Governor\u2019s attention seemed focused on the paper before him, but suddenly his head turned sharply, as though he had seen something dart past the open door.</p><p>He looked for a moment, then blinked, rubbed his eyes, and returned his attention to the paper. But he couldn\u2019t keep it there. He glanced again at the empty doorway\u2014I couldn\u2019t help looking, too\u2014then back, blinking.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . see someone pass, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I said, nobly swallowing a yawn.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Seeming somehow disappointed, he took up his quill, but didn\u2019t write anything, just held it between his fingers, as though he had forgotten it was there.</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting anyone, Your Excellency?\u201d I asked politely, and his head jerked up, surprised to be directly addressed.</p><p>\u201cOh. No. That is . . .\u201d His voice died away as he glanced once more at the doorway that led to the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cMy son,\u201d he said. \u201cOur darling Sam. He\u2014died here, you know\u2014late last year. Only eight years old. Sometimes . . . sometimes I think I see him,\u201d he ended quietly, and bent his head once more over his paper, lips pressed tight.</p><p>I moved impulsively, meaning to touch his hand, but his tight-lipped air prevented me.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d I said quietly, instead. He didn\u2019t speak, but gave one quick, short nod of acknowledgment, not raising his head. His lips tightened further, and he went back to his writing, as did I.</p><p>A little later, the clock struck the hour, then two. It had a soft, sweet chime, and the Governor stopped to listen, a distant look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo late,\u201d he said, as the last chime died away. \u201cI have kept you intolerably late, Mrs. Fraser. Forgive me.\u201d He motioned to me to leave the papers I was working on, and I rose, stiff and aching from sitting so long.</p><p>I shook my skirts into some order and turned to go, realizing only then that he had made no move to put away his ink and quills.</p><p>\u201cYou should go to bed, too, you know,\u201d I said to him, turning and pausing at the door.</p><p>The palace was still. Even the crickets had ceased, and only the soft snore of a sleeping soldier in the hall disturbed the quiet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and gave me a small, tired smile. \u201cSoon.\u201d He shifted his weight to the other buttock, and picked up his quill, bending his head once more over the papers.</p><p>NO ONE WOKE ME in the morning, and the sun was well up when I stirred on my own. Listening to the silence, I had a momentary fear that everyone had decamped in the night, leaving me locked in to starve. I rose hastily, though, and looked out. The red-coated soldiers were still patrolling the grounds, just as usual. I could see small groups of citizens outside the perimeter, mostly strolling past in twos or threes, but sometimes stopping to stare at the palace.</p><p>Then I began to hear small thumps and homely noises on the floor below, and felt relieved; I was not entirely abandoned. I was, however, extremely hungry by the time the butler came to let me out.</p><p>He brought me to Mrs. Martin\u2019s bedchamber, but to my surprise it was empty. He left me there, and within a few moments, Merilee, one of the kitchen slaves, came in, looking apprehensive at being in this unfamiliar part of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhatever is going on?\u201d I asked her. \u201cWhere is Mrs. Martin, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know that,\u201d she said, in a dubious tone indicating that it was the only thing she did know for certain. \u201cShe lef\u2019 just afore dawn this mornin\u2019. That Mr. Webb, he took her away, secret-like, in a wagon with her boxes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, perplexed. It was reasonable that she should have left quietly; I imagined the Governor didn\u2019t want to give any indication that he felt threatened, for fear of provoking exactly the violence he feared.</p><p>\u201cBut if Mrs. Martin is gone,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy am I here? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I know that, too,\u201d Merilee said, gaining a bit of confidence. \u201cI s\u2019posed to hep you dress, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need any . . .\u201d I began, and then saw the garments laid out on the bed: one of Mrs. Martin\u2019s day gowns, a pretty printed floral cotton, done in the newly popular \u201cpolonaise\u201d fashion, complete with voluminous petticoats, silk stockings, and a large straw hat to shade the face.</p><p>Evidently, I was meant to impersonate the Governor\u2019s wife. There was no real point in protesting; I could hear the Governor and the butler talking in the hall, and after all\u2014if it got me out of the palace, so much the better.</p><p>I was only two or three inches taller than Mrs. Martin, and my lack of a bulge made the gown hang lower. There was no hope of my fitting into any of her shoes, but my own were not completely disreputable, in spite of all my adventures since leaving home. Merilee cleaned them and rubbed them with a bit of grease to make the leather shine; they were at least not so crude as to draw attention immediately.</p><p>With the broad-brimmed hat slanting forward to hide my face, and my hair twisted up and firmly pinned under a cap beneath it, I was probably a reasonable approximation, at least to people who did not know Mrs. Martin well. The Governor frowned when he saw me, and walked slowly round me, tugging here and there to adjust the fit, but then nodded, and with a small bow, offered me his arm.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, mum,\u201d he said politely. And with me slumping slightly to disguise my height, we went out the front door, to find the Governor\u2019s carriage waiting in the drive.</p><p>94</p><p>ABSQUATULATION</p><p>JAMIE FRASER observed the quantity and quality of books in the window of the printshop\u2014F. Fraser, Proprietor\u2014and allowed himself a momentary sense of pride in Fergus; the establishment, though small, was apparently thriving. Time, however, was pressing, and he pushed through the door without stopping to read the titles.</p><p>A small bell over the door rang at his entrance, and Germain popped up behind the counter like an ink-smeared jack-in-the-box, emitting a whoop of joy at sight of his grandfather and his uncle Ian.</p><p>\u201cGrandp\u00e8re, Grandp\u00e8re!\u201d he shouted, then dived under the flap in the counter, clutching Jamie about the h*ps in ecstasy. He\u2019d grown; the top of his head now reached Jamie\u2019s lower ribs. Jamie ruffled the shiny blond hair gently, then detached Germain and told him to fetch his father.</p><p>No need; aroused by the shouting, the whole family came boiling out from the living quarters behind the shop, exclaiming, yelling, squealing, and generally carrying on like a pack of wolves, as Ian pointed out to them, Henri-Christian riding on his shoulders in red-faced triumph, clinging to his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened, milord? Why are you here?\u201d Fergus disengaged Jamie easily from the riot and drew him aside, into the alcove where the more expensive books were kept\u2014and those not suitable for public display.</p><p>He could see from the look on Fergus\u2019s face that some news had come down from the mountains; while surprised to see him, Fergus was not astonished, and his pleasure covered a worried mind. He explained the matter as quickly as he could, stumbling now and then over his words from haste and weariness; one of the horses had broken down some forty miles from town, and unable to find another, they had walked for two nights and a day, taking it in turns to ride, the other trotting alongside, clinging to the stirrup leathers.</p><p>Fergus listened with attention, wiping his mouth with the handkerchief he had taken from his collar; they had arrived in the middle of dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2014that would be Mr. Tolliver,\u201d he said. \u201cI know him. Shall we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie made an abrupt gesture, cutting him short.</p><p>\u201cWe went there to begin with,\u201d he said. They had found the sheriff gone, and no one in the house save a very drunken woman with a face like a discontented bird, collapsed and snoring on the settle with a small Negro baby clutched in her arms.</p><p>He had taken the baby and thrust it into Ian\u2019s arms, bidding him grimly to mind it while he sobered the woman enough to talk. He had then dragged her out into the yard and poured buckets of well water over her until she gasped and blinked, then dragged her dripping and stumbling back into the house, where he obliged her to drink water poured over the black, burned dregs of chicory coffee he had found in the pot. She had vomited profusely and disgustingly, but regained some vague sense of language.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, all she could say was that all of the female prisoners were gone\u2014run off or hanged.\u201d He said nothing of the fright that had lanced through his belly at that last. He had shaken the woman thoroughly, though, demanding particulars, and eventually, after further applications of water and vile coffee, got them.</p><p>\u201cA man came, the day before yesterday, and took her away. That was all she knew\u2014or all she remembered. I made her tell me what she could of how he looked\u2014it wasna Brown, nor yet Neil Forbes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Fergus glanced behind him; his family were all gathered round Ian, pestering and caressing him. Marsali, though, was looking toward the alcove, worry on her face, obviously wanting to come and join the conversation, but detained by Joan, who was tugging on her skirt.</p><p>\u201cWho would take her, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoanie, a chuisle, will ye not leave go? Help F\u00e9licit\u00e9 for a moment, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Mama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. In a moment, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d Jamie said, the frustration of helplessness welling up like black bile at the back of his throat. A sudden, more horrible thought struck him. \u201cGod, d\u2019ye suppose it might have been Stephen Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s slurred description had not sounded like the pirate\u2014but she had been far from certain in it. Could Forbes have learned of his own escape, and determined simply to reverse the roles in the drama he had conceived\u2014deport Claire forcibly to England, and try to pin the guilt of Malva Christie\u2019s death to Jamie\u2019s coat?</p><p>He found it hard to breathe, and had to force air into his chest. If Forbes had given Claire to Bonnet, he would slit the lawyer from wishbone to cock, rip the guts from his belly, and strangle him with them. And the same for the Irishman, once he laid hands upon him.</p><p>\u201cPapi, Pa-pee . . .\u201d Joan\u2019s singsong voice penetrated dimly through the red cloud that filled his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, ch\u00e9rie?\u201d Fergus lifted her with the ease of long practice, balancing her fat little bottom on his left arm, to leave his right hand free.</p><p>She put her arms round his neck and hissed something into his ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, did you?\u201d he said, plainly abstracted. \u201cTr\u00e8s bien. Where did you put it, ch\u00e9rie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the naughty-lady pictures.\u201d</p><p>She pointed at the upper shelf, where several volumes lay, leather-bound but discreetly untitled. Glancing in the direction she indicated, Jamie saw a smudged paper sticking out from between two of the books.</p><p>Fergus clicked his tongue in displeasure, and smacked her lightly on the bottom with his good hand.</p><p>\u201cYou know you are not to climb up there!\u201d</p><p>Jamie reached over and pulled the paper out. And felt all the blood leave his head, at sight of the familiar writing on it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fergus, alarmed at his appearance, set Joanie down. \u201cSit, milord! Run, ch\u00e9rie, get the smelling bottle.\u201d</p><p>Jamie waved a hand, speechless, trying to indicate that he was all right, and succeeded at last in finding his tongue.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the Governor\u2019s Palace,\u201d he said. \u201cChrist be thanked, she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Seeing a stool pushed under the shelf, he pulled it out and sat on it, feeling exhaustion pulse through the quivering muscles of thigh and calf, ignoring the confusion of question and explanation, how Joanie had found the note pushed under the door\u2014anonymous submissions to the newspaper often were delivered in this fashion, and the children knew they were to bring such things to their father\u2019s attention. . . .</p><p>Fergus read the note, his dark eyes assuming the expression of interested intent that he always had when contemplating the abstraction of something difficult and valuable.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will go and fetch her. But I think first you must eat a little, milord.\u201d</p><p>He wished to refuse, to say that there was not a moment to be lost, that he could eat nothing in any case; his wame was knotted, hurting him.</p><p>But Marsali was already hurrying the girls back to the kitchen, calling out things about hot coffee and bread, and Ian following her, Henri-Christian still wrapped lovingly about his ears, Germain yapping eagerly at his heels. And he knew that should it come to a fight, he had nothing left to fight with. Then the succulent sizzle and scent of eggs frying in butter reached him, and he was up and moving toward the back, like iron drawn by a magnet.</p><p>Over their hasty meal, various plans were offered and rejected. At length, he reluctantly accepted Fergus\u2019s suggestion that either Fergus or Ian should go openly to the palace, asking to see Claire, saying that he was a kinsman, wishing to assure himself of her welfare.</p><p>\u201cThey have no reason to deny her presence, after all,\u201d Fergus said, shrugging. \u201cIf we can see her, so much the better; but even if not, we will learn whether she is still there, and perhaps where she is likely to be within the palace.\u201d</p><p>Fergus clearly wished to undertake the errand, but yielded when Ian pointed out that Fergus was widely known in New Bern, and it might be suspected that he was merely hunting scandal for the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cFor I am pained to say, milord,\u201d Fergus said apologetically, \u201cthat the matter\u2014the crime\u2014is known here already. There are broadsheets . . . the usual nonsense. L\u2019Oignon was obliged to print something regarding the matter, of course, to keep our countenance, but we did so in a most repressive fashion, mentioning only the bald facts of the matter.\u201d His long, mobile mouth compressed briefly, in illustration of the repressive nature of his article, and Jamie smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see,\u201d he said. He pushed back from the table, pleased to feel some strength returned to his limbs, and heartened anew by food, coffee, and the comforting knowledge of Claire\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cWell, then, Ian, comb your hair. Ye dinna want the Governor to think ye a savage.\u201d</p><p>JAMIE INSISTED UPON going with Ian, despite the danger of being recognized. His nephew eyed him narrowly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re no going to do anything foolish, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time ye kent me to do anything foolish?\u201d</p><p>Ian gave him an old-fashioned look, held up one hand, and began to fold the fingers down, one by one.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, let me reckon, then . . . Simms the printer? Tarring Forbes? Roger Mac told me what ye did in Mecklenberg. And then there was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe would have let them kill wee Fogarty?\u201d Jamie inquired. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re mentioning fools, who was it got his arse pricked for wallowing in mortal sin with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is,\u201d Ian said severely, \u201cye\u2019re no going to walk into the Governor\u2019s Palace and try to take her by force, no matter what happens. Ye\u2019ll wait quietly wi\u2019 your hat on until I come back, and then we\u2019ll see, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie pulled down the brim of his hat, a floppy, weathered felt affair such as a pig farmer might wear, with his hair tucked up beneath it.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes ye think I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d he asked, as much from curiosity as natural contention.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face,\u201d Ian replied briefly. \u201cI want her back as much as you do, Uncle Jamie\u2014well,\u201d he amended, with a wry grin, \u201cperhaps not quite sae much\u2014but I mean to have her back, nonetheless. You\u201d\u2014he poked his uncle emphatically in the chest\u2014\u201cbide your time.\u201d</p><p>And leaving Jamie standing under a heat-stricken elm, he strode purposefully toward the gates of the palace.</p><p>Jamie took several deep breaths, trying to maintain a sense of annoyance with Ian as an antidote to the anxiety that wrapped itself round his chest like a snake. As the annoyance had been purely manufactured, it evaporated like steam from a kettle, leaving the anxiety squirming and writhing.</p><p>Ian had reached the gate, and was in palaver with the guard who stood there, musket at the ready. Jamie could see the man shaking his head emphatically.</p><p>This was nonsense, he thought. The need of her was a physical thing, like the thirst of a sailor becalmed for weeks on the sea. He\u2019d felt that need before, often, often, in their years apart. But why now? She was safe; he knew where she was\u2014was it only the exhaustion of the past weeks and days, or perhaps the weakness of creeping age that made his bones ache, as though she had in fact been torn from his body, as God had made Eve from Adam\u2019s rib?</p><p>Ian was arguing, making persuasive gestures toward the guard. The sound of wheels on gravel drew his attention from them; a carriage was coming down the drive, a small open conveyance with two people and a driver, drawn by a team of nice dark bays.</p><p>The guard had pushed Ian back with the barrel of his musket, gesturing him to keep away while the guard and his fellow opened the gates. The carriage rattled through without stopping, turned into the street, and came past him.</p><p>He had never seen Josiah Martin, but thought the plump, self-important-looking gentleman must surely be the\u2014 His eye caught the merest glimpse of the woman, and his heart clenched like a fist. Without an instant\u2019s thought, he was pelting after the carriage, as hard as he could run.</p><p>In his prime, he could not have outrun a team of horses. Even so, he came within a few feet of the carriage, would have called, but had no breath, no sight, and then his foot struck a misplaced cobble and he fell headlong.</p><p>He lay stunned and breathless, vision dark and his lungs afire, hearing only the receding clatter of hooves and carriage wheels, until a strong hand seized his arm and jerked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll avoid notice, he says,\u201d Ian muttered, bending to get his shoulder under Jamie\u2019s arm. \u201cYour hat\u2019s flown off, did ye notice that? Nay, of course not, nor the whole street staring, ye crack-brained gomerel. God, ye weigh as much as a three-year bullock!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d he said, and paused to gulp for breath.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe sound like your mother. Stop.\u201d Another gulp of air. \u201cAnd let go my arm; I can walk.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave a snort that sounded even more like Jenny, but did stop, and did let go. Jamie picked up his fallen hat and limped toward the printshop, Ian following in urgent silence through the staring streets.</p><p>SAFELY AWAY FROM the palace, we trotted sedately through the streets of New Bern, provoking only mild interest from the citizenry, some of whom waved, a few of whom called out vaguely hostile things, most of whom simply stared. At the edge of town, the groom turned the team onto the main road, and we bowled pleasantly along, apparently bound for an outing in the countryside, an illusion bolstered by the wicker picnic hamper visible behind us.</p><p>Once past the congestion of heavy wagons, cattle, sheep, and the other traffic of commerce, though, the groom whipped up, and we were flying again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I shouted over the noise of the team, holding on to my hat to prevent it blowing off. I had thought we were merely providing a diversion, so that no one would notice Mrs. Martin\u2019s quiet removal until she was safely out of the colony. Evidently, though, we were not merely out for a picnic.</p><p>\u201cBrunswick!\u201d the Governor shouted back.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrunswick,\u201d he repeated. He looked grim, and grimmer still as he cast a last look back toward New Bern. \u201cGod damn them,\u201d he said, though I was sure he meant this observation only for himself. He turned round then, and settled himself, leaning slightly forward, as though to speed the carriage, and said no more.</p><p>95</p><p>THE CRUIZER</p><p>I WOKE EVERY MORNING, just before dawn. Worn out from worry and the Governor\u2019s late hours, I slept like the dead, through all the thumps and rattlings and bell-ringings of the watch, shouts from boats nearby, occasional musket-fire from the shore, and the whine of the offshore wind as it passed through the rigging. But in that moment before the light, the silence woke me.</p><p>Today? was the single thought in my mind, and I seemed to hang bodiless for a moment, just above my pallet beneath the forecastle. Then I drew breath, heard my heart beating, and felt the gentle heave of the deck beneath me. Would turn my face to the shore, watching, as the light began to touch the waves and reach toward land. We had first gone to Fort Johnston, but had stayed there barely long enough for the Governor to meet with local Loyalists who had assured him how unsafe it was, before retreating further.</p><p>We had been aboard His Majesty\u2019s sloop Cruizer for nearly a week, anchored off Brunswick. Lacking any troops save the Marines aboard the sloop, Governor Martin was unable to seize back control of his colony, and was reduced to writing frenzied letters, attempting to keep up some semblance of a government in exile.</p><p>Lacking anyone else to fill the office, I remained in my role as ad hoc secretary, though I had moved up from mere copyist to amanuensis, taking down some letters by dictation when Martin grew too tired to write himself. And cut off from land and information alike, I spent every spare moment watching the shore.</p><p>Today, a boat was coming, out of the fading dark.</p><p>One of the watch hailed it, and an answering \u201challoo\u201d came up, in tones of such agitation that I sat up abruptly, groping for my stays.</p><p>Today, there would be news.</p><p>The messenger was already in the Governor\u2019s cabin, and one of the Marines barred my way\u2014but the door was open, and the man\u2019s voice clearly audible.</p><p>\u201cAshe\u2019s done it, sir, he\u2019s moving against the fort!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, God damn him for a treasonous dog!\u201d</p><p>There was a sound of footsteps, and the Marine stepped hastily out of the way, just in time to avoid the Governor, who came popping out of his cabin like a jack out of the box, still attired in a billowing nightshirt and minus his wig. He seized the ladder and scampered up it like a monkey, affording me an unwanted view from below of his chubby bare buttocks. The Marine caught my eye and quickly averted his own gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing? Do you see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d The messenger, a middle-aged man in the dress of a farmer, had followed the Governor up the ladder; their voices floated down from the rail.</p><p>\u201cColonel Ashe ordered all the ships in Wilmington Harbor to take on troops yesterday and float them down to Brunswick. They were mustering just outside the town this morning; I heard the roll calls whilst I was doing the morning milking\u2014nigh onto five hundred men, they must have. When I saw that, sir, I slipped away down to the shore and found a boat. Thought you ought to know, Your Excellence.\u201d The man\u2019s voice had lost its agitation now, and taken on a rather self-righteous tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes? And what do you expect me to do about it?\u201d The Governor sounded distinctly cranky.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d said the messenger, replying in like vein. \u201cI ain\u2019t the Governor, now, am I?\u201d</p><p>The Governor\u2019s response to this was drowned out by the striking of the ship\u2019s bell. As it died away, he strode past the companionway, and looking down, saw me below.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mrs. Fraser. Will you fetch me some tea from the galley?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t much choice, though I would have preferred to stay and eavesdrop. The galley fire had been banked for the night in its small iron pot, and the cook was still abed. By the time I had poked up the fire, boiled water, brewed a pot of tea, and assembled a tray with teapot, cup, saucer, milk, and toast, butter, biscuits, and jam, the Governor\u2019s informant had gone; I saw his boat heading for the shore, a dark arrowhead against the slowly brightening surface of the sea.</p><p>I paused for a moment on deck and rested my tea tray on the rail, looking inland. It was just light now, and Fort Johnston was visible, a blocky log building that stood exposed on top of a low rise, surrounded by a cluster of houses and outbuildings. There was a fair amount of activity around it; men were coming and going like a trail of ants. Nothing that looked like an imminent invasion, though. Either the commander, Captain Collet, had decided to evacuate\u2014or Ashe\u2019s men had not yet begun their march from Brunswick.</p><p>Had John Ashe received my message? If he had . . . would he have acted? It wouldn\u2019t have been a popular thing to do; I couldn\u2019t blame him if he had decided that he simply couldn\u2019t afford to be seen aiding a man widely suspected of being a Loyalist\u2014let alone one accused of such a hideous crime.</p><p>He might have, though. With the Governor marooned at sea, the Council disbanded, and the court system evaporated, there was no effective law in the colony now\u2014save for the militias. If Ashe chose to storm the Wilmington jail and remove Jamie, he would have faced precious little opposition.</p><p>And if he had . . . if Jamie were free, he would be looking for me. And surely he would hear quickly where I was. If John Ashe came to Brunswick and Jamie were free, he would surely come with Ashe\u2019s men. I looked toward shore, seeking movement, but saw only a boy driving a cow desultorily along the road to Brunswick. But the shadows of the night were still cold around my feet; it was barely dawn.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and noticed the aromatic scent of the tea, mixed with the shore\u2019s morning breath\u2014the smell of tide flats and piney scrub. I hadn\u2019t drunk tea in months, if not years. Thoughtfully, I poured a cup, and sipped it slowly, watching the shore.</p><p>WHEN I ARRIVED IN the surgeon\u2019s cabin, which the Governor had taken for his office, he was dressed, and alone.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser.\u201d He nodded briefly to me, scarcely looking up. \u201cI am obliged. Will you write, please?\u201d</p><p>He had been writing himself, already; quills and sand and blotter were scattered about the desk, and the inkwell stood open. I picked out a decent quill and a sheet of paper, and began to write as per his dictation, with a sense of growing curiosity.</p><p>The note\u2014dictated between bites of toast\u2014was to a General Hugh MacDonald, and referred to the General\u2019s safe arrival upon the mainland with a Colonel McLeod. Receipt of the General\u2019s report was acknowledged, and request made for continuing information. Mention was also made of the Governor\u2019s request for support\u2014which I knew about\u2014and assurances he had received regarding the arrival of that support, which I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cEnclosure, a letter of credit\u2014no, wait.\u201d The Governor darted a look in the direction of the shore\u2014to no particular avail, as the surgeon\u2019s cabin boasted no porthole\u2014and scowled in concentration. Evidently, it had occurred to him that in light of recent events, a letter of credit issued by the Governor\u2019s office was possibly worth less than one of Mrs. Ferguson\u2019s forgeries.</p><p>\u201cEnclosure, twenty shillings,\u201d he amended with a sigh. \u201cIf you will make the fair copy at once, Mrs. Fraser? These, you may do at your leisure.\u201d He pushed across an untidy stack of notes, done in his own crabbed hand.</p><p>He got up then, groaning as he stretched, and went up, no doubt to peer over the railing at the fort again.</p><p>I made the copy, sanded it, and set it aside, wondering who on earth this MacDonald was, and what he was doing? Unless Major MacDonald had undergone a change of name and an extraordinary promotion of late, it couldn\u2019t be he. And from the tone of the Governor\u2019s remarks, it appeared that General MacDonald and his friend McLeod were traveling alone\u2014and on some particular mission.</p><p>I flipped quickly through the waiting stack of notes, but saw nothing else of interest; just the usual administrative trivia. The Governor had left his writing desk on the table, but it was closed. I debated trying to pick the lock and rummage through his private correspondence, but there were too many people about: seamen, Marines, ship\u2019s boys, visitors\u2014the place was seething.</p><p>There was a sense of nervous tension aboard, as well. I\u2019d noticed many times before how a sense of danger communicates itself among people in a confined setting: hospital emergency room, surgical suite, train car, ship; urgency flashes from one person to the next without speech, like the impulse down a neuron\u2019s axon to the dendrites of another. I didn\u2019t know whether anyone beyond the Governor and myself knew about John Ashe\u2019s movements yet\u2014but the Cruizer knew that something was up.</p><p>The sense of nervous anticipation was affecting me, too. I was fidgeting, toe tapping absently, fingers moving restlessly up and down the shaft of the quill, unable to concentrate enough to write with it.</p><p>I stood up, with no idea what I meant to do; only the fixed notion that I would suffocate with impatience if I stayed below any longer.</p><p>On the shelf beside the door to the cabin stood the usual half-tidy clutter of shipboard, jammed behind a rail: a candlestick, extra candles, a tinderbox, a broken pipe, a bottle with a twist of flax stopping it, a bit of wood that someone had tried to carve and made a mess of. And a box.</p><p>The Cruizer had no surgeon aboard. And surgeons tended to take their personal implements with them, unless they died. This must be a kit belonging to the ship itself.</p><p>I glanced out the door; there were voices nearby, but no one in sight. I hastily flipped open the box, wrinkling my nose at the scent of dried blood and stale tobacco. There wasn\u2019t much there, and what there was was thrown in higgledy-piggledy, rusted, crusted, and of little use. A tin of Blue Pills, so labeled, and a bottle, not labeled, but recognizable, of black draught\u2014laudanum, that is. A dried-up sponge and a sticky cloth stained with something yellow. And the one thing certain to be in any surgeon\u2019s kit of the times\u2014blades.</p><p>There were footsteps coming down the companionway, and I heard the Governor\u2019s voice, talking to someone. Without pausing to consider the wisdom of my conduct, I grabbed a small jointing knife and thrust it down the front of my stays.</p><p>I slammed shut the lid of the box. There was no time to sit down again, though, before the Governor arrived, with another visitor in tow.</p><p>My heart was hammering in my throat. I pressed my palms, damp with sweat, against my skirt, and nodded to the new arrival, who was regarding me, open-mouthed, behind the Governor.</p><p>\u201cMajor MacDonald,\u201d I said, hoping that my voice wouldn\u2019t tremble. \u201cFancy meeting you here!\u201d</p><p>MACDONALD\u2019S MOUTH snapped shut and he drew himself more firmly upright.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, bowing warily. \u201cYour servant, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Governor Martin glanced from MacDonald to me and back, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d I said, nodding politely. It had occurred to me that it might not profit either of us for the Governor to think there was some connection between us\u2014if indeed there was one.</p><p>The same thought had clearly struck MacDonald; his face betrayed nothing beyond faint courtesy, though I could see the thoughts darting to and fro behind his eyes like a swarm of gnats. I was entertaining a similar swarm, myself\u2014and knowing that my own face was naturally revealing, I cast down my eyes demurely, and murmuring an excuse about refreshment, made off toward the galley.</p><p>I threaded my way through clumps of seamen and Marines, mechanically acknowledging their salutes, mind working furiously.</p><p>How? How was I going to speak to MacDonald alone? I had to find out what he knew about Jamie\u2014if anything. Would he tell me, if he did know anything? But yes, I thought, he would; soldier he might be, but MacDonald was also a confirmed gossip\u2014and he was plainly dying of curiosity at the sight of me.</p><p>The cook, a chubby young free black named Tinsdale, who wore his hair in three stubby braids that stuck out of his head like the horns of a triceratops, was at work in the galley, dreamily toasting bread over the fire.</p><p>\u201cOh, hullo,\u201d he said amiably, seeing me. He waved the toasting fork. \u201cWant a bit of toast, Mrs. Fraser? Or is it the hot water, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove some toast,\u201d I said, seized by inspiration. \u201cBut the Governor has company; he wants coffee sent. And if you have a few of those nice almond biscuits to go with it . . .\u201d</p><p>Armed with a loaded coffee tray, I made my way toward the surgeon\u2019s cabin a few minutes later, heart pounding. The door was open for air; evidently it wasn\u2019t a secret meeting.</p><p>They were huddled together over the small desk, the Governor frowning at a wad of papers, these clearly having traveled some distance in MacDonald\u2019s dispatch case, judging from the creases and stains upon them. They appeared to be letters, written in a variety of hands and inks.</p><p>\u201cOh, coffee,\u201d the Governor said, looking up. He seemed vaguely pleased, plainly not recalling that he hadn\u2019t ordered any. \u201cSplendid. Thank you, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald hastily picked up the papers, making room for me to set the tray down on the desk. The Governor had one in his hand; he kept hold of this, and I caught a quick glimpse of it as I bent to place the tray in front of him. It was a list of some sort\u2014names on one side, numbers beside them.</p><p>I managed to knock a spoon to the floor, enabling a better look as I stooped for it. H. Bethune, Cook\u2019s Creek, 14. Jno. McManus, Boone, 3. F. Campbell, Campbelton, 24?</p><p>I darted a look at MacDonald, who had his eyes fixed on me. I dropped the spoon on the desk, then took a hasty step back, so that I stood directly behind the Governor. I pointed a finger at MacDonald, then in rapid succession clutched my throat, tongue protruding, grabbed my stomach with crossed forearms, then jabbed the finger again at him, then at myself, all the while giving him a monitory stare.</p><p>MacDonald viewed this pantomime with subdued fascination, but\u2014with a veiled glance at the Governor, who was stirring his coffee with one hand, frowning at the paper he held in the other\u2014gave me a tiny nod.</p><p>\u201cHow many can you be quite sure of?\u201d the Governor was saying, as I curtsied and backed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, at least five hundred men, sir, even now,\u201d MacDonald replied confidently. \u201cA great many more to come, as word spreads. Ye should see the enthusiasm with which the General has been received so far! I cannot speak for the Germans, of course, but depend upon it, sir, we shall have all the Highlanders of the backcountry, and not a few of the Scotch\u2013Irish, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows I hope you are right,\u201d the Governor said, sounding hopeful, but still dubious. \u201cWhere is the General now?\u201d</p><p>I would have liked to hear the answer to that\u2014and a good many other things\u2014but the drum was beating overhead for mess, and thundering feet were already pounding down the decks and companionways. I couldn\u2019t lurk about eavesdropping in plain sight of the mess, so was obliged to go back up top, hoping that MacDonald had indeed got my message.</p><p>The captain of the Cruizer was standing by the rail, his first mate beside him, both scanning the shore with their telescopes.</p><p>\u201cIs anything happening?\u201d I could see more activity near the fort, people coming and going\u2014but the shore road was still empty.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say, ma\u2019am.\u201d Captain Follard shook his head, then lowered the telescope and shut it, reluctantly, as though afraid something might happen if he didn\u2019t keep his eyes fixed on the shore. The first mate didn\u2019t move, still squinting fixedly toward the fort on its bluff.</p><p>I remained there by his side, staring silently toward the shore. The tide shifted; I had been on the ship long enough to feel it, a barely perceptible pause, the sea taking breath as the invisible moon yielded its pull.</p><p>There is a tide in the affairs of men. . . . Surely Shakespeare had stood upon a deck, at least once, and felt that same faint shift, deep in the flesh. A professor had told me once, in medical school, that the Polynesian seafarers dared their vast journeys through the trackless sea because they had learned to sense the currents of the ocean, the shifts of wind and tide, registering these changes with that most delicate of instruments\u2014their testicles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t take a scrotum to feel the currents that were swirling round us now, I reflected, with a sideways glance at the first mate\u2019s securely fastened white breeches. I could feel them in the pit of my stomach, in the damp of my palms, in the tenseness of the muscles at the back of my neck. The mate had lowered his telescope, but still looked toward the shore, almost absently, his hands resting on the rail.</p><p>It occurred to me suddenly that if something drastic were to happen on land, the Cruizer would at once lift sail and head out to sea, carrying the Governor to safety\u2014and me farther from Jamie. Where on earth might we end up? Charlestown? Boston? Either was as likely. And no one on that seething shore would have any notion where we had gone.</p><p>I\u2019d met displaced persons during the war\u2014my war. Driven or taken from their homes, their families scattered, their cities destroyed, they thronged refugee camps, stood in lines besieging embassies and aid stations, asking, always asking for the names of the vanished, describing the faces of the loved and lost, grasping at any scrap of information that might lead them back to whatever might be left. Or, failing that, preserve for a moment longer what they had once been.</p><p>The day was warm, even on the water, and my clothes clung to me with humid damp, but my muscles convulsed and my hands on the rail shook with sudden chill.</p> <p>I might have seen them all for the last time, not knowing it: Jamie, Bree, Jemmy, Roger, Ian. That\u2019s how it happened: I had not even said goodbye to Frank, had had no faintest inkling when he left that last night that I would never see him alive again. What if\u2014</p><p>But no, I thought, steadying myself with a tighter grip on the wooden rail. We would find each other again. We had a place to return to. Home. And if I remained alive\u2014as I most firmly intended to do\u2014I would go back home.</p><p>The mate had shut his telescope and left; I hadn\u2019t noticed his departure, absorbed in morbid thoughts, and was quite startled when Major MacDonald hove to alongside me.</p><p>\u201cToo bad the Cruizer has nay long-range guns,\u201d he said with a nod at the fort. \u201c\u2019Twould put a crimp in the plans o\u2019 those wee heathen, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever those plans might be,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd speaking of plans\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a kind of a griping in the wame,\u201d he interrupted blandly. \u201cThe Governor suggested that ye might possibly have some sort of medicine to soothe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he indeed?\u201d I said. \u201cWell, come down to the galley; I\u2019ll brew you a cup of something that will set you right, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDID YE KEN, he thought ye were a forger?\u201d MacDonald, hands wrapped around a mug of tea, jerked his head in the direction of the main cabin. The Governor was nowhere in sight, and the cabin\u2019s door closed.</p><p>\u201cI did, yes. Does he know better now?\u201d I asked with a sense of resignation.</p><p>\u201cWell, aye.\u201d MacDonald looked apologetic. \u201cI supposed he knew already, or I wouldna have said. Though if I hadn\u2019t,\u201d he added, \u201che would have kent it sooner or later. The story\u2019s spread all the way to Edenton by now, and the broadsheets . . .\u201d</p><p>I flapped a hand, dismissing this.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not.\u201d He glanced at me, curiosity warring with wariness. \u201cI\u2019d heard . . . aye, well, I\u2019ve heard a great many things, and all different. But the meat of the matter is that ye\u2019ve both been arrested, aye? For the murder of Miss Christie.\u201d</p><p>I nodded briefly. I wondered whether one day I would grow used to that word. The sound of it was still like a punch in the stomach, short and brutal.</p><p>\u201cNeed I tell you that there is no truth to it?\u201d I said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cNot the slightest need, mum,\u201d he assured me, with a fair assumption of confidence. But I sensed the hesitation in him, and saw the sideways glance, curious and somehow avid. Perhaps one day I\u2019d get used to that, too.</p><p>My hands were cold; I wrapped them round my own mug, taking what comfort I could in its heat.</p><p>\u201cI need to get word to my husband,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>MacDonald\u2019s pale blue eyes were fixed on my face, his own showing no more now than courteous attention.</p> <p>\u201cNo, mum. But you do, I assume?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy,\u201d I advised him shortly. \u201cYou know as well as I do what\u2019s going on on shore\u2014probably much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoy.\u201d His thin lips pursed in brief amusement. \u201cI dinna believe anyone\u2019s called me that before. Aye, I know. And so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that he may be in Wilmington. I tried to send word to John Ashe, and asked him to get Jamie out of the gaol in Wilmington, if possible\u2014if he was there\u2014and to tell him where I was. But I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d I waved a hand in frustration toward the shore.</p><p>He nodded, native caution at odds with his obvious desire to ask me for the gory details of Malva\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI shall be going back through Wilmington. I\u2019ll make such inquiries as may be possible. If I find Mr. Fraser\u2014shall I tell him anything, beyond your present situation?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, thinking. I had been holding a constant conversation with Jamie, ever since they took him away from me. But none of what I said to him in the wide black nights or the lonely dawns seemed appropriate to confide to MacDonald. And yet . . . I couldn\u2019t forgo the opportunity; God knew when I might have another.</p><p>\u201cTell him that I love him,\u201d I said softly, my eyes on the tabletop. \u201cI always will.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald made a small sound that made me look up at him.</p><p>\u201cEven though he\u2014\u201d he began, then stopped himself.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cAnd neither did I. I told you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cNo one could imagine . . . I only meant . . . but of course, a man\u2019s but a man, and . . . mmphm.\u201d He broke off and looked away, the color high in his face.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do that, either,\u201d I said through my teeth.</p><p>There was a marked silence, during which we avoided each other\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cIs General MacDonald a kinsman of yours?\u201d I asked abruptly, needing either to change the course of the conversation or to leave.</p><p>The Major glanced up, surprised\u2014and relieved.</p><p>\u201cAye, a distant cousin. The Governor\u2019s mentioned him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. It was the truth, after all; Martin simply hadn\u2019t mentioned the General to me. \u201cYou\u2019re, um, assisting him, are you? It sounded as though you\u2019ve been having some success.\u201d</p><p>Relieved to have escaped the social awkwardness of dealing with the question as to whether I were a murderess, and Jamie only a philanderer, or he a murderer and I his scorned and deluded dupe, MacDonald was only too eager to take the offered bait.</p><p>\u201cGreat success, indeed,\u201d he said heartily. \u201cI\u2019ve gathered pledges from many of the most prominent men in the colony; they stand ready to do the Governor\u2019s bidding at the slightest word!\u201d</p><p>Jno. McManus, Boone, 3. Prominent men. I happened to know Jonathan McManus, whose gangrenous toes I had removed the winter before. He likely was the most prominent man in Boone, if by that, MacDonald meant that the other twenty inhabitants all knew him for a drunkard and a thief. It was also probably true that he had three men who would go to fight with him if called: his one-legged brother and his two feeble-minded sons. I took a sip of tea to hide my expression. Still, MacDonald had Farquard Campbell on his list; had Farquard really made a formal commitment?</p><p>\u201cI gather the General is not presently anywhere near Brunswick, though,\u201d I said, \u201cgiven the, er, present circumstances?\u201d If he was, the Governor would be much less nervous than he was.</p><p>MacDonald shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. But he is not ready to muster his forces yet; he and McLeod do but discover the readiness of the Highlanders to rise. They will not call muster until the ships come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShips?\u201d I blurted. \u201cWhat ships?\u201d</p><p>He knew he oughtn\u2019t to speak further, but couldn\u2019t resist. I saw it in his eyes; after all, what danger could there be in telling me?</p><p>\u201cThe Governor has asked for aid from the Crown in subduing the factionalism and unrest that runs rampant in the colony. And has received assurances that it will be forthcoming\u2014should he be able to raise enough support on the ground to reinforce the government troops who will arrive by ship.</p><p>\u201cThat is the plan, ye see,\u201d he went on, warming to it. \u201cWe are notified\u201d\u2014Oh, \u201cwe\u201d indeed, I thought\u2014\u201cthat my Lord Cornwallis begins to gather troops in Ireland, who will take ship shortly. They should arrive in the early autumn, and join wi\u2019 the General\u2019s militia. Between Cornwallis on the coast and the General comin\u2019 doon frae the hills\u2014\u201d He closed thumb and fingers in a pinching movement. \u201cThey\u2019ll crush the Whiggish whoresons like a pack o\u2019 lice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they?\u201d I said, endeavoring to sound impressed. Possibly they would; I had no idea, nor did I much care, being in no position to see far beyond the present moment. If I ever got off this frigging boat and out of the shadow of a noose, I\u2019d worry about it.</p><p>The sound of the main cabin\u2019s door opening made me look up. The Governor was closing it behind him. Turning, he saw us, and came to inquire as to MacDonald\u2019s presumed indisposition.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am a great deal better,\u201d the Major assured him, hand pressed to the waistcoat of his uniform. He belched in illustration. \u201cMrs. Fraser is a capital hand at such things. Capital!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Martin said. He seemed a trifle less harassed than he had earlier. \u201cYou will be wanting to go back, then.\u201d He signaled to the Marine standing at the foot of the companionway, who knuckled his forehead in acknowledgment and disappeared up the ladder.</p><p>\u201cThe boat will be ready for you in a few minutes\u2019 time.\u201d With a nod at MacDonald\u2019s half-drunk tea, and a punctilious bow to me, the Governor turned and went into the surgeon\u2019s cabin, where I could see him standing beside the desk, frowning at the heap of crumpled papers.</p><p>MacDonald hastily swallowed the rest of his tea, and with a lift of the eyebrows, invited me to accompany him to the upper deck. We were standing on deck, waiting as a local fishing boat made its way out to the Cruizer from shore, when he suddenly laid a hand on my arm.</p><p>This startled me; MacDonald was not a casual toucher.</p><p>\u201cI will do my utmost to discover your husband\u2019s whereabouts, mum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt occurs to me, though\u2014\u201d He hesitated, eyes on my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI said I had heard considerable speculation?\u201d he said delicately. \u201cRegarding . . . erm . . . the unfortunate demise of Miss Christie. Would it not be . . . desirable . . . that I know the truth of the matter, so that I might put any ill-natured rumors firmly to rest, should I encounter them?\u201d</p><p>I was torn between anger and laughter. I should have known that curiosity would be too much for him. But he was right; given the rumors I had heard\u2014and I knew they were but a fraction of those circulating\u2014the truth was certainly more desirable. On the other hand, I was entirely sure that the telling of the truth would do nothing to quell the rumors.</p><p>And still. The urge to be justified was a strong one; I understood those poor wretches who cried their innocence from the gallows\u2014and I bloody hoped I wasn\u2019t going to be one.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said crisply. The first mate was back by the rail, keeping an eye on the fort, and within earshot, but I supposed it didn\u2019t matter whether he heard.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is this: Malva Christie was got with child by someone, but rather than name the real father, insisted that it was my husband. I know this to be false,\u201d I added, fixing him with a gimlet stare. He nodded, mouth a little open.</p><p>\u201cA few days later, I went out to tend my garden and found the little\u2014Miss Christie lying in my lettuce patch with her throat freshly cut. I thought . . . there was some chance that I might save her unborn child. . . .\u201d Despite my assumption of bravado, my voice trembled a little. I stopped, clearing my throat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. The child was born dead.\u201d</p><p>Much better not to say how it was born; that weltering image of severed flesh and dirt-smeared blade was not one I wished the Major to have in mind, if it could be prevented. I had told no one\u2014not even Jamie\u2014about the faint flicker of life, that tingle that I still held secret in the palms of my hands. To say that the child had been born alive was to arouse immediate suspicion that I had killed it, and I knew as much. Some would think that anyway; Mrs. Martin plainly had.</p><p>MacDonald\u2019s hand was still resting on my arm, his gaze on my face. For once, I blessed the transparency of my countenance; no one watching my face ever doubted what I said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said quietly, and gently squeezed my arm.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and told him the rest\u2014circumstantial details might convince some hearers.</p><p>\u201cYou know that there were bee gums at the edge of my garden? The murderer kicked two of them over in fleeing; he must have been stung several times\u2014I was, when I came into the garden. Jamie\u2014Jamie had no stings. It wasn\u2019t him.\u201d And under the circumstances, I had not been able to find out which man\u2014or woman? For the first time, it occurred to me that it could have been a woman\u2014had been stung.</p><p>At this, he gave a deep \u201chum!\u201d of interest. He stood for a moment in contemplation, then shook his head, as though waking from a dream, and let go my arm.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, mum, for telling me,\u201d he said formally, and bowed to me. \u201cBe assured, I will speak in your behalf, whenever the occasion shall arise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Major.\u201d My voice was husky, and I swallowed. I hadn\u2019t realized how much it would hurt to speak of.</p><p>The wind stirred around us, and the reefed sails rustled in their ropes overhead. A shout from below announced the presence of the boat that would carry MacDonald back to the shore.</p><p>He bowed low over my hand, breath warm on my knuckles. For an instant, my fingers tightened on his; I was surprisingly reluctant to let him go. But let him go I did, and watched him all the way to the shore; a diminishing silhouette against the brightness of the water, back straight with resolution. He didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>The mate moved at the rail, sighing, and I glanced at him, then at the fort.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I asked. Some of the antlike forms seemed to be dropping lines from the walls to their fellows on the ground; I saw the ropes, fine as spiderwebs from this distance.</p><p>\u201cI do believe the fort\u2019s commander is preparing to remove the cannon, madam,\u201d he said, snapping shut his brass telescope with a click. \u201cIf you will excuse me, I need to go inform the captain.\u201d</p><p>96</p><p>GUNPOWDER, TREASON,</p><p>AND PLOT</p><p>IF THE GOVERNOR\u2019S ATTITUDE toward me was altered by the news that I was not in fact a forger but rather a notorious\u2014if merely accused\u2014murderess, I had no opportunity to find out. He, like the rest of the officers and half the men aboard, rushed to the rail, and the rest of the day passed in a flurry of observation, speculation, and largely fruitless activity.</p><p>The lookout at the masthead called down periodic observations\u2014men were leaving the fort, carrying things . . . the fort\u2019s weaponry, it looked like.</p><p>\u201cAre they Collet\u2019s men?\u201d the Governor bellowed, shading his eyes to look aloft.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say, sir,\u201d came the unhelpful reply from above.</p><p>At last, the Cruizer\u2019s two launches were sent ashore, with orders to collect what information they could. They came back several hours later, with the news that Collet had abandoned the fort, in the face of threats, but had taken pains to remove the guns and powder, lest these fall into rebel hands.</p><p>No, sir, they had not spoken with Colonel Collet, who was\u2014by rumor\u2014on his way upriver with his militia forces. They had sent two men down the road toward Wilmington; it was true that a large force was gathering in the fields outside the town, under Colonels Robert Howe and John Ashe, but no word of what was planned.</p><p>\u201cNo word of what\u2019s planned, God\u2019s ballocks!\u201d muttered the Governor, having been ceremoniously informed of this by Captain Follard. \u201cThey mean to burn the fort, what else would Ashe be planning, for the love of Jesus?\u201d</p><p>His instincts were quite sound; just before sunset, the scent of smoke came across the water, and we could just make out the antlike scurrying of men, piling heaps of flammable debris around the base of the fort. It was a simple, square building, made of logs. And despite the dampness of the humid air, it would burn, eventually.</p><p>It took them no little time to get the fire going, though, with neither powder nor oil to hasten its burning; as night fell, we could clearly see flaming torches, streaming in the breeze as they were carried to and fro, passed from hand to hand, dipping to touch off a pile of kindling, coming back a few minutes later, as the kindling went out.</p><p>Around nine o\u2019clock, someone found a few barrels of turpentine, and the blaze took a sudden, lethal hold of the fort\u2019s log walls. Sheets of wavering flame rose pure and brilliant, orange and crimson billows against the night-black sky, and we heard scraps of cheering and snatches of ribald song, borne with the smell of smoke and the tang of turpentine on the offshore breeze.</p><p>\u201cAt least we needn\u2019t worry about the mosquitoes,\u201d I observed, waving a cloud of whitish smoke away from my face.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d said the Governor. \u201cI had not considered that particular positive aspect of the matter.\u201d He spoke with some bitterness, his fists resting impotently on the rail.</p><p>I took the hint, and said no more. For myself, the leaping flames and the column of smoke that rose wavering toward the stars were cause for celebration. Not for any benefit that the burning of Fort Johnston might be to the rebel cause\u2014but because Jamie might be there, by one of the campfires that had sprung up on the shore below the fort.</p><p>And if he was . . . he would come tomorrow.</p><p>HE DID. I was awake well before dawn\u2014in fact, I had not slept\u2014and standing at the rail. There was little of the usual boat traffic this morning, in the wake of the fort\u2019s burning; the bitter smell of wood ash mingled with the marshy smell of the nearby mud flats, and the water was still and oily-looking. It was a gray day, heavily overcast, and a deep bank of haze hung over the water, hiding the shore.</p><p>I kept watching, though, and when a small boat came out of the haze, I knew at once that it was Jamie. He was alone.</p><p>I watched the long, smooth reach of his arms and the pull of the oars, and felt a sudden deep, calm happiness. I had no notion what might happen\u2014and all the horror and anger connected with Malva\u2019s death still lurked at the back of my mind, a great dark shape under very thin ice. But he was there. Near enough now to see his face, as he looked back over his shoulder toward the ship.</p><p>I lifted a hand to wave; his eyes were already fixed on me. He didn\u2019t stop rowing, but turned round and came on. I stood clinging to the rail, waiting.</p><p>The rowboat passed out of sight for a moment, under the lee of the Cruizer, and I heard the watch hail him, the deep half-audible answer, and felt something that had been knotted inside me for a long time let go at the sound of his voice.</p><p>I stood rooted, though, not able to move. Then there were footsteps on deck, and a murmur of voices\u2014someone going to fetch the Governor\u2014and I turned blindly, into Jamie\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d come,\u201d I whispered into the linen of his shirt. He reeked of fire: smoke and pinesap and scorched cloth, and the bitter tang of turpentine. Reeked of stale sweat and horses, the weariness of a man who has not slept, who has labored all night, the faint yeasty smell of long hunger.</p><p>He held me close, ribs and breath and warmth and muscle, then put me away from him a little and looked down into my face. He had been smiling since I saw him. It lit his eyes, and without a word, he pulled the cap off my head and threw it over the rail. He ran his hands through my hair, fluffing it out into abandon, then cupped my head in his hands and kissed me, fingers digging into my scalp. He had a three-day beard, which rasped my skin like sandpaper, and his mouth was home and safety.</p><p>Somewhere behind him, one of the Marines coughed, and said loudly, \u201cYou wished to see the Governor, I believe, sir?\u201d</p><p>He let go, slowly, and turned.</p><p>\u201cI do indeed,\u201d he said, and put out a hand to me. \u201cSassenach?\u201d</p><p>I took it, and followed the Marine, heading for the companionway. I glanced back over the rail, to see my cap bobbing in the swell, puffed with air and tranquil as a jellyfish.</p><p>The momentary illusion of peace vanished directly, though, once we were below.</p><p>The Governor had been up most of the night, as well, and didn\u2019t look much better than Jamie, though he was not, of course, besmeared with soot. He was, however, unshaven, bloodshot, and in no mood to be trifled with.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said with a short nod. \u201cYou are James Fraser, I collect? And you dwell in the mountain backcountry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the Fraser, of Fraser\u2019s Ridge,\u201d Jamie said courteously. \u201cAnd I have come for my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have you.\u201d The Governor gave him a sour look and sat down, gesturing indifferently at a stool. \u201cI regret to inform you, sir, that your wife is a prisoner of the Crown. Though perhaps you were aware of this?\u201d</p><p>Jamie ignored this bit of sarcasm and took the proffered seat.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, she is not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true, is it not, that you have declared martial law upon the colony of North Carolina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Martin said shortly. This was rather a sore point, since while he had declared martial law, he was in no position actually to enforce it, but was obliged to float impotently offshore, fuming, until and unless England chose to send him reinforcements.</p><p>\u201cThen in fact, all customary legal usage is suspended,\u201d Jamie pointed out. \u201cYou alone have control over the custody and disposition of any prisoners\u2014and my wife has in fact been in your custody for some little time. Ye therefore have also the power to release her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d said the Governor. Plainly he hadn\u2019t thought of that, and wasn\u2019t sure of its ramifications. At the same time, the notion that he was in control of anything at all at the moment was likely soothing to his inflamed spirits.</p><p>\u201cShe has not been committed for trial, and in fact, there has been no evidence whatever adduced against her,\u201d Jamie said firmly.</p><p>I found myself uttering a silent prayer of thanks that I had told MacDonald the gory details after his visit with the Governor\u2014it might not be what a modern court called evidence, but being found with a knife in my hand and two warm, bloody corpses was very damned circumstantial.</p><p>\u201cShe is accused, but there is no merit to the charge. Surely, having had her acquaintance for even so short a time as you have, ye will have drawn your own conclusions as to her character?\u201d Not waiting for an answer to this, he pressed on.</p><p>\u201cWhen accusation was made, we did not resist the attempt to bring my wife\u2014or myself, for I also have been accused in the matter\u2014to trial. What better indication is there that we should hold such conviction of her innocence as to wish for a speedy trial to establish it?\u201d</p><p>The Governor had narrowed his eyes, and appeared to be thinking intently.</p><p>\u201cYour arguments are not entirely lacking in virtue, sir,\u201d he said at last, with formal courtesy. \u201cHowever, I understand that the crime of which your wife stands accused was a most heinous one. For me to release her must necessarily cause public outcry\u2014and I have had rather enough of public unrest,\u201d he added, with a bleak look at the scorched cuffs of Jamie\u2019s coat.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath and had another go.</p><p>\u201cI quite understand Your Excellency\u2019s reservations,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps some . . . surety might be offered, which would overcome them?\u201d</p><p>Martin sat bolt upright in his chair, receding jaw thrust out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest, sir? Have you the impertinence, the\u2014the\u2014unspeakable bloody face to try to bribe me?\u201d He slapped both hands down on the desk and glared from Jamie to me and back. \u201cGod damn it, I should hang the two of you, out of hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice, Mr. Ohnat,\u201d I muttered to Jamie under my breath. \u201cAt least we\u2019re already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ah,\u201d he replied, giving me a brief glance of incomprehension before returning his attention to the Governor, who was muttering \u201cSwing them from the bloody yardarm . . . the infernal cheek of it, the creatures!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no such intent, sir.\u201d Jamie kept his voice level, his eyes direct. \u201cWhat I offer is a bond, against my wife\u2019s appearance in court to answer the charge against her. When she does so appear, it would be returned to me.\u201d</p><p>Before the Governor could respond to this, he reached into his pocket and withdrew something small and dark, which he set on the desk. The black diamond.</p><p>The sight of it stopped Martin in mid-sentence. He blinked, once, his long-nosed face going almost comically blank. He rubbed a finger slowly across his upper lip, considering.</p><p>Having seen a great deal of the Governor\u2019s private correspondence and accounts by now, I was well aware that he had few private means, and was obliged to live far beyond his modest income in order to maintain the appearances necessary for a Royal Governor.</p><p>The Governor in turn was well aware that in the current state of unrest, there was little chance of my being brought to trial in any sort of timely manner. It could be months\u2014and possibly years\u2014before the court system was restored to anything like routine function. And for however long it took, he would have the diamond. He couldn\u2019t in honor simply sell the thing\u2014but could most assuredly borrow a substantial sum against it, in the reasonable expectation that he might redeem it later.</p><p>I saw his eyes flicker toward the sooty marks on Jamie\u2019s coat, narrowing in speculation. There was also a good possibility of Jamie\u2019s being killed or arrested for treason\u2014and I saw the impulse to do just that pop momentarily into his mind\u2014which would leave the diamond perhaps in legal limbo, but certainly in Martin\u2019s possession. I had to force myself to keep on breathing.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t stupid, Martin\u2014nor was he venal. With a small sigh, he pushed the stone back toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said, though his voice had now lost its earlier outrage. \u201cI will not accept this as bond for your wife. But the notion of surety . . .\u201d His gaze went to the stack of papers on his desk, and returned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI will make you a proposition, sir,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI have an action in train, an operation by which I hope to raise a considerable body of the Scottish Highlanders, who will march from the backcountry to the coast, there to meet with troops sent from England, and in the process, to subdue the countryside on behalf of the King.\u201d</p><p>He paused for breath, eyeing Jamie closely to assess the effect of his speech. I was standing close behind Jamie, and couldn\u2019t see his face, but didn\u2019t need to. Bree, joking, called it his \u201cbrag face\u201d; no one looking at him would ever know whether he held four aces, a full house, or a pair of threes. I was betting on the pair of threes, myself\u2014but Martin didn\u2019t know him nearly as well as I did.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Hugh MacDonald and a Colonel Donald McLeod came into the colony some time ago, and have been traversing the countryside, rallying support\u2014which they have gained in gratifying numbers, I am pleased to say.\u201d His fingers drummed briefly on the letters, then stopped abruptly as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat I propose, then, sir, is this: you will return to the backcountry, and gather such men as you can. You will then report to General MacDonald and commit your troops to his campaign. When I receive word from MacDonald that you have arrived\u2014with, let us say, two hundred men\u2014then, sir, I will release your wife to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My pulse was beating fast, and so was Major\u2019s; I could see it throbbing in his neck. Definitely a pair of threes. Obviously, MacDonald hadn\u2019t had time to tell the Governor\u2014or hadn\u2019t known\u2014just how widespread and acrimonious the response had been to Malva Christie\u2019s death. There were still men on the Ridge who would follow Jamie, I was sure\u2014but many more who would not, or who would, but only if he repudiated me.</p><p>I was trying to think logically about the situation, as a means of distracting myself from the crushing disappointment of realizing that the Governor was not going to let me go. Jamie must go without me, leave me here. For an overwhelming instant, I thought I could not bear it; I would run mad, scream and leap across the desk to claw Josiah Martin\u2019s eyes out.</p><p>He glanced up, caught a glimpse of my face, and started back, half-rising from his chair.</p><p>Jamie put back a hand and gripped my forearm, hard.</p> <p>\u201cBe still, a nighean,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I had been holding my breath without realizing it. Now I let it out in a gasp, and made myself breathe slowly.</p><p>Just as slowly, the Governor\u2014a wary gaze still fixed on me\u2014lowered himself back into his seat. Clearly, the accusation against me had just become a lot more likely, in his mind. Fine, I thought fiercely, to keep from crying. See how easily you sleep, with me never more than a few feet away from you.</p><p>Jamie drew a long, deep breath, and his shoulders squared beneath his tattered coat.</p><p>\u201cYou will give me leave, sir, to consider your proposal,\u201d he said formally, and letting go of my arm, rose to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cDo not despair, mo chridhe,\u201d he said to me in Gaelic. \u201cI will see you when the morning comes.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it, then, with the barest of nods to the Governor, strode out, without looking back.</p><p>There was an instant\u2019s silence in the cabin, and I heard his feet going away, climbing the ladder of the companionway. I didn\u2019t pause to consider, but reached down into my stays and withdrew the small knife I had taken from the surgeon\u2019s kit.</p><p>I jabbed it down with all my strength, so that it stuck in the wood of the desk and stood there, quivering before the Governor\u2019s astonished eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou f**king bastard,\u201d I said evenly, and left.</p><p>97</p> <p>FOR THE SAKE OF</p><p>ONE WHO IS</p><p>I WAS WAITING AT THE RAIL again before dawn the next day. The smell of ashes was strong and acrid on the wind, but the smoke had gone. An early-morning haze still shrouded the shore, though, and I felt a small thrill of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, mingled with hope, as I saw the small boat come out of the mist, pulling slowly toward the ship.</p><p>As it grew closer, though, my hands tightened on the rail. It wasn\u2019t Jamie. For a few moments, I tried to convince myself that it was, that he had merely changed his coat\u2014but with each stroke of the oars, it became more certain. I closed my eyes, stinging with tears, all the while telling myself that it was absurd to be so upset; it meant nothing.</p><p>Jamie would be here; he\u2019d said so. The fact that someone else was coming early to the ship had nothing to do with him or me.</p><p>It did, though. Opening my eyes and wiping them on my wrist, I looked again at the rowboat, and felt a start of disbelief. It couldn\u2019t be. It was, though. He looked up at the watch\u2019s hail, and saw me at the rail. Our eyes met for an instant, then he bowed his head, reaching to the oars. Tom Christie.</p><p>The Governor was not amused at being roused from his bed at dawn for the third day running; I could hear him below, ordering one of the Marines to tell the fellow, whoever he was, to wait to a more reasonable hour\u2014this followed by a peremptory slam of the cabin door.</p><p>I was not amused, either, and in no mood to wait. The Marine at the head of the companionway refused to allow me below, though. Heart pounding, then, I turned and made my way to the stern, where they had put Christie to wait the Governor\u2019s pleasure.</p> <p>The Marine there hesitated, but after all, there were no orders to prevent me speaking with visitors; he let me pass.</p><p>\u201cMr. Christie.\u201d He was standing at the rail, staring back at the coast, but turned at my words.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser.\u201d He was very pale; his grizzled beard stood out nearly black. He had trimmed it, though, and his hair, as well. While he still looked like a lightning-blasted tree, there was life in his eyes once more when he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2014\u201d I began, but he cut me off.</p><p>\u201cHe is well. He awaits you on the shore; you will see him presently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The boil of fear and fury inside me reduced itself slightly, as though someone had turned down the flame, but a sense of impatience was still steaming. \u201cWell, what in bloody hell is going on, will you tell me that?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a long moment in silence, then licked his lips briefly, and turned to look over the rail at the smooth gray swell. He glanced back at me and drew a deep breath, obviously bracing himself for something.</p><p>\u201cI have come to confess to the murder of my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I simply stared at him, unable to make sense of his words. Then I assembled them into a sentence, read it from the tablet of my mind, and finally grasped it.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>The faintest shadow of a smile seemed to stir in his beard, though it vanished almost before I had seen it.</p><p>\u201cYou remain contrary, I see,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNever mind what I remain,\u201d I said, rather rudely. \u201cAre you insane? Or is this Jamie\u2019s latest plan? Because if so\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped me with a hand on my wrist; I started at the touch, not expecting it.</p><p>\u201cIt is the truth,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cAnd I will swear to it by the Holy Scriptures.\u201d</p><p>I stood looking at him, not moving. He looked back, directly, and I realized suddenly how seldom he had ever met my eyes; all through our acquaintance, he had glanced away, avoided my gaze, as though he sought to escape any real acknowledgment of me, even when obliged to speak to me.</p><p>Now that was gone, and the look in his eyes was nothing I had ever seen before. The lines of pain and suffering cut deep around them, and the lids were heavy with sorrow\u2014but the eyes themselves were deep and calm as the sea beneath us. That sense he had carried through our nightmare journey south, that atmosphere of mute horror, numb pain, had left him, replaced by resolve and something else\u2014something that burned, far down in his depths.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said at last, and he let go his grip on my wrist, stepping back a pace.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye remember once\u201d\u2014from the reminiscent tone of his voice, it might have been decades before\u2014\u201cye asked me, did I think ye a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I replied guardedly. \u201cYou said\u2014\u201d Now I remembered that conversation, all right, and something small and icy fluttered at the base of my spine. \u201cYou said that you believed in witches, all right\u2014but you didn\u2019t think I was one.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, dark gray eyes fixed on me. I wondered whether he was about to revise that opinion, but apparently not.</p><p>\u201cI believe in witches,\u201d he said with complete matter-of-fact seriousness. \u201cFor I\u2019ve kent them. The girl was one, as was her mother before her.\u201d The icy flutter grew stronger.</p><p>\u201cThe girl,\u201d I said. \u201cYou mean your daughter? Malva?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head a little, and his eyes took on a darker hue. \u201cNo daughter of mine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot\u2014not yours? But\u2014her eyes. She had your eyes.\u201d I heard myself say it, and could have bitten my tongue. He only smiled, though, grimly.</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother\u2019s.\u201d He turned to the rail, put his hands on it, and looked across the stretch of sea, toward land. \u201cEdgar was his name. When the Rising came, and I declared for the Stuarts, he would have none of it, saying \u2019twas folly. He begged me not to go.\u201d He shook his head slowly, seeing something in memory, that I knew was not the wooded shore.</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014well, it doesna matter what I thought, but I went. And asked him, would he mind my wife, and the wee lad.\u201d He drew a deep breath, let it slowly out. \u201cAnd he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said very quietly. He turned his head sharply at the tone of my voice, gray eyes piercing.</p><p>\u201cIt was not his fault! Mona was a witch\u2014an enchantress.\u201d His lips compressed at the expression on my face. \u201cYe don\u2019t believe me, I see. It is the truth; more than once, I caught her at it\u2014working her charms, observing times\u2014I came once to the roof o\u2019 the house at midnight, searching for her. I saw her there, stark nak*d and staring at the stars, standing in the center of a pentacle she\u2019d drawn wi\u2019 the blood of a strangled dove, and her hair flying loose, mad in the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair,\u201d I said, looking for some thread to grasp in this, and suddenly realizing. \u201cShe had hair like mine, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking away, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cShe was . . . what she was,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI tried to save her\u2014by prayer, by love. I could not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice as low as his. With the wind as it was, there was little chance of our being overheard here, but this was not the sort of thing I thought anyone should hear.</p><p>He sighed, and swallowed again.</p><p>\u201cShe was hangit,\u201d he said, sounding almost matter-of-fact about it. \u201cFor the murder of my brother.\u201d</p><p>This, it seemed, had happened while Tom was imprisoned at Ardsmuir; she had sent him word, before her execution, telling him of Malva\u2019s birth, and that she was confiding care of the children to Edgar\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cI suppose she thought that funny,\u201d he said, sounding abstracted. \u201cShe\u2019d the oddest sense of humor, Mona had.\u201d</p><p>I felt cold, beyond the chill of the early-morning breeze, and hugged my elbows.</p><p>\u201cBut you got them back\u2014Allan and Malva.\u201d</p><p>He nodded; he had been transported, but had the good fortune to have his indenture bought by a kind and wealthy man, who had given him the money for the children\u2019s passage to the Colonies. But then both his employer and the wife he had taken here had died in an epidemic of the yellow fever, and casting about for some new opportunity, he had heard of Jamie Fraser\u2019s settling in North Carolina and that he would help those men he had known in Ardsmuir to land of their own.</p><p>\u201cI would to God I had cut my own throat before I came,\u201d he said, turning back abruptly to me. \u201cBelieve me in that.\u201d</p><p>He seemed entirely sincere. I didn\u2019t know what to say in response, but he seemed to require none, and went on.</p><p>\u201cThe girl . . . she was nay more than five years old when I first saw her, but already she had it\u2014the same slyness, the charm\u2014the same darkness of soul.\u201d</p><p>He had tried to the best of his ability to save Malva, as well\u2014to beat the wickedness out of her, to constrain the streak of wildness, above all, to keep her from working her wiles upon men.</p><p>\u201cHer mither had that, too.\u201d His lips tightened at the thought. \u201cAny man. It was the curse of Lilith that they had, the both of them.\u201d</p><p>I felt a hollowness in the pit of my stomach, as he came back now to the matter of Malva.</p><p>\u201cBut she was with child . . .\u201d I said.</p><p>His face paled further, but his voice was firm.</p><p>\u201cAye, she was. I do not think it wrong to prevent yet another witch from entering the world.\u201d</p><p>Seeing my face, he went on before I could interrupt.</p><p>\u201cYe ken she tried to kill ye? You and me, both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Tried to kill me, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen ye told her about the invisible things, the\u2014the germs. She took great interest in that. She told me, when I caught her wi\u2019 the bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bones?\u201d I asked, a sliver of ice running down my back.</p><p>\u201cThe bones she took from Ephraim\u2019s grave, to work her charms upon your husband. She didna use them all, and I found them in her workbasket later. I beat her, badly, and she told me then.\u201d</p><p>Accustomed to wander alone in the woods in search of food plants and herbs, she had been doing so during the height of the dysentery epidemic. And in her wanderings, had come upon the isolated cabin of the sin-eater, that strange, damaged man. She had found him near death, burning with fever and sunk in coma, and while she stood there undecided whether to run for help, or only run, he had in fact died.</p><p>Whereupon, seized by inspiration\u2014and bearing my careful teachings in mind\u2014she had taken mucus and blood from the body and put it into a little bottle with a bit of broth from the kettle on the hearth, nurturing it inside her stays with the warmth of her own body.</p><p>And had slipped a few drops of this deadly infusion into my food, and that of her father, in the hope that if we fell sick, our deaths would be seen as no more than a part of the sickness that plagued the Ridge.</p><p>My lips felt stiff and bloodless.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of this?\u201d I whispered. He nodded, making no effort to convince me, and that alone gave me conviction that he spoke the truth.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted\u2014Jamie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment; the sun was coming up, and while the brilliance of it was behind us, the gleam off the water was bright as silver plate.</p><p>\u201cShe . . . wanted,\u201d he said at last. \u201cShe lusted. Lusted for wealth, for position, for what she saw as freedom, not seeing it as license\u2014never seeing!\u201d He spoke with sudden violence, and I thought it was not Malva alone who had never seen things as he did.</p><p>But she had wanted Jamie, whether for himself or only for his property. And when her love charm failed, and the epidemic of sickness came, had taken a more direct way toward what she wanted. I could not yet find a way to grasp that\u2014and yet I knew it was true.</p><p>And then, finding herself inconveniently with child, she had come up with a new scheme.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who the father really was?\u201d I asked, my throat tightening again\u2014I thought it always would\u2014at the memory of the sunlit garden and the two neat, small bodies, ruined and wasted. Such a waste.</p><p>He shook his head, but would not look at me, and I knew that he had some idea, at least. He would not tell me, though, and I supposed it didn\u2019t matter just now. And the Governor would be up soon, ready to receive him.</p><p>He, too, heard the stirrings down below, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI could not let her destroy so many lives; could not let her go on. For she was a witch, make no mistake; that she failed to kill either you or me was no more than luck. She would have killed someone, before she finished. Perhaps you, if your husband clung to you. Perhaps him, in the hope of inheriting his property for the child.\u201d He took a ragged, painful breath.</p><p>\u201cShe was not born of my loins, and yet\u2014she was my daughter, my blood. I could not . . . could not allow . . . I was responsible.\u201d He stopped, unable to finish. In this, I thought, he told the truth. And yet . . .</p><p>\u201cThomas,\u201d I said firmly, \u201cthis is twaddle, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, surprised, and I saw that tears stood in his eyes. He blinked them back and answered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cSay you so? You know nothing, nothing!\u201d</p><p>He saw me flinch, and looked down. Then, awkwardly, he reached out and took my hand. I felt the scars of the surgery I had done, the flexible strength of his gripping fingers.</p><p>\u201cI have waited all my life, in a search . . .\u201d He waved his free hand vaguely, then closed his fingers, as though grasping the thought, and continued more surely, \u201cNo. In hope. In hope of a thing I could not name, but that I knew must exist.\u201d</p><p>His eyes searched my face, intent, as though he memorized my features. I raised a hand, uncomfortable under this scrutiny, intending, I suppose, to tidy my mad hair\u2014but he caught my hand and held it, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Standing with both hands in his, I had no choice.</p><p>\u201cThomas,\u201d I said, uncertain. \u201cMr. Christie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI became convinced that it was God I sought. Perhaps it was. But God is not flesh and blood, and the love of God alone could not sustain me.</p><p>\u201cI have written down my confession.\u201d He let go, and poked a hand into his pocket, fumbling a little, and pulled out a folded paper, which he clutched in his short, solid fingers.</p><p>\u201cI have sworn here that it was I who killed my daughter, for the shame she had brought upon me by her wantonness.\u201d He spoke firmly enough, but I could see the working of his throat above the wilted stock.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said positively. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, gazing at me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, quite matter-of-fact. \u201cBut perhaps I should have.</p><p>\u201cI have written a copy of this confession,\u201d he said, tucking the document back into his coat, \u201cand have left it with the newspaper in New Bern. They will publish it. The Governor will accept it\u2014how can he not?\u2014and you will go free.\u201d</p><p>Those last four words struck me dumb. He was still gripping my right hand; his thumb stroked gently over my knuckles. I wanted to pull away, but forced myself to keep still, compelled by the look in his eyes, clear gray and nak*d now, without disguise.</p><p>\u201cI have yearned always,\u201d he said softly, \u201cfor love given and returned; have spent my life in the attempt to give my love to those who were not worthy of it. Allow me this: to give my life for the sake of one who is.\u201d</p><p>I felt as though someone had knocked the wind from me. I hadn\u2019t any breath, but struggled to form words.</p><p>\u201cMr. Chr\u2014Tom,\u201d I said. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t. Your life has\u2014has value. You can\u2019t throw it away like this!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, patient.</p><p>\u201cI know that. If it did not, this would not matter.\u201d</p><p>Feet were coming up the companionway, and I heard the Governor\u2019s voice below, in cheerful conversation with the Captain of Marines.</p><p>\u201cThomas! Don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>He only looked at me, and smiled\u2014had I ever seen him smile?\u2014but did not speak. He raised my hand and bent over it; I felt the prickle of his beard and the warmth of his breath, the softness of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI am your servant, madam,\u201d he said very softly. He squeezed my hand and released it, then turned and glanced toward the shore. A small boat was coming, dark against the glitter of the silver sea. \u201cYour husband is coming for you. Adieu, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away, back steady in spite of the swell that rose and fell beneath us.</p><p>PART ELEVEN</p><p>In the Day of Vengeance</p><p>98</p><p>TO KEEP A GHOST AT BAY</p><p>JAMIE GROANED, STRETCHED, and sat down heavily on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though someone\u2019s stepped on my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I opened one eye to look at him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a bloodshot look.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, but it feels as though it was someone heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d I said, yawning. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got to leave right away; you can rest a bit more.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, I want to be home. We\u2019ve been gone too long as it is.\u201d Nonetheless, he didn\u2019t get up and finish dressing, but continued to sit on the swaybacked inn bed in his shirt, big hands hanging idle between his thighs.</p><p>He looked tired to death, in spite of just having risen, and no wonder. I didn\u2019t think he could have slept at all for several days, what with his search for me, the burning of Fort Johnston, and the events attending my release from the Cruizer. Remembering, I felt a pall settle over my own spirits, in spite of the joy in which I had wakened, realizing that I was free, on land, and with Jamie.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d I repeated. I rolled toward him, and put a hand on his back. \u201cIt\u2019s barely dawn. At least wait for breakfast; you can\u2019t travel without rest or food.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the window, still shuttered; the cracks had begun to pale with the growing light, but I was right; there was no sound below of fires being stoked or pots banged in preparation. Capitulating suddenly, he collapsed slowly sideways, unable to repress a sigh as his head settled back on the pillow.</p><p>He didn\u2019t protest when I flung the ratty quilt over him, nor yet when I curved my body to fit round him, wrapping an arm about his waist and laying my cheek against his back. He still smelled of smoke, though both of us had washed hastily the night before, before falling into bed and a dearly bought oblivion.</p><p>I could feel how tired he was. My own joints still ached with fatigue\u2014and from the lumps in the flattened, wool-stuffed mattress. Ian had been waiting with horses when we came ashore, and we had ridden as far as we could before darkness fell, finally fetching up at a ramshackle inn in the middle of nowhere, a crude roadside accommodation for wagoneers on their way to the coast.</p><p>\u201cMalcolm,\u201d he\u2019d said, with the slightest of hesitations, when the innkeeper had asked his name. \u201cAlexander Malcolm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Murray,\u201d Ian had said, yawning and scratching his ribs. \u201cJohn Murray.\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper had nodded, not particularly caring. There was no reason why he should associate three nondescript, bedraggled travelers with a notorious case of murder\u2014and yet I had felt panic well up under my diaphragm when he glanced at me.</p><p>I had sensed Jamie\u2019s hesitation in giving the name, his distaste for reassuming one of the many aliases he had once lived under. More than most men, he valued his name\u2014I only hoped that given time, it would once more have value.</p><p>Roger might help. He would be a full-fledged minister by now, I thought, smiling at the thought. He had a true gift for soothing the divisions among the inhabitants of the Ridge, easing acrimony\u2014and having the additional authority of being an ordained minister, his influence would be increased.</p><p>It would be good to have him back. And to see Bree and Jemmy again\u2014I had a moment\u2019s longing for them, though we would see them soon; we meant to go through Cross Creek and collect them on the way. But of course, neither Bree nor Roger had any notion what had happened in the last three weeks\u2014nor what life might now be like, in the wake of it.</p><p>The birds were in full voice in the trees outside; after the constant screeching of gulls and terns that formed the background of life on the Cruizer, the sound of them was tender, a homely conversation that made me long suddenly for the Ridge. I understood Jamie\u2019s strong urge to be home\u2014even knowing that what we would find there was not the same life we had left. The Christies would be gone, for one thing.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had the chance to ask Jamie about the circumstances of my rescue; I had finally been put ashore just before sunset, and we had ridden off at once, Jamie wanting to put as much distance as possible between me and Governor Martin\u2014and, perhaps, Tom Christie.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said softly, my breath warm in the folds of his shirt. \u201cDid you make him do it? Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was soft, too. \u201cHe came to Fergus\u2019s printshop, the day after ye left the palace. He\u2019d heard that the gaol had burned\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sat up in bed, shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sheriff Tolliver\u2019s house? No one told me that!\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose anyone ye\u2019ve spoken to in the last week or two would know,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cNo one was killed, Sassenach\u2014I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of it?\u201d I asked with uneasy thoughts of Sadie Ferguson. \u201cHow did it happen? A mob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, yawning. \u201cFrom what I hear, Mrs. Tolliver got stinking drunk, stoked her laundry fire too high, then lay down in the shade and fell asleep. The wood collapsed, the embers set fire to the grass, it spread to the house, and . . .\u201d He flipped a hand in dismissal. \u201cThe neighbor smelt smoke, though, and rushed over in time to drag Mrs. Tolliver and the bairn safe away. He said there was no one else in the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . .\u201d I let him persuade me to lie down again, my head resting in the hollow of his shoulder. I couldn\u2019t feel strange with him, not after spending the night pressed close against him in the narrow bed, each of us aware of the other\u2019s every small movement. Still, I was very conscious of him.</p><p>And he of me; his arm was round me, his fingers unconsciously exploring the length of my back, lightly reading the shapes of me like braille as he talked.</p><p>\u201cSo, then, Tom. He kent about L\u2019Onion, of course, and so went there, when he found ye\u2019d disappeared from the gaol. By then, of course, ye\u2019d gone from the palace, as well\u2014it had taken him some time to part company wi\u2019 Richard Brown, without rousing their suspicions.</p><p>\u201cBut he found us there, and he told me what he meant to do.\u201d His fingers stroked the back of my neck, and I felt the tightness there begin to relax. \u201cI told him to bide; I should have a go at getting ye back on my own\u2014but if I could not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d I spoke with certainty. \u201cDid he tell you he had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only said that he had kept silent while there was any chance of ye being tried and acquitted\u2014but that had ye ever seemed in urgent danger, then he\u2019d meant to speak up at once; that\u2019s why he insisted upon coming with us. I, ah, didna wish to ask him questions,\u201d he said delicately.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d I prodded, insistent. \u201cJamie, you know he didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>I felt the rise of his chest under my cheek as he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>We were silent for a bit. There was a sudden, muffled rapping outside, and I jerked\u2014but it was only a woodpecker, hunting insects in the wormy timbers of the inn.</p><p>\u201cWill they hang him, do you think?\u201d I asked at last, staring up at the splintered beams above.</p><p>\u201cI expect they will, aye.\u201d His fingers had resumed their half-unconscious motion, smoothing strands of my hair behind my ear. I lay still, listening to the slow thump of his heart, not wanting to ask what came next. But I had to.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014tell me that he didn\u2019t do it\u2014that he didn\u2019t make that confession\u2014for me. Please.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I could bear that, not on top of everything else.</p><p>His fingers stilled, just touching my ear.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you. Ye ken that, aye?\u201d He spoke very quietly; I heard the reverberation of the words in his chest, as much as the words themselves.</p><p>\u201cHe said he did.\u201d I felt a tightness in the throat, recalling that very direct gray look. Tom Christie was a man who said what he meant, and meant what he said\u2014a man like Jamie, in that regard at least.</p><p>Jamie was quiet for what seemed a long time. Then he sighed, and turned his head so his cheek rested against my hair; I heard the faint rasp of his whiskers.</p><p>\u201cSassenach\u2014I would have done the same, and counted my life well lost, if it saved ye. If he feels the same, then ye\u2019ve done nay wrong to him, to take your life from his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to think of any of it\u2014not Tom\u2019s clear gray look and the calling of gulls, not the lines of affliction that carved his face into pieces, not the thought of what he had suffered, in loss, in guilt, in suspicion\u2014in fear. Nor did I want to think of Malva, going unwitting to that death among the lettuces, her son heavy and peaceful in her womb. Nor the dark rusty blood drying in gouts and splashes among the leaves of the grapevines.</p><p>Above all, I didn\u2019t want to think that I had had any part in this tragedy\u2014but that was inescapable.</p><p>I swallowed, hard.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014can it ever be made right?\u201d</p><p>He held my hand now, in his other hand, stroking his thumb gently back and forth under my fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe lass is dead, mo chridhe.\u201d</p><p>I closed my hand on his thumb, stilling it.</p><p>\u201cYes, and someone killed her\u2014and it wasn\u2019t Tom. Oh, God, Jamie\u2014who? Who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he said, and his eyes grew deep with sadness. \u201cShe was a lass who craved love, I think\u2014and took it. But she didna ken how to give it back again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took a deep breath and asked the question that had lain unspoken between us since the murder.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was Ian?\u201d</p><p>He nearly smiled at that.</p><p>\u201cIf it had been, a nighean, we\u2019d know. Ian could kill; he couldna let you or me suffer for it.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, shifting my shoulders to ease the knot between them. He was right, and I felt comforted, on Ian\u2019s account\u2014and still more guilty, on Tom Christie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThe man who fathered her child\u2014if that wasn\u2019t Ian, and I so hope it wasn\u2019t\u2014or someone who wanted her and killed her from jealousy when he found she was pregnant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone already wed. Or a woman, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>That stopped me cold. \u201cA woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took love,\u201d he repeated, and shook his head. \u201cWhat makes ye think it was only the young men she took it from?\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes, envisioning the possibilities. If she had had an affair with a married man\u2014and they had looked at her, too, only more discreetly\u2014yes, he might have killed her to keep it undiscovered. Or a scorned wife . . . I had a brief, shocking glimpse of Murdina Bug, face contorted with effort as she pressed the pillow over Lionel Brown\u2019s face. Arch? God, no. Once again, with a sense of utter hopelessness, I turned away from the question, seeing in mind the myriad faces of Fraser\u2019s Ridge\u2014one of them hiding a murderer\u2019s soul.</p><p>\u201cNo, I know it can\u2019t be fixed for them\u2014not Malva, or Tom. Or\u2014or even Allan.\u201d For the first time, I spared a thought for Tom\u2019s son, so suddenly bereft of his family and in such dreadful circumstances. \u201cBut the rest . . .\u201d The Ridge, I meant. Home. The life we had had. Us.</p><p>It had grown warm under the quilt, lying together\u2014too warm, and I felt the heat of a hot flush wash over me. I sat up abruptly, throwing off the quilt, and leaned forward, lifting the hair off my neck in hopes of an instant\u2019s coolness.</p><p>\u201cStand up, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rolled out of bed, stood up, and took me by the hand, pulling me to my feet. Sweat had already broken out on my body like dew, and my cheeks were flushed. He bent and, taking the hem of my shift in both hands, stripped it off over my head.</p><p>He smiled faintly, looking at me, then bent and blew softly over my br**sts. The coolness was a tiny but blessed relief, and my n**ples rose in silent gratitude.</p> <p>He opened the shutters for more air, then stepped back and pulled off his own shirt. Day had broken fully now, and the flood of pure morning light glimmered on the lines of his pale torso, on the silver web of his scars, the red-gold dusting of hair on his arms and legs, the rust and silver hairs of his sprouting beard. Likewise on the darkly suffused flesh of his gen**als in their morning state, standing stiff against his belly and gone the deep, soft color one would find in the heart of a shadowed rose.</p><p>\u201cAs to putting things right,\u201d he said, \u201cI canna say\u2014though I mean to try.\u201d His eyes moved over me\u2014stark nak*d, slightly salt-encrusted, and noticeably grimy about the feet and ankles. He smiled. \u201cShall we make a start, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tired you can barely stand up,\u201d I protested. \u201cUm\u2014with certain exceptions,\u201d I added, glancing down. It was true; there were dark hollows under his eyes, and while the lines of his body were still long and graceful, they were also eloquent of deep fatigue. I felt as though I\u2019d been run over by a steamroller myself, and I hadn\u2019t been up all night burning down forts.</p><p>\u201cWell, seeing as we\u2019ve a bed to hand, I didna plan to stand up for it,\u201d he replied. \u201cMind, I may never get back on my feet again, but I think I might be able to stay awake for the next ten minutes or so, at least. Ye can pinch me if I fall asleep,\u201d he suggested, smiling.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him, but didn\u2019t argue. I lay down upon the grubby but now-cool sheets, and with a small tremor in the pit of my stomach, opened my legs for him.</p><p>We made love like people underwater, heavy-limbed and slow. Mute, able to speak only through crude pantomime. We had barely touched one another in this way since Malva\u2019s death\u2014and the thought of her was still with us.</p><p>And not only her. For a time, I tried to focus only on Jamie, fixing my attention on the small intimacies of his body, so well known\u2014the tiny white cicatrice of the triangular scar at his throat, the whorls of auburn hair and the sunburned skin beneath\u2014but I was so tired that my mind refused to cooperate, and persisted in showing me instead random bits of memory or, even more disturbing, imagination.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good,\u201d I said. My eyes were shut tight, and I was clinging to the bedclothes with both hands, sheets knotted in my fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He made a small sound of surprise, but at once rolled away, leaving me damp and trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, a nighean?\u201d he said softly. He didn\u2019t touch me, but lay close.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, close to panic. \u201cI keep seeing\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Jamie. I see other people; it\u2019s like I\u2019m making love to other m-men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d He sounded cautious, but not upset. There was a whish of fabric, and he drew the sheet up over me. That helped a little, but not much. My heart was pounding hard in my chest, I felt dizzy and couldn\u2019t seem to take a full breath; my throat kept closing.</p><p>Bolus hystericus, I thought, quite calmly. Do stop, Beauchamp. Easier said than done, but I did stop worrying that I was having a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was cautious. \u201cWho? Hodgepile and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d My stomach clenched in revulsion at the thought. I swallowed. \u201cNo, I\u2014I hadn\u2019t even thought of that.\u201d</p><p>He lay quietly beside me, breathing. I felt as though I were literally coming apart.</p><p>\u201cWho is it that ye see, Claire?\u201d he whispered. \u201cCan ye tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d I said, fast, before I could change my mind. \u201cAnd Tom. And\u2014and Malva.\u201d My chest heaved, and I felt that I would never have air enough to breathe again.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2014all of a sudden, I could feel them all,\u201d I blurted. \u201cTouching me. Wanting to come in.\u201d I rolled over, burying my face in the pillow, as though I could seal out everything.</p><p>Jamie was silent for a long time. Had I hurt him? I was sorry that I\u2019d told him\u2014but I had no defenses anymore. I could not lie, even for the best of reasons; there was simply no place to go, nowhere to hide. I felt beset by whispering ghosts, their loss, their need, their desperate love pulling me apart. Apart from Jamie, apart from myself.</p><p>My entire body was clenched and rigid, trying to keep from dissolution, and my face was pushed so deep into the pillow, trying to escape, that I felt I might suffocate, and was obliged to turn my head, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was soft, but I felt his breath on my face and my eyes popped open. His eyes were soft, too, shadowed with sorrow. Very slowly, he lifted a hand and touched my lips.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d I blurted. \u201cI feel as though he\u2019s already dead, because of me, and it\u2019s so terrible. I can\u2019t bear it, Jamie, I really can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He moved his hand, hesitated. \u201cCan ye bear it if I touch ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I swallowed the lump in my throat. \u201cTry it and see.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile, though I\u2019d spoken with complete seriousness. He put his hand gently on my shoulder and turned me, then gathered me against him, moving slowly, so that I might pull back. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I sank into him, and clung to him as though he was a floating spar, the only thing keeping me from drowning. He was.</p><p>He held me close and stroked my hair for a long time.</p><p>\u201cCan ye weep for them, mo nighean donn?\u201d he whispered into my hair at last. \u201cLet them come in.\u201d</p><p>The mere idea made me go rigid with panic again. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeep for them,\u201d he whispered, and his voice opened me deeper than his cock. \u201cYe canna hold a ghost at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I said, but I was already shaking with grief, tears wet on my face. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>And yet I did. Gave up the struggle and opened myself, to memory and sorrow. Sobbed as though my heart would break\u2014and let it break, for them, and all I could not save.</p><p>\u201cLet them come, and grieve them, Claire,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd when they\u2019ve gone, I\u2019ll take ye home.\u201d</p><p>99</p><p>OLD MASTER</p><p>River Run</p><p>IT HAD RAINED HARD THE NIGHT BEFORE, and while the sun had come out bright and hot, the ground was soggy and steam seemed to rise from it, adding to the thickness of the air. Brianna had put her hair up, to keep it off her neck, but wisps escaped constantly, clinging damply to forehead and cheeks, always in her eyes. She wiped a strand away crossly with the back of her hand; her fingers were smeared with the pigment she was grinding\u2014and the humidity wasn\u2019t doing that any good, making the powder clump and cling to the sides of the mortar.</p><p>She needed it, though; she had a new commission, due to start this afternoon.</p><p>Jem was hanging round, too, bored and poking his fingers into everything. He was singing to himself, half under his breath; she paid no attention, until she happened to catch a few words.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked, rounding on him incredulously. He couldn\u2019t have been singing \u201cFolsom Prison Blues\u201d\u2014could he?</p><p>He blinked at her, lowered his chin to his chest, and said\u2014in the deepest voice he could produce\u2014\u201cHello. I\u2019m Johnny Cash.\u201d</p><p>She narrowly stopped herself laughing out loud, feeling her cheeks go pink with the effort of containment.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d she asked, though she knew perfectly well. There was only one place he could have gotten it, and her heart rose up at the thought.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d he said logically.</p><p>\u201cHas Daddy been singing?\u201d she asked, trying to sound casual. He had to have been. And, just as obviously, had to have been trying Claire\u2019s advice, to shift the register of his voice so as to loosen his frozen vocal cords.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Daddy sings a lot. He teached me the song about Sunday morning, and the one about Tom Dooley, and . . . and lots,\u201d he ended, rather at a loss.</p><p>\u201cDid he? Well, that\u2019s\u2014put that down!\u201d she said, as he idly picked up an open pouch of rose madder.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d He looked guiltily at the blob of paint that had erupted from the leather pouch and landed on his shirt, then at her, and made a tentative move toward the door.</p><p>\u201cOops, he says,\u201d she said darkly. \u201cDon\u2019t you move!\u201d Snaking out a hand, she grabbed him by the collar and applied a turpentine-soaked rag vigorously to the front of his shirt, succeeding only in producing a large pink blotch rather than a vivid red line.</p><p>Jem was silent during this ordeal, head bobbing as she pulled him to and fro, swabbing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here, anyway?\u201d she demanded crossly. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to go find something to do?\u201d There was no shortage of things to do at River Run, after all.</p><p>He hung his head and muttered something, in which she made out the word \u201cscared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared? Of what?\u201d A little more gently, she pulled the shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cThe ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ghost?\u201d she asked warily, not sure yet how to handle this. She was aware that all of the slaves at River Run believed implicitly in ghosts, simply as a fact of life. So did virtually all of the Scottish settlers in Cross Creek, Campbelton, and the Ridge. And the Germans from Salem and Bethania. So, for that matter, did her own father.</p><p>She could not simply inform Jem that there was no such thing as a ghost\u2014particularly as she was not entirely convinced of that herself.</p><p>\u201cMaighistear \u00e0rsaidh\u2019s ghost,\u201d he said, looking up at her for the first time, his dark blue eyes troubled. \u201cJosh says he\u2019s been walkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Something skittered down her back like a centipede. Maighistear \u00e0rsaidh was Old Master\u2014Hector Cameron. Involuntarily, she glanced toward the window. They were in the small room above the stable block where she did the messier bits of paint preparation, and Hector Cameron\u2019s white marble mausoleum was clearly visible from here, gleaming like a tooth at the side of the lawn below.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes Josh say that, I wonder?\u201d she said, stalling for time. Her first impulse was to observe that ghosts didn\u2019t walk in broad daylight\u2014but the obvious corollary to that was that they did walk by night, and the last thing she wanted to do was give Jem nightmares.</p><p>\u201cHe says Angelina saw him, night before last. A big ol\u2019 ghost,\u201d he said, stretching up, hands clawed, and widening his eyes in obvious imitation of Josh\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was he doing?\u201d She kept her tone light, only mildly interested, and it seemed to be working; Jem was more interested than scared, for the moment.</p><p>\u201cWalkin\u2019,\u201d Jem said with a small shrug. What else did ghosts do, after all?</p><p>\u201cWas he smoking a pipe?\u201d She\u2019d caught sight of a tall gentleman strolling under the trees on the lawn below, and had an idea.</p><p>Jem looked somewhat taken aback at the notion of a pipe-smoking ghost.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said dubiously. \u201cDo ghosts smoke pipes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of doubt it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Mr. Buchanan does. See him down there on the lawn?\u201d She moved aside, gesturing toward the window with her chin, and Jem rose up on his toes to look out over the sill. Mr. Buchanan, an acquaintance of Duncan\u2019s who was staying at the house, was in fact smoking a pipe at this very moment; the faint aroma of his tobacco reached them through the open window.</p><p>\u201cI think probably Angelina saw Mr. Buchanan walking around in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe he was in his nightshirt, going out to the necessary, and she just saw the white and thought he was a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Jem giggled at the thought. He seemed willing to be reassured, but hunched his skinny shoulders, peering closely at Mr. Buchanan.</p><p>\u201cJosh says Angelina says the ghost was comin\u2019 out of old Mr. Hector\u2019s tomb,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI expect Mr. Buchanan just walked round it, and she saw him coming along the side, and thought he was coming out of it,\u201d she said, carefully avoiding any question as to why a middle-aged Scottish gentleman should be walking round tombs in his nightshirt; obviously, that wasn\u2019t a notion that struck Jemmy as odd.</p><p>It did occur to her to ask just what Angelina was doing outside in the middle of the night seeing ghosts, but on second thought, better not. The most likely reason for a maid\u2019s stealing out at night wasn\u2019t something a boy of Jemmy\u2019s age needed to hear about, either.</p><p>Her lips tightened a little at the thought of Malva Christie, who had perhaps gone to a rendezvous of her own in Claire\u2019s garden. Who? she wondered for the thousandth time, even as she automatically crossed herself, with a brief prayer for the repose of Malva\u2019s soul. Who had it been? If ever there were a ghost that should walk . . .</p><p>A small shiver passed over her, but that in turn gave her a new idea.</p><p>\u201cI think it was Mr. Buchanan Angelina saw,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cBut if you ever should be afraid of ghosts\u2014or anything else\u2014you just make the Sign of the Cross, and say a quick prayer to your guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>The words gave her a slight sense of dizziness\u2014perhaps it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. She thought that someone\u2014her mother? her father?\u2014had said exactly that to her, sometime in the distant past of her childhood. What she had been afraid of? She no longer remembered that, but did remember the sense of security that the prayer had given her.</p><p>Jem frowned uncertainly at that; he knew the Sign of the Cross, but wasn\u2019t so sure about the angel prayer. She rehearsed it with him, feeling slightly guilty as she did so.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before he did something overtly Catholic\u2014like make the Sign of the Cross\u2014in front of someone who mattered to Roger. For the most part, people either assumed that the minister\u2019s wife was Protestant, as well\u2014or knew the truth, but were in no position to make a fuss about it. She was aware of a certain amount of muttering amongst Roger\u2019s flock, particularly in the wake of Malva\u2019s death and the talk about her parents\u2014she felt her lips press tight again, and consciously relaxed them\u2014but Roger steadfastly refused to hear any such remarks.</p><p>She felt a deep pang of longing for Roger, even with the worrying thought of potential religious complications fresh in her mind. He\u2019d written; Elder McCorkle had been delayed, but should be in Edenton within the week. A week more, maybe, before the Presbytery Session convened\u2014and then he\u2019d be coming to River Run for her and Jem.</p><p>He was so happy at the thought of his ordination; surely once he was ordained, they couldn\u2019t defrock him\u2014if that\u2019s what happened to miscreant ministers\u2014for having a Catholic wife, could they?</p><p>Would she convert, if she had to, for Roger to be what he so clearly wanted\u2014and needed\u2014to be? The thought made her feel hollow, and she put her arms round Jemmy for reassurance. His skin was damp and still baby-soft, but she could feel the hardness of his bones pressing through, giving promise of a size that would likely one day match his father and grandfather. His father\u2014there was a small, glowing thought that calmed all her anxieties, and even soothed the ache of missing Roger.</p><p>Jemmy\u2019s hair had long since grown again, but she kissed the spot behind his left ear where the hidden mark was, making him hunch his shoulders and giggle at the tickle of her breath on his neck.</p><p>She sent him off then, to take the paint-stained shirt to Matilda the laundress to see what might be done, and went back to her grinding.</p><p>The mineral smell of the malachite in her mortar seemed vaguely wrong; she lifted it and sniffed, even as she did so aware that that was ridiculous: ground stone couldn\u2019t go bad. Maybe the mixture of turpentine and the fumes from Mr. Buchanan\u2019s pipe was affecting her sense of smell. She shook her head, and scraped the soft green powder carefully out into a vial, to be mixed with walnut oil or used in an egg tempera later.</p><p>She cast an appraising eye over the selection of boxes and pouches\u2014some supplied by Aunt Jocasta, others courtesy of John Grey, sent specially from London\u2014and the vials and drying trays of the pigments she\u2019d ground herself, to see what else might be needed.</p><p>This afternoon, she\u2019d only be making preliminary sketches\u2014the commission was for a portrait of Mr. Forbes\u2019s ancient mother\u2014but she might have only a week or two to finish the job before Roger\u2019s return; she couldn\u2019t waste\u2014</p><p>A wave of dizziness made her sit down suddenly, and black spots flickered through her vision. She put her head between her knees, breathing deep. That didn\u2019t help; the air was raw with turps, and thick with the meaty, decaying animal smells of the stables below.</p><p>She lifted her head, and grabbed for the edge of the table. Her insides seemed to have turned abruptly to a liquid substance that shifted with her movement like water in a bowl, sloshing from belly to throat and back, leaving the bitter yellow smell of bile at the back of her nose.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>The liquid in her belly rushed up her throat, and she had barely time to seize the washbasin from the table and dump the water on the floor before her stomach turned inside out in the frantic effort to empty itself.</p><p>She set the basin down, very carefully, and sat panting, staring at the wet blotch on the floor, as the world beneath her shifted on its axis and settled at a new, uneasy angle.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Roger,\u201d she said out loud, her voice sounding faint and uncertain in the close, damp air. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be a daddy. Again.\u201d</p><p>SHE SAT STILL for some time, cautiously exploring the sensations of her body, looking for certainty. She hadn\u2019t been sick with Jemmy\u2014but she remembered the oddly altered quality of her senses; that odd state called synesthesia, where sight, smell, taste, and even sometimes hearing occasionally and weirdly took on characteristics of each other.</p><p>It had gone away as abruptly as it had happened; the tang of Mr. Buchanan\u2019s tobacco was much stronger, but now it was only the mellow burning of cured leaves, not a mottled green-brown thing that writhed through her sinuses and rattled the membranes of her brain like a tin roof in a hailstorm.</p><p>She had been concentrating so hard on her bodily sensations and what they might or might not mean that she hadn\u2019t really noticed the voices in the next room. That was Duncan\u2019s modest lair, where he kept the ledgers and accounts of the estate and\u2014she thought\u2014went to hide, when the grandeur of the house became too much for him.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan was in there with Duncan now, and what had started out as a genial thrum of conversation was now showing signs of strain. She got up, relieved to feel only a slight residual clamminess now, and picked up the basin. She had the natural human inclinations toward eavesdropping, but lately, she had been careful not to hear anything but what she must.</p><p>Duncan and her aunt Jocasta were stout Loyalists, and nothing she could say by way of tactful urging or logical argument would sway them. She had overheard more than one of Duncan\u2019s private conversations with local Tories that made her heart go small with apprehension, knowing as she did what would be the outcome of the present events.</p><p>Here in the piedmont, in the heart of the Cape Fear country, most of the solid citizens were Loyalists, convinced that the violence taking place to the north was an overblown rumpus that might be unnecessary, and if it was not, had little to do with them\u2014and that what was most needed here was a firm hand to rein in the wild-eyed Whigs, before their excesses provoked a ruinous retaliation. Knowing that exactly such a ruinous retaliation was coming\u2014and to people she liked, or even loved\u2014gave her what her father called the grue: a cold sense of oppressive horror, coiling through the blood.</p><p>\u201cWhen, then?\u201d Buchanan\u2019s voice came clearly as she opened the door, sounding impatient. \u201cThey will not wait, Duncan. I must have the money by Wednesday week, or Dunkling will sell the arms elsewhere; ye ken it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market the noo. For gold, he\u2019ll wait\u2014but not for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that fine, Sawny.\u201d Duncan sounded impatient\u2014and very uneasy, Brianna thought. \u201cIf it can be done, it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIF?\u201d Buchanan cried. \u201cWhat is this \u2018if\u2019? \u2019Til now, it\u2019s been, oh, aye, Sawny, nay difficulty, to be sure, Sawny, tell Dunkling it\u2019s on, oh, of course, Sawny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, Alexander, that if it can be done, it will.\u201d Duncan\u2019s voice was low, but suddenly had a note of steel in it that she had never heard before.</p><p>Buchanan said something rude in the Gaelic, and suddenly the door of Duncan\u2019s office burst open and the man himself popped out, in so great a huff that he barely saw her, and gave her no more than a brusque nod in passing.</p><p>Which was just as well, she thought, since she was standing there holding a bowl full of vomit.</p><p>Before she could move to dispose of it, Duncan came out in turn. He looked hot, cross\u2014and extremely worried. He did, however, notice her.</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019ye fare, lass?\u201d he asked, squinting at her. \u201cYe\u2019re that bit green; have ye eaten aught amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. But I\u2019m all right now,\u201d she said, hastily turning to put the basin back in the room behind her. She set it on the floor and closed the door on it. \u201cAre you, er, all right, Duncan?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for an instant, but whatever was bothering him was too overwhelming to keep it bottled up. He glanced about, but none of the slaves was up here at this time of day. He leaned close, nonetheless, and lowered his voice.</p><p>\u201cHave ye by chance . . . seen anything peculiar, a nighean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeculiar, how?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle under his drooping mustache, and glanced round once more.</p><p>\u201cNear Hector Cameron\u2019s tomb, say?\u201d he asked, his voice pitched only just above a whisper.</p><p>Her diaphragm, still sore from vomiting, contracted sharply at that, and she put a hand to her middle.</p><p>\u201cYe have, then?\u201d Duncan\u2019s expression sharpened.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d she said, and explained about Jemmy, Angelina, and the supposed ghost.</p><p>\u201cI thought perhaps it was Mr. Buchanan,\u201d she finished, nodding toward the stair down which Alexander Buchanan had vanished.</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s a thought,\u201d Duncan muttered, rubbing distractedly at his grizzled temple. \u201cBut no . . . surely not. He couldna\u2014but it\u2019s a thought.\u201d Brianna thought that he looked very slightly more hopeful.</p><p>\u201cDuncan\u2014can you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, shaking his head\u2014not in refusal, but in perplexity\u2014and let it out again, his shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cThe gold,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS in gold bullion was a substantial amount, in all senses of the word. She had no idea how much such a sum might weigh, but it had completely lined Jocasta\u2019s coffin, standing chastely next to Hector Cameron\u2019s in the family mausoleum.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018gone\u2019?\u201d she blurted. \u201cAll of it?\u201d</p><p>Duncan clutched her arm, features contorted in the urge to shush her.</p><p>\u201cAye, all of it,\u201d he said, looking round yet again. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, lass, keep your voice down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it go? Or rather,\u201d she amended, \u201cwhen you did find it gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d He looked round yet again, and jerked his chin toward his office. \u201cCome in, lass; I\u2019ll tell ye about it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s agitation subsided a little as he told her the story; by the time he had finished, he had regained a certain amount of outward calm.</p><p>The seven thousand pounds was what was left of the original ten thousand, which in turn was one-third of the thirty thousand sent\u2014too late, but sent nonetheless\u2014from Louis of France in support of Charles Stuart\u2019s doomed attempt on the thrones of England and Scotland.</p><p>\u201cHector was careful, aye?\u201d Duncan explained. \u201cHe lived as a rich man, but always within such means as a place like this\u201d\u2014he waved his one hand around, indicating the grounds and messuages of River Run\u2014\u201cmight provide. He spent a thousand pound acquiring the land and building the house, then over the years, another thousand in slaves, cattle, and the like. And a thousand pound he put to the bankers\u2014Jo said he couldna bear the thought of all that money sitting, earning nay interest\u201d\u2014he gave her a small, wry smile\u2014\u201cthough he was too clever to attract attention by putting it all out. I suppose he meant, maybe, to invest the rest, a bit at a time\u2014but he died before that was done.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Jocasta as a very wealthy widow\u2014but even more cautious than her husband had been about attracting undue attention. And so the gold had sat, safe in its hiding place, save for the one ingot being gradually whittled away and disposed of by Ulysses. Which had disappeared, she remembered with a qualm. Someone knew there was gold here.</p><p>Perhaps whoever had taken that ingot had guessed that there was more\u2014and hunted, quietly, patiently, until they found it.</p><p>But now\u2014</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll have heard about General MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard the name frequently of late, in conversation\u2014he was a Scottish general, more or less retired, she\u2019d assumed\u2014who had been staying here and there, the guest of various prominent families. She hadn\u2019t heard of his purpose, though.</p><p>\u201cHe means to raise men\u2014three thousand, four\u2014among the Highlanders, to march to the coast.

Lord Dunsmore is gathering a great store of powder and arms in Virginia, and Dunkling is one of his lieutenants\u2014and willing to give up some of that store, in return for gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is now gone.\u201d She took a deep breath, feeling sweat trickle down between her br**sts, further dampening her shift.</p> <p>\u201cWhich is now gone,\u201d he agreed bleakly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m left to wonder what about this ghost of wee Jem\u2019s, aye?\u201d</p><p>Ghost, indeed. For someone to have entered a place like River Run, teeming with people, and to have moved several hundred pounds by weight of gold, completely unnoticed . . .</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs caused Duncan to jerk his head sharply toward the door, but it was only Josh, one of the black grooms, his hat in his hand.</p><p>\u201cBest we be going, Miss Bree,\u201d he said, bowing respectfully. \u201cIf ye be wanting the light, like?\u201d</p><p>For her drawings, he meant. It was a good hour\u2019s trip into Cross Creek to lawyer Forbes\u2019s house, and the sun was rising fast toward noon.</p> <p>She glanced at her green-smeared fingers, and recalled the hair straggling untidily down from its makeshift bun; she\u2019d have to tidy herself a bit first.</p><p>\u201cGo, lass.\u201d Duncan waved her toward the door, his lean face still creased with worry but lightened a little by having shared it.</p><p>She kissed him affectionately on the forehead and went down after Josh. She was worried, and not only about missing gold and prowling ghosts. General MacDonald, indeed. For if he meant to raise fighting men among the Highlanders, one of the natural places for him to go was to her father.</p><p>As Roger had noted to her sometime earlier, \u201cJamie can walk the tightrope between Whigs and Tories better than any man I know\u2014but when push comes to shove . . . he\u2019ll have to jump.\u201d</p><p>The push had come at Mecklenberg. But shove, she thought, was named MacDonald.</p><p>100</p> <p>A TRIP TO THE SEASIDE</p><p>NEIL FORBES, thinking it prudent to be absent from his usual haunts for a time, had removed to Edenton, with the excuse of taking his aged mother to visit her even more aged sister. He had enjoyed the long journey, in spite of his mother\u2019s complaints about the clouds of dust raised by another carriage that preceded them.</p><p>He had been loath to sacrifice his sight of that carriage\u2014a small, well-sprung affair, whose windows were sealed and heavily curtained. But he had always been a devoted son, and at the next post stop, he went to speak to the driver. The other coach obligingly dropped back, following them at a convenient distance.</p><p>\u201cWhatever are ye lookin\u2019 at, Neil?\u201d his mother demanded, looking up from fastening her favorite garnet brooch. \u201cThat\u2019s the third time ye\u2019ve had a peek out thon window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing, Mam,\u201d he said, inhaling deeply. \u201cOnly taking pleasure in the day. Such beautiful weather, is it not?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Forbes sniffed, but obligingly settled her spectacles on her nose and leaned to peer out.</p><p>\u201cAye, weel, it\u2019s fair enough,\u201d she admitted dubiously. \u201cHot, though, and damp enough to wring buckets from your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, a leannan,\u201d he said, patting her black-clad shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in Edenton afore ye know. It\u2019ll be cooler there. Nothing like a sea-breeze, so they say, to put the roses in your cheeks!\u201d</p> <p>101</p><p>NIGHTWATCH</p><p>Edenton</p><p>THE REVEREND MCMILLAN\u2019S HOUSE was on the water. A blessing in the hot, muggy weather. The offshore breeze in the evening swept everything away\u2014heat, hearth smoke, mosquitoes. The men sat on the big porch after supper, smoking their pipes and enjoying the respite.</p><p>Roger\u2019s enjoyment was spiced by the guilty awareness that Mrs. Reverend McMillan and her three daughters were sweating to and fro, washing dishes, clearing away, sweeping floors, boiling up the leftover ham bones from supper with lentils for tomorrow\u2019s soup, putting children to bed, and generally slaving away in the stuffy, sweltering confines of the house. At home, he would have felt obliged to help with such work, or face Brianna\u2019s wrath; here, such an offer would have been received with drop-jawed incredulity, followed by deep suspicion. Instead, he sat peacefully in the cool evening breeze, watching fishing boats come in across the water of the sound and sipping something that passed for coffee, engaged in pleasant male conversation.</p><p>There was, he thought, occasionally something to be said for the eighteenth-century model of sexual roles.</p><p>They were talking over the news from the south: the flight of Governor Martin from New Bern, the burning of Fort Johnston. The political climate of Edenton was strongly Whiggish, and the company was largely clerical\u2014the Reverend Doctor McCorkle, his secretary Warren Lee, the Reverend Jay McMillan, Reverend Patrick Dugan, and four \u201cinquirers\u201d awaiting ordination besides Roger\u2014but there were still currents of political disagreement flowing beneath the outwardly cordial surface of the conversation.</p><p>Roger himself said little; he didn\u2019t wish to offend McMillan\u2019s hospitality by contributing to any argument\u2014and something inside him wished for quiet, to contemplate tomorrow.</p><p>Then the conversation took a new turn, though, and he found himself paying rapt attention. The Continental Congress had met in Philadelphia two months before, and given General Washington command of the Continental army. Warren Lee had been in Philadelphia at the time, and was giving the company a vivid account of the battle at Breed\u2019s Hill, at which he had been present.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Putnam, he brought up wagonloads of dirt and brush, to the neck of the Charlestown peninsula\u2014you said you knew it, sir?\u201d he asked, courteously turning toward Roger. \u201cWell, Colonel Prescott, he\u2019s there already, with two militia comp\u2019nies from Massachusetts, and parts of another from Connecticut\u2014was mebbe a thousand men in all, and dear Lord, was they a stench from the camps!\u201d</p><p>His soft Southern accent\u2014Lee was a Virginian\u2014held a slight touch of amusement, but this faded as he went on.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Ward, he\u2019d give orders to fortify this one hill, Bunker Hill, they call it, for an old redoubt atop. But Colonel Prescott, he goes up it and don\u2019t care so much for the looks, him and Mr. Gridley, the engineer. So they leave a detachment there, and go on to Breed\u2019s Hill, what they think is maybe better to the purpose, bein\u2019 closer to the harbor.</p><p>\u201cNow, this is all at night, mind. I was with one of the Massachusetts companies, and we marched right smart, then spent the whole night through, \u2019twixt midnight and dawn, diggin\u2019 trenches and raising up six-foot walls about the perimeter.</p><p>\u201cCome the dawn, and we skulked down behind our fortifications, and just in time, too, for there\u2019s a British ship in the harbor\u2014the Lively, they said\u2014and she opens fire the minute the sun\u2019s up. Looked right pretty, for the fog was still on the water and the cannon lit it up in red flashes. Did no harm, though; most all the balls fell short into the harbor\u2014did see one whaleboat at the docks hit, though; stove it like kindling. The crew, they\u2019d hopped out like fleas when the Lively took to firing. From where I was, I could just see \u2019em, hoppin\u2019 up and down on the dock, a-shakin\u2019 their fists\u2014then the Lively let off another broadside, and they all fell flat or run like rabbits.\u201d</p><p>The light was nearly gone, and Lee\u2019s young face invisible in the shadows, but the amusement in his voice made a small rumble of laughter run among the other men.</p><p>\u201cThey was some firin\u2019 from a little battery up on Copp\u2019s Hill, and one or two of the other ships, they let off a pop or two, but they could see \u2019twan\u2019t no earthly use and ceased. Then come in some fellows from New Hampshire to join up with us, and that was purely heartening. But General Putnam, he sends a good many men back to work on the fortifications at Bunker, and the New Hampshire folk, they\u2019re crouched way down on the left, where they\u2019s got no cover beyond rail fences stuffed with mown grass. Lookin\u2019 at \u2019em down there, I was pleased as punch to have four feet of solid earthwork in front of me, I tell you, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>The British troops had set out across the Charles River, bold as brass under the midday sun, with the warships behind them and the batteries on shore all providing covering fire.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t fire back, of course. Had no cannon,\u201d Lee said with an audible shrug.</p><p>Roger, listening intently, couldn\u2019t keep from asking a question at this point.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that Colonel Stark said, \u2018Don\u2019t fire until you see the whites of their eyes\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Lee coughed discreetly.</p><p>\u201cWell, sir. I couldn\u2019t say for sure as no one said that, but I didn\u2019t hear it myself. Mind, I did hear one colonel call out, \u2018Any whoreson fool wastes his powder afore the bastards are close enough to kill is gonna get his musket shoved up his arse butt-first!\u2019\u201d</p><p>The assembly erupted into laughter. An inquiry from Mrs. McMillan, who had come out to offer further refreshment, as to the source of this merriment shut them all up sharp, though, and they listened with a fair assumption of sober attention to the rest of Lee\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cWell, so, then, on they come, and I will say \u2019twas a daunting sight. They\u2019d several regiments, and all in their different colors, fusiliers and grenadiers, Royal Marines, and a proper boiling of light infantry, all comin\u2019 on over the ground like a horde of ants, and just as mean.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t make great claim to bravery myself, gentlemen, but I would say the fellows standin\u2019 with me had some nerve. We did let \u2019em come, and the first ranks weren\u2019t no more than ten feet away when our volley cut into them.</p><p>\u201cThey rallied, came back on, and we cut them down again\u2014like ninepins. And the officers\u2014there was a powerful lot of the officers went; they were on their horses, see? I\u2014I shot one such. He keeled over, but he didn\u2019t fall off\u2014his horse carried him away. Kind of lolling, with his head loose. But he didn\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>Lee\u2019s voice had lost some of its color, and Roger saw the burly form of the Reverend Doctor McCorkle lean toward his secretary, touching his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThey rallied a third time, and came on. And . . . we were most of us out of ammunition. They came on over the earthworks and through the fences. With their bayonets fixed.\u201d</p><p>Roger was sitting on the steps of the porch, Lee above him and several feet away, but could hear the young man swallow.</p><p>\u201cWe fell back. That\u2019s how they say it. We ran, is what we did. So\u2019d they.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed again.</p><p>\u201cA bayonet\u2014it makes a terrible sound, goin\u2019 into a man. Just\u2014terrible. I can\u2019t say how it is, describe it properly. Heard it, though, and more\u2019n once. Was a good many run straight through the body that day\u2014skewered and then the steel pulled out, and they left to die on the ground, floppin\u2019 like fish.\u201d</p><p>Roger had seen\u2014handled\u2014eighteenth-century bayonets, often. A seventeen-inch triangular blade, heavy and brutal, with a blood groove down one side. He thought, quite suddenly, of the furrowed scar that ran up Jamie Fraser\u2019s thigh, and rose to his feet. Murmuring a brief excuse, he left the porch, and walked down the shore, pausing only for a moment to shed his shoes and stockings.</p><p>The tide was going out; sand and shingle were wet and cool under his bare feet. The breeze rattled faintly among palmetto leaves behind him, and a line of pelicans flew down the shore, solemn against the last of the light. He walked a little way into the surf, small rippling waves that tugged at his heels, sucking the sand away beneath him, making him shift and sway to keep his balance.</p><p>Far out on the water of Albemarle Sound, he could see lights; fishing boats, with small fires built in sandboxes aboard, to light the torches the fishermen swung over the side. These seemed to float in the air, swinging to and fro, their reflections in the water winking slowly in and out like fireflies.</p><p>The stars were coming out. He stood looking up, trying to empty his mind, his heart, open himself to the love of God.</p><p>Tomorrow, he would be a minister. Thou art a priest forever, said the ordination service, quoting from the Bible, after the order of Melchizedek.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d Brianna had asked him, when he\u2019d told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said softly, aloud.</p><p>He stood until the tide left him, then followed it, walking into the water, wanting the rhythmic touch of the waves.</p><p>\u201cWill you do it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, more softly still. He had no idea what he was agreeing to, but said it, anyway. Far down the beach behind him, the breeze brought him now and then a snatch of laughter, a few words from the Reverend McMillan\u2019s porch. They had moved on, then, from the talk of war and death.</p><p>Had any of them ever killed a man? Lee, perhaps. The Reverend Doctor McCorkle? He snorted a little at the thought, but did not dismiss it. He turned and walked a little further, until the only sounds were those of the waves and the offshore wind.</p><p>Soul-searching. It was what squires used to do, he thought, smiling a little wryly at the thought. The night before he became a knight, a young man would keep vigil in church or chapel, watching through the dark hours, lighted only by the glow of a sanctuary lamp, praying.</p><p>For what? he wondered. Purity of mind, singleness of purpose. Courage? Or perhaps forgiveness?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to kill Randall Lillington; that had been almost accident, and what wasn\u2019t had been self-defense. But he had been hunting when he did it, had gone out looking for Stephen Bonnet, meaning to kill him in cold blood. And Harley Boble; he could still see the shine of the thieftaker\u2019s eyes, feel the echo of the blow, the shards of the man\u2019s skull reverberating through the bones of his own arm. He\u2019d meant that, yes. Could have stopped. Didn\u2019t.</p><p>Tomorrow, he would swear before God that he believed in the doctrine of predestination, that he had been meant to do what he had done. Perhaps.</p><p>Maybe I don\u2019t believe that, so much, he thought, doubt stealing in. But maybe I do. Christ\u2014oh, sorry\u2014he apologized mentally\u2014can I be a proper minister, with doubts? I think everyone\u2019s got them, but if I\u2019ve got too many\u2014maybe ye\u2019d best let me know now, before it\u2019s too late.</p><p>His feet had gone numb, and the sky was ablaze with a glory of stars, thick in the black velvet night. He heard the crunch of footsteps among the shingle and the sea wrack nearby.</p><p>It was Warren Lee\u2014tall and gangly by starlight, the Reverend Doctor McCorkle\u2019s secretary, erstwhile militiaman.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d take a bit of air,\u201d Lee said, his voice hardly audible above the hiss of the sea.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, there\u2019s a lot of it, and it\u2019s free,\u201d Roger said as amiably as he could. Lee chuckled briefly in response, but luckily didn\u2019t seem disposed to talk.</p><p>They stood for some time, watching the fishing boats. Then, by unspoken consent, turned to go back. The house was dark, the porch deserted. A single candle burned in the window, though, lighting them home.</p><p>\u201cThat officer, the one I shot,\u201d Lee blurted suddenly. \u201cI pray for him. Every night.\u201d</p><p>Lee shut up abruptly, embarrassed. Roger breathed slow and deep, feeling the jerk of his own heart. Had he ever prayed for Lillington, or Boble?</p><p>\u201cI will, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lee very softly, and side by side, they made their way back up the beach, pausing to pick up their shoes, going back barefooted, sand drying on their feet.</p><p>They had sat down on the steps to brush it off before going in, when the door behind them opened.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie?\u201d said the Reverend McMillan, and something in his voice pulled Roger to his feet, heart pounding. \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>He saw the tall silhouette behind McMillan, and knew, even before Jamie Fraser\u2019s pale, fierce face appeared, eyes black in the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken Brianna,\u201d Jamie said without preamble. \u201cYe\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>102</p><p>Anemone</p><p>FEET TRAMPLED BACK AND FORTH OVERHEAD, and she could hear voices, but most of the words were too muffled to make out. There was a chorus of jovial shouts on the side nearest shore, and cordial feminine shrieks in reply.</p><p>The cabin had a wide, paned window\u2014did you call it a window on a ship, she wondered, or had it some special nautical name?\u2014that ran behind the bunk, raked back with the angle of the stern. It was made in small, thick panes, set in leading. No hope there of escape, but it did offer the possibility of air, and perhaps information regarding their whereabouts.</p><p>Repressing a qualm of nauseated distaste, she clambered across the stained and rumpled sheets of the bed. She pressed close to the window and pushed her face into one of the open panes, taking deep breaths to dispel the aromas of the cabin, though the smell of the harbor was no great improvement, rife as it was with the smell of dead fish, sewage, and baking mud.</p><p>She could see a small dock, and moving figures on it. A fire was burning on the shore outside a low, whitewashed building roofed with palmetto leaves. It was too dark to see what, if anything, lay beyond the building. There must be at least a small town, though, judging from the noise of the people on the dock.</p><p>There were voices outside the cabin door, coming closer. \u201c. . . meet him on Ocracoke, the dark o\u2019 the moon,\u201d said one, to which the other replied in an indistinct mumble, before the door flew open.</p><p>\u201cCare to join the party, sweetheart? Or have ye started without me?\u201d</p><p>She whirled on her knees, heart hammering in her throat. Stephen Bonnet stood inside the door to the cabin, a bottle in one hand and a slight smile on his face. She took a deep breath to quell the shock, and nearly gagged on the stale scent of sex that wafted from the sheets under her knees. She scrambled off the bed, heedless of her clothes, and felt a rip at the waist as her knee caught in her skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she demanded. Her voice sounded shrill, panicked to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cOn the Anemone,\u201d he said patiently, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou know that isn\u2019t what I mean!\u201d The neck of her gown and chemise had torn in the struggle when the men pulled her from her horse, and most of one breast was exposed; she put up a hand, pushing the fabric back in place.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He set the bottle on the desk, and reached to unfasten the stock from his neck. \u201cAh, that\u2019s better.\u201d He rubbed at the dark red line across his throat, and she had a sudden, piercing vision of Roger\u2019s throat, with its ragged scar.</p><p>\u201cI wish to know what this town is called,\u201d she said, deepening her voice and fixing him with a gimlet eye. She didn\u2019t expect that what worked on her father\u2019s tenants would work on him, but the assumption of an air of command helped to steady her a bit.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s an easily gratified wish, to be sure.\u201d He waved a casual hand toward the shore. \u201cRoanoke.\u201d He shucked his coat, tossing it carelessly over the stool. The linen of his shirt was crumpled, and clung damply to his chest and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d best take off the gown, darlin\u2019; it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the strings that tied his shirt, and she moved abruptly away from the bed, glancing round the cabin, searching the shadows for something that could be used as a weapon. Stool, lamp, logbook, bottle . . . there. A piece of wood showed among the rubble on the desk, the blunt end of a marlinespike.</p><p>He frowned, attention fastened momentarily on a knot in the string. She took two long steps and seized the marlinespike, yanking it off the desk in a shower of rubbish and clanging oddments.</p><p>\u201cStand back.\u201d She held the thing like a baseball bat, gripped in both hands. Sweat streamed down the hollow of her back, but her hands felt cold and her face went hot and cold and hot again, ripples of heat and terror rolling down her skin.</p><p>Bonnet looked at her as though she had gone mad.</p><p>\u201cWhatever will ye be after doing with that, woman?\u201d He left off fiddling with his shirt and took a step toward her. She took one back, raising the club.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**king touch me!\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, eyes fixed wide, pale green and unblinking above a small, odd smile. Still smiling, he took another step toward her. Then another, and the fear boiled off in a surge of rage. Her shoulders bunched and lifted, ready.</p><p>\u201cI mean it! Stand back or I\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll know who this baby\u2019s father is, if I die for it!\u201d</p><p>He had raised a hand, as though to grasp the club and jerk it away from her, but at this, he stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cBaby? You are with child?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her breath still thick in her throat. The blood hammered in her ears, and the smooth wood was slick with sweat from her palms. She tightened her grip, trying to keep the rage alive, but it was already dying.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think so. I\u2019ll know for sure in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>His sandy eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cHm!\u201d With a short grunt, he stepped back, surveying her with interest. Slowly, his eyes traveled over her, appraising her one bared breast.</p><p>The sudden spurt of rage had drained away, leaving her breathless and empty-bellied. She kept hold of the marlinespike, but her wrists quivered, and she lowered it.</p><p>\u201cIs that the way of it, then?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and reached out, quite without lascivious intent now. Startled, she froze for an instant, and he weighed the breast in one hand, kneading thoughtfully, as though it were a grapefruit he meant to buy at market. She gasped and hit at him one-handed with the club, but she had lost what readiness she had, and the blow bounced off his shoulder, rocking him but having little other effect. He grunted and stepped back, rubbing at his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCould be. Well, then.\u201d He frowned, and tugged at the front of his breeches, adjusting himself without the slightest embarrassment. \u201cLucky we\u2019re in port, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>She made no sense whatever of this remark, but didn\u2019t care; apparently he had changed his mind upon hearing her revelation, and the feeling of relief made her knees go weak and her skin prickle with sweat. She sat down, quite suddenly, upon the stool, the club clanking to the floor beside her.</p><p>Bonnet had put his head out into the corridor, and was bellowing for someone named Orden. Whoever Orden was, he didn\u2019t come into the cabin, but within a few moments, a voice mumbled interrogatively outside.</p><p>\u201cFetch me down a whore from the docks,\u201d Bonnet said, in the casual tone of one ordering a fresh pint of bitter. \u201cClean, mind, and fairly young.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door then, and turned to the table, scrabbling through the debris until he unearthed a pewter cup. He poured a drink, quaffed half of it, and then\u2014seeming belatedly to realize that she was still there\u2014offered her the bottle with a vague \u201cEh?\u201d of invitation.</p><p>She shook her head, wordless. A faint hope had sprung up in the back of her mind. He did have some faint streak of gallantry, or at least decency; he had come back to rescue her from the burning warehouse, and he had left her the stone for what he assumed to be his child. Now he had abandoned his advances, upon hearing that she was with child again. Perhaps he would let her go, then, particularly if she was of no immediate use to him.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you don\u2019t want me?\u201d she said, edging her feet under her, ready to leap up and run, as soon as the door opened to admit her replacement. She hoped she could run; her knees were still trembling with reaction.</p><p>Bonnet glanced at her, surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve split your quim once already, sweetheart,\u201d he said, and grinned. \u201cI recall the red hair\u2014a lovely sight, sure\u2014but it wasn\u2019t so memorable an experience otherwise that I can\u2019t be waitin\u2019 to repeat it. Time enough, darlin\u2019, time enough.\u201d He chucked her negligently under the chin, and gulped more of his drink. \u201cFor now, though, LeRoi\u2019s needing a bit of a gallop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Distracted, he pulled once more at the crotch of his breeches, quite unself-conscious of her presence.</p><p>\u201cHere? Why, because a gentleman paid me to take ye to London-town, darlin\u2019. Didn\u2019t ye know?\u201d</p><p>She felt as though someone had hit her in the stomach, and sat down on the bed, folding her arms protectively across her midsection.</p><p>\u201cWhat gentleman? And for God\u2019s sake\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>He considered for a moment, but evidently concluded that there was no reason not to tell her.</p><p>\u201cA man named Forbes,\u201d he said, and threw back the rest of his drink. \u201cKnow him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do,\u201d she said, amazement vying with fury. \u201cThat bloody bastard!\u201d So they were Forbes\u2019s men, the masked bandits that had stopped her and Josh, dragged them from their horses, and shoved them both into a sealed carriage, bumping over unseen roads for days on end, until they reached the coast, and then been pulled out, disheveled and reeking, and bundled aboard the ship.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Joshua?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cThe young black man who was with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there?\u201d Bonnet looked quizzical. \u201cIf they brought him aboard, I imagine they\u2019ve put him in the hold with the other cargo. A bonus, I suppose,\u201d he added, and laughed.</p><p>Her fury at Forbes had been tinged with relief at finding out he was the motive behind her abduction; Forbes might be a low-down, sneaking scoundrel, but he wouldn\u2019t be intending to murder her. That laugh of Stephen Bonnet\u2019s, though, made a cold qualm run through her, and she felt suddenly light-headed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, a bonus?\u201d</p><p>Bonnet scratched his cheek, gooseberry eyes roaming over her in approval.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then. Mr. Forbes only wanted ye out of the way, he said. Whatever did ye do to the man, darlin\u2019? But he\u2019s paid your fare already, and I\u2019ve the impression that he\u2019s no great interest in where ye end up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I end up?\u201d Her mouth had been dry; now saliva was pouring from her membranes, and she had to swallow repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, after all, darlin\u2019, why bother takin\u2019 ye all the way to London, where ye\u2019d be of no particular use to anyone? Besides, it rains quite a bit in London; I\u2019m sure ye wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Before she could draw breath to ask any more questions, the door opened, and a young woman slid through, closing it behind her.</p><p>She was likely in her twenties, though with a missing molar that showed when she smiled. She was plump and plain-faced, brown-haired, and clean by local standards, though the scent of her sweat and waves of freshly applied cheap cologne wafted across the cabin, making Brianna want to throw up again.</p><p>\u201cHallo, Stephen,\u201d the newcomer said, standing on tiptoe to kiss Bonnet\u2019s cheek. \u201cGive us a drink to be starting with, eh?\u201d</p><p>Bonnet grabbed her, gave her a deep and lingering kiss, then let her go and reached for the bottle.</p><p>Coming down onto her heels, she looked at Brianna with detached professional interest, then back at Bonnet, and scratched at her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have the two of us, Stephen, or shall it be me and her to start? It\u2019s a quid more, either way.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet didn\u2019t bother answering, but thrust the bottle into her hand, whipped off the kerchief that hid the swell of her heavy br**sts, and began at once to undo his flies. He dropped the breeches on the floor, and without ado, seized the woman by the h*ps and pressed her against the door.</p><p>Guzzling from the bottle she held in one hand, the young woman snatched up her skirts with the other, whisking skirt and petticoat out of the way with a practiced motion that bared her to the waist. Brianna caught a glimpse of sturdy thighs and a patch of dark hair, before they were obscured by Bonnet\u2019s buttocks, blond-furred and clenched with effort.</p><p>She turned her head away, cheeks burning, but morbid fascination compelled her to glance back. The whore was standing balanced on her toes, squatting slightly to accommodate him, gazing placidly over his shoulder as he thrust and grunted. One hand still held the bottle; the other stroked Bonnet\u2019s shoulders in a practiced way. She caught Brianna\u2019s eye on her, and winked, still saying, \u201cOoh, yes . . . oh, YES! That\u2019s good, love, so good . . .\u201d in her client\u2019s ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cabin door quivered with each meaty thump of the whore\u2019s backside, and Brianna could hear laughter in the corridor outside, both male and female; evidently Orden had brought back enough to supply crew as well as captain.</p><p>Bonnet heaved and grunted for a minute or two, then gave a loud groan, his movements suddenly jerky and uncoordinated. The whore put a helpful hand on his buttocks and pulled him close, then relaxed her grip as his body went limp, leaning heavily against her. She supported him for a moment, patting his back matter-of-factly, like a mother burping a baby, then pushed him off.</p><p>His face and neck were flushed dark red, and he was breathing heavily. He nodded to the whore, and stooped, fumbling for his breeches. He stood up with them and waved toward the littered desk.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself to your pay, darlin\u2019, but give me back the bottle, aye?\u201d</p> <p>The whore pouted slightly, but took a final deep gulp of the liquor and handed him the bottle, now no more than a quarter full. She pulled a wadded cloth from the pocket at her waist and clapped it between her thighs, then shook down her skirts and minced across to the desk, poking delicately among the litter for scattered coins, which she picked out with two fingers, dropping them one by one into the depths of her pocket.</p><p>Bonnet, clothed once more, went out without a backward glance at the two women. The air in the cabin was hot and thick with the scent of sex, and Brianna felt her stomach clench. Not with revulsion, but with panic. The strong male reek had triggered an instinctive flush of response that tingled across her br**sts and gripped her inwardly; for a brief, disorienting moment, she felt Roger\u2019s skin, slick with sweat against her own, and her br**sts tingled, swollen and wanting.</p><p>She pressed both lips and legs tight together, and curled her hands into fists, breathing shallowly. The last thing she could stand right now, she thought\u2014the very last thing\u2014was to think of Roger and sex, while anywhere within miles of Stephen Bonnet. She resolutely pushed the thought aside, and edged closer to the whore, searching for some remark with which to open conversation.</p><p>The whore sensed the movement, and glanced at Brianna, taking in both the torn dress and its quality, but then dismissed her in favor of finding more coins. Once she had her pay, the woman would leave, going back to the docks. It was a chance to get word to Roger and her parents. Not much, perhaps, but a chance.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . um . . . know him well?\u201d she said.</p> <p>The whore glanced at her, eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cWho? Oh, Stephen? Aye, he\u2019s a good \u2019un, Stephen.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t take more than two or three minutes, no bones about the money, never wants nothin\u2019 but a simple swive. He\u2019s rough now and then, but he don\u2019t hit unless you cross him, and no one\u2019s fool enough to do that. Not more than once, anyroad.\u201d Her gaze lingered for a moment on Brianna\u2019s torn dress, one brow lifting sardonically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that,\u201d Brianna said dryly, and pulled the edge of her ripped chemise up higher. She glimpsed a glass bottle amid the rubble on the desk, filled with a clear liquid, containing a small round object. She leaned closer to look at it, frowning. It couldn\u2019t be . . . but it was. A round, fleshy object, rather like a hard-boiled egg, a pinkish-gray in color\u2014with a neat round hole drilled completely through it.</p><p>She crossed herself, feeling faint.</p><p>\u201cI was that surprised,\u201d the whore went on, eyeing Brianna with open curiosity. \u201cHe\u2019s never had two girls together, so far as I know, and he\u2019s not one as wants someone to watch while he\u2019s at his pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Brianna began, but then stopped, not wanting to offend the woman.</p> <p>\u201cNot a whore?\u201d The young woman grinned broadly, exposing the black gap of her missing tooth. \u201cI might ha\u2019 guessed as much, chickie. Not as it would make no never mind to Stephen. He sows as he likes, and I can see as how he might like you. Most men would.\u201d She looked at Brianna with dispassionate assessment, nodding at her disheveled hair, flushed face, and tidy figure.</p><p>\u201cI expect they like you, too,\u201d Brianna said politely, with a faint feeling of surreality. \u201cEr . . . what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHepzibah,\u201d the woman said with an air of pride. \u201cOr Eppie, for short, like.\u201d There were coins still on the desk, but the whore left them alone. Bonnet might be generous, but evidently the whore didn\u2019t want to take advantage of him\u2014more likely a sign of fear than of friendship, Brianna thought. She took a deep breath and pressed on.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely name. Pleased to meet you, Eppie.\u201d She held out a hand. \u201cMy name is Brianna Fraser MacKenzie.\u201d She gave all three names, hoping the whore would remember at least one of them.</p><p>The woman glanced at the extended hand in puzzlement, then gingerly shook it, dropping it like a dead fish. She pulled up her skirt, and began to clean herself with the rag, fastidiously wiping away all trace of the recent encounter.</p><p>Brianna leaned closer, bracing herself against the odors of the stained rag, the woman\u2019s body, and the hot smell of liquor on her breath.</p><p>\u201cStephen Bonnet kidnapped me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d said the whore, indifferent. \u201cWell, he takes as he likes, does Stephen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to get away,\u201d Brianna said, keeping her voice low, with a glance at the cabin door. She could hear the sound of feet on the deck overhead, and hoped voices wouldn\u2019t carry through the heavy planks.</p><p>Eppie wadded up the rag and dropped it on the desk. She rummaged in her pocket, coming out with a small bottle stoppered with a plug of wax. She still held her skirts up, and Brianna could see the silvery streaks of stretch marks across her plump belly.</p><p>\u201cWell, give him what he wants, then,\u201d the whore advised, taking out the plug and pouring a bit of the bottle\u2019s contents\u2014a surprisingly mild scent of rosewater\u2014into her hand. \u201cChances are he\u2019ll tire of ye in a few days and put ye ashore.\u201d She wiped the rosewater lavishly over her pubic hair, then sniffed critically at her hand and made a face.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, that\u2019s not what he kidnapped me for. I don\u2019t think,\u201d she added.</p><p>Eppie recorked the bottle, and dropped both it and the rag into her pocket.</p><p>\u201cOh, he means to ransom you?\u201d Eppie eyed her with a little more interest. \u201cStill, I\u2019ve never known scruples interfere with the man\u2019s appetite. He\u2019d take a virgin\u2019s maidenhead and sell her back to her father before her belly started swelling.\u201d She pursed her lips, a belated thought coming to her.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you talk him out of havin\u2019 you, then?\u201d</p><p>Brianna put a hand on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI told him I was pregnant. That stopped him. I wouldn\u2019t have thought\u2014a man like that\u2014but it did. Perhaps he\u2019s better than you think?\u201d she asked with a wisp of hope.</p><p>Eppie laughed at that, small eyes squeezing half-shut with hilarity at the thought.</p><p>\u201cStephen? God, no!\u201d She sniffed with amusement, and smoothed down her skirts.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she went on, more matter-of-factly, \u201cbest story you could tell, though, if you don\u2019t want him at you. He called me down to him once, then put me off when he saw I\u2019d a cake in the oven\u2014when I joked him about it, he said he\u2019d once taken a whore with her belly the size of a cannonball, and right in the midst of it, she give a groan and the blood come spurting out of her fit to drench the room. Put him right off, he said, and no wonder. Left our Stephen with a horror of swiving girls what are up the spout. He\u2019s takin\u2019 no chances, see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A trickle of sweat ran down Brianna\u2019s cheek, and she wiped it away with the back of her hand. Her mouth felt dry, and she sucked the inside of her cheek for moisture. \u201cThe woman\u2014what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Hepzibah looked blank for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, the whore? Why, she died, of course, poor cow. Stephen said as how he was struggling to get into his wet breeches, all soused with blood like they were, and he looked up and saw her layin\u2019 still as stone on the floor, but with her belly still wriggling and twitching like a bag full o\u2019 snakes. Said it come to him sudden that the babe meant to come out and take its revenge on him, and he fled the house right then in his shirt, leavin\u2019 his breeches behind.\u201d</p><p>She chortled at this amusing vision, then snorted and settled herself, brushing down her skirts. \u201cBut then, Stephen\u2019s Irish,\u201d she added tolerantly. \u201cThey take morbid fancies, the Irish, especially when they\u2019re gone in drink.\u201d The tip of her tongue came out and passed reminiscently over her lower lip, tasting the lingering traces of Bonnet\u2019s liquor.</p><p>Brianna leaned closer, holding out her hand.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Hepzibah glanced into her hand, then looked again, riveted. The thick gold band with its big cabochon ruby winked and glowed in the lantern light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d Brianna said, lowering her voice, \u201cif you\u2019ll do something for me.\u201d</p><p>The whore licked her lips again, a sudden look of alertness coming into her heavy face.</p><p>\u201cAye? Do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet word to my husband. He\u2019s in Edenton, at the Reverend McMillan\u2019s house\u2014anyone will know where it is. Tell him where I am, and tell him\u2014\u201d She hesitated. What should she say? There was no telling how long the Anemone would stay here, or where Bonnet would choose to go next. The only clue she had was what she had overheard in his conversation with his mate, just before he came in.</p><p>\u201cTell them I think he has a hiding place on Ocracoke. He means to rendezvous with someone there at the dark of the moon. Tell him that.\u201d</p><p>Hepzibah cast an uneasy glance at the cabin door, but it stayed shut. She looked back at the ring, longing for it warring in her face with an obvious fear of Bonnet.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t know,\u201d Brianna urged. \u201cHe won\u2019t find out. And my father will reward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rich man, then, your father?\u201d Brianna saw the look of calculation in the whore\u2019s eyes, and felt a moment\u2019s misgiving\u2014what if she should simply take the ring and betray her to Bonnet? Still, she hadn\u2019t taken more money than her due; perhaps she was honest. And there was no choice, after all.</p><p>\u201cVery rich,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cHis name is Jamie Fraser. My aunt is rich, too. She has a plantation called River Run, just above Cross Creek in North Carolina. Ask for Mrs. Innes\u2014Jocasta Cameron Innes. Yes, if you don\u2019t find Ro\u2014my husband, send word there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiver Run.\u201d Hepzibah repeated it obediently, eyes still fixed on the ring.</p><p>Brianna twisted it off and dropped it into the whore\u2019s palm before she could change her mind. The woman\u2019s hand closed tight around it.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s name is Jamie Fraser; my husband is Roger MacKenzie,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAt the Reverend McMillan\u2019s house. Can you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFraser and MacKenzie,\u201d Hepzibah repeated uncertainly. \u201cOh, aye, to be sure.\u201d She was already moving toward the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Brianna said urgently.</p><p>The whore nodded but without looking at her, then sidled through the door, shutting it behind her.</p><p>The ship creaked and swayed underfoot, and she heard the rattle of wind through the trees on the shore, over the shouts of drunken men. Her knees gave way then and she sat down on the bed, careless of the sheets.</p><p>THEY LEFT WITH the tide; she heard the anchor chain rumble and felt the ship quicken, taking life as her sails took wind. Glued to the window, she watched the dark green mass of Roanoke recede. A hundred years before, the first English colony had landed here\u2014and disappeared without trace. The governor of the colony, returning from England with supplies, had found everyone gone, leaving no clue save the word \u201cCroatan\u201d carved into the trunk of a tree.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even leaving that much. Heartsick, she watched until the island sank into the sea.</p><p>No one came for some hours. Empty-bellied, she grew nauseated, and threw up in the chamber pot. She could not bear the thought of lying down on those revolting sheets, but instead pulled them off, remade the bed with only the quilts, and lay down.</p><p>The windows were open, and the fresh air of the sea stirred her hair and lifted the clamminess from her skin, making her feel a little better. She was unbearably conscious of her womb, a small, heavy, tender weight, and what was likely happening inside it: that orderly dance of dividing cells, a sort of peaceful violence, implacably wresting lives and wrenching hearts.</p><p>When had it happened? She tried to think back, remember. It might have been the night before Roger left for Edenton. He had been excited, almost exalted, and they had made love with lingering joy, spiced by longing, for they both knew the morrow would bring separation. She had fallen asleep in his arms, feeling loved.</p><p>But then she had waked alone, in the middle of the night, to find him sitting by the window, bathed in the light of a gibbous moon. She had been reluctant to disturb his private contemplation, but he had turned, feeling her eyes on him, and something in his look had made her get out of bed and go to him, taking his head against her bosom, holding him.</p><p>He had risen then, laid her on the floor, and had her again, wordless and urgent.</p><p>Catholic that she was, she had found it terribly erotic, the notion of seducing a priest on the eve of his ordination, stealing him\u2014if only for a moment\u2014from God.</p><p>She swallowed, hands clasped over her belly. Be careful what you pray for. The nuns at school had always told the children that.</p><p>The wind was growing cold, chilling her, and she pulled the edge of one quilt\u2014the cleanest\u2014over her. Then, concentrating fiercely, she began very carefully to pray.</p><p>103</p><p>PUT TO THE QUESTION</p><p>NEIL FORBES sat in the parlor of the King\u2019s Inn, enjoying a glass of hard cider and the feeling that all was right with the world. He had had a most fruitful meeting with Samuel Iredell and his friend, two of the most prominent rebel leaders in Edenton\u2014and an even more fruitful meeting with Gilbert Butler and William Lyons, local smugglers.</p><p>He had a great fondness for jewels, and in private celebration of his elegant disposal of the threat of Jamie Fraser, he had bought a new stickpin, topped with a beautiful ruby. He contemplated this with quiet satisfaction, noting the lovely shadows that the stone cast on the silk of his ruffle.</p><p>His mother was safely planted at her sister\u2019s house, he had an appointment for luncheon with a local lady, and an hour to spare beforehand. Perhaps a stroll to stimulate appetite; it was a beautiful day.</p><p>He had in fact pushed back his chair and begun to rise when a large hand planted itself in the center of his chest and shoved him back into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d He looked up in indignation\u2014and took great care to keep that expression on his face, despite a sudden deep qualm. A tall, dark man was standing over him, wearing a most unfriendly expression. MacKenzie, the chit\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you, sir?\u201d he said, belligerent. \u201cI must demand apology!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou demand what ye like,\u201d MacKenzie said. He was pale under his tan, and grim. \u201cWhere is my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Forbes\u2019s heart was beating fast, but with glee as much as trepidation. He lifted his chin and made to rise. \u201cYou will excuse me, sir.\u201d</p><p>A hand on his arm stopped him, and he turned, looking into the face of Fraser\u2019s nephew, Ian Murray. Murray smiled, and Forbes\u2019s sense of self-satisfaction diminished slightly. They said the boy had lived with the Mohawk, become one of them\u2014that he dwelt with a vicious wolf who spoke to him and obeyed his commands, that he had cut a man\u2019s heart out and eaten it in some heathen ritual.</p><p>Looking at the lad\u2019s homely face and disheveled dress, though, Forbes was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cRemove your hand from my person, sir,\u201d he said with dignity, straightening in his chair.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I won\u2019t,\u201d Murray said. The hand tightened on his arm like the bite of a horse, and Forbes\u2019s mouth opened, though he made no sound.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye done with my cousin?\u201d Murray said.</p><p>\u201cI? Why, I\u2014I have nothing whatever to do with Mrs. MacKenzie. Let go, God damn you!\u201d</p><p>The grip relaxed, and he sat breathing heavily. MacKenzie had pulled up a chair to face him and sat down.</p><p>Forbes smoothed the sleeve of his coat, avoiding MacKenzie\u2019s stare and thinking rapidly. How had they found out? Or had they? Perhaps they were only trying a venture, with no sure knowledge.</p><p>\u201cI am grieved to hear that any misfortune might have befallen Mrs. MacKenzie,\u201d he said politely. \u201cAm I to take it that you have somehow misplaced her?\u201d</p><p>MacKenzie looked him up and down for a moment without answering, then made a small sound of contempt.</p><p>\u201cI heard ye speak in Mecklenberg,\u201d he said, his tone conversational. \u201cVery glib ye were. A great deal about justice, I heard, and protection of our wives and children. Such eloquence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine talk,\u201d Ian Murray put in, \u201cfor a man who would abduct a helpless woman.\u201d He was still crouching on the floor like a savage, but had moved round a little, so as to stare directly into Forbes\u2019s face. The lawyer found it slightly unnerving, and chose instead to meet MacKenzie\u2019s eyes, man to man.</p><p>\u201cI regret your misfortune extremely, sir,\u201d he said, striving for a tone of concern. \u201cI should be pleased to help, in any way possible, of course. But I do not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Stephen Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>The question struck Forbes like a blow to the liver. He gaped for a moment, thinking that he had made a mistake in choosing MacKenzie to look at; that flat green gaze was like a snake\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWho is Stephen Bonnet?\u201d he asked, licking his lips. His lips were dry, but the rest of him was heavily bedewed; he could feel sweat pooling in the creases of his neck, soaking the cambric of his shirt beneath his oxters.</p><p>\u201cI heard ye, ken,\u201d Murray remarked pleasantly. \u201cWhen ye made the bargain wi\u2019 Richard Brown. In your warehouse, it was.\u201d</p><p>Forbes\u2019s head snapped round. He was so shocked that it was a moment before he realized that Murray was holding a knife, laid casually across his knee.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You say\u2014what? I tell you, sir, you are mistaken\u2014mistaken!\u201d He half-rose, stammering. MacKenzie shot to his feet and seized him by the shirtfront, twisting.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said very softly, his face so close that Forbes felt the heat of his breath. \u201cIt is yourself has been mistaken. Most grievously mistaken, in choosing my wife to serve your wicked ends.\u201d</p><p>There was a ripping sound as the fine cambric tore. MacKenzie shoved him back violently into the chair, then leaned forward, seizing his neckcloth in a grip that threatened to choke him on the spot. His mouth opened, gasping, and black spots flickered in his vision\u2014but not sufficiently as to obscure those brilliant, cold green eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere has he taken her?\u201d</p><p>Forbes gripped the arms of his chair, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing about your wife,\u201d he said, his voice pitched low and venomous. \u201cAnd as for grievous error, sir, you are in the process of committing one. How dare you assault me? I shall prefer charges, I do assure you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, assault, forbye,\u201d Murray said, scoffing. \u201cWe havena done any such thing. Yet.\u201d He sat back on his haunches, tapping the knife thoughtfully against his thumbnail and regarding Forbes with an air of estimation, like one planning to carve a suckling pig on a platter.</p><p>Forbes set his jaw and glared up at MacKenzie, who was still standing, looming over him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a public place,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou cannot harm me without notice being taken.\u201d He glanced behind MacKenzie, hoping that someone would come into the parlor and interrupt this grossly uncomfortable t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, but it was a quiet morning, and all the chambermaids and ostlers inconveniently about their duties elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cDo we care if anyone notices, a charaid?\u201d Murray inquired, glancing up at MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Nonetheless, MacKenzie resumed his seat and resumed his stare. \u201cWe can wait a bit, though.\u201d He glanced at the case clock by the mantel, its pendulum moving with a serene tick-tock. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Belatedly, it occurred to Forbes to wonder where Jamie Fraser was.</p><p>ELSPETH FORBES was rocking gently on the veranda of her sister\u2019s house, enjoying the coolness of the morning air, when a visitor was announced.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mr. Fraser!\u201d she exclaimed, sitting up. \u201cWhat brings ye to Edenton? Is it Neil ye\u2019re in search of? He\u2019s gone to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, Mistress Forbes.\u201d He swept her a low bow, the morning sun gleaming off his hair as though it were bronze metal. \u201cIt is yourself I\u2019ve come for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Oh!\u201d She sat up in her chair, hastily brushing away crumbs of toast on her sleeve, and hoping her cap was on straight. \u201cWhy, sir, what could ye possibly want with an old woman?\u201d</p><p>He smiled\u2014such a nice-looking lad he was, so fine in his gray coatie, and that look of mischief in his eyes\u2014and leaned close to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to steal ye away, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, awa\u2019 with ye!\u201d She flapped a hand at him, laughing, and he took it, kissing her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI shallna take \u2018no\u2019 for answer, now,\u201d he assured her, and gestured toward the edge of the porch, where he had left a large, promising-looking basket, covered with a checkered cloth. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to eat my luncheon in the country, under a tree. I\u2019ve the very tree in mind\u2014a braw, fine tree\u2014but it\u2019s a poor meal, taken without company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely to goodness ye could find better company than mine, lad,\u201d she said, thoroughly charmed. \u201cAnd where\u2019s your dear wife, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s left me,\u201d he said, affecting sorrow. \u201cHere\u2019s me, with a wonderful picnic planned, and her off to a birthing. So I said to myself, well, Jamie, it\u2019s shame to waste such a feast\u2014who might be at liberty to share it with ye? And what should I see next but your most elegant self, taking your ease. An answer to prayer, it was; surely ye wouldna go against heavenly guidance, Mistress Forbes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d she said, trying not to laugh at him. \u201cOch, well. If it\u2019s a matter of wasting . . .\u201d</p><p>Before she could say more, he had stooped down and plucked her from her chair, lifting her in his arms. She whooped with surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a proper abduction, I must carry ye away, aye?\u201d he said, smiling down at her.</p><p>To her mortification, the sound she made could be called nothing but a giggle. He seemed not to mind, though, and bending to sweep up the basket in one strong hand, carried her like a bit of thistledown out to his carriage.</p><p>\u201cYOU CANNOT KEEP ME prisoner here! Let me pass, or I will shout for help!\u201d</p><p>They had, in fact, held him for more than an hour, blocking all attempts on his part to rise and leave. He was right, though, Roger thought; traffic was beginning to pick up in the street outside, and he could hear\u2014as could Forbes\u2014the noises of a maid setting out the tables for dinner in the next room.</p><p>He glanced at Ian. They had discussed it; if word hadn\u2019t come within an hour, they would have to try to remove Forbes from the inn, take him to a more private place. That could be a dicey business; the lawyer was intimidated, but stubborn as a ball bearing. And he would call for help.</p><p>Ian pursed his lips thoughtfully, and drew the knife he had been playing with down the side of his breeches, polishing the blade.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie?\u201d A small boy had popped up beside him like a mushroom, dirt-smeared and round-faced.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, a wave of thankfulness washing through him. \u201cHave ye got something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d The urchin handed over a small twist of paper, accepted a coin in return, and was gone, in spite of Forbes\u2019s call of \u201cWait, boy!\u201d</p><p>The lawyer had half-risen from his seat in agitation. Roger made a sharp move toward him, though, and he sank back at once, not waiting to be pushed. Good, Roger thought grimly, he was learning.</p><p>Undoing the twist of paper, he found himself holding a large brooch in the shape of a bunch of flowers, done in garnets and silver. It was a good piece of workmanship, but rather ugly. Its impression on Forbes, though, was substantial.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t.\u201d The lawyer was staring at the brooch in Roger\u2019s hand, his heavy face gone pale.</p><p>\u201cOh, I expect he would, if ye mean Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian Murray said. \u201cHe\u2019s fond of his daughter, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d The lawyer was making a game attempt to bluff it out, but he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the brooch. \u201cFraser is a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Highlander,\u201d Roger said brutally. \u201cLike your father, aye?\u201d He\u2019d heard stories about the elder Forbes, who by all accounts had escaped Scotland just ahead of the hangsman.</p><p>Forbes chewed his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cHe would not harm an old woman,\u201d he said, with as much bravado as he could summon.</p><p>\u201cWould he not?\u201d Ian\u2019s sketchy brows lifted. \u201cAye, perhaps not. He might just send her awa\u2019, though\u2014to Canada, maybe? Ye seem to ken him fair weel, Mr. Forbes. What d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>The lawyer drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair, breathing through his teeth, evidently reviewing what he knew of Jamie Fraser\u2019s character and reputation.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cAll right!\u201d</p><p>Roger felt the tension running through him snap like a cut wire. He\u2019d been strung like a puppet since Jamie had come to fetch him last night.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he said, feeling breathless. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d Forbes said hoarsely. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have her harmed.\u201d He looked up, wild-eyed. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I wouldn\u2019t harm her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Roger clamped the brooch tight, not caring that its edges cut into his hand. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The lawyer sagged like a half-filled bag of meal.</p><p>\u201cAboard a ship called Anemone, Captain Bonnet.\u201d He swallowed hard, unable to keep his eyes away from the brooch. \u201cShe\u2014I told\u2014they are bound for England. But she is safe, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>Shock tightened Roger\u2019s grip, and he felt the sudden slick of blood on his fingers. He flung the brooch onto the floor, wiping his hand on his breeches, struggling for words. The shock had tightened his throat, as well; he felt as though he were strangling.</p><p>Seeing his trouble, Ian stood abruptly and pressed his knife against the lawyer\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cWhen did they sail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d The lawyer\u2019s mouth opened and closed at random, and he looked helplessly from Ian to Roger, eyes bulging.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Roger forced the word past the blockage in his throat, and Forbes flinched at the sound.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014she was put aboard here. In Edenton. Two\u2014two days ago.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded abruptly. Safe, he said. In Bonnet\u2019s hands. Two days, in Bonnet\u2019s hands. But he had sailed with Bonnet, he thought, trying to steady himself, keep a grip on his rationality. He knew how the man worked. Bonnet was a smuggler; he would not sail for England without a full cargo. He might\u2014might\u2014be going down the coast, picking up small shipments before turning to the open sea and the long voyage for England.</p><p>And if not\u2014he might still be caught, with a fast ship.</p><p>No time to be lost; people on the docks might know where the Anemone was headed next. He turned and took a step toward the door. Then a red wave washed through him and he whirled back, smashing his fist into Forbes\u2019s face with the full weight of his body behind it.</p><p>The lawyer gave a high-pitched scream, and clutched both hands to his nose. All noises in the inn and in the street seemed to stop; the world hung suspended. Roger took a short, deep breath, rubbing his knuckles, and nodded once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ian.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d</p><p>Roger was halfway to the door when he realized that Ian was not with him. He looked back, and was just in time to see his cousin-by-marriage take Forbes gently by one ear and cut it off.</p><p>104</p> <p>SLEEPING WITH A SHARK</p><p>STEPHEN BONNET was as good as his word\u2014if that\u2019s how one would describe it. He made no sexual advances toward her, but did insist that she share his bed.</p><p>\u201cI like a warm body in the night,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ye might prefer my bed to the cargo hold, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She would most emphatically have preferred the cargo hold, though her explorations\u2014once free of land, she was allowed out of the cabin\u2014had revealed the hold as a dark and comfortless hole, in which several hapless slaves were chained among a collection of boxes and barrels, in constant danger of being crushed should the cargo shift.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, miss? And what will happen when we get there?\u201d Josh spoke in Gaelic, his handsome face small and frightened in the shadows of the hold.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to Ocracoke,\u201d she said in the same language. \u201cBeyond that\u2014I don\u2019t know. Do you still have your rosary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, miss.\u201d He touched his chest, where the crucifix hung. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that keeps me from despair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Keep praying.\u201d She glanced at the other slaves: two women, two men, all with slender bodies and delicate, fine-boned faces. She had brought food for Josh from her own supper, but had nothing to offer them, and was troubled.</p><p>\u201cDo they feed you down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss. Fairly well,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cDo they\u201d\u2014she moved her chin a little, delicately indicating the other slaves\u2014\u201cknow anything? About where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, miss. I can\u2019t talk to them. They\u2019re African\u2014Fulani, I can see that from the way they look, but that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well . . .\u201d She hesitated, eager to be out of the dark, clammy hold, but reluctant to leave the young groom there.</p><p>\u201cYou go along, miss,\u201d he said quietly in English, seeing her doubt. \u201cI be fine. We all be fine.\u201d He touched his rosary, and did his best to give her a smile, though it wavered round the edges. \u201cHoly Mother see us safe.\u201d</p><p>Having no words of comfort to impart, she nodded, and climbed the ladder into the sunlight, feeling five sets of eyes upon her.</p><p>Bonnet, thank God, spent most of his time on deck during the day. She could see him now, coming down the rigging like a nimble ape.</p><p>She stood very still, no movement save the brush of windblown hair, of skirts against her frozen limbs. He was as sensitive to the movements of her body as was Roger\u2014but in his own way. The way of a shark, signaled to and drawn by the flappings of its prey.</p><p>She had spent one night in his bed so far, sleepless. He had pulled her casually against himself, said, \u201cGood night, darlin\u2019,\u201d and fallen instantly asleep. Whenever she had tried to move, to extricate herself from his grip, though, he had shifted, moving with her, to keep her firmly by him.</p><p>She was obliged to an unwelcome intimacy with his body, an acquaintance that awoke memories she had with great difficulty put away\u2014the feel of his knee pushing her thighs apart, the rough joviality of his touch between her legs, the sun-bleached blond hairs that curled crisply on his thighs and forearms, the unwashed, musky male smell of him. The mocking presence of LeRoi, rising at intervals during the night, pressed in firm and mindless hunger against her buttocks.</p> <p>She had a moment of intense thankfulness, both for her present pregnancy\u2014for she was in no doubt of it now\u2014and for her certain knowledge that Stephen Bonnet had not fathered Jemmy.</p><p>He dropped from the rigging with a thud, saw her, and smiled. He said nothing, but squeezed her bottom familiarly as he passed, making her clench her teeth and cling to the rail.</p><p>Ocracoke, at the dark of the moon. She looked up into the brilliant sky, wheeling with clouds of terns and gulls; they could not be far offshore. How long, for God\u2019s sake, \u2019til the dark of the moon?</p><p>105</p><p>THE PRODIGAL</p><p>THEY HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING persons familiar with Anemone and her captain. Stephen Bonnet was well-known on the Edenton docks, though his reputation varied, depending on his associations. An honest captain was the usual opinion, but hard in his dealings. A blockade runner, a smuggler, said others\u2014and whether that was good or bad depended on the politics of the person saying it. He\u2019d get you anything, they said\u2014for a price.</p><p>Pirate, said a few. But those few spoke in low tones, looking frequently over their shoulders, and strongly desired not to be quoted.</p><p>The Anemone had left quite openly, with a homely cargo of rice and fifty barrels of smoked fish. Roger had found one man who recalled seeing the young woman go aboard with one of Bonnet\u2019s hands: \u201cGreat huge doxy, with flaming hair a-loose, flowing down to her arse,\u201d the man had said, smacking his lips. \u201cMr. Bonnet\u2019s a good-size man himself, though; expect he can handle her.\u201d</p><p>Only Ian\u2019s hand on his arm had stopped him hitting the man.</p><p>What they had not yet found was anyone who knew for sure where Anemone was headed.</p><p>\u201cLondon, I think,\u201d said the harbormaster, dubious. \u201cBut not directly; he\u2019s not yet got a full cargo. Likely he\u2019ll be going down the coast, trading here and there\u2014perhaps sail for Europe from Charlestown. But then again,\u201d the man added, rubbing his chin, \u201ccould be he\u2019s bound for New England. Terrible risky business, getting anything into Boston these days\u2014but well worth it if you do. Rice and smoked fish like to be worth their weight in gold up there, if you can get it ashore without the navy\u2019s warships blowing you out of the water.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, looking a little pale, thanked the man. Roger, unable to speak for the knot in his throat, merely nodded, and followed his father-in-law out of the harbormaster\u2019s office, back into the sun of the docks.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Ian asked, stifling a belch. He had been trawling through the dockside taverns, buying beer for casual laborers who might have helped load Anemone, or who might have spoken with her hands regarding her destination.</p><p>\u201cThe best I can think of is maybe for you and Roger Mac to take ship down the coast,\u201d Jamie said, frowning at the masts of the sloops and packet boats rocking at anchor. \u201cClaire and I could go up, toward Boston.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, still unable to speak. It was far from being a good plan, particularly in light of the disruption the undeclared war was having on shipping\u2014but the need of doing something was acute. He felt as though the marrow of his bones was burning; only movement would quench it.</p><p>To hire a small ship\u2014even a fishing smack\u2014or take passage on a packet boat, though, was expensive business.</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d Jamie curled his hand in his pocket, where the black diamond still lay. \u201cI\u2019ll go and see Judge Iredell; he can maybe put me in touch with an honest banker who\u2019ll advance me money against the sale of the stone. Let\u2019s go and tell Claire what\u2019s to do, first.\u201d</p><p>As they turned off the docks, though, a voice hailed Roger.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie!\u201d</p><p>He turned, to find the Reverend Doctor McCorkle, his secretary, and the Reverend McMillan, carrying bags, all staring at him.</p><p>There was a brief scuffle of introduction\u2014they had of course met Jamie when he came to fetch Roger, but not Ian\u2014and then a slightly awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Roger cleared his throat, addressing the elder. \u201cYou are leaving, then, sir? For the Indies?\u201d</p><p>McCorkle nodded, his large, kindly face set in concern.</p><p>\u201cI am, sir. I regret so much that I must go\u2014and that you were not able to\u2014well.\u201d Both McCorkle and the Reverend McMillan had tried to persuade him to return to them the day before, to take his place at the service of ordination. But he could not. Could not spare hours to such a thing, could not possibly engage himself to undertake the commitment with anything less than a single mind\u2014and while his mind was in fact single just now, it was not toward God. There was room in his heart just now for only one thing\u2014Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWell, doubtless it is God\u2019s will,\u201d McCorkle said with a sigh. \u201cYour wife, Mr. MacKenzie? There is no word of her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and muttered acknowledgment of their concern, their promises to pray for him and for the safe return of his wife.He was too much worried to find this much solace, yet still, he was touched by their kindness, and parted from them with many good wishes in both directions.</p><p>Roger, Jamie, and Ian walked silently back toward the inn where they had left Claire.</p><p>\u201cJust by way of curiosity, Ian, what did ye do with Forbes\u2019s ear?\u201d Jamie asked, breaking the silence as they turned into the wide street where the inn was.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have it safe, Uncle,\u201d Ian assured him, patting the small leather pouch at his belt.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of G\u2014\u201d Roger stopped abruptly, then resumed. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it with me until we find my cousin,\u201d Ian said, seeming surprised that this was not obvious. \u201cIt will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, serious.</p><p>\u201cWhen ye set about a difficult quest\u2014if ye\u2019re Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, I mean\u2014ye generally go aside for a time, to fast and pray for guidance. We havena time to be doing that now, of course. But often, while ye\u2019re doing that, ye choose a talisman\u2014or to be right about it, it chooses you\u2014\u201d He sounded completely matter-of-fact about this procedure, Roger noted.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye carry it with ye through the quest, to keep the attention of the spirits upon your desire and ensure your success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Jamie rubbed the bridge of his nose. He appeared\u2014like Roger\u2014to be wondering what the Mohawk spirits might make of Neil Forbes\u2019s ear. It would, probably, ensure their attention, at least. \u201cThe ear . . . did ye pack it in salt, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, I smoked it over the kitchen fire at the inn last night. Dinna fash yourself, Uncle Jamie; it will keep.\u201d</p><p>Roger found a perverse sort of comfort in this conversation. Between the prayers of the Presbyterian clergy and the support of the Mohawk spirits, perhaps they had a chance\u2014but it was the presence of his two kinsmen, stalwart and determined on either side of him, that kept him in hope. They would not give up until Brianna was found, no matter what it took.</p><p>He swallowed the lump in his throat for the thousandth time since hearing the news, thinking of Jemmy. The little boy was safe at River Run\u2014but how could he tell Jem that his mother was gone? Well . . . he wouldn\u2019t, that was all. They\u2019d find her.</p><p>In this mood of resolution, he led the way through the door of the Brewster, only to be hailed again.</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d</p><p>This time, it was Claire\u2019s voice, sharp with excitement. He turned at once, to see her rising from a bench in the taproom. Seated across the table from her were a plump young woman and a slightly built young man with a cap of tightly curled black hair. Manfred McGillivray.</p><p>\u201cI SAW YE BEFORE, sir, two days ago.\u201d Manfred bobbed his head apologetically toward Jamie. \u201cI . . . er . . . well, I hid myself, sir, and I do regret it. But of course, I\u2019d no way of knowing, until Eppie came back from Roanoke and showed me the ring. . . .\u201d</p><p>The ring lay on the table, its cabochon ruby casting a tiny, calm pool of ruddy light on the boards. Roger picked it up and turned it in his fingers. He barely heard the explanations\u2014that Manfred lived with the whore, who made periodic expeditions to the ports near Edenton, and upon seeing the ring had overcome his sense of shame and come to find Jamie\u2014too much overcome by this small, hard, tangible evidence of Brianna.</p><p>Roger closed his fingers over it, finding the warmth of it a comfort, and came to himself in time to hear Hepzibah say earnestly, \u201cOcracoke, sir. At the dark of the moon.\u201d She coughed modestly, ducking her head. \u201cThe lady did say, sir, as you might feel some gratitude for the news of her whereabouts. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll be paid, and paid well,\u201d Jamie assured her, though he was clearly giving her no more than a fraction of his attention. \u201cThe dark of the moon,\u201d he said, turning to Ian. \u201cTen days?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, his face shining with excitement.</p><p>\u201cAye, about that. She didna ken whereabouts on Ocracoke Island this was?\u201d he asked the whore.</p><p>Eppie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNay, sir. I ken Stephen\u2019s got a house there, a large one, hidden in the trees, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find it.\u201d Roger\u2019s own voice surprised him; he hadn\u2019t meant to speak aloud.</p><p>Manfred had been looking uneasy throughout. He leaned forward, putting his hand on top of Eppie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014when ye do find it . . . ye\u2019ll not say to anybody, will ye, about Eppie telling ye? Mr. Bonnet\u2019s a dangerous man, and I wouldna have her imperiled from him.\u201d He glanced at the young woman, who blushed and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t say anything about her,\u201d Claire assured him. She had been scrutinizing both Manfred and Hepzibah carefully while they talked, and now leaned across the table to touch Manfred\u2019s forehead, which showed a stippling of some sort of rash. \u201cSpeaking of peril . . . she\u2019s in a great deal more danger from you, young man, than from Stephen Bonnet. Did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>Manfred went a little paler, and for the first time, Roger noticed that the young man looked truly ill, his face thin and deeply lined.</p><p>\u201cI did, Frau Fraser. From the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, about the pox?\u201d Hepzibah affected nonchalance, though Roger could see her hand tighten on Manfred\u2019s. \u201cAye, he did tell me. But I says to him as it makes no difference. I daresay I\u2019ve had a few men what are poxed before, not knowing. If I should get it . . . well. God\u2019s will, innit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said to her quite gently. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. But you\u2019ll go with Mrs. Claire, you and Manfred both, and do exactly what she tells you. Ye\u2019ll be all right, and so will he. Won\u2019t they?\u201d he asked, turning to Claire, suddenly a little uncertain.</p><p>\u201cYes, they will,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cFortunately, I have quite a bit of penicillin with me.\u201d</p><p>Manfred\u2019s face was a study in confusion.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014do ye mean, meine Frau, that ye can\u2014can cure it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly what I mean,\u201d Claire assured him, \u201cas I tried to tell you before you ran away.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hung open, and he blinked. Then he turned to Hepzibah, who was staring at him in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cLiebchen! I can go home! We can go home,\u201d he amended quickly, seeing her face change. \u201cWe will be married. We will go home,\u201d he repeated, in the tones of one seeing a beatific vision but not quite trusting in its reality yet.</p><p>Eppie was frowning in uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a whore, Freddie,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd from the stories you tell about your mother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather think that Frau Ute will be so happy to have Manfred back that she won\u2019t be disposed to ask too many questions,\u201d Claire said, with a glance at Jamie. \u201cThe Prodigal Son, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe won\u2019t need to be a whore any longer,\u201d Manfred assured her. \u201cI\u2019m a gunsmith; I\u2019ll earn a good living. Now that I know I shall be living!\u201d His thin face was suddenly suffused with joy, and he flung his arms around Eppie and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, flustered, but looking pleased. \u201cWell. Hm. This . . . er . . . this penny\u2014?\u201d She looked inquiringly at Claire.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner, the better,\u201d Claire said, standing up. \u201cCome with me.\u201d Her own face was a little flushed, Roger saw, and she put out a quick hand to Jamie, who took it and pressed it hard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and see to things,\u201d he said, glancing at Ian and Roger in turn. \u201cWith luck, we\u2019ll sail this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Eppie had already stood up to follow Claire, but at this reminder of their business, she turned to Jamie, a hand to her mouth. \u201cOh. I\u2019ve thought of the one more thing.\u201d Her pleasant round face was puckered in concentration. \u201cThere are wild horses that run near the house. On Ocracoke. I heard Stephen speak o\u2019 them once.\u201d She looked from one man to the other. \u201cMight that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThank you\u2014and God bless you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were outside, heading for the docks again, that he realized the ring was still clutched tight in his hand. What was it Ian had said?</p><p>\u201cYe choose a talisman\u2014or to be right about it, it chooses you.\u201d</p><p>His hands were slightly bigger than Brianna\u2019s, but he pushed the ring onto his finger, and closed his hand around it.</p><p>SHE WOKE FROM a damp and restless sleep, mother-sense at once aroused. She was halfway out of bed, moving by instinct toward Jemmy\u2019s trundle, when a hand grabbed her wrist, a convulsive grip like the bite of a crocodile.</p><p>She jerked back, groggy and alarmed. The sound of footsteps came to her from the deck overhead and she realized belatedly that the sound of distress that had wakened her had not come from Jemmy, but from the darkness at her side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he whispered, and the fingers dug deep into the soft flesh of her inner wrist.</p><p>Unable to wrench free, she reached out with the other hand, to push him away. She touched damp hair, hot skin\u2014and a trickle of wetness, cool and surprising on her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered back, and leaned toward him by instinct. She reached again, touched his head, smoothed his hair\u2014all the things she had waked prepared to do. She felt her hand rest on him and thought to stop, but did not. It was as though the spurt of maternal comfort, once called forth, could not be pressed back into her, no more than the spurt of breast milk summoned by an infant\u2019s cry could be recalled to its source.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She kept her voice low, and as impersonal as the words allowed. She lifted her hand, and he moved, rolling toward her, pressing his head hard against the curve of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said again, and caught his breath in what might have been a sob. His voice was low and rough, but not as she had ever heard it before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Her trapped wrist was growing numb. She laid her free hand on his shoulder, hoping he would let go if she seemed willing to stay.</p><p>He did relax his grip, but only to reach out and seize her by the waist, pulling her back into bed. She went, because there was no choice, and lay in silence, Bonnet\u2019s breathing harsh and warm on the back of her neck.</p><p>At length, he let go and rolled onto his back with a sigh, allowing her to move. She rolled onto her own back, cautious, trying to keep a few inches between them. Moonlight came through the stern windows in a silver flood, and she could see the silhouette of his face, catch the glint of light from forehead and cheek as he turned his head.</p><p>\u201cBad dream?\u201d she ventured. She\u2019d meant to sound sarcastic, but her own heart was still tripping fast from the alarm of the awakening, and the words had a tentative sound.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye,\u201d he said with a shuddering sigh. \u201cThe same. It comes to me over and over again, see? Ye\u2019d think I\u2019d know what it was about and wake, but I never do. Not \u2019til the waters close over my head.\u201d He rubbed a hand under his nose, sniffing like a child.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to ask for details, didn\u2019t want to encourage any further sense of intimacy. What she wanted, though, had nothing much to do with things anymore.</p><p>\u201cSince I was a lad, I\u2019ve dreamed of drowning,\u201d he said, and his voice, normally so assured, was unsteady. \u201cThe sea comes in, and I cannot move\u2014not at all. The tide\u2019s risin\u2019, and I know it will kill me, but there\u2019s no way to move.\u201d His hand clutched the sheet convulsively, pulling it away from her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gray water, full of mud, and there are blind things swimmin\u2019 in it. They\u2019re waitin\u2019 on the sea to finish its business wit\u2019 me, see\u2014and then they\u2019ve business of their own.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the horror of it in his voice, and was torn between wanting to edge farther away from him and the ingrained habit of offering comfort.</p><p>\u201cIt was only a dream,\u201d she said at last, staring up at the boards of the deck, no more than three feet above her head. If only this were a dream!</p><p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d he said, and his voice had dropped to little more than a whisper in the darkness beside her. \u201cAh, no. It\u2019s the sea herself. Callin\u2019 me, see?\u201d</p><p>Quite suddenly, he rolled toward her, seizing her and pressing her hard against him. She gasped, stiffening, and he pressed harder, responding, sharklike, to her struggles.</p><p>To her own horror, she felt LeRoi rising, and forced herself to be still. Panic and the need to escape his dream might all too easily make him forget his aversion to hav**g s*x with pregnant women, and that was the very last thing, the very last thing . . .</p><p>\u201cSshh,\u201d she said firmly, and clutched him round the head, forcing his face down into her shoulder, patting him, stroking his back. \u201cShh. It will be all right. It was only a dream. I won\u2019t let it hurt you\u2014I won\u2019t let anything hurt you. Hush, hush now.\u201d</p><p>She went on patting him, her eyes closed, trying to imagine herself holding Jemmy after such a nightmare, quiet in their cabin, the hearth fire low, Jem\u2019s little body relaxing in trust, the sweet little-boy smell of his hair near her face. . . .</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you drown,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI promise. I won\u2019t let you drown.\u201d</p><p>She said it over and over, and slowly, slowly, his breathing eased, and his grip on her slackened as sleep overcame him. Still she repeated it, a soft, hypnotic murmur, her words half-lost in the sound of water, hissing past the side of the ship, and she spoke no longer to the man beside her, but to the slumbering child within.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything hurt you. Nothing will hurt you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>106</p><p>RENDEZVOUS</p><p>ROGER PAUSED TO WIPE the sweat out of his eyes. He\u2019d tied a folded kerchief round his head, but the humidity in the thick growth of the tidal forest was so high that sweat formed in his eye sockets, stinging and blurring his vision.</p><p>From a taproom in Edenton, the knowledge that Bonnet was\u2014or would be\u2014on Ocracoke had seemed all heady conviction; the search narrowed suddenly to one tiny sandbar, versus the millions of other places the pirate could have been; how difficult could it be? Once on the bloody sandbar, the perspective had altered. The frigging island was narrow, but several miles long, with large patches of scrub forest, and most of its coastline fraught with hidden bars and dangerous eddies.</p><p>The skipper of the fishing boat they\u2019d hired had got them there in good time; then they\u2019d spent two days sailing up and down the length of the damn thing, looking for possible landing spots, likely pirate hideouts, and herds of wild horses. So far, none of these had appeared.</p><p>Having spent long enough retching over the side\u2014Claire hadn\u2019t brought her acupuncture needles, having not foreseen the need of them\u2014Jamie had insisted upon being put ashore. He would walk the length of the island, he said, keeping an eye out for anything untoward. They could pick him up at sundown.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you run smack into Stephen Bonnet, all on your own?\u201d Claire had demanded, when he refused to allow her to accompany him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be run through than puke to death,\u201d was Jamie\u2019s elegant reply, \u201cand besides, Sassenach, I need ye to stay here and make sure yon misbegotten son of a\u2014of a captain doesna sail away without us, aye?\u201d</p><p>So they had rowed him ashore and left him, watching as he strode away, staggering only slightly, into the thicket of scrub pines and palmetto.</p><p>Another day of frustration, spent sailing slowly up and down the coast, seeing nothing but the occasional ramshackle fishing shack, and Roger and Ian had begun to see the wisdom of Jamie\u2019s approach, as well.</p><p>\u201cSee yon houses?\u201d Ian pointed at a tiny cluster of shacks on the shore.</p><p>\u201cIf ye want to call them that, yes.\u201d Roger shaded his hand over his eyes to look, but the shacks looked deserted.</p><p>\u201cIf they can get boats off there, we can get one on. Let\u2019s go ashore and see will the folk there tell us anything.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Claire glowering behind them, they had rowed ashore to make inquiries\u2014to no avail. The only inhabitants of the tiny settlement were a few women and children, all of whom heard the name \u201cBonnet\u201d and scuttled into their homes like clams digging into the sand.</p><p>Still, having felt solid ground under their feet, they were less than eager to admit defeat and go back to the fishing shack. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look, then,\u201d Ian had said, gazing thoughtfully into the sun-striped forest. \u201cWe\u2019ll crisscross, aye?\u201d He drew a quick series of X\u2019s in the sand in illustration. \u201cWe\u2019ll cover more ground, and meet up every so often. Whoever reaches the shore first each time will wait on the other.\u201d</p><p>Roger had nodded agreement, and with a cheery wave at the fishing boat and the small, indignant figure on its bow, had turned inland.</p><p>It was hot and still under the pines, and his progress was impaired by all sorts of low bushes, creepers, patches of sandburs and other stickery things. The going was a little easier near the shore, as the forest thinned and gave way to stretches of coarse sea oats, with dozens of tiny crabs that scuttled out of his way\u2014or occasionally crunched under his feet.</p><p>Still, it was a relief to move, to feel that somehow he was doing something, was making progress toward finding Bree\u2014though he admitted to himself that he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what they were looking for. Was she here? Had Bonnet arrived on the island already? Or would he be coming in a day or two, at the dark of the moon, as Hepzibah had said?</p><p>Despite the worry, the heat, and the millions of gnats and mosquitoes\u2014they didn\u2019t bite, for the most part, but insisted upon crawling into his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth\u2014he smiled at the thought of Manfred. He\u2019d been praying for the boy ever since his disappearance from the Ridge, that he might be restored to his family. Granted, to find him firmly attached to an ex-prostitute was likely not quite the answer to prayer that Ute McGillivray had been hoping for, but he\u2019d learned before that God had His own methods.</p><p>Lord, let her be safe. He didn\u2019t care how that prayer was answered, provided only that it was. Let me have her back, please.</p><p>It was well past mid-afternoon, and his clothes stuck to him with sweat, when he came to one of the dozens of small tidal inlets that cut into the island like the holes in Swiss cheese. It was too wide to leap across, so he made his way down the sandy bank and into the water. It was deeper than he\u2019d thought\u2014he was up to his neck by mid-channel, and had to swim a few strokes before he found solid footing on the other side.</p><p>The water pulled at him, rushing toward the sea; the tide had begun to turn. Likely the inlet would be much shallower when the tide was out\u2014but he thought a boat could make it up the inlet easily, with the tide coming in.</p><p>That was promising. Encouraged, he crawled out on the far side and began to follow the channel inland. Within minutes, he heard a sound in the distance and stopped dead, listening.</p><p>Horses. He would swear it was the sound of neighing, though so far away he couldn\u2019t be sure of it. He turned in a circle, trying to locate it, but the sound had vanished. Still, it seemed a sign, and he pushed on with renewed vigor, frightening a family of raccoons washing their meal in the water of the channel.</p><p>But then the inlet began to narrow, the water level dropping to no more than a foot\u2014and then less, only a few inches of water running clear over dusky sand. He was loath to give up, though, and shoved his way under a low canopy of pine and twisted scrub oak. Then he stopped dead, skin tingling from scalp to sole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Four of them. Crude stone pillars, pale in the shadow of the trees. One stood actually in the channel itself, tilted drunkenly by the action of the water. Another, on the bank, had carvings on its face, abstract symbols that he didn\u2019t recognize. He stood frozen, as though they were live things that might see him if he moved.</p><p>It seemed abnormally silent; even the insects seemed temporarily to have deserted him. He had no doubt that this was the circle the man Donner had described to Brianna. Here, the five men had chanted, walked their pattern, and turned, passing to the left of the inscribed stone. And here at least one of them had died. A profound shiver ran through him, despite the oppressive heat.</p><p>He moved at last, very carefully, backing away, as though the stones might wake, but did not turn his back on them until he was a good distance away\u2014so far away that the stones were lost to sight, buried in the heavy growth. Then he turned and walked back toward the sea, fast, and then faster, \u2019til the breath burned in his throat, feeling as though invisible eyes bored into his back.</p><p>I SAT IN THE SHADE of the forecastle, sipping cool beer and watching the shore. Just like bloody men, I thought, frowning at the tranquil stretch of sand. Charge in pigheaded, leaving the women to mind the store. Still . . . I wasn\u2019t so sure that I would have wanted to slog the length of the beastly island on foot myself. By repute, Blackbeard and a number of his confederates had used the place as a lair, and the reason why was obvious. A less hospitable shore I\u2019d seldom seen.</p> <p>The chance of finding anything in that secretive, wooded place by randomly poking into holes was low. Still, sitting on my bum in a boat while Brianna was dealing with Stephen Bonnet was making me twitch with anxiety and the urgent desire to do something.</p><p>But there was nothing to do, and the afternoon wore slowly away. I watched the shore steadily; now and then, I would see Roger or Ian pop out of the undergrowth, then the two of them would confer briefly before popping back in. Now and then, I looked to the north\u2014but there was no sign of Jamie.</p><p>Captain Roarke, who was in fact a misbegotten son of a poxed whore, as he cheerfully admitted himself, sat down with me for a time and accepted a bottle of beer. I congratulated myself on my forethought in having brought a few dozen, a few of which I\u2019d put over the side in a net to keep cool; the beer was doing a lot to soothe my impatience, though my stomach was still knotted with worry.</p><p>\u201cNone o\u2019 your men are what ye might call sailing men, are they?\u201d Captain Roarke observed, after a thoughtful silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s spent a bit of time on fishing boats in Scotland,\u201d I said, dropping an empty bottle into the net. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s an able seaman, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d He drank a bit more.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said finally. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his bottle and belched loudly, then blinked.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, ma\u2019am\u2014I believe I did hear one o\u2019 the young men say as how there was a rondayvooz to occur, at dark o\u2019 moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said a little guardedly. We had told the captain as little as possible, not knowing whether he might have some association with Bonnet. \u201cThe dark of the moon is tomorrow night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut what I mean to say is\u2014when one says \u2018dark o\u2019 moon,\u2019 most likely one does mean nighttime, aye?\u201d He peered into the empty neck of his bottle, then lifted it and blew thoughtfully across it, making a deep woooog sound.</p> <p>I took the hint and handed him another.</p><p>\u201cThank you kindly, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, looking happy. \u201cSee, the tide turns about half-eleven, this time o\u2019 month\u2014and it\u2019s going out,\u201d he added with emphasis.</p><p>I gave him a blank look.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you look careful, ma\u2019am, you\u2019ll see the tide is half out now\u201d\u2014he pointed toward the south\u2014\u201cyet there\u2019s middling deep water close to shore all along o\u2019 here. Come the nighttime, though, it won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I was still missing his point, but he was patient.</p><p>\u201cWell, with the tide out, it\u2019s easier to see the bars and inlets, sure\u2014and were you coming in with a boat with a shallow draft, that would be the time to choose. But was the rondayvooz to be with something bigger, maybe anything that draws more than four feet . . . well, then.\u201d He took a gulp, and pointed the bottom of his bottle toward a spot far down the shore. \u201cThe water there is deep, ma\u2019am\u2014see the color of it? Was I a ship of any size, that would be the safest place to anchor, when the tide is on the ebb.\u201d</p><p>I regarded the spot he\u2019d indicated. The water was distinctly darker there, a deeper blue-gray than the waves surrounding it.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told us that earlier,\u201d I said with a certain note of reproach.</p> <p>\u201cSo I could, ma\u2019am,\u201d he agreed cordially, \u201csave for not knowin\u2019 as you\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d He got up then and wandered toward the stern, an empty bottle in hand, absently going woog-woog-woog, like a distant foghorn.</p><p>As the sun sank into the sea, Roger and Ian appeared on the shore, and Captain Roarke\u2019s hand, Moses, rowed ashore to fetch them off. Then we hoisted sail and made our way slowly up the coast of Ocracoke, until we found Jamie, waving from a tiny spit of sand.</p><p>Anchored offshore for the night, we exchanged notes of our findings\u2014or lack of them. All the men were drained, exhausted from heat and searching and with little appetite for supper, despite their exertions. Roger, in particular, looked drawn and pale, and said almost nothing.</p><p>The last sliver of the waning moon rose in the sky. With a minimum of conversation, the men took their blankets and lay down on deck, asleep within minutes.</p><p>Quantities of beer notwithstanding, I was wide awake. I sat beside Jamie, my own blanket wrapped about my shoulders against the coolness of the night wind, watching the low black mystery of the island. The anchorage Captain Roarke had pointed out to me was invisible in the darkness. Would we know, I wondered, if a ship were to come tomorrow night?</p><p>IN FACT, it came that night. I woke in the very early morning, dreaming of corpses. I sat up, heart pounding, to see Roarke and Moses at the rail, and a dreadful smell in the air. It wasn\u2019t a smell one would ever forget, and when I got to my feet and went to the rail to look, I was not at all surprised to hear Roarke murmur, \u201cSlaver,\u201d nodding toward the south.</p><p>The ship was anchored half a mile or so away, its masts black against the paling sky. Not a huge ship, but definitely too big to make its way into the small channels of the island. I watched a long time, joined by Jamie, Roger, and Ian as they woke\u2014but no boats were lowered.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye suppose it\u2019s doing there?\u201d Ian said. He spoke in a low voice; the slave ship made everyone nervous.</p><p>Roarke shook his head; he didn\u2019t like it, either.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t expect such a thing in such a place. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand across his unshaven chin. He hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and, green-faced and hollow-eyed beneath the stubble\u2014he\u2019d vomited over the rail within minutes of rising, though the swell was very gentle\u2014looked even more disreputable than Roarke himself.</p><p>\u201cCan ye lay us alongside her, Mr. Roarke?\u201d he said, eyes on the slave ship. Roger glanced at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t suppose Brianna\u2019s aboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she is, we\u2019ll find out. If she\u2019s not\u2014we\u2019ll maybe find out who yon ship has come to see.\u201d</p><p>It was full daylight by the time we came along the ship, and there were a number of hands on deck, all of whom peered curiously down over the rail at us.</p><p>Roarke hallooed up, asking permission to come aboard. There was no immediate response to this, but after a few minutes, a large man with an air of authority and an ill-tempered face appeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye want?\u201d he called down.</p><p>\u201cTo come aboard,\u201d Roarke bellowed back.</p><p>\u201cNo. Shove off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in search of a young woman!\u201d Roger called up. \u201cWe should like to ask you a few questions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny young women on this ship are mine,\u201d the captain\u2014if that\u2019s what he was\u2014said definitely. \u201cBugger off, I said.\u201d He turned and gestured to his hands, who scattered at once, reappearing in moments with muskets.</p><p>Roger cupped his hands to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBRIANNA!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cBRIANNAAAA!\u201d</p><p>One man raised his gun and fired, the ball whistling safely over our heads, and ripping through the mainsail.</p><p>\u201cOi!\u201d shouted Roarke, incensed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter of you?\u201d</p><p>The only answer to this was a fusillade of further shots, followed by the opening of the port lids nearest us, and the sudden appearance of the long black noses of several cannon, along with a more intense gust of stink.</p><p>\u201cJesus God,\u201d said Roarke, astonished. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s how you feel about\u2014well, God damn you!\u201d he shouted, brandishing a fist. \u201cGod damn you, I say!\u201d</p><p>Moses, less interested in rhetoric, had made sail with the first shot and was already at the tiller; we slid past the slave ship and into clean water within moments.</p><p>\u201cWell, something\u2019s going on,\u201d I remarked, looking back at the ship. \u201cWhether it\u2019s to do with Bonnet or not.\u201d</p><p>Roger was clinging to the rail, his knuckles white.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Jamie said. He wiped a hand across his mouth, and grimaced. \u201cCan ye keep in sight of her, but out of range, Mr. Roarke?\u201d A fresh wave of the smell of sewage, corruption, and hopelessness hit us, and he turned the color of rancid suet. \u201cAnd maybe upwind, too?\u201d</p><p>We were obliged to sail well out into the ocean and tack to and fro in order to meet these various conditions, but at length had beaten our way back and anchored a safe distance away, the slave ship barely visible. Here we lay through the rest of the day, taking it in turns to keep an eye on the strange ship through Captain Roarke\u2019s telescope.</p><p>Nothing happened, though; no boats came from the ship, nor from the shore. And as we all sat silent on deck, watching the stars come out in a moonless sky, the ship was swallowed by the dark.</p><p>107</p><p>THE DARK OF THE MOON</p><p>THEY ANCHORED LONG BEFORE DAWN, and a small boat took them ashore.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d she asked, voice rusty with disuse\u2014Bonnet had wakened her in the dark. They had made three stops along the way, at nameless coves where mysterious men came out of the shrubbery, rolling barrels or carrying bales, but she had not been taken off at any of them. This was a long, low island, thick with scrub forest and hazy with mist, looking haunted under a dying moon.</p><p>\u201cOcracoke,\u201d he answered, leaning forward to peer into the fog. \u201cA bit farther to port, Denys.\u201d The seaman at the oars leaned harder to the side, and the nose of the boat turned slowly, drawing nearer to the shore.</p><p>It was cold on the water; she was grateful for the thick cloak he had wrapped around her before handing her into the boat. Even so, the chill of the night and the open sea had little to do with the small, constant shiver that made her hands tremble and numbed her feet and fingers.</p><p>Soft murmurs between the pirates, further direction. Bonnet jumped off into waist-deep, muddy water, and waded into the shadows, pushing aside the heavy growth so that the water of the hidden inlet showed suddenly, a smooth dark gleam before them. The boat nosed its way under the overhanging trees, then paused, so that Bonnet could pull himself over the gunwales, splashing and dripping.</p><p>A shattering cry sounded near them, so close that she jerked, heart pounding, before realizing that it was only a bird somewhere in the swamp around them. Otherwise, the night was quiet, save for the muted, regular splash of the oars.</p><p>They had put Josh and the Fulani men into the boat, too; Josh sat at her feet, a hunched black form. He was shivering; she could feel it. Disengaging a fold of the cloak, she put it over him, and put a hand on his shoulder under it, meaning to give him what encouragement she could. A hand rose and settled softly over hers, squeezing, and thus linked, they sailed slowly into the dark unknown beneath the dripping trees.</p><p>The sky was lightening by the time the boat reached a small landing, and streaks of rose-tinted cloud reached across the horizon. Bonnet hopped out, and reached down to take her hand. Reluctantly, she let go of Josh, and stood up.</p><p>There was a house, half-hidden in the trees. Made of gray clapboards, it seemed to sink into the remnants of fog, as though it weren\u2019t quite real and might disappear at any moment.</p><p>The wind-borne stink, though, was real enough. She\u2019d never smelled it before herself, but had heard her mother\u2019s vivid description of it, and recognized it instantly\u2014the smell of a slaver, anchored offshore. Josh recognized it, too; she heard his sudden gasp, and then a hasty murmur\u2014he was saying the Hail Mary in Gaelic, as fast as he could.</p><p>\u201cTake these to the barracoon,\u201d Bonnet said to the seaman, pushing Josh in his direction and waving at the Fulani. \u201cThen go back to the ship. Tell Mr. Orden we sail for England in four days\u2019 time; he\u2019ll see to the rest of the provisioning. Come for me Saturday, an hour before high tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d She called after him, and he looked back, eyes white with fear, but the seaman hustled him along, and Bonnet dragged her in the other direction, up the path toward the house.</p><p>\u201cWait! Where is he taking him? What are you going to do with him?\u201d She dug her feet into the mud, and grabbed hold of a mangrove, refusing to move.</p><p>\u201cSell him, what else?\u201d Bonnet was matter-of-fact about that, and also about her refusal to move. \u201cCome along, darlin\u2019. Ye know I can make ye, and ye know ye won\u2019t like it if I do.\u201d He reached out, flipped back the edge of her cloak, and pinched her nipple, hard, in illustration.</p><p>Burning with anger, she snatched the cloak back and wrapped it tight around her, as though that might soothe the pain. He had already turned, and was making his way up the path, quite certain that she would follow. To her everlasting shame, she did.</p><p>THE DOOR WAS OPENED by a black man, nearly as tall as Bonnet himself, and even wider through the chest and shoulder. A thick vertical scar between his eyes ran nearly from his hairline to the bridge of his nose, but it had the clean look of a deliberate tribal scar, not the result of accident.</p><p>\u201cEmmanuel, me man!\u201d Bonnet greeted the man cheerfully, and pushed Brianna ahead of him into the house. \u201cLook what the cat dragged in, will ya?\u201d</p><p>The black man looked her up and down with an expression of doubt.</p><p>\u201cShe damn tall,\u201d he said, in a voice that held an African lilt. He took her by the shoulder and turned her round, running a hand down her back and cupping her buttocks briefly through the cloak. \u201cNice fat arse, though,\u201d he admitted grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it, though? Well, be seeing to her, then come tell me how it is here. The hold\u2019s near full\u2014oh, and I\u2019ve picked up four\u2014no, five\u2014more blacks. The men can go to Captain Jackson, but the women\u2014ah, now, those are somethin\u2019 special.\u201d He winked at Emmanuel. \u201cTwins.\u201d</p><p>The black man\u2019s face went rigid.</p><p>\u201cTwins?\u201d he said in a tone of horror. \u201cYou bring them in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Bonnet said firmly. \u201cFulani, and gorgeous things they are, too. No English, no training\u2014but they\u2019ll go for fancies, sure. Speakin\u2019 of which, have we word from Signor Ricasoli?\u201d</p><p>Emmanuel nodded, though his brow was furrowed; the scar pulled the frown lines into a deep \u201cV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe be here on Thursday. Monsieur Houvener comes then, too. Mister Howard be here tomorrow, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid. I\u2019m wanting me breakfast now\u2014and I imagine you\u2019re hungry as well, aren\u2019t ye, darlin\u2019?\u201d he asked, turning to Brianna.</p><p>She nodded, torn between fear, outrage, and morning sickness. She had to eat something, and fast.</p><p>\u201cFine, then. Take her somewhere\u201d\u2014he flipped a hand toward the ceiling, indicating rooms upstairs\u2014\u201cand feed her. I\u2019ll eat in me office; come find me there.\u201d</p><p>Without acknowledgment of the order, Emmanuel clamped a hand like a vise on the back of her neck, and shoved her toward the stairs.</p><p>THE BUTLER \u2014if one could describe something like Emmanuel with such a domestic term\u2014pushed her into a small room and shut the door behind her. It was furnished, but sparsely: a bed frame with a bare mattress, one woolen blanket, and a chamber pot. She made use of the latter object with relief, then made a rapid reconnaissance of the room itself.</p><p>There was only one window, a small one, set with metal bars. There was no glass, only inside shutters, and the breath of sea and scrub forest filled the room, vying with dust and the stale smell of the stained mattress. Emmanuel might be a factotum, but he wasn\u2019t much of a housekeeper, she thought, trying to keep her spirits up.</p><p>A familiar sound came to her, and she craned her neck to see. Not much was visible from the window\u2014only the white crushed shells and sandy mud that surrounded the house, and the tops of stunted pines. If she pressed her face to the side of the window, though, she could see a small slice of a distant beach, with white breakers rolling in. As she watched, three horses galloped across it, vanishing out of her view\u2014but with the wind-borne sound of neighing, then came five more, and then another group of seven or eight. Wild horses, the descendants of Spanish ponies left here a century ago.</p><p>The sight of them charmed her, and she watched for a long time, hoping they would come back, but they didn\u2019t; only a flight of pelicans passed by, and a few gulls, diving for fish.</p><p>The sight of the horses had made her feel less alone for a few moments, but no less empty. She had been in the room for half an hour, at least, and there were no sounds of footsteps in the hall outside, bringing food. Cautiously, she tried the door, and was surprised to find it unlocked.</p><p>There were sounds downstairs; someone was here. And the warm, grainy aromas of porridge and baking bread were faint in the air.</p><p>Swallowing to keep her stomach down, she moved soft-footed through the house and down the stairs. There were male voices in a room at the front of the house\u2014Bonnet and Emmanuel. The sound of them made her diaphragm tighten, but the door was closed, and she tiptoed past.</p><p>The kitchen was a cookshack, a separate small building outside, connected to the house by a short breezeway and surrounded by a fenced yard that also enclosed the back of the house. She gave the fence\u2014very tall, and spiked\u2014a glance, but first things first: she had to have food.</p><p>There was someone in the kitchen; she could hear the movements of pots, and a woman\u2019s voice, muttering something. The smell of food was strong enough to lean against. She pushed open the door and went in, pausing to let the cook see her. Then she saw the cook.</p><p>She was so battered by circumstance at this point that she only blinked, certain she was seeing things.</p><p>\u201cPhaedre?\u201d she said uncertainly.</p><p>The girl swung around, wide-eyed and open-mouthed with shock.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet Jesus!\u201d She glanced wildly behind Brianna, then, seeing that she was alone, grabbed Brianna\u2019s arm and pulled her out into the yard.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing here?\u201d she demanded, sounding fierce. \u201cHow do you come to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen Bonnet,\u201d Brianna said briefly. \u201cHow on earth did you\u2014did he kidnap you? From River Run?\u201d She couldn\u2019t think how\u2014or why\u2014but everything from the moment she had learned she was pregnant had had the surreal feel of hallucination, and how much of this was due to pregnancy alone she had no real idea.</p><p>Phaedre was shaking her head, though.</p><p>\u201cNo, miss. That Bonnet, he got me a month ago. From a man name Butler,\u201d she added, mouth twisting in an expression that made clear her loathing of Butler.</p><p>The name seemed vaguely familiar to Brianna. She thought it was the name of a smuggler; she had never met him, but had heard the name now and then. He wasn\u2019t the smuggler who provided her aunt with tea and other contraband luxuries, though\u2014she had met that man, a disconcertingly effete and dainty gentleman named Wilbraham Jones.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. But\u2014wait, is there anything to eat?\u201d she asked, the floor of her stomach dropping suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Surely. You wait here.\u201d Phaedre vanished back into the kitchen, light-footed, and was back in an instant with half a loaf of bread and a crock of butter.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She grabbed the bread and ate some hastily, not bothering to butter it, then put down her head between her knees and breathed for a few minutes, until the nausea subsided.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, raising her head at last. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Phaedre nodded, plainly unsurprised.</p><p>\u201cWho by?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d Brianna answered. She\u2019d spoken tartly, but then realized, with a small lurch of her unsettled innards, that it could so easily be otherwise. Phaedre had been gone from River Run for months\u2014God only knew what had happened to her in that span of time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not had you long, then.\u201d Phaedre glanced at the house.</p><p>\u201cNo. You said a month\u2014have you tried to get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce.\u201d The girl\u2019s mouth twisted again. \u201cYou see that man Emmanuel?\u201d</p><p>Brianna nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe an Ibo. Track a haunt through a cypress swamp, and make it sorry when he catch it.\u201d She wrapped her arms around herself, though the day was warm.</p><p>The yard was fenced with eight-foot pointed pine stakes, laced with rope. She might get over them, with a foot up from Phaedre . . . but then she saw the shadow of a man pass by on the other side, a gun across his shoulder.</p><p>She would have guessed as much, had she been capable of organized thought. This was Bonnet\u2019s hideaway\u2014and judging from the piles of boxes, bundles, and casks stacked haphazardly in the yard, it was also where he kept valuable cargo before selling it. Naturally, it would be guarded.</p><p>A faint breeze wafted through the pickets of the fence, carrying the same vile stench she had smelled when they came ashore. She took another quick bite of bread, forcing it down as ballast for her queasy stomach.</p><p>Phaedre\u2019s nostrils flared, then pinched at the reek.</p><p>\u201cBe a slave ship, anchored past the breakers,\u201d she said very quietly, and swallowed. \u201cCaptain come in yesterday, see if Mr. Bonnet have something for him, but he ain\u2019t back yet. Captain Jackson say he come again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Brianna could feel Phaedre\u2019s fear, like a pale yellow miasma wavering over her skin, and took another bite of bread.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t\u2014he wouldn\u2019t sell you to this Jackson?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t put anything at all past Bonnet. But she did by now understand things about slavery. Phaedre was a prime item: light-skinned, young, and pretty\u2014and trained as a body servant. Bonnet could get a very good price for her almost anywhere, and from what little she knew of slavers, they dealt in raw slaves from Africa.</p><p>Phaedre shook her head, her lips gone pale.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. He say I\u2019m what he call a \u2018fancy.\u2019 That\u2019s why he\u2019s kept me so long; he got some men he know, come up from the Indies this week. Planters.\u201d She swallowed again, looking ill. \u201cThey buy pretty women.\u201d</p><p>The bread Brianna had eaten melted suddenly into a soggy, slimy mass in her stomach, and with a certain feeling of fatality, she got up and took a few steps away before throwing up over a bale of raw cotton.</p><p>Stephen Bonnet\u2019s voice echoed in her head, cheerfully jovial.</p><p>\u201cWhy bother takin\u2019 ye all the way to London, where ye\u2019d be of no particular use to anyone? Besides, it rains quite a bit in London; I\u2019m sure ye wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey buy pretty women,\u201d she whispered, leaning against the palisades, waiting for the sense of clamminess to fade. But white women?</p><p>Why not? said the coldly logical part of her brain. Women are property, black or white. If you can be owned, you can be sold. She herself had owned Lizzie, for a time.</p><p>She wiped her sleeve over her mouth, and went back to Phaedre, who was sitting on a roll of copper, her fine-boned face thin and drawn with worry.</p><p>\u201cJosh\u2014he took Josh, too. When we came ashore, he told them to take Josh to the barracoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua?\u201d Phaedre sat up straight, eyes huge. \u201cJoshua, Miss Jo\u2019s groom? He\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where\u2019s the barracoon, do you know?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre had hopped to her feet and was striding to and fro, agitated.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t knowing for sure. I cook up food for the slaves there, but be one of the seamen takes it. Can\u2019t be far from the house, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a big one?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre shook her head emphatically at that.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2019m. Mr. Bonnet, he ain\u2019t really in the slaving business. He pick up a few, here and there\u2014and then he got his \u2018fancies\u2019\u201d\u2014she grimaced at that\u2014\u201cbut can\u2019t be more\u2019n a dozen here, amount of food they eat. Three girls in the house\u2014five, counting they Fulani he say he\u2019s bringing.\u201d</p><p>Feeling better, Brianna began to cast about the yard, searching for anything that might be of use. It was a hodgepodge of valuable things\u2014everything from bolts of Chinese silk, wrapped in linen and oiled cloth, and crates of porcelain dishes, to rolls of copper, casks of brandy, bottles of wine packed in straw, and chests of tea. She opened one of these, breathing in the soft perfume of the leaves and finding it wonderfully soothing to her internal distress. She\u2019d give almost anything for a hot cup of tea just now.</p><p>Even more interesting, though, were a number of small barrels, thick-walled and tightly sealed, containing gunpowder.</p><p>\u201cIf only I had a few matches,\u201d she muttered to herself, looking at them longingly. \u201cOr even a striker.\u201d But fire was fire, and there was certainly one in the kitchen. She looked at the house carefully, thinking exactly where to place the barrels\u2014but she couldn\u2019t blow the place up, not with the other slaves inside, and not without knowing what she\u2019d do next.</p><p>The sound of the door opening galvanized her; by the time Emmanuel looked out, she had jumped away from the gunpowder, and was examining an enormous box enclosing a grandfather clock, the gilded face\u2014decorated with three animated sailing ships on a sea of silver\u2014peeping out behind the protective laths nailed over it.</p><p>\u201cYou, girl,\u201d he said to Brianna, and jerked his chin. \u201cYou come wash yourself.\u201d He gave Phaedre a hard look\u2014Brianna saw that she wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes, but hastily began to pick up sticks of kindling from the ground.</p><p>The hand clamped hard on her neck again, and she was marched ignominiously back into the house.</p><p>THIS TIME, Emmanuel did lock the door. He brought her a basin and ewer, a towel, and a clean shift. Much, much later, he came back, bringing a tray of food. But he ignored all questions, and locked the door again upon leaving.</p><p>She pulled the bed over to the window and knelt on it, elbows wedged between the bars. There was nothing to do but think\u2014and that was something she would as soon put off a little longer. She watched the forest and the distant beach, the shadows of the scrub pines creeping over the sand, the oldest of sundials, marking the snaillike progress of the hours.</p><p>After a long time, her knees grew numb and her elbows hurt, and she spread the cloak over the nasty mattress, trying not to consider the various stains on it, nor the smell. Lying on her side, she watched the sky through the window, the infinitesimal changes of the light from one moment to the next, and considered in detail the specific pigments and the exact brushstrokes she would use to paint it. Then she got up and began pacing to and fro, counting her steps, estimating distance.</p><p>The room was about eight feet by ten; 5,280 feet in a mile. Five hundred and twenty-eight laps. She really hoped Bonnet\u2019s office was underneath her.</p><p>Nothing, though, was enough, and as the room darkened and she reached two miles, she found Roger in her mind\u2014where he had been all along, unacknowledged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sank down on the bed, hot from the exercise, and watched the last of the flaming color fade from the sky.</p><p>Had he been ordained, as he wanted so much? He had been worried about the question of predestination, not sure that he could take the Holy Orders he desired, if he were not able to subscribe wholeheartedly to that notion\u2014well, she called it a notion; to Presbyterians, it was dogma. She smiled wryly, thinking of Hiram Crombie.</p><p>Ian had told her about Crombie earnestly attempting to explain the doctrine of predestination to the Cherokee. Most of them had listened politely, then ignored him. Bird\u2019s wife, Penstemon, though, had been interested by the argument, and followed Crombie about during the day, playfully pushing him, then crying out, \u2018Did your God know I would do that? How could he know that\u2014I didn\u2019t know I would do that!\u2019, or in more thoughtful mood, trying to get him to explain how the idea of predestination might work in terms of gambling\u2014like most of the Indians, Penstemon would bet on almost anything.</p><p>She thought Penstemon had probably had a lot to do with the shortness of Crombie\u2019s initial visit to the Indians. She had to give him credit, though: he\u2019d gone back. And back again. He believed in what he was doing.</p> <p>As did Roger. Damn, she thought wearily, there he was again, those soft moss-green eyes of his dark with thought, running a finger slowly down the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d she\u2019d said at last, tiring of the discussion of predestination, and privately pleased that Catholics weren\u2019t required to believe any such thing and were content to let God work in mysterious ways. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it matter more that you can help people, that you can offer comfort?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been in bed, the candle extinguished, talking by the glow of the hearth. She could feel the shift of his body as he moved, his hand playing with a strand of her hair as he considered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he\u2019d said at last. He\u2019d smiled a little then, looking up at her.</p><p>\u201cDo ye not think any time-traveler must be a bit of a theologian, though?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d taken a deep, martyred breath, and he\u2019d laughed then, and let it go, kissing her instead and descending to far earthier matters.</p><p>He\u2019d been right, though. No one who had traveled through the stones could help asking it: why me? And who would answer that question, if not God?</p><p>Why me? And the ones who didn\u2019t make it\u2014why them? She felt a small chill, thinking of those. The anonymous bodies, listed in Geillis Duncan\u2019s notebook; Donner\u2019s companions, dead on arrival. And speaking of Geillis Duncan . . . the thought came to her suddenly; the witch had died here, out of her own time.</p><p>Putting metaphysics aside and looking at the matter purely in terms of science\u2014and it must have a scientific basis, she argued stubbornly, it wasn\u2019t magic, no matter what Geilie Duncan had thought\u2014the laws of thermodynamics held that neither mass nor energy could be created nor destroyed. Only changed.</p><p>Changed how, though? Did movement through time constitute change? A mosquito whined past her ear, and she flapped her hand to drive it away.</p><p>You could go both ways; they knew that for a fact. The obvious implication\u2014which neither Roger nor her mother had mentioned, so perhaps they hadn\u2019t seen it\u2014was that one could go into the future from a starting point, rather than only into the past and back.</p> <p>So perhaps if someone traveled to the past and died there, as Geillis Duncan and Otter-Tooth had both demonstrably done . . . perhaps that must be balanced by someone traveling to the future and dying there?</p><p>She closed her eyes, unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to follow that train of thought any further. Far in the distance, she heard the sound of the surf, pounding on the sand, and thought of the slave ship. Then she realized that the smell of it was here, and rising suddenly, went to the window. She could just see the far end of the path that led to the house; as she watched, a big man in a dark-blue coat and hat stumped rapidly out of the trees, followed by two others, shabbily dressed. Sailors, she thought, seeing the roll of their gait.</p><p>This must be Captain Jackson, then, come to conduct his business with Bonnet.</p><p>\u201cOh, Josh,\u201d she said out loud, and had to sit down on the bed, a wave of faintness washing over her.</p><p>Who had it been? One of the Saint Theresas\u2014Theresa of Avila? Who\u2019d said in exasperation to God, \u201cWell, if this is how You treat Your friends, no wonder You have so few of them!\u201d</p><p>SHE HAD FALLEN asleep hinking of Roger. She waked in the morning thinking of the baby.</p><p>For once, the nausea and the odd sense of dislocation were absent. All she felt was a deep peace, and a sense of . . . curiosity?</p><p>Are you there? she thought, hands across her womb. Nothing so definite as an answer; but knowledge was there, as sure as the beating of her own heart.</p> <p>Good, she thought, and fell asleep again.</p><p>Noises from below awakened her sometime later. She sat up suddenly, hearing loud voices raised, then swayed, feeling faint, and lay down again. The nausea had returned, but if she closed her eyes and kept very still, it lay dormant, like a sleeping snake.</p><p>The voices continued, rising and falling, with the occasional loud thud for punctuation, as though a fist had struck a wall or table. After a few minutes, though, the voices ceased, and she heard nothing further until light footsteps came to her door. The lock rattled, and Phaedre came in, with a tray of food.</p><p>She sat up, trying not to breathe; the smell of anything fried . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on down there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Phaedre pulled a face.</p><p>\u201cThat Emmanuel, he\u2019s not best pleased with they Fulani women. Ibo, they think twins are bad, bad luck\u2014any woman bear twins, she take them out in the forest, leave them there to die. Emmanuel want to send the Fulani off with Captain Jackson first thing, get them out the house, but Mr. Bonnet, he say he waiting on the gentlemen from the Indies, get a lots better price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen from the Indies\u2014what gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre lifted her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t knowing. Gentlemen he think he sell things to. Sugar planters, I reckon. You eat that; I be back later.\u201d</p><p>Phaedre turned to go, but Brianna suddenly called after her.</p><p>\u201cWait! You didn\u2019t tell me yesterday\u2014who took you from River Run?\u201d</p><p>The girl turned back, looking reluctant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Ulysses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUlysses?\u201d Brianna said, disbelieving. Phaedre heard the doubt in her voice, and gave her a flat, angry look.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Brianna hastily assured her. \u201cI do believe you. Only\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre breathed in deeply through her nose.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am one damn stupid nigger,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cMy mama told me, she say never, ever cross Ulysses. But did I listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross him,\u201d Brianna said warily. \u201cHow did you cross him?\u201d She gestured to the bed, inviting Phaedre to sit down. The girl hesitated for a moment, but then did, smoothing a hand over the white cloth tied round her head, over and over, while she searched for words.</p><p>\u201cMr. Duncan,\u201d she said at last, and her face softened a little. \u201cHe a nice, nice man. You know he never been with a woman? He got kicked by a horse when he young, hurt his balls, think he can\u2019t do nothing that way.\u201d</p><p>Brianna nodded; she\u2019d heard something of Duncan\u2019s trouble from her mother.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phaedre said with a sigh. \u201cHe wrong about that.\u201d She glanced at Brianna, to see how she might take this admission. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t meaning no harm, and nor was I. It just\u2014happened.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut Ulysses, he find it out; he find out every single thing goes on at River Run, sooner or later. Maybe one of the girls told him, maybe some other way, but he knew. And he told me that ain\u2019t right, I put a stop to it this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t?\u201d Brianna guessed.</p><p>Phaedre shook her head slowly, lips pushed out.</p><p>\u201cTold him I\u2019d stop when Mr. Duncan didn\u2019t want to no more\u2014not his business. See, I thought Mr. Duncan, he the master. Ain\u2019t true, though; Ulysses be the master at River Run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2014he took you away\u2014sold you?\u2014to stop you sleeping with Duncan?\u201d Why would he care? she wondered. Was he afraid Jocasta would discover the affair and be hurt?</p><p>\u201cNo, he sell me because I told him if he don\u2019t leave me and Mr. Duncan be, then I tell about him and Miss Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim and . . .\u201d Brianna blinked, not believing what she was hearing. Phaedre looked at her, and gave a small, ironic smile.</p><p>\u201cHe share Miss Jo\u2019s bed these twenty years and more. Since before Old Master die, my mama said. Every slave there knows it; ain\u2019t one stupid enough to say so to his face, \u2019cept me.\u201d</p><p>Brianna knew she was gaping like a goldfish, but couldn\u2019t help it. A hundred tiny things she\u2019d seen at River Run, myriad small intimacies between her aunt and the butler, suddenly took on new significance. No wonder her aunt had gone to such lengths to get him back after the death of Lieutenant Wolff. And no wonder, either, that Ulysses had taken instant action. Phaedre might have been believed, or not; the mere accusation would have destroyed him.</p><p>Phaedre sighed, and rubbed a hand over her face.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t waste no time. That very night, he and Mr. Jones come take me from my bed, wrap me up tight in a blanket, and carry me away in a wagon. Mr. Jones, he say he ain\u2019t no slaver, but he do it as a favor for Mr. Ulysses. So he don\u2019t keep me; he take me way downriver, though, sell me in Wilmington to a man what owns an ordinary. That\u2019s not too bad, but then a couple months later, Mr. Jones comes and takes me back\u2014Wilmington\u2019s not far enough away to suit Ulysses. So he give me to Mr. Butler, and Mr. Butler, he take me to Edenton.\u201d</p><p>She looked down, pleating the quilt between long, graceful fingers. Her lips were tight, and her face slightly flushed. Brianna forbore to ask what she had done for Butler in Edenton, thinking that she had likely been employed in a brothel.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . er . . . Stephen Bonnet found you there?\u201d she hazarded.</p><p>Phaedre nodded, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cWon me in a card game,\u201d she said succinctly. She stood up. \u201cI got to go; I had me enough of crossing black men\u2014ain\u2019t risking no more beatings from that Emmanuel.\u201d</p><p>Brianna was beginning to emerge from the shock of hearing about Ulysses and her aunt. A sudden thought occurred to her, and she jumped out of bed, hurrying to catch Phaedre before she reached the door.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait! Just one more thing\u2014do you\u2014do the slaves at River Run\u2014know anything about the gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, in Old Master\u2019s tomb? Surely.\u201d Phaedre\u2019s face expressed a cynical surprise that there could be any doubt about it. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody touch it, though. Everybody know there a curse on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about its disappearing?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre\u2019s face went blank.</p><p>\u201cDisappearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait\u2014no, you wouldn\u2019t know; you . . . left, long before it disappeared. I just wondered, you know, whether maybe Ulysses had something to do with that.\u201d</p><p>Phaedre shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about that. But I ain\u2019t put one thing past Ulysses, curse or no.\u201d There was a sound of heavy footsteps on the stair, and she paled. Without a word or gesture of farewell, she slipped out the door and closed it; Brianna heard the frantic fumbling of the key on the other side, and then the click of the closing lock.</p><p>EMMANUEL, silent as a lizard, brought her a dress in the afternoon. It was too short by a good bit, and too tight in the bosom, but a heavy blue watered silk, and well-made. It had plainly been worn before; there were sweat stains on it and it smelled\u2014of fear, she thought, repressing a shudder as she struggled into it.</p><p>She was sweating herself as Emmanuel led her downstairs, though a pleasant breeze swept through the open windows, stirring the curtains. The house was very simple, for the most part, with bare wooden floors and little more than stools and bed frames by way of furniture. The room downstairs to which Emmanuel showed her was such a contrast that it might have belonged to a different house entirely.</p><p>Rich Turkey rugs covered the floor in a overlapping riot of color, and the furniture, while of several different styles, was all heavy and elaborate, carved wood and silk upholstery. Silver and crystal glittered from every available surface, and a chandelier\u2014much too large for the room\u2014hung with crystal pendants sprayed the room with tiny rainbows. It was a pirate\u2019s idea of a rich man\u2019s room\u2014lavish abundance, displayed with no sense of style or taste.</p><p>The rich man seated by the window appeared not to mind his surroundings, though. A thin man in a wig, with a prominent Adam\u2019s apple, he looked to be in his thirties, though his skin was lined and yellowed by some tropical disease. He glanced sharply at the door as she entered, then rose to his feet.</p><p>Bonnet had been entertaining his guest; there were glasses and a decanter on the table, and the smell of brandy was sweet and heavy in the air. Brianna felt her stomach shift queasily, and wondered what they\u2019d do if she were to vomit on the Turkey rug.</p><p>\u201cThere ye are, darlin\u2019,\u201d Bonnet said, coming to take her by the hand. She pulled it away from him, but he affected not to notice, and instead pushed her toward the thin man, a hand in the small of her back. \u201cCome and make your bob to Mr. Howard, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She drew herself to her full height\u2014she was a good four inches taller than Mr. Howard, whose eyes widened at sight of her\u2014and glowered down at him.</p><p>\u201cI am being held against my will, Mr. Howard. My husband and my father will\u2014ow!\u201d Bonnet had gripped her wrist and twisted it, hard.</p><p>\u201cLovely, is she not?\u201d he said conversationally, as though she had not spoken.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Yes, indeed. Very tall, though . . .\u201d Howard walked round her, examining her dubiously. \u201cAnd red hair, Mr. Bonnet? I do really prefer blond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do you indeed, you little pissant!\u201d she snapped, in spite of Bonnet\u2019s grip on her arm. \u201cWhere do you get off, preferring things?\u201d With a wrench, she pulled away from Bonnet and rounded on Howard.</p><p>\u201cNow, look,\u201d she said, trying to sound reasonable\u2014he was blinking at her in a faintly bewildered fashion\u2014 \u201cI am a woman of good\u2014of excellent\u2014family, and I have been kidnapped. My father\u2019s name is James Fraser, my husband is Roger MacKenzie, and my aunt is Mrs. Hector Cameron, of River Run Plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she really of good family?\u201d Howard addressed this question to Bonnet, appearing to be more interested.</p><p>Bonnet bowed slightly in affirmation.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed she is, sir. The finest blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. And good health, I see.\u201d Howard had resumed his examination, leaning close to peer at her. \u201cHas she bred before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir, a healthy son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood teeth?\u201d Howard rose on his toes, looking inquisitive, and Bonnet obligingly yanked one arm behind her back to hold her still, then took a handful of her hair and jerked her head back, making her gasp.</p><p>Howard took her chin in one hand and pried at the corner of her mouth with the other, poking experimentally at her molars.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cAnd I will say the skin is very fine. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jerked her chin out of his grasp, and bit down as hard as she could on Howard\u2019s thumb, feeling the meat of it shift and tear between her molars with a sudden copper taste of blood.</p><p>He shrieked and struck at her; she let go and dodged, enough so his hand glanced off her cheek. Bonnet let go, and she took two fast steps back and fetched up hard against the wall.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bitten me thumb off, the bitch!\u201d Eyes watering in agony, Mr. Howard swayed to and fro, cradling his wounded hand against his chest. Fury flooded his face and he lunged toward her, free hand drawn back, but Bonnet seized him by the wrist and pulled him aside.</p><p>\u201cNow then, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot allow ye to damage her, sure. She\u2019s not yours yet, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s mine or not,\u201d Howard cried, face suffused with blood. \u201cI\u2019ll beat her to death!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, surely ye don\u2019t mean that, Mr. Howard,\u201d Bonnet said, his voice jovially soothing. \u201cA cruel waste that would be. Leave her to me, will ye, then?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, he pulled Brianna after him, dragging her stumbling across the room, and thrust her toward the silent factotum, who had waited motionless by the door through the conversation.</p><p>\u201cTake her out, Manny, and teach her her manners, will ye? And gag her before ye bring her back.\u201d</p><p>Emmanuel didn\u2019t smile, but a faint light seemed to burn in the black depths of his pupilless eyes. His fingers dug between the bones of her wrist and she gasped with pain, jerking in a vain attempt to free herself. With a single quick movement, the Ibo whirled her round and twisted up her arm behind her back, bending her half forward. Sharp pain shot up her arm as she felt her shoulder tendons begin to part. He pulled harder and a dark wave passed over her vision. Through it, she heard Bonnet\u2019s voice calling out behind them as Emmanuel propelled her through the door.</p><p>\u201cNot in the face, mind, Manny, and no permanent marks.\u201d</p><p>HOWARD\u2019S VOICE had quite lost its choked note of fury. It was still choked, but with something more like awe.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA charmin\u2019 sight, is it not?\u201d Bonnet agreed cordially.</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Howard echoed. \u201cOh\u2014the most charming thing I believe I have ever seen. Such a shade! Might I\u2014\u201d The hunger in his voice was evident, and Brianna felt the vibration of his footstep on the carpet, a split second before his hands clamped tight on her buttocks. She screamed behind the gag, but she was bent hard across the table, with the edge cutting into her diaphragm, and the sound came out as no more than a grunt. Howard laughed joyfully, and let go.</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d he said, sounding enchanted. \u201cLook, do you see? The most perfect print of my hands\u2014so white on the crimson . . . she is so hot . . . oh, it\u2019s fading. Let me just\u2014\u201d</p><p>She clenched her legs tight together and stiffened as he fondled her nak*d privates, but then his touch was gone, and Bonnet had taken his hand off her neck, and was pulling his customer away from her.</p><p>\u201cAh, now, that\u2019s enough, sir. After all, she\u2019s not your property\u2014not yet.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s tone was jovial, but firm. Howard\u2019s response was immediately to offer a sum that made her gasp behind the gag, but Bonnet only laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generous, sir, so it is, but \u2019twouldn\u2019t be fair on my other customers, would it, to be takin\u2019 your offer without letting them make their own? No, sir, I do appreciate it, but I mean to auction this one; I\u2019m afraid ye\u2019ll needs be waiting on the day.\u201d</p><p>Howard was disposed to protest, to offer more\u2014he was most urgently in earnest, he protested that he could not wait, was ravished by desire, a great deal too warm to abide delay . . . but Bonnet only demurred, and in a few moments had ushered him out of the room. Brianna heard his voice protesting, dying away as Emmanuel removed him.</p><p>She had stood up as soon as Bonnet took his hand off her neck, wriggling madly to shake her skirts down. Emmanuel had tied her hands behind her back, as well as gagging her. If he hadn\u2019t, she would have tried to kill Stephen Bonnet with her bare hands.</p><p>This thought must have been visible on her face, for Bonnet glanced at her, looked again, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYe did amazing well, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, and leaning over, negligently pulled the gag down from her mouth. \u201cThat man will empty his purse for the chance to get his hands on your arse again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou God damn . . . you\u2014\u201d She shook with rage, and with the futility of finding any epithet that came close to being strong enough. \u201cI will f**king kill you!\u201d</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>\u201cOh, now, sweetheart. For a sore arse? Consider it a repayment\u2014in part\u2014for my left ball.\u201d He chucked her under the chin, and went toward the table where the tray with the decanters stood. \u201cYe\u2019ve earned a drink. Brandy or porter?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the offer, trying to keep her rage in check. Her cheeks flamed with furious blood, and so did her outraged bottom.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018auction\u2019?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI should think that clear enough, sweetheart. Ye\u2019ve heard the word, sure.\u201d Bonnet gave her a glance of mild amusement, and pouring himself a tot of brandy, drank it off in two swallows. \u201cHah.\u201d He exhaled, blinking, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHoo. I\u2019ve two more customers in the market for someone like you, darlin\u2019. They\u2019ll be here tomorrow or next day to be having a look. Then I\u2019ll ask for bids, and ye\u2019ll be off to the Indies by Friday, I expect.\u201d</p><p>He spoke casually, without the slightest hint of jeering. That, more than anything, made her insides waver. She was a matter of business, a piece of merchandise. To him, and to his goddamned bloody customers, too\u2014Mr. Howard had made that clear. It didn\u2019t matter what she said; they weren\u2019t at all interested in who she was or what she might want.</p><p>Bonnet was watching her face, his pale green eyes assessing. He was interested, she realized, and her insides curled up into a knot.</p><p>\u201cWhat did ye use on her, Manny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA wooden spoon,\u201d the manservant said indifferently. \u201cYou said no marks.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet nodded, thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cNothing permanent, I said,\u201d he corrected. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave her as she is for Mr. Ricasoli, I think, but Mr. Houvener . . . well, we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Emmanuel merely nodded, but his eyes rested on Brianna with sudden interest. Her stomach everted itself neatly and she vomited, absolutely ruining the fine silk dress.</p><p>THE SOUND OF high-pitched whinnying reached her; wild horses, rioting down the beach. If this were a romance novel, she thought grimly, she\u2019d make a rope from the bedclothes, let herself down from the window, find the horse herd, and, by exercising her mystical skills with horses, persuade one of them to carry her to safety.</p><p>As it was, there were no bedclothes\u2014only a ratty mattress made of ticking stuffed with sea grass\u2014and as for getting within a mile of wild horses . . . She would have given a lot for Gideon, and felt tears prickle at thought of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, now you are losing your mind,\u201d she said aloud, wiping her eyes. \u201cCrying over a horse.\u201d Especially that horse. That was so much better than thinking of Roger, though\u2014or Jem. No, she absolutely could not think about Jemmy, nor the possibility of his growing up without her, without knowing why she had abandoned him. Or the new one . . . and what life might be like for the child of a slave.</p><p>But she was thinking of them, and the thought was enough to overcome her momentary despair.</p><p>All right, then. She was getting out of here. Preferably before Mr. Ricasoli and Mr. Houvener, whoever they were, turned up. For the thousandth time, she moved restlessly around the room, forcing herself to move slowly, look at what was there.</p><p>Damn little, and what there was, stoutly built, was the discouraging answer. She\u2019d been given food, water for washing, a linen towel, and a hairbrush with which to tidy herself. She picked it up, assessing its potential as a weapon, then threw it down again.</p><p>The chimney stack rose through this room, but there was no open hearth. She thumped the bricks experimentally, and pried at the mortar with the end of the spoon they\u2019d given her to eat with. She found one place where the mortar was cracked enough to pry, but a quarter of an hour\u2019s trying managed to dislodge only a few inches of mortar; the brick itself stayed firmly in place. Given a month or so, that might be worth a try\u2014though the chances of someone her size managing to squeeze up an eighteenth-century flue . . .</p><p>It was getting up to rain; she heard the excited rattle of the palmetto leaves as the wind came through, sharp with the smell of rain. It was not quite sunset, but the clouds had darkened the sky so the room seemed dim. She had no candle; no one expected her to read or sew.</p><p>She threw her weight against the bars of the window for the dozenth time, and for the dozenth time found them solidly set and unyielding. Again, in a month, she might contrive to sharpen the spoon\u2019s end by grinding it against the chimney bricks, then use it as a chisel to chip away enough of the frame to dislodge one or two bars. But she didn\u2019t have a month.</p><p>They\u2019d taken away the fouled dress, and left her in shift and stays. Well, that was something. She pulled off the stays, and by picking at the ends of the stitching, extracted the busk\u2014a flat, twelve-inch strip of ivory that ran from sternum to navel. A better weapon than a hairbrush, she thought. She took it over to the chimney, and began to rasp the end against the brick, sharpening its point.</p><p>Could she stab someone with it? Oh, yes, she thought fiercely. And please let it be Emmanuel.</p><p>108</p><p>DAMN TALL</p><p>ROGER WAITED IN THE COVER of the thick bayberry bushes near the shore; a little way beyond, Ian and Jamie lay likewise in wait.</p><p>The second ship had arrived in the morning, coming to anchor a fastidious distance beyond the slaver. Sloshing nets over the side of Roarke\u2019s ship in the guise of fishermen, they had been able to watch as first the captain of the slaver went ashore, and then, an hour later, a boat from the second ship was lowered and rowed ashore, with two men\u2014and a small chest\u2014in it.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman,\u201d Claire had reported, scanning them through the telescope. \u201cWig, nicely dressed. The other man\u2019s a servant of some kind\u2014is the gentleman one of Bonnet\u2019s customers, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jamie had said, watching the boat pull to the shore. \u201cTake us a bit to the north, if ye please, Mr. Roarke; we\u2019ll go ashore.\u201d</p><p>The three of them had landed half a mile from the beach and worked their way down through the wood, then took up their positions in the shrubbery and settled down to wait. The sun was hot, but so close to the shore, there was a fresh breeze, and it was not uncomfortable in the shade, bar the insects. For the hundredth time, Roger brushed away something crawling on his neck.</p><p>The waiting was making him jumpy. His skin itched with salt, and the scent of the tidal forest, with its peculiar mix of aromatic pine and distant seaweed, the crunch of shell and needle beneath his feet, brought back to him in vivid detail the day he had killed Lillington.</p><p>He had gone then\u2014as now\u2014with the intent of killing Stephen Bonnet. But the elusive pirate had been warned, and an ambush laid. It had been by the will of God\u2014and the skill of Jamie Fraser\u2014that he hadn\u2019t left his own carcass in a similar forest, bones scattered by wild pigs, bleaching among the gleam of dry needles and the white of empty shells.</p><p>His throat was tight again, but he couldn\u2019t shout or sing to loosen it.</p><p>He should pray, he thought, but could not. Even the constant litany that had echoed through his heart since the night he had learned she was gone\u2014Lord, that she might be safe\u2014even that small petition had somehow dried up. His present thought\u2014Lord, that I might kill him\u2014he couldn\u2019t voice that, even to himself.</p><p>The deliberate intent and desire to murder\u2014surely he couldn\u2019t expect such a prayer to be heard.</p><p>For a moment, he envied Jamie and Ian their faith in gods of wrath and vengeance. While Roarke and Moses had brought the fishing boat in, he had heard Jamie murmur to Claire and take her hands in his. And heard her then bless him in the Gaelic, with the invocation to Michael of the red domain, the blessing of a warrior on his way to battle.</p><p>Ian had merely sat, cross-legged and silent, watching the shore draw nearer, his face remote. If he prayed, there was no telling to whom. When they landed, though, he had paused on the bank of one of the myriad inlets, and scooping up mud in his fingers, had carefully painted his face, drawing a line from forehead to chin, then four parallel streaks across his left cheek, a thick dark circle around his right eye. It was remarkably unsettling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quite obviously, neither of them had the slightest qualms about the business, nor the least hesitation in asking God to aid their efforts. He envied them.</p><p>And sat in stubborn silence, the gates of heaven closed against him, his hand on the hilt of his knife and a loaded pistol in his belt, planning murder.</p><p>A little past noon, the burly captain of the slaver came back, footsteps crunching indifferently on the layer of dried pine needles. They let him pass, waiting.</p><p>Late in the afternoon, it began to rain.</p> <p>SHE HAD DOZED off again, from sheer boredom. It began to rain; the sound roused her briefly, then drove her more deeply into slumber, drops pattering softly on the palmetto thatch above. She woke abruptly when one of the drops fell cold on her face, followed quickly by a few of its fellows.</p><p>She jerked upright, blinking with momentary disorientation. She rubbed a hand over her face and looked up; there was a small wet patch on the plaster ceiling, surrounded by a much larger stain from previous leaks, and drops were forming in its center like magic, each perfect bead falling one after another after another to splat on the mattress ticking.</p><p>She got up to push the bed out from under the leak, and then stopped. Slowly she straightened up, and put up a hand to the wet patch. The ceiling was a normal one for the time, less than seven feet; she could reach it easily.</p><p>\u201cShe damn tall,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cDamn right she is.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand flat on the wet patch and pushed as hard as she could. The wet plaster gave way at once, and so did the rotten laths behind it. She jerked back her hand, scratching her arm on the jagged edges of lath, and a small cascade of dirty water, centipedes, mouse droppings, and fragments of palmetto leaf poured in through the hole she\u2019d made.</p> <p>She wiped her hand on her shift, reached up, seized the edge of the hole, and pulled, ripping down chunks of lath and plaster, until she\u2019d made a hole that would accommodate her head and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered to the baby, or herself. She glanced around the room, put on her stays over her shift, then tucked the sharpened busk down the front.</p><p>Then, standing on the bed, she took a deep breath, shoved her steepled hands upward as though about to dive, and grabbed for anything solid enough to provide leverage. Little by little, she hauled herself, sweating and grunting, up into the steaming thatch of sharp-edged leaves, teeth gritted and eyes closed against the dirt and dead insects.</p><p>Her head thrust into moist open air and she gasped for breath. She had an elbow hooked over a beam and, using that for leverage, pulled farther up. Her legs kicked vainly in empty air, trying to propel her upward, and she felt the wrench of shoulder muscles, but sheer desperation propelled her upward\u2014that, and the nightmare vision of Emmanuel coming into the room and seeing the bottom half of her hanging out of the ceiling.</p><p>With a rending shower of leaves, she hauled herself out, to lie flat on the rain-wet thatch of the roof. The rain was still coming down heavily, and she was soaked in moments. A little way away, she saw some sort of structure sticking up amid the palmetto leaves of the thatch, and wriggled her way cautiously toward it, constantly fearful lest the roof give way beneath her weight, probing with hands and elbows for the firmness of the roof beams below the thatched leaves.</p><p>The structure proved to be a small platform, firmly set on the beams, with a railing on one side. She scrambled onto this and crouched, panting. It was still raining onshore, but out to sea, the sky was mostly clear, and the setting sun behind her spilled a burnt, bloody orange over sky and water through black streaks of shattered cloud. It looked like the end of the world, she thought, her ribs heaving against the lacing of her stays.</p> <p>From the vantage point of the roof, she could see over the scrub forest; the slice of beach she had glimpsed from her window was clearly visible\u2014and beyond it, two ships, lying close offshore.</p><p>Two boats were pulled up on shore, though well separated from each other\u2014probably one from each ship, she thought. One of the ships must be the slaver, the other likely Howard\u2019s. A wash of humiliated rage ran over her\u2014she was surprised that the rain didn\u2019t steam off her skin. There was no time to dwell on that, though.</p><p>Voices came faintly through the patter of rain, and she ducked down, then realized that no one was likely to look up and see her. Raising her head to peer through the railing, she saw figures come out of the trees onto the beach\u2014a single file of chained men, with two or three guards.</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d She strained her eyes to see, but in the eerie twilight, the figures were no more than silhouettes. She thought she made out the tall, slender figures of the two Fulani men\u2014perhaps the shorter one behind them was Josh, but she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Her fingers curled tight around the railing, impotent. She couldn\u2019t help, she knew it, but to be obliged simply to watch . . . As she watched, a thin scream came from the beach, and a smaller figure ran out of the wood, skirts flying. The guards turned, startled; one of them seized Phaedre\u2014it had to be her; Brianna could hear her screaming \u201cJosh! Josh!\u201d, the sound of it harsh as the cry of a distant gull.</p><p>She was struggling with the guard\u2014some of the chained men turned abruptly, lunging at the other. A struggling knot of men fell to the sand. Someone was running toward them from the boat, something in his hand . . .</p><p>The vibration in her feet jerked her attention from the scene on the beach.</p><p>\u201cCrap!\u201d she said involuntarily. Emmanuel\u2019s head poked up over the edge of the roof, staring in disbelief. Then his face contorted, and he heaved himself up\u2014there must be a ladder attached to the side of the house, she thought, well, of course there would be, you wouldn\u2019t have a lookout platform and no way to get up to it. . . .</p> <p>While her mind was busying itself with that nonsense, her body was taking more concrete steps. She had drawn the sharpened busk and was crouched against the platform, hand low as Ian had taught her.</p><p>Emmanuel made a derisive face at the thing in her hand and grabbed at her.</p><p>THEY COULD HEAR the gentleman coming well before they saw him. He was singing softly to himself, a French air of some kind. He was alone; the servant must have gone back to the ship while they were making their way through the woods.</p><p>Roger got softly to his feet, crouched behind his chosen bush. His limbs were stiff, and he stretched inconspicuously.</p><p>As the gentleman drew even with him, Jamie stepped out into the path in front of him. The man\u2014a small, foppish-looking sort\u2014uttered a girlish shriek of alarm. Before he could flee, though, Jamie had stepped forward and grasped his arm, smiling pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir,\u201d he said courteously. \u201cHave ye been calling upon Mr. Bonnet, by chance?\u201d</p><p>The man blinked at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cBonnet? Why, why . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt a tightness in his chest ease suddenly. Thank God. They\u2019d found the right place.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, sir?\u201d the small man was demanding, trying to draw his forearm out of Jamie\u2019s grip, to no avail.</p><p>There was no need to keep hidden now; Roger and Ian stepped out of the bushes, and the gentleman gasped at sight of Ian in his war paint, then glanced wildly back and forth between Jamie and Roger.</p><p>Evidently settling on Roger as the most civilized-looking person present, the gentleman appealed to him.</p><p>\u201cI beg you, sir\u2014who are you, and what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in search of an abducted young woman,\u201d Roger said. \u201cA very tall young woman with red hair. Have you\u2014\u201d Before he could finish, he saw the man\u2019s eyes dilate with panic. Jamie saw it, too, and twisted the man\u2019s wrist, sending him to his knees, mouth awry with pain.</p><p>\u201cI think, sir,\u201d Jamie said, with impeccable courtesy, holding tight, \u201cwe must oblige you to tell us what ye know.\u201d</p><p>SHE COULDN\u2019T LET him get hold of her. That was her only conscious thought. He grabbed at her weaponless arm and she yanked free, skin slippery with rain, and struck at him in the same motion. The point of the busk skidded up his arm, leaving a reddening furrow, but he ignored this and lunged at her. She fell backward over the railing, landing awkwardly on her hands and knees in the leaves, but he hadn\u2019t got her; he\u2019d fallen on his own knees on the platform, with a thud that shook the whole roof.</p><p>She scrabbled madly to the edge of the roof, hands and knees poking randomly through the thatch, and threw her legs over the edge into space, kicking frantically for the rungs of the ladder.</p><p>He was after her, had her wrist in a grip like an eel\u2019s bite, was hauling her back onto the roof. She drew back her free hand and lashed him hard across the face with the busk. He roared and his grip loosened; she wrenched free and dropped.</p><p>She hit the sand flat on her back with a bone-shaking thump! and lay paralyzed, unable to breathe, the rain pelting down on her face. A hoot of triumph came from the roof, and then a growl of exasperated dismay. He thought he\u2019d killed her.</p><p>Great, she thought muzzily. Keep thinking that. The shock of impact was beginning to wear off, her diaphragm lurched into motion, and glorious air rushed into her lungs. Could she move?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know, and didn\u2019t dare to try. Through rain-clotted lashes, she saw Emmanuel\u2019s bulk ease over the edge of the roof, foot groping for the crude ladder rungs she could now see, nailed to the wall.</p><p>She\u2019d lost the busk when she fell, but saw it gleaming dully, a foot from her head. With Emmanuel\u2019s back momentarily turned, she whipped her hand up and grabbed it, then lay still, playing possum.</p><p>THEY HAD NEARLY reached the house when sounds from the nearby forest stopped them. Roger froze, then ducked off the path. Jamie and Ian had already melted into the wood. The sounds weren\u2019t coming from the path, though, but from somewhere off to the left\u2014voices, men\u2019s voices, shouting orders, and the shuffling of feet, the clink of chains.</p><p>A thrill of panic shot through him. Were they taking her away? He was already soaked with rain, but felt the bloom of cold sweat over his body, colder than the rain.</p><p>Howard, the man they\u2019d apprehended in the wood, had assured them Brianna was safe in the house, but what would he know? He listened, straining his ears for the sound of a woman\u2019s voice, and heard it, a high, thin scream.</p><p>He jerked toward it, only to find Jamie beside him, gripping his arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Brianna,\u201d his father-in-law said urgently. \u201cIan will go. You and I\u2014for the house!\u201d</p><p>There was no time for argument. The sounds of violence on the beach came faintly\u2014shouts and cries\u2014but Jamie was right, that voice wasn\u2019t Brianna\u2019s. Ian was running toward the beach, making no effort now to be silent.</p><p>An instant\u2019s hesitation, instinct urging him to go after Ian, then Roger was on the path, following Jamie toward the house at the run.</p><p>EMMANUEL BENT OVER HER; she felt his bulk and lunged upward like a striking snake, sharpened busk like a fang. She\u2019d aimed for his head, hoping for eye or throat, but counting at least on his jerking reflexively back, putting him at a disadvantage.</p><p>He jerked, all right, up and away, but was much faster than she\u2019d thought. She struck with all her force, and the sharpened busk drove under his arm with a rubbery shock. He froze for a moment, mouth open in incredulity, looking at the ivory rod that stuck out of his armpit. Then he wrenched it out, and lunged for her with an outraged bellow.</p><p>She was already on her feet, though, and running for the woods. From somewhere ahead, she heard more yelling\u2014and a bloodcurdling scream. Another, and then more, these coming from the front of the house.</p><p>Dazed and terrified, she kept running, her mind only slowly grasping that some of the screams had words.</p><p>\u201cCasteal DHUUUUUUUIN!\u201d</p><p>Da, she thought, in absolute astonishment, then tripped over a branch on the ground and fell arse over teakettle, landing in a disheveled heap.</p><p>She struggled to her feet, thinking absurdly, This can\u2019t be good for the baby, and groping for another weapon.</p><p>Her fingers were trembling, wouldn\u2019t work. She scrabbled the ground, vainly. Then Emmanuel popped up beside her like the Demon King, grabbing her arm with a gloating, \u201cHA!\u201d</p><p>The shock made her sway, her vision going gray at the edges. She could still hear bloodcurdling screams on the distant beach, but no more yelling at the house. Emmanuel was saying something, full of satisfaction and threat, but she wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>There seemed to be something wrong with his face; it went in and out of focus, and she blinked hard, shaking her head to clear her sight. It wasn\u2019t her eyes, though\u2014it was him. His face melted slowly from bare-toothed menace to a look of faint astonishment. He frowned, lips pursing so she saw the pink lining of his mouth, and blinked two or three times. Then he made a small choked noise, put a hand to his chest, and dropped to his knees, still gripping her arm.</p><p>He fell over, and she landed on top of him. She pulled away\u2014his fingers came away easily, all their strength suddenly gone\u2014and stumbled to her feet, panting and shaking.</p><p>Emmanuel was lying on his back, legs bent under him at what would have been an excruciating angle, had he been alive. She gulped for air, trembling, afraid to believe it. But he was dead; there was no mistaking the look of it.</p><p>Her breath was coming better now, and she began to be conscious of the cuts and bruises on her bare feet. She still felt stunned, unable to decide what to do next.</p><p>The decision was made for her in the next instant, as Stephen Bonnet came dashing toward her through the wood.</p><p>SHE JERKED TO instant alertness, and spun on her heel to flee. She made it no more than six paces before he had an arm about her throat, dragging her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cHush, now, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said in her ear, sounding breathless. He was hot, and his stubble rasped her cheek. \u201cI mean ye no harm. I\u2019ll leave ye safe on the shore. But ye\u2019re the only thing I\u2019ve got right now will keep your men from killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the body of Emmanuel entirely. The heavy forearm left her throat and he grabbed her arm, trying to drag her in the direction away from the beach\u2014evidently, he meant to make for the hidden inlet on the opposite side of the island, where they had landed the day before. \u201cMove, darlin\u2019. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d She dug her feet in hard, yanking on her trapped arm. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you. HELP!\u201d she shrieked as loudly as she could. \u201cHELP! ROGER!\u201d</p><p>He looked startled, and raised his free arm to wipe the streaming rain out of his eyes. There was something in his hand; the last of the light gleamed orange on glass. Holy Lord, he\u2019d brought his testicle.</p><p>\u201cBree! Brianna! Where are you?\u201d Roger\u2019s voice, frantic, and a jolt of adrenaline shot through her at the sound, giving her the strength to jerk her arm from Bonnet\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cHere! Here I am! Roger!\u201d she shouted at the top of her voice.</p><p>Bonnet glanced over his shoulder; the bushes were shaking, two men at least coming through them. He wasted no time, but darted into the forest, bending low to avoid a branch, and was gone.</p><p>In the next instant, Roger crashed out of the brush and seized her, crushing her against him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right? Has he hurt you?\u201d He\u2019d dropped his knife, and held her by the arms, eyes trying to look everywhere at once\u2014her face, her body, into her eyes. . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, feeling dizzy. \u201cRoger, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere has he gone?\u201d It was her father, soaking wet and grim as death, dirk in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d She turned to point, but he was already gone, running wolflike. She saw the marks of Bonnet\u2019s passage now, the scuffed footmarks clear in the muddy sand. Before she could turn round again, Roger was after him.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she shrieked, but no answer came save the rapidly receding rustle of brush as heavy bodies flung themselves heedlessly through.</p><p>She stood still for a moment, head hanging as she breathed. The rain was pooling in the sockets of Emmanuel\u2019s open eyes; the orange light glowed in them, making them look like the eyes of a Japanese movie monster.</p><p>That random thought passed across her mind, then vanished, leaving her blank and numb. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do at this point. There were no sounds from the beach anymore; the noises of Bonnet\u2019s flight had long since faded.</p><p>The rain was still falling, but the last of the sun shone through the wood, the long rays nearly horizontal, filling the space between the shadows with an odd, shifting light that seemed to waver as she watched, as though the world around her were about to disappear.</p><p>In the midst of it, dreamlike, she saw the women appear, the Fulani twins. They turned the identical faces of fawns to her, huge eyes black with fear, and ran into the wood. She called out to them, but they disappeared. Feeling unutterably tired, she trudged after them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t find them. Nor was there a sign of anyone else. The light began to die, and she turned back, limping, toward the house. She ached everywhere, and began to suffer from the illusion that there was no one left in the world but her. Nothing but the burning light, fading to ashes moment by moment.</p><p>Then she remembered the baby in her womb, and felt better. No matter what, she wasn\u2019t alone. Nonetheless, she gave a wide berth to the place where she thought Emmanuel\u2019s body lay. She had meant to circle back toward the house, but went too far. As she turned to go back, she caught a glimpse of them, standing together in the shelter of the trees on the other side of a stream.</p><p>The wild horses, tranquil as the trees around them, flanks gleaming bay and chestnut and black with the wet. They raised their heads, scenting her, but didn\u2019t run, only stood regarding her with big, gentle eyes.</p><p>THE RAIN HAD stopped when she reached the house. Ian sat on the stoop, wringing water out of his long hair.</p><p>\u201cYou have mud on your face, Ian,\u201d she said, sinking down beside him.</p><p>\u201cOh, have I?\u201d he said, giving her a half-smile. \u201cHow is it, then, coz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m . . . I think I\u2019m fine. What\u2014?\u201d She gestured at his shirt, stained with watery blood. Something seemed to have hit him in the face; besides the smudges of mud, his nose was puffed, there was a swelling just above his brow, and his clothes were torn, as well as wet.</p><p>He drew a deep, deep breath and sighed, as though he were as tired as she was.</p><p>\u201cI got back the wee black lass,\u201d he said. \u201cPhaedre.\u201d</p><p>That pierced the dreamlike fugue that filled her mind, but only a little.</p><p>\u201cPhaedre,\u201d she said, the name feeling like that of someone she had once known, long ago. \u201cIs she all right? Where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn there.\u201d Ian nodded back toward the house, and she became aware that what she had thought the sound of the sea was in fact someone weeping, the small sobs of someone who has already wept herself to exhaustion, but cannot stop.</p><p>\u201cNay, leave her to herself, coz.\u201d Ian\u2019s hand on her arm stopped her from rising. \u201cYe canna help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped her, reaching into his shirt. From around his neck, he took a battered wooden rosary, and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll maybe want this\u2014later. I picked it up from the sand, after the ship . . . left.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since her escape, the nausea was back, a sense of vertigo that threatened to pull her down into blackness.</p><p>\u201cJosh,\u201d she whispered. Ian nodded silently, though it hadn\u2019t been a question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, coz,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>IT WAS NEARLY DARK when Roger appeared at the edge of the wood. She hadn\u2019t been worrying, only because she was in a state of shock too deep even to think of what was happening. At sight of him, though, she was on her feet and flying toward him, all the fears she had suppressed erupting at last into tears, running down her face like the rain.</p><p>\u201cDa,\u201d she said, choking and sniffling into his wet shirt. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014is he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right. Bree\u2014can ye come with me? Are ye strong enough\u2014just for a bit?\u201d</p><p>Gulping and wiping her nose on the soggy arm of her shift, she nodded, and leaning on his arm, limped into the darkness under the trees.</p><p>Bonnet was lying against a tree, head lolling to one side. There was blood on his face, running down onto his shirt. She felt no sense of victory at sight of him, only an infinitely weary distaste.</p><p>Her father was standing silently under the same tree. When he saw her, he stepped forward and folded her wordlessly into his arms. She closed her eyes for one blissful moment, wanting nothing more than to abandon everything, let him pick her up like a child and carry her home. But they had brought her here for a reason; with immense effort, she lifted her head and looked at Bonnet.</p><p>Did they want congratulations? she wondered fuzzily. But then she remembered what Roger had told her, describing her father leading her mother through the scene of butchery, making her look, so that she would know her tormentors were dead.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, swaying a little. \u201cAll right, I mean. I\u2014I see. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . no. Actually, he isn\u2019t.\u201d Roger\u2019s voice held an odd note of strain, and he coughed, with a look that shot daggers at her father.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want him dead, lass?\u201d Her father touched her shoulder, gently. \u201cIt is your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2014\u201d She looked wildly from one to the other of the grave, shadowed faces, then at Bonnet, realizing for the first time that blood was running down his face. Dead men, as her mother had often explained, don\u2019t bleed.</p><p>They had found Bonnet, Jamie said, run him to earth like a fox, and set about him. It had been an ugly fight, close-to, with knives, as their pistols were useless in the wet. Knowing that he fought for his life, Bonnet had struck viciously\u2014there was a red-stained gash in the shoulder of Jamie\u2019s coat, a scratch high on Roger\u2019s throat, where a knife blade had passed within a fraction of slashing his jugular. But Bonnet had fought to escape, and not to kill\u2014retreating into a space between trees where only one could come at him, he had grappled with Jamie, thrown him off, then bolted.</p><p>Roger had given chase, and boiling with adrenaline, had thrown himself at Bonnet bodily, knocking the pirate headfirst into the tree he now lay against.</p><p>\u201cSo there he lies,\u201d Jamie said, giving Bonnet a bleak eye. \u201cI had hoped he\u2019d broken his neck, but no such thing, alas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is unconscious,\u201d Roger said, and swallowed.</p><p>She understood, and in her present mood, this particular male quirk of honor seemed reasonable. To kill a man in fair fight\u2014or even an unfair fight\u2014was one thing; to cut his throat while he lay unconscious at your feet was another.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t understood at all. Her father wiped his dirk on his breeches and handed it to her, hilt first.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . me?\u201d She was too shocked even to feel astonishment. The knife was heavy in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIf ye wish it,\u201d her father said, with grave courtesy. \u201cIf not, Roger Mac or I will do it. But it is your choice, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood Roger\u2019s look\u2014they had been arguing about it, before he had come to fetch her. And she understood exactly why her father offered her the choice. Whether it was vengeance or forgiveness, she held the man\u2019s life in her hand. She took a deep breath, the awareness that it would not be vengeance coming over her with something like relief.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d Roger said softly, touching her arm. \u201cSay the word if ye\u2019ll have him dead; I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and took a deep breath. She could hear the savage longing in his voice\u2014he did. She could hear the choked sound of his voice in memory, too, when he had told her of killing Boble\u2014when he woke from dreams of it, drenched in sweat.</p><p>She glanced at her father\u2019s face, nearly drowned in shadow. Her mother had said only a little of the violent dreams that haunted him since Culloden\u2014but that little was enough. She could hardly ask her father to do this\u2014to spare Roger what he suffered himself.</p><p>Jamie raised his head, feeling her eyes on him, and met her gaze, straight on. Jamie Fraser had never turned from a fight he saw as his\u2014but this was not his fight, and he knew it. She had a sudden flash of awareness; it wasn\u2019t Roger\u2019s fight, either, though he would take the weight of it from her shoulders, and gladly.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2014if we\u2014if we don\u2019t kill him here and now\u2014\u201d Her chest was tight, and she stopped for breath. \u201cWhat will we do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him to Wilmington,\u201d her father said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe Committee of Safety there is strong, and they know him for a pirate; they\u2019ll deal with him by law\u2014or what passes for it now.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d hang him; he would be just as dead\u2014but his blood wouldn\u2019t be on Roger\u2019s hands, or in his heart.</p><p>The light was gone. Bonnet was no more than a lumpen shape, dark against the sandy ground. He might die of his wounds, she thought, and dimly hoped so\u2014it would save trouble. But if they took him to her mother, Claire would be compelled to try to save him. She never turned from a fight that was hers, either, Brianna thought wryly, and was surprised to feel a small lightening of spirit at the thought.</p><p>\u201cLet him live to be hanged, then,\u201d she said quietly, and touched Roger\u2019s arm. \u201cNot for his sake. For yours and mine. For your baby.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, she was sorry that she\u2019d told him now, in the night-dark wood. She would so much have liked to see his face.</p><p>109</p><p>ALL THE NEWS THAT\u2019S</p><p>FIT TO PRINT</p><p>FROM L\u2019Oignon\u2013Intelligencer, September 25, 1775</p><p>A ROYAL PROCLAMATION\u2014</p><p>A Proclamation was issued in London upon the 23rd of August, in which His Majesty George III proclaims the American Colonies to be \u201cin a State of open and avowed Rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNOTHING BUT OUR OWN EXERTIONS MAY DEFEAT THE MINISTERIAL SENTENCE OF DEATH OR ABJECT SUBMISSION\u201d\u2014The Continental Congress in Philadelphia has now rejected the Objectionable Proposals put forth by Lord North, intended to promote the Object of Reconciliation.

I think Duncan has sufficient trouble on his hands; he\u2019d feel obliged to take issue wi\u2019 Forbes, and that\u2019s a stramash he doesna need to start just now. As for my aunt . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t complete the statement, but the bleakness of his countenance spoke well enough. The MacKenzies of Leoch were a vengeful lot, and neither he nor I would put it past Jocasta to invite Neil Forbes to dinner and poison him.</p><p>\u201cAlways assuming that Mr. Forbes is accepting dinner invitations these days,\u201d I joked uneasily. \u201cDo you know what Ian did with the . . . er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was going to feed it to his dog,\u201d Jamie replied thoughtfully. \u201cBut I dinna ken was he serious or not.\u201d</p> <p>Phaedre had been a good deal shocked, both by her experiences and by the loss of Josh, and Brianna insisted that we bring her back to the Ridge with us to recover, until we could find a reasonable place for her.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get Aunt Jocasta to free her,\u201d Bree had argued.</p><p>\u201cI think that willna be difficult,\u201d Jamie had assured her with a certain grimness. \u201cNot knowing what we know. But wait a bit, until we find a place for the lass\u2014then I\u2019ll see to it.\u201d</p><p>As it was, that particular matter took care of itself with stunning abruptness.</p><p>I opened the door to a knock one afternoon in October, to find three weary horses and a pack mule in the dooryard, and Jocasta, Duncan, and the black butler Ulysses standing on the stoop.</p> <p>The sight of them was so utterly incongruous that I merely stood there gaping at them, until Jocasta said acerbically, \u201cWeel, lass, d\u2019ye mean us to stand here until we\u2019re melted away like sugar in a dish o\u2019 tea?\u201d</p><p>It was in fact raining quite hard, and I stepped back so quickly to let them in that I trod on Adso\u2019s paw. He uttered a piercing yowl, which brought Jamie out of his study, Mrs. Bug and Amy from the kitchen\u2014and Phaedre out of the surgery, where she had been grinding herbs for me.</p><p>\u201cPhaedre!\u201d Duncan\u2019s jaw dropped, and he took two steps toward her. He stopped abruptly, just before taking her into his arms, but his face suffused with joy.</p><p>\u201cPhaedre?\u201d said Jocasta, sounding utterly astounded. Her face had gone quite blank with shock.</p><p>Ulysses said nothing, but the look on his face was one of unalloyed horror. Within a second, it was gone, replaced by his usual austere expression of dignity, but I\u2019d seen it\u2014and kept a narrow eye on him during the ensuing confusion of exclamations and embarrassments.</p><p>Finally, I got them all out of the front hall. Jocasta suffered a diplomatic headache\u2014though seeing her drawn face, I thought it wasn\u2019t entirely feigned\u2014and was escorted upstairs by Amy, who put her to bed with a cold compress. Mrs. Bug went back to the kitchen, excitedly revising the supper menu. Phaedre, looking frightened, disappeared, doubtless to take refuge in Brianna\u2019s cabin and tell her all about the unexpected arrival\u2014which meant there would be another three for supper.</p> <p>Ulysses went to deal with the horses, leaving Duncan at last alone to explain matters to Jamie in the study.</p><p>\u201cWe are emigrating to Canada,\u201d he said, closing his eyes and inhaling the aroma of the glass of whisky in his hand as though it were smelling salts. He looked like he needed them; he was gaunt, and his face was nearly as gray as his hair.</p><p>\u201cCanada?\u201d Jamie said, as surprised as I was. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Duncan, what have ye been doing?\u201d</p><p>Duncan smiled wearily, opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMore what I didna do, Mac Dubh,\u201d he said. Brianna had told us about the disappearance of the secret hoard of gold, and had mentioned something about Duncan\u2019s dealings with Lord Dunsmore in Virginia, but had been vague about it\u2014understandably so, as she had been kidnapped a few hours afterward, and had no details.</p><p>\u201cI should never ha\u2019 believed matters could come to such a pass\u2014nor sae quickly,\u201d he said, shaking his head. Loyalists had gone suddenly from being a majority in the piedmont to being a threatened and frightened minority. Some folk had been literally chased from their homes, to take refuge skulking in swamps and woods; others had been beaten and badly injured.</p><p>\u201cEven Farquard Campbell,\u201d Duncan said, and rubbed a hand tiredly over his face. \u201cThe Committee of Safety called him before them, on charges of being loyal to the Crown, and threatened to confiscate his plantation. He put up a great deal of money, pledged as surety for his good behavior, and they let him go\u2014but it was a near thing.\u201d</p><p>Near enough to have frightened Duncan badly. The debacle of the promised guns and powder had deprived him of any influence with the local Loyalists and left him completely isolated, vulnerable to the next wave of hostilities\u2014which any fool could see would not be long in coming.</p> <p>He had therefore moved swiftly to sell River Run at a decent price, before it was seized. He had kept one or two warehouses on the river and a few other assets, but had disposed of the plantation, slaves, and livestock, and proposed to remove at once with his wife to Canada, as many other Loyalists were doing.</p><p>\u201cHamish MacKenzie is there, ken,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe and some others from Leoch settled in Nova Scotia, when they left Scotland in the wake of Culloden. He\u2019s Jocasta\u2019s nephew, and we\u2019ve money enough\u2014\u201d He glanced vaguely toward the hall, where Ulysses had dumped the saddlebags. \u201cHe\u2019ll help us to find a place.\u201d</p><p>He smiled crookedly.</p><p>\u201cAnd if things shouldna turn out well . . . they do say the fishing\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled at the feeble joke, and poured him more whisky, but he shook his head when he came to join me in the surgery, before dinner.</p><p>\u201cThey mean to travel overland to Virginia, and with luck take ship there for Nova Scotia. They can perhaps get out of Newport News; it\u2019s a small port, and the British blockade isna tight there\u2014or so Duncan hopes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d It would be a grueling journey\u2014and Jocasta was not a young woman. And the state of her eye . . . I was not fond of Jocasta, in light of what we had learned about her recently, but to think of her ripped from her home, forced to emigrate while suffering excruciating pain\u2014well, it caused one to think there might be such a thing as divine retribution, after all.</p><p>I lowered my voice, looking over my shoulder to be sure Duncan had in fact gone upstairs. \u201cWhat about Ulysses? And Phaedre?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s lips pressed tight.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, as to the lass\u2014I asked Duncan to sell her to me. I shall set her free as quickly as I can; perhaps send her to Fergus, in New Bern. He agreed at once, and wrote out a bill of sale on the spot.\u201d He nodded toward his office. \u201cAs for Ulysses . . .\u201d His face was grim. \u201cI think that matter will adjust itself, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug came bustling down the hall to announce that the supper was served, and I had no chance to ask him what he meant by that remark.</p><p>I SQUEEZED OUT the poultice of witch hazel and Carolina allspice, and laid it gently over Jocasta\u2019s eyes. I\u2019d already given her willow-bark tea for the pain, and the poultice would do nothing for the underlying glaucoma\u2014but it would be soothing, at least, and it was a relief to both patient and physician to be able to offer something, even though that might be the merest palliative.</p><p>\u201cWill ye have a keek in my saddlebags, lass?\u201d she asked, stretching a little to ease herself on the bed. \u201cThere\u2019s a bittie parcel in there of an herb ye might find of interest.\u201d</p><p>I found it immediately\u2014by smell.</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth did you get that?\u201d I asked, halfway amused.</p><p>\u201cFarquard Campbell,\u201d she replied matter-of-factly. \u201cWhen ye told me what the difficulty was with my eyes, I asked Fentiman if he kent anything that might be of help, and he told me that he\u2019d heard somewhere that hemp might be of use. Farquard Campbell has a field of it under cultivation, so I thought I might as well try it. It does seem to help. Would ye put it in my hand, please, niece?\u201d</p><p>Fascinated, I put the parcel of hemp and the little stack of papers down on the table beside her, and guided her hand to it. Rolling carefully onto her side to prevent the poultice falling off, she took a good pinch of aromatic herb, sprinkled it down the center of the paper, and rolled as tidy a joint as I had ever seen in Boston.</p><p>Without comment, I held the candle flame for her to light it, and she eased herself back on the pillow, nostrils flaring as she took a deep lungful of smoke.</p><p>She smoked in silence for some time, and I busied myself in putting things away, not wanting to leave her lest she fall asleep and set the bed on fire\u2014she was clearly exhausted, and relaxing further by the moment.</p><p>The pungent, heady smell of the smoke brought back instant, though fragmentary memories. Several of the younger medical students had smoked it on weekends, and would come to the hospital with the scent of it in their clothes. Some of the people brought into the emergency room had reeked of it. Now and then, I\u2019d smelled the faintest hint of it on Brianna\u2014but never inquired.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t ever tried it, myself, but now found the smell of the fragrant smoke rather soothing. Rather too soothing, and I went and sat down by the window, open a crack to admit fresh air.</p><p>It had been raining off and on all day, and the air was sharp with ozone and tree resins, welcomely cold against my face.</p><p>\u201cYe know, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jocasta\u2019s voice came softly from behind me. I looked round; she hadn\u2019t moved, but lay like a tomb figure on the bed, straight as a die. The poultice bandage over her eyes made her look like the image of Justice\u2014ironic, that, I thought.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, matching her own calm tone. \u201cNot very fair to Duncan, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word drifted out with the smoke, almost soundless. She lifted the cigarette lazily and drew air through it, making the end glow red. I kept a narrow eye, but she seemed to have a feel for the ash, tapping it now and then into the saucer base of the candlestick.</p><p>\u201cHe knows, too,\u201d she said, almost casually. \u201cAbout Phaedre. I told him, finally, to stop him searching for her. I am sure he knows about Ulysses, too\u2014but he doesna speak of it.\u201d</p><p>She reached out, unerring, and tapped the ash neatly from the joint.</p><p>\u201cI told him I wouldna blame him if he left me, ken.\u201d Her voice was very soft, nearly without emotion. \u201cHe wept, but then he stopped, and said to me that he had said, \u2018For better or for worse\u2019\u2014and so had I, had I not? I said I had, and he said, \u2018Well, then.\u2019 And here we are.\u201d She shrugged a little, settling herself more comfortably, and fell silent, smoking.</p><p>I turned my face again to the window and leaned my forehead against the frame. Below, I saw a sudden spill of light as the door opened, and a dark figure came quickly out. The door closed, and I lost sight of him in the darkness for an instant; then my eyes adapted and I saw him again, just before he vanished on the path to the barn.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Startled, I turned round to look at her, realizing that she must have heard the closing of the door below.</p><p>\u201cUlysses? Yes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>She was still for quite a while, the cigarette burning unregarded in her hand. Just before I thought I must rise and take it from her, she lifted it again to her lips.</p><p>\u201cHis true name was Joseph,\u201d she said softly, releasing the smoke. Wisps of it swirled slowly in a cloud around her head. \u201cSo appropriate, I always thought\u2014for he was sold into slavery by his own people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen his face?\u201d I asked suddenly. She shook her head, and ground out the last of the cigarette.</p><p>\u201cNay, but I kent him always,\u201d she said very softly. \u201cHe smelled of light.\u201d</p><p>JAMIE FRASER sat patiently in the darkness of his barn. It was a small one, with stallage for only half a dozen animals, but soundly built. Rain beat solidly on the roof, and wind whined like a ban-sidhe round the corners, but not a drip came through the shingled roof, and the air inside was warm with the heat of somnolent beasts. Even Gideon was a-nod over his manger, half-chewed hay hanging from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>It was past midnight now, and he had been waiting for more than two hours, the pistol loaded and primed, resting on his knee.</p><p>There it was; above the rain, he heard the soft grunt of someone pushing at the door, and the rumble as it slid open, admitting a breath of cold rain to mingle with the warmer scents of hay and manure.</p><p>He sat still, not moving.</p><p>He could see a tall form pause against the lighter black of the rain-drenched night, waiting for his eyes to adapt to the dark within, then throw his weight against the heavy door to open it enough to slip inside.</p><p>The man had brought a dark-lantern, not trusting that he could find the necessary bits of harness and apply them in the dark. He drew back the slide and turned the lantern slowly, letting the shaft of light travel over the stalls, one by one. The three horses Jocasta had brought were here, but done in. Jamie heard the man click his tongue softly in consideration, turning the light back and forth between the mare, Jerusha, and Gideon.</p><p>Making up his mind, Ulysses set the lantern on the floor, and made to pull the pin fastening the door to Gideon\u2019s stall.</p><p>\u201cIt would serve ye right, and I let ye take him,\u201d Jamie said conversationally.</p><p>The butler let out a sharp yelp and whirled round, glaring, his fists clenched. He couldn\u2019t see Jamie in the dark, but the evidence of his ears caught up with him a second later, and he breathed deeply and lowered his fists, realizing who it was.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said. His eyes were live in the lantern light, and watchful. \u201cYou took me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did intend to,\u201d Jamie replied equably. \u201cYe mean to be off, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He could see thoughts flit through the butler\u2019s eyes, quick as dragonflies, wondering, calculating. But Ulysses was no fool, and came to the correct conclusion.</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s told you, then,\u201d he said, quite calmly. \u201cShall you kill me\u2014for your aunt\u2019s honor?\u201d Had that last been said with any trace of a sneer, Jamie might have killed him indeed\u2014he\u2019d been of two minds on the matter while he waited. But it was said simply, and Jamie\u2019s finger eased on the trigger.</p><p>\u201cIf I were a younger man, I would,\u201d he said, matching Ulysses\u2019s tone. And if I did not have a wife and daughter who once called a black man friend.</p><p>\u201cAs it is,\u201d he went on, lowering the pistol, \u201cI try not to kill these days unless I must.\u201d Or until I must. \u201cDo ye offer me denial? For I think there can be nay defense.\u201d</p><p>The butler shook his head slightly. The light gleamed on his skin, dark, with a reddish undertone that made him look as though carved from aged cinnabar.</p><p>\u201cI loved her,\u201d he said softly, and spread his hands. \u201cKill me.\u201d He was dressed for traveling, in cloak and hat, with a pouch and canteen hung at his belt, but no knife. Slaves, even trusted ones, dared not go armed.</p><p>Curiosity warred with distaste, and\u2014as usual in such warfare\u2014curiosity won.</p><p>\u201cPhaedre said ye lay with my aunt, even before her husband died. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Ulysses said softly, his expression unreadable. \u201cI do not justify it. I cannot. But I loved her, and if I must die for that . . .\u201d</p><p>Jamie believed the man; his sincerity was evident in voice and gesture. And knowing his aunt as he did, he was less inclined to blame Ulysses than the world at large would be. At the same time, he was not letting down his guard; Ulysses was good-size, and quick. And a man who thought he had nothing to lose was very dangerous indeed.</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye mean to go?\u201d he asked with a nod toward the horses.</p><p>\u201cVirginia,\u201d the black man replied with a barely perceptible hesitation. \u201cLord Dunsmore has offered freedom to any slave who will join his army.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to ask, though it was a question that had raised itself in his mind from the moment he heard Phaedre\u2019s story. With this opening, though, he could not resist.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she not free you?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter Hector Cameron died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did\u201d was the surprising answer. The butler touched the breast of his coat. \u201cShe wrote the papers of manumission nearly twenty years ago\u2014she said she could not bear to think that I came to her bed only because I must. But a request for manumission must be approved by the Assembly, you know. And if I had been openly freed, I could not have stayed to serve her as I did.\u201d That was true enough; a freed slave was compelled to leave the colony within ten days or risk being enslaved again, by anyone who chose to take him; the vision of large gangs of free Negroes roaming the countryside was one that made the Council and Assembly shit themselves with fear.</p><p>The butler looked down for a moment, eyes hooded against the light.</p><p>\u201cI could choose Jo\u2014or freedom. I chose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, verra romantic,\u201d Jamie said with extreme dryness\u2014though in fact, he was not unaffected by the statement. Jocasta MacKenzie had married for duty, and duty again\u2014and he thought she had had little happiness in any of her marriages until finding some measure of contentment with Duncan. He was shocked at her choice, disapproving of her adultery, and very angry indeed at her deception of Duncan, but some part of him\u2014the MacKenzie part, doubtless\u2014could not but admire her boldness in taking happiness where she could.</p><p>He sighed deeply. The rain was easing now; the thundering on the roof had dwindled to a soft pattering.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I have one question more.\u201d</p><p>Ulysses inclined his head gravely, in a gesture Jamie had seen a thousand times. At your service, sir, it said\u2014and that was done with more irony than there was in anything the man had said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the gold?\u201d</p><p>Ulysses\u2019s head jerked up, eyes wide with startlement. For the first time, Jamie felt a shred of doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou think I took it?\u201d the butler said incredulously. But then his mouth twisted to one side. \u201cI suppose you would, after all.\u201d He rubbed a hand under his nose, looking worried and unhappy\u2014as well he might, Jamie reflected.</p><p>They stood regarding each other in silence for some time, at an impasse. Jamie did not have the feeling that the other was attempting to deceive him\u2014and God knew the man was good at that, he thought cynically.</p><p>At last, Ulysses heaved his wide shoulders, and let them drop in helplessness.</p><p>\u201cI cannot prove that I did not,\u201d he said. \u201cI can offer nothing save my word of honor\u2014and I am not entitled to have such a thing.\u201d For the first time, bitterness rang in his voice.</p><p>Jamie suddenly felt very tired. The horses and mules had long since gone back to their drowse, and he wanted nothing so much as his own bed, and his wife beside him. He also wanted Ulysses to be gone, long before Duncan discovered his perfidy. And while Ulysses was patently the most obvious person to have taken the gold, the fact remained that he could have taken it anytime in the last twenty years, with a good deal less danger. Why now?</p><p>\u201cWill ye swear on my aunt\u2019s head?\u201d he asked abruptly. Ulysses\u2019s eyes were sharp, shining in the lantern light, but steady.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said at last, quietly. \u201cI do so swear.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was about to dismiss him, when one last thought occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have children?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Indecision crossed the chiseled face; surprise and wariness, mingled with something else.</p><p>\u201cNone I would claim,\u201d he said at last, and Jamie saw what it was\u2014scorn, mixed with shame. His jaw tensed, and his chin rose slightly. \u201cWhy do you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>Jamie met his gaze for a moment, thinking of Brianna growing heavy with child.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said at last, \u201cit is only the hope of betterment for my children, and theirs, that gives me the courage to do what must be done here.\u201d Ulysses\u2019s face had gone blank; it gleamed black and impassive in the light.</p><p>\u201cIf you have no stake in the future, you have no reason to suffer for it. Such children as you may have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are slaves, born of slave women. What can they be, to me?\u201d Ulysses\u2019s hands were clenched, pressed against his thighs.</p><p>\u201cThen go,\u201d Jamie said softly, and stood aside, gesturing toward the door with the barrel of his pistol. \u201cDie free, at least.\u201d</p><p>111</p><p>JANUARY TWENTY-FIRST</p><p>January 21, 1776</p><p>JANUARY 21 WAS THE COLDEST DAY of the year. Snow had fallen a few days before, but now the air was like cut crystal, the dawn sky so pale it looked white, and the packed snow chirped like crickets under our boots. Snow, snow-shrouded trees, the icicles that hung from the eaves of the house\u2014the whole world seemed blue with cold. All of the stock had been put up the night before in stable or barn, with the exception of the white sow, who appeared to be hibernating under the house.</p><p>I peered dubiously at the small, melted hole in the crust of snow that marked the sow\u2019s entrance; long, stertorous snores were audible inside, and a faint warmth emanated from the hole.</p><p>\u201cCome along, mo nighean. Yon creature wouldna notice if the house fell down atop her.\u201d Jamie had come down from feeding the animals in the stable, and was hovering impatiently behind me, chafing his hands in the big blue mittens Bree had knitted for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat, not even if it was on fire?\u201d I said, thinking of Lamb\u2019s \u201cEssay on Roast Pork.\u201d But I turned obligingly to follow him down the trampled path past the side of the house, then slowly, slipping on the icy patches, across the wide clearing toward Bree and Roger\u2019s cabin.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re sure the hearth fire\u2019s out?\u201d Jamie asked, for the third time. His breath wreathed round his head like a veil as he looked over his shoulder at me. He had lost his woolen cap hunting, and instead had a woolly white muffler wrapped around his ears and tied on top of his head, the long ends flopping, which made him look absurdly like an enormous rabbit.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I assured him, suppressing an urge to laugh at sight of him. His long nose was pink with cold, and twitched suspiciously, and I buried my face in my own muffler, making small snorting noises that emerged as puffs of white, like a steam engine.</p><p>\u201cAnd the bedroom candle? The wee lamp in your surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I assured him, emerging from the depths of the muffler. My eyes were watering and I would have liked to wipe them, but I had a huge bundle in one arm and a covered basket hung on the other. This contained Adso, who had been forcibly removed from the house, and wasn\u2019t pleased about it; small growls emerged from the basket, and it swayed and thumped against my leg.</p><p>\u201cAnd the rush dip in the pantry, and the candle in the wall sconce in the hall, and the brazier in your office, and the fish-oil lantern you use in the stables. I went over the whole house with a nit comb. Not a spark anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough, then,\u201d he said\u2014but couldn\u2019t help an uneasy glance backward at the house. I looked, too; it looked cold and forlorn, the white of its boards rather grimy against the pristine snow.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be an accident,\u201d I said. \u201cNot unless the white sow is playing with matches in her den.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile, in spite of the circumstances. Frankly, at the moment, the circumstances struck me as slightly absurd; the whole world seemed deserted, frozen solid and immobile under a winter sky. Nothing seemed less likely than that cataclysm could descend to destroy the house by fire. Still . . . better safe than sorry. And as Jamie had remarked more than once during the years since Roger and Bree had brought word of that sinister newspaper clipping, \u201cIf ye ken the house is meant to burn down on a certain day, why would ye be standing in it?\u201d</p><p>So we weren\u2019t standing in it. Mrs. Bug had been told to stay at home, and Amy McCallum and her two little boys were already at Brianna\u2019s cabin\u2014puzzled, but obliging. If Himself said that no one was to set foot in the house until dawn tomorrow . . . well, then, there was nothing more to be said, was there?</p><p>Ian had been up since before dawn, chopping kindling and hauling in firewood from the shed; everyone would be snug and warm.</p><p>Jamie himself had been up all night, tending stock, dispersing his armory\u2014there was not a grain of gunpowder anywhere in the house, either\u2014and prowling restlessly upstairs and down, alert to every cracking ember on a hearth, every burning candle flame, any faint noise without that might portend the approach of an enemy. The only thing he hadn\u2019t done was to sit on the roof with a wet sack, keeping a suspicious eye out for lightning\u2014and that, only because it had been a cloudless night, the stars immense and bright overhead, burning in the frozen void.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t slept a great deal, either, disturbed equally by Jamie\u2019s prowling and by vivid dreams of conflagration.</p><p>The only conflagration visible, though, was the one sending a welcome shower of smoke and sparks from Brianna\u2019s chimney, and we opened the door to the grateful warmth of a roaring hearth and a number of bodies.</p><p>Aidan and Orrie, roused in the dark and dragged through the cold, had promptly crawled into Jemmy\u2019s trundle, and the three little boys were sound asleep, curled up like hedgehogs beneath their quilt. Amy was helping Bree with the breakfast; savory smells of porridge and bacon rose from the hearth.</p><p>\u201cIs all well, ma\u2019am?\u201d Amy hurried over to take the big bundle I had brought\u2014this contained my medical chest, the more scarce and valuable herbs from my surgery\u2014and the sealed jar with the latest shipment of white phosphorus that Lord John had sent as a farewell present to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I assured her, setting Adso\u2019s basket on the floor. I yawned, and eyed the bed wistfully, but set about to stow my chest in the lean-to pantry, where the children wouldn\u2019t get into it. I put the phosphorus on the highest shelf, well back from the edge, and moved a large cheese in front of it, just in case.</p><p>Jamie had divested himself of cloak and rabbit ears, and handing Roger the fowling piece, shot pouch, and powder horn he\u2019d carried, was stamping snow from his boots. I saw him glance round the cabin, counting heads, then, at last, draw a small breath, nodding to himself. All safe, so far.</p><p>The morning passed peacefully. Breakfast eaten and cleared away, Amy, Bree, and I settled down by the fire with an enormous heap of mending. Adso, tail still twitching with indignation, had taken up a place on a high shelf, from whence he glared at Rollo, who had taken over the trundle bed when the boys got out of it.</p><p>Aidan and Jemmy, each now the proud possessor of two vrooms, drove them over hearthstones, under the bed, and through our feet, but for the most part, refrained from punching each other or stepping on Orrie, who was sitting placidly under the table gnawing on a piece of toast. Jamie, Roger, and Ian took turns going outside to pace back and forth and stare at the Big House, deserted in the shelter of the snow-dusted spruce.</p><p>As Roger came back from one of these expeditions, Brianna looked up suddenly from the sock she was darning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, seeing her face.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She had paused, needle halfway through the sock, and now looked down, completing her stitch. \u201cNothing. Just a\u2014just a thought.\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice made Jamie, who had been frowning his way through a battered copy of Evelina, look up.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of thought was that, a nighean?\u201d he asked, his radar quite as good as Roger\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . well.\u201d She bit her lower lip, but then blurted, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s this house?\u201d</p><p>That froze everyone except the little boys, who continued crawling industriously around the room and over bed and table, screeching and vrooming.</p><p>\u201cIt could be, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d Bree looked round, from rooftree to hearth. \u201cAll the\u2014the prophecy said\u201d\u2014with an awkward nod toward Amy McCallum\u2014\u201cwas the home of James Fraser would burn. But this was your home, to start with. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a street address. It just said, On Fraser\u2019s Ridge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone stared at her, and she flushed deeply, dropping her eyes to the sock.</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . it\u2019s not like they\u2014er, prophecies\u2014like they\u2019re always accurate, is it? They might have got the details wrong.\u201d</p><p>Amy nodded seriously; evidently, vagueness in the matter of detail was an accepted characteristic of prophecies.</p><p>Roger cleared his throat explosively; Jamie and Ian exchanged glances, then looked at the fire, leaping on the hearth and the towering stack of bone-dry firewood next to it, the overflowing kindling basket . . . Everyone\u2019s eyes turned expectantly to Jamie, whose face was a study in conflicting emotions.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cwe could remove to Arch\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>I began to count on my fingers: \u201cYou, me, Roger, Bree, Ian, Amy, Aidan, Orrie, Jemmy\u2014plus Mr. and Mrs. Bug\u2014is eleven people. In a one-room cabin that measures eight feet by ten?\u201d I closed my fists and stared at him. \u201cNo one would have to set the place on fire; half of us would be sitting in the hearth already, well alight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, then . . . the Christie place is empty.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s eyes went round with horror, and everyone looked automatically away from everyone else. Jamie took a deep breath and let it out, audibly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll just be . . . very careful,\u201d I suggested. Everyone exhaled slightly, and we resumed our occupations, though without our former sense of snug safety.</p> <p>Dinner passed without incident, but in midafternoon, a knock came on the door. Amy screamed, and Brianna dropped the shirt she was mending into the fire. Ian leaped to his feet and jerked the door open, and Rollo, jerked out of a doze, charged past him, roaring.</p><p>Jamie and Roger struck the doorway\u2014and each other\u2014simultaneously, stuck for an instant, and fell through. All the little boys shrieked and ran to their respective mothers, who were frantically beating at the smoldering shirt as though it were a live snake.</p><p>I had leaped to my feet, but was pressed against the wall, unable to get past Bree and Amy. Adso, startled by the racket and by my popping up beside him, hissed and took a swipe at me, narrowly missing my eye.</p><p>A number of oaths in a mixture of languages were coming from the dooryard, accompanied by a series of sharp barks from Rollo. Everyone sounded thoroughly annoyed, but there were no sounds of conflict. I edged my way delicately past the knot of mothers and sons, and peered out.</p><p>Major MacDonald, wet to the eyebrows and covered in clumps of snow and dirty slush, was gesticulating with some energy at Jamie, while Ian rebuked Rollo, and Roger\u2014from the look on his face\u2014was trying very hard not to burst out laughing.</p><p>Jamie, compelled by his own sense of propriety, but eyeing the Major with deep suspicion, invited him in. The inside of the cabin smelled of burned fabric, but at least the riot had calmed down, and the Major greeted us all with a fair assumption of cordiality. There was a lot of fuss, getting him stripped of his soaking-wet clothes, dried off, and\u2014for lack of any better alternative\u2014temporarily swathed in Roger\u2019s spare shirt and breeches, in which he appeared to be drowning, as he was a good six inches shorter than Roger.</p> <p>Food and whisky having been ceremonially offered and accepted, the household fixed the Major with a collective eye and waited to hear what had brought him to the mountains in the dead of winter.</p><p>Jamie exchanged a brief glance with me, indicating that he could hazard a guess. So could I.</p><p>\u201cI have come, sir,\u201d MacDonald said formally, hitching up the shirt to keep it from sliding off his shoulder, \u201cto offer ye command of a company of militia, under the orders of General Hugh MacDonald. The General\u2019s troops are gathering, even as we speak, and will undertake their march to Wilmington at the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>I felt a deep qualm of apprehension at that. I was accustomed to MacDonald\u2019s chronic optimism and tendency to overstatement, but there was nothing of exaggeration in this statement. Did that mean that the help Governor Martin had requested, the troops from Ireland, would be landing soon, to meet General MacDonald\u2019s troops at the coast?</p><p>\u201cThe General\u2019s troops,\u201d Jamie said, poking up the fire. He and MacDonald had taken over the fireside, with Roger and Ian ranged on either side of them, like firedogs. Bree, Amy, and I repaired to the bed, where we perched like a row of roosting hens, watching the conversation with a mingling of interest and alarm, while the little boys retired under the table.</p><p>\u201cHow many men does he have, would ye say, Donald?\u201d</p><p>I saw MacDonald hesitate, torn between truth and desire. He coughed, though, and said matter-of-factly, \u201cHe had a few more than a thousand when I left him. Ye ken weel, though\u2014once we begin to move, others will come to join us. Many others. The more particularly,\u201d he added pointedly, \u201cif such gentlemen as yourself are in command.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t reply to that at once. Meditatively, he shoved a burning wood fragment back into the fire with his foot.</p> <p>\u201cPowder and shot?\u201d he asked. \u201cArms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well; we\u2019d a bit of a disappointment there.\u201d MacDonald took a sip of his whisky. \u201cDuncan Innes had promised us a great deal in that way\u2014but in the end, he was obliged to renege upon his promise.\u201d The Major\u2019s lips pressed tight, and I thought from the expression on his face that perhaps Duncan had not been overreacting in his decision to move to Canada.</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d MacDonald continued more cheerfully, \u201cwe are not destitute in that regard. And those gallant gentlemen who have flocked to our cause\u2014and who will come to join us\u2014bring with them both their own weapons and their courage. You, of all people, must appreciate the force of the Hieland charge!\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked up at that, and regarded MacDonald for a long moment before replying.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. Ye were behind the cannon at Culloden, Donald. I was in front of them. With a sword in my hand.\u201d He took up his own glass and drained it, then got up and moved to pour another, leaving MacDonald to recover his countenance.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, Major,\u201d Brianna murmured under her breath. I didn\u2019t think Jamie had ever before referred to the fact that the Major had fought with the government forces during the Rising\u2014but I wasn\u2019t surprised that he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>With a brief nod to the company, Jamie stepped outside\u2014ostensibly to visit the privy, more likely to check on the well-being of the house. Still more likely to give MacDonald a little breathing room.</p><p>Roger, with the courtesy of a host\u2014and the suppressed keenness of a historian\u2014was asking MacDonald questions regarding the General and his activities. Ian, impassive and watchful, sat by his feet, one hand toying with Rollo\u2019s ruff.</p><p>\u201cThe General\u2019s rather elderly for such a campaign, surely?\u201d Roger took another stick of wood and pushed it into the fire. \u201cEspecially a winter campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the odd wee spell of catarrh,\u201d MacDonald admitted, offhand. \u201cBut who doesna, in this climate? And Donald McLeod, his lieutenant, is a man of vigor. I assure ye, sir, should the General be at any point indisposed, Colonel McLeod is more than capable of leading the troops to victory!\u201d</p><p>He went on at some length about the virtues\u2014both personal and military\u2014of Donald McLeod. I ceased listening, my attention distracted by a stealthy movement on the shelf above his head. Adso.</p><p>MacDonald\u2019s red coat was spread over the back of a chair to dry, steaming in the heat. His wig, damp and disheveled from Rollo\u2019s attack, hung on the cloak peg above it. I got up hastily and possessed myself of the wig, receiving a look of puzzlement from the Major, and one of green-eyed hostility from Adso, who plainly considered it low of me to hog this desirable prey for myself.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . I\u2019ll just . . . um . . . put it somewhere safe, shall I?\u201d Clutching the damp mass of horsehair to my bosom, I sidled outside and round to the pantry, where I tucked the wig safely away behind the cheese with the phosphorus.</p><p>Coming out, I met Jamie, red-nosed with cold, coming back from a reconnaissance of the Big House.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d he assured me. He glanced up at the chimney above us, spuming clouds of thick gray smoke. \u201cYe dinna suppose the lass might be right, do ye?\u201d He sounded as though he were joking, but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGod knows. How long \u2019til tomorrow\u2019s dawn?\u201d The shadows were already falling long, violet and chill across the snow.</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d He had violet shadows in his face, too, from one sleepless night; this would be another. He hugged me against himself for a moment, though, warm in spite of the fact that he wore nothing over his shirt but the rough jacket in which he did chores.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna suppose MacDonald will come back and fire the house, if I refuse him, do ye?\u201d he asked, releasing me with a fair attempt at a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018if\u2019?\u201d I demanded, but he was already on his way back in.</p><p>MacDonald stood up in respect when Jamie came in, waiting until he was seated again before taking his own stool.</p><p>\u201cHave ye had a moment, then, to think on my offer, Mr. Fraser?\u201d he asked formally. \u201cYour presence would be of the greatest value\u2014and valued greatly by General MacDonald and the Governor, as well as myself.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sat silent for a moment, looking into the fire.</p><p>\u201cIt grieves me, Donald, that we should find ourselves so opposed,\u201d he said at last, looking up. \u201cYe canna be in ignorance, though, of my position in this matter. I have declared myself.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald nodded, lips tightening a little.</p><p>\u201cI ken what ye\u2019ve done. But it is not too late for remedy. Ye\u2019ve done nothing yet that is irrevocable\u2014and a man may surely admit mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched a little.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, Donald. Might you admit your own mistake, then, and join the cause of liberty?\u201d</p><p>MacDonald drew himself up.</p><p>\u201cIt may please ye to tease, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said, obviously keeping a grip on his temper, \u201cbut my offer is made in earnest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Major. My apologies for undue levity. And also for the fact that I must make ye a poor reward of your efforts, coming so far in bitter weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe refuse, then?\u201d Red smudges burned on MacDonald\u2019s cheeks, and his pale blue eyes had gone the color of the winter sky. \u201cYe will abandon your kin, your ain folk? Ye would betray your blood, as well as your oath?\u201d</p><p>Jamie had opened his mouth to reply, but stopped at this. I could feel something going on inside him. Shock, at this blunt\u2014and very accurate\u2014accusation? Hesitation? He had never discussed the situation in those terms, but he must have grasped them. Most of the Highlanders in the colony either had joined the Loyalist side already\u2014like Duncan and Jocasta\u2014or likely would.</p><p>His declaration had cut him off from a great many friends\u2014and might well cut him off from the remnants of his family in the New World, as well. Now MacDonald was holding out the apple of temptation, the call of clan and blood.</p><p>But he had had years to think of it, to ready himself.</p><p>\u201cI have said what I must, Donald,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI have pledged myself and my house to what I believe is right. I cannot do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald sat for a moment, looking at him narrowly. Then, without a word, he stood and pulled Roger\u2019s shirt off over his head. His torso was pale and lean, but with a slight middle-aged softness round the waist, and bore several white scars, the marks of bullet wounds and sabre cuts.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to go, surely, Major? It\u2019s freezing out, and nearly dark!\u201d I came to stand by Jamie, and Roger and Bree rose, too, adding their protestations to mine. MacDonald, though, was obdurate, merely shaking his head as he pulled on his own damp clothing, fastening his coat with difficulty, as the buttonholes were stiff with damp.</p><p>\u201cI will not take hospitality from the hand of a traitor, mum,\u201d he said very quietly, and bowed to me. He straightened then, and met Jamie\u2019s eye, man to man.</p><p>\u201cWe shall not meet again as friends, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let us hope we do not meet again at all, Major,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI too regret it.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald bowed again, to the rest of the company, and clapped his hat on his head. His expression changed as he did so and felt the damp coldness of it on his bare head.</p><p>\u201cOh, your wig! Just a moment, Major\u2014I\u2019ll fetch it.\u201d I rushed out and round to the pantry\u2014just in time to hear a crash as something fell inside. I jerked open the door, left ajar from my last visit, and Adso streaked past me, the Major\u2019s wig in his mouth. Inside, the lean-to was in brilliant blue flames.</p><p>I HAD INITIALLY wondered how I would keep awake all night. In the event, it wasn\u2019t difficult at all. In the aftermath of the blaze, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever sleep again.</p><p>It could have been much worse; Major MacDonald, in spite of now being a sworn enemy, had come nobly to our aid, rushing out and flinging his still-wet cloak over the blaze, thus preventing the total destruction of the pantry\u2014and, doubtless, the cabin. The cloak had not put out the fire entirely, though, and quenching the flames that sprang up here and there had entailed a great deal of excitement and rushing about, in the course of which Orrie McCallum was misplaced, toddled off, and fell into the groundhog kiln, where he was found\u2014many frantic minutes later\u2014by Rollo.</p><p>He was fished out undamaged, but the hullabaloo caused Brianna to have what she thought was premature labor. Fortunately, this proved to be merely a bad case of hiccups, caused by the combination of nervous strain and eating excessive quantities of sauerkraut and dried-apple pie, for which she had conceived a recent craving.</p><p>\u201cFlammable, she said.\u201d Jamie looked at the charred remains of the pantry floor, then at Brianna, who had, in spite of my recommendation that she lie down, come out to see what could be salvaged from the smoking remains. He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that ye\u2019ve not burnt the place to ashes long since, lass.\u201d</p><p>She emitted a smothered \u201chic!\u201d and glowered at him, one hand on her bulging stomach.</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019d better not be try\u2014hic!\u2014ing to make out that this is my\u2014hic!\u2014fault. Did I put the Major\u2019s\u2014hic!\u2014wig next to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBOO!\u201d Roger bellowed, darting a hand at her face.</p><p>She shrieked, and hit him. Jemmy and Aidan, running out to see what the commotion was about, started dancing round her, ecstatically shouting, \u201cBoo! Boo!\u201d like a gang of miniature lunatic ghosts.</p><p>Bree, her eyes gleaming dangerously, bent and scooped up a handful of snow. In an instant, she had molded it into a ball, which she flung at her husband\u2019s head with deadly accuracy. It struck him right between the eyes, exploding in a shower that left white granules clinging to his eyebrows and melting globs of snow running down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said incredulously. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for? I was only trying to\u2014hey!\u201d He ducked the next one, only to be pelted round the knees and waist by handsful of snow lobbed at short range by Jemmy and Aidan, quite berserk by now.</p><p>Modestly accepting thanks for his action earlier, the Major had been persuaded\u2014not least by the fact that it was now full dark and beginning to snow again\u2014to accept the hospitality of the cabin, with the understanding that it was Roger, not Jamie, who was offering it. Watching his hosts whooping and hiccing as they plastered one another with snow, he looked as though he might be having second thoughts about being so fine as to refuse to dine with a traitor, but he rather stiffly bowed in response when Jamie and I bade him farewell, then trudged into the cabin, the muddy shreds that Adso had left of his wig clasped in his hand.</p><p>It seemed extremely\u2014and most gratefully\u2014quiet as we made our way through the falling snow toward our own house, alone. The sky had gone a pinkish lavender, and the flakes floated down around us, supernatural in their silence.</p><p>The house loomed before us, its quiet bulk somehow welcoming, in spite of the darkened windows. Snow was swirling across the porch in little eddies, piling in drifts on the sills.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would be harder for a fire to start if it\u2019s snowing\u2014wouldn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jamie bent to unlock the front door.</p><p>\u201cI dinna much mind if the place bursts into flame by spontaneous combustion, Sassenach, provided I have my supper first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cold supper, were you thinking?\u201d I asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI was not,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI mean to light a roaring fire in the kitchen hearth, fry up a dozen eggs in butter, and eat them all, then lay ye down on the hearth rug and roger ye \u2019til you\u2014is that all right?\u201d he inquired, noticing my look.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Til I what?\u201d I asked, fascinated by his description of the evening\u2019s program.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Til ye burst into flame and take me with ye, I suppose,\u201d he said, and stooping, swooped me up into his arms and carried me across the darkened threshold.</p><p>112</p><p>OATHBREAKER</p><p>February 2, 1776</p><p>HE CALLED THEM ALL TOGETHER, and they came. The Jacobites of Ardsmuir, the fishermen from Thurso, the outcasts and opportunists who had come to settle on the Ridge over the last six years. He had called for the men, and most came alone, making their way through the dripping woods, slipping on mossy rocks and muddy trails. Some of the wives came, as well, though, curious, wary, though they hung modestly back and allowed Claire to shepherd them into the house one by one.</p><p>The men stood in the dooryard, and he regretted that; the memory of the last time they had gathered here was much too fresh in everyone\u2019s mind. But there was no choice about it; there were too many to fit in the house. And it was broad day, now, not night\u2014though he saw more than one man turn his head sharply to glance at the chestnut trees, as though he saw the ghost of Thomas Christie there, poised once more to walk through the crowd.</p><p>He crossed himself, and said a hasty prayer, as he always did when he thought of Tom Christie, then stepped out on the porch. They had been talking together\u2014awkwardly, but with a fair assumption of ease\u2014but the talk died abruptly when he appeared.</p><p>\u201cI have received word summoning me to Wilmington,\u201d he said to them without preamble. \u201cI go to join the militias there, and I will take with me such men as will come willingly.\u201d</p><p>They gaped at him like sheep disturbed at grazing. He had a moment\u2019s unsettling impulse to laugh, but it passed at once.</p><p>\u201cWe will go as militia, but I do not command your service.\u201d Privately, he doubted that he could command more than a handful of them now, but as well to put a good face on it.</p><p>Most were still blinking at him, but one or two had got a grip on themselves.</p><p>\u201cYou declare yourself a rebel, Mac Dubh?\u201d That was Murdo, bless him. Loyal as a dog, but slow of thought. He needed things to be put in the simplest of terms, but once grasped, he would deal with them tenaciously.</p><p>\u201cAye, Murdo, I do. I am a rebel. So will any man be who marches with me.\u201d</p><p>That caused a fair degree of murmuring, glances of doubt. Here and there in the crowd, he heard the word \u201coath,\u201d and steeled himself for the obvious question.</p><p>He was taken aback by the man who asked it, though. Arch Bug drew himself up, tall and stern.</p><p>\u201cYe swore an oath to the King, Seaumais mac Brian,\u201d he said, his voice unexpectedly sharp. \u201cSo did we all.\u201d</p><p>There was a murmur of agreement at this, and faces turned to him, frowning, uneasy. He took a deep breath, and felt his stomach knot. Even now, knowing what he knew, and knowing too the immorality of a forced oath, to break his sworn word openly made him feel that he had stepped on a step that wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cSo did we all,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut it was an oath forced upon us as captives, not one given as men of honor.\u201d</p><p>This was patently true; still, it was an oath, and Highlanders did not take any oath lightly. May I die and be buried far from my kin . . . Oath or no, he thought grimly, that fate would likely be theirs.</p><p>\u201cBut an oath nonetheless, sir,\u201d said Hiram Crombie, lips drawn tight. \u201cWe have sworn before God. Do you ask us to put aside such a thing?\u201d Several of the Presbyterians murmured acquiescence, drawing closer to Crombie in show of support.</p><p>He took another deep breath, feeling his belly tighten.</p><p>\u201cI ask nothing.\u201d And knowing full well what he did, despising himself in a way for doing it\u2014he fell back upon the ancient weapons of rhetoric and idealism.</p><p>\u201cI said that the oath of loyalty to the King was an oath extorted, not given. Such an oath is without power, for no man swears freely, save he is free himself.\u201d</p><p>No one shouted disagreement, so he went on, voice pitched to carry, but not shouting.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll ken the Declaration of Arbroath, will ye? Four hundred years since, it was our sires, our grandsires, who put their hands to these words: . . . for as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule.\u201d He stopped to steady his voice, then went on. \u201cIt is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom\u2014for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.\u201d</p><p>He stopped dead then. Not for its effect on the men to whom he spoke, but because of the words themselves\u2014for in speaking them, he had found himself unexpectedly face to face with his own conscience.</p><p>To this point, he had been dubious about the justifications of the revolution, and more so of its ends; he had been compelled to the rebel stand because of what Claire, Brianna, and Roger Mac had told him. But in the speaking of the ancient words, he found the conviction he thought he pretended\u2014and was stricken by the thought that he did indeed go to fight for something more than the welfare of his own people.</p><p>And ye\u2019ll end up just as dead in the end, he thought, resigned. I dinna expect it hurts less, to ken it\u2019s for good cause\u2014but maybe so.</p><p>\u201cI shall leave in a week,\u201d he said quietly, and left them staring after him.</p><p>HE HAD EXPECTED his Ardsmuir men to come: the three Lindsay brothers, Hugh Abernathy, Padraic MacNeill, and the rest. Not expected, but gladly welcomed, were Robin McGillivray and his son, Manfred.</p><p>Ute McGillivray had forgiven him, he saw, with a certain sense of amusement. Besides Robin and Freddie, fifteen men from near Salem had come, all relatives of the redoubtable frau.</p><p>A great surprise, though, was Hiram Crombie, who alone of the fisher-folk had decided to join him.</p><p>\u201cI have prayed on the matter,\u201d Hiram informed him, managing to look more piously sour than usual, \u201cand I believe ye\u2019re right about the oath. I expect ye\u2019ll have us all hangit and burned oot of our homes\u2014but I\u2019ll come, nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>The rest\u2014with great mutterings and agitated debate\u2014had not. He didn\u2019t blame them. Having survived the aftermath of Culloden, the perilous voyage to the colonies, and the hardship of exile, the very last thing a sensible person could wish was to take up arms against the King.</p><p>The greatest surprise, though, awaited him as his small company rode out of Cooperville and turned into the road that led south.</p><p>A company of men, some forty strong, was waiting at the crossroad. He drew near warily, and a single man spurred out of the crowd and drew up with him\u2014Richard Brown, pale-faced and grim.</p><p>\u201cI hear you go to Wilmington,\u201d Brown said without preamble. \u201cIf so be as it\u2019s agreeable, my men and I will ride with you.\u201d He coughed, and added, \u201cUnder your command, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, he heard a small \u201chmph!\u201d from Claire, and suppressed a smile. He was quite aware of the phalanx of narrowed eyes at his back. He caught Roger Mac\u2019s eye, and his son-in-law gave a small nod. War made strange bedfellows; Roger Mac knew that as well as he did\u2014and for himself, he had fought with worse than Brown, during the Rising.</p><p>\u201cBe welcome, then,\u201d he said, and bowed from his saddle. \u201cYou and your men.\u201d</p><p>WE MET ANOTHER militia company near a place called Moore\u2019s Creek, and camped with them under the longleaf pines. There had been a bad ice storm the day before, and the ground was thick with fallen branches, some as large around as my waist. It made the going more difficult, but had its advantages, so far as making campfires went.</p><p>I was throwing a hastily assembled bucket of ingredients into the kettle for stew\u2014scraps of ham, with bones, beans, rice, onions, carrots, crumbled stale biscuit\u2014and listening to the other militia commander, Robert Borthy, who was telling Jamie\u2014with considerable levity\u2014about the state of the Emigrant Highland Regiment, as our opponents were formally known.</p><p>\u201cThere can\u2019t be more than five or six hundred, all told,\u201d he was saying with amused derision. \u201cOld MacDonald and his aides have been tryin\u2019 to scoop \u2019em up from the countryside for months, and I gather the effort has been akin to scoopin\u2019 water with a sieve.\u201d</p><p>On one occasion, Alexander McLean, one of the general\u2019s aides, had set up a rendezvous point, calling upon all the Highlanders and Scotch\u2013Irish in the neighborhood to assemble\u2014cannily providing a hogshead of liquor as inducement. Some five hundred men had in fact shown up\u2014but as soon as the liquor was drunk, they had melted away again, leaving McLean alone, and completely lost.</p><p>\u201cThe poor man wandered about for nearly two days, lookin\u2019 for the road, before someone took pity on him and led him back to civilization.\u201d Borthy, a hearty backwoods soul with a thick brown beard, grinned widely at the tale, and accepted a cup of ale with due thanks before going on.</p><p>\u201cGod knows where the rest of \u2019em are now. I hear tell that what troops Old MacDonald has are mostly brand-new emigrants\u2014the Governor made \u2019em swear to take up arms to defend the colony before he\u2019d grant them land. Most of them poor sods are fresh off the boat from Scotland\u2014they don\u2019t know north from south, let alone just where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I ken where they are, even if they don\u2019t.\u201d Ian came into the firelight, grubby but cheerful. He had been riding dispatches back and forth among the various militia companies converging on Wilmington, and his statement caused a rush of general interest.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Richard Brown leaned forward into the firelight, narrow face keen and foxy.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re comin\u2019 down Negro Head Point Road, marching like a proper regiment,\u201d Ian said, sinking onto a hastily offered log with a small groan. \u201cIs there anything hot to drink, Auntie? I\u2019m frozen and parched, both.\u201d</p><p>There was a nasty sort of dark liquid, called \u201ccoffee\u201d for courtesy\u2019s sake, and made from boiling burned acorns. I rather dubiously poured him a cup, but he consumed it with every evidence of enjoyment, meanwhile recounting the results of his expeditions.</p><p>\u201cThey meant to circle round to the west, but Colonel Howe\u2019s men got there first, and cut them off. So then they went across, meaning to take the ford\u2014but Colonel Moore put his men to the quick-step and marched all night to forestall them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made no move to engage either Howe or Moore?\u201d Jamie asked, frowning. Ian shook his head, and gulped the rest of his acorn coffee.</p><p>\u201cWouldna come close. Colonel Moore says they dinna mean to engage until they reach Wilmington\u2014they\u2019re expecting reinforcement there.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged a glance with Jamie. The expected reinforcement was presumably the British regular troops, promised by General Gage. But a rider from Brunswick we had met the day before had told us that no ships had arrived when he left the coast, four days before. If there was reinforcement awaiting them, it would have to come from the local Loyalists\u2014and from the various rumors and reports we\u2019d heard so far, the local Loyalists were a weak reed on which to lean.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. They\u2019re cut off on either side, aye? Straight down the road is where they\u2019re headed\u2014they might reach the bridge late tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow far is it, Ian?\u201d Jamie asked, squinting through the vista of longleaf pines. The trees were very tall, and the grassland under them wide open\u2014very reasonable for riding.</p><p>\u201cMaybe half a day on horseback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, then.\u201d Jamie relaxed a little, and reached for his own cup of the vile brew. \u201cWe\u2019ve time to sleep first, then.\u201d</p><p>WE REACHED the bridge at Moore\u2019s Creek by midday the next day, and joined the company commanded by Richard Caswell, who greeted Jamie with pleasure.</p> <p>The Highland regiment was nowhere in sight\u2014but dispatch riders arrived regularly, reporting their steady movement down Negro Head Point Road\u2014a wide wagon thoroughfare that led directly to the solid plank bridge that crossed the Widow Moore\u2019s Creek.</p><p>Jamie, Caswell, and several of the other commanders were walking up and down the bank, pointing at the bridge and up and down the shore. The creek ran through a stretch of treacherous, swampy ground, with cypress trees stretching up from water and mud. The creek itself deepened as it narrowed, though\u2014a plumb line that some curious soul dropped into the water off the bridge said it was fifteen feet deep at that point\u2014and the bridge was the only feasible place for an army of any size to cross.</p><p>Which did a great deal to explain Jamie\u2019s silence over supper. He had helped to throw up a small earthwork on the far side of the creek, and his hands were smeared with dirt\u2014and grease.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve cannon,\u201d he said quietly, seeing me eye the smudges on his hands. He wiped them absently on his breeks, much the worse for wear. \u201cTwo small guns from the town\u2014but cannon, nonetheless.\u201d He looked toward the bridge, and grimaced slightly.</p><p>I knew what he was thinking\u2014and why.</p> <p>Ye were behind the cannon at Culloden, Donald, he had said to the Major. I was in front of them. With a sword in my hand. Swords were the Highlanders\u2019 natural weapons\u2014and for most, likely their only weapons. From all we had heard, General MacDonald had managed to assemble only a small quantity of muskets and powder; most of his troops were armed with broadswords and targes. And they were marching straight into ambush.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d Jamie said, so softly I could barely hear him. \u201cThe poor wee fools. The poor gallant wee fools.\u201d</p><p>MATTERS BECAME still worse\u2014or much better, depending on your viewpoint\u2014as dusk fell. The temperature had risen since the ice storm, but the ground was sodden; moisture rose from it during the day, but then as night came on, condensed into a fog so thick that even the campfires were barely visible, each one glowing like a sullen coal in the mist.</p><p>Excitement was passing through the militia like a mosquito-borne fever, as the new conditions gave rise to new plans.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Ian said softly, appearing like a ghost out of the fog beside Jamie. \u201cCaswell\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Such supplies as we had were already packed; carrying guns, powder, and food, eight hundred men, together with an uncounted quantity of camp-followers like myself, stole quietly through the mist toward the bridge, leaving the campfires burning behind us.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure exactly where MacDonald\u2019s troops were just now\u2014they might be still on the wagon road, or might have cautiously detoured, coming down to the edge of the swamp to reconnoiter. Good luck to them in that case, I thought. My own insides were tight with tension as I stepped carefully across the bridge; it was silly to tiptoe, but I felt a reluctance to put my feet down firmly\u2014the fog and silence compelled a sense of secrecy and furtiveness.</p><p>I stubbed a toe against an uneven plank and lurched forward, but Roger, walking beside me, caught me by the arm and set me upright. I squeezed his arm, and he smiled a little, his face barely visible through the mist, though he was no more than a foot away.</p><p>He knew quite as well as Jamie and the rest did what was coming. Nonetheless, I sensed a strong excitement in him, mingled with dread. It was, after all, to be his first battle.</p><p>On the other side, we dispersed to make fresh camps on the hill above the circular earthwork the men had thrown up a hundred yards from the creek. I passed close enough to the guns to see their elongated snouts, poking inquisitively through the mist: Mother Covington and her daughter, the men called the two cannon\u2014I wondered idly which was which, and who the original Mother Covington might have been. A redoubtable lady, I assumed\u2014or possibly the proprietor of the local brothel.</p><p>Firewood was easy to find; the ice storm had extended to the pines near the creek, too. It was, however, bloody damp, and damned if I was going to spend an hour on my knees with a tinderbox. Luckily, no one could see what I was doing in this pea-soup fog, and I stealthily removed a small tin of Brianna\u2019s matches from my pocket.</p><p>As I was blowing on the kindling, I heard a series of odd, rending screeches from the direction of the bridge, and knelt upright, staring down the hill. I couldn\u2019t see anything, of course, but realized almost at once that it was the sound of nails giving way as planks were pried up\u2014they were dismantling the bridge.</p><p>It seemed a long time before Jamie came to find me. He refused food, but sat against a tree and beckoned to me. I sat down between his knees and leaned back against him, grateful for his warmth; the night was cold, with a damp that crept into every crevice and chilled the marrow.</p><p>\u201cSurely they\u2019ll see that the bridge is out?\u201d I said, after a long silence filled with the myriad noises of the men working below.</p> <p>\u201cNot if the fog lasts \u2019til morning\u2014and it will.\u201d Jamie sounded resigned, but he seemed more peaceful than he had earlier. We sat quietly together for some time, watching the play of flames on the fog\u2014an eerie sight, as the fire seemed to shimmer and merge with the mist, the flames stretching strangely up and up, disappearing into the swirl of white.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye believe in ghosts, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . well, not to put too fine a point on it, yes,\u201d I said. He knew I did, because I\u2019d told him about my meeting with the Indian whose face was painted black. I knew he did, too\u2014he was a Highlander. \u201cWhy, have you seen one?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, wrapping his arms more securely around me.</p><p>\u201cNot to say \u2018seen,\u2019\u201d he said, sounding thoughtful. \u201cBut I will be damned if he\u2019s no there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said, rather startled at this.</p><p>\u201cMurtagh,\u201d he said, surprising me further. He shifted more comfortably, resettling me against him. \u201cEver since the fog came in, I\u2019ve had the most peculiar sense of him, just by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d This was fascinating, but made me thoroughly uneasy. Murtagh, Jamie\u2019s godfather, had died at Culloden, and\u2014so far as I knew\u2014hadn\u2019t been going about manifesting himself since. I didn\u2019t doubt his presence; Murtagh\u2019s had been an extremely strong\u2014if dour\u2014personality, and if Jamie said he was there, he very likely was. What made me uneasy was the contemplation of just why he might be there.</p><p>I concentrated for a time, but got no sense of the tough little Scotsman myself. Evidently, he was only interested in Jamie. That frightened me.</p><p>While the conclusion of the morrow\u2019s battle was a foregone one, a battle was a battle, and men might be killed on the winning side, as well. Murtagh had been Jamie\u2019s godfather, and took his duty to Jamie seriously. I sincerely hoped he hadn\u2019t had word that Jamie was about to be killed, and shown up to conduct him to heaven\u2014visions on the eve of battle were a fairly common occurrence in Highland lore, but Jamie did say he hadn\u2019t seen Murtagh. That was something, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cHe, um, hasn\u2019t said anything to you, has he?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head, seeming unfazed by this ghostly visitation.</p><p>\u201cNay, he\u2019s just . . . there.\u201d He seemed, in fact, to find this \u201cthereness\u201d a comfort, and so I didn\u2019t voice my own doubts and fears. I had them, nonetheless, and spent the rest of the short night pressed close against my husband, as though daring Murtagh or anyone else to take him from me.</p><p>113</p><p>THE GHOSTS OF CULLODEN</p><p>COME DAWN, ROGER STOOD BEHIND the low earthwork by his father-in-law, musket in hand, straining his eyes to peer into the mist. The sounds of an army came to him clearly; sound carried through fog. The measured tramp of feet, though they were not marching in any sort of unison. The clank of metal and rustle of cloth. Voices\u2014the shouts of officers, he thought, beginning to rally their troops.</p><p>They would by now have found the deserted campfires; they\u2019d know that the enemy now lay across the creek.</p><p>The smell of tallow was strong in the air; Alexander Lillington\u2019s men had greased the support timbers, after the planks had been removed. He\u2019d been grasping his gun for hours, it seemed, and yet the metal was still cold in his hand\u2014his fingers were stiff.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye hear the shouting?\u201d Jamie nodded toward the mist that hid the far bank. The wind had changed; no more than disconnected Gaelic phrases came from beyond the ghostly cypress trunks, and I made no sense of them. Jamie did.</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s leading them\u2014I think it\u2019s McLeod, by the voice\u2014he means to charge the creek,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s suicide!\u201d Roger blurted. \u201cSurely they know\u2014surely someone\u2019s seen the bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are Highlanders,\u201d Jamie said, still softly, eyes on the ramrod he pulled from its rest. \u201cThey will follow the man to whom they vow loyalty, even though he leads them to their death.\u201d</p><p>Ian was nearby; he glanced quickly toward Roger, then over his shoulder, where Kenny and Murdo Lindsay stood with Ronnie Sinclair and the McGillivrays. They stood in a casual knot, but every hand touched a musket or rifle, and their eyes darted toward Jamie every few seconds.</p><p>They had joined Colonel Lillington\u2019s men on this side of the creek; Lillington was passing to and fro through the men, eyes darting back and forth, assessing readiness.</p><p>Lillington stopped abruptly at sight of Jamie, and Roger felt a nervous qualm in the pit of his stomach. Randall Lillington had been a second cousin of the Colonel\u2019s.</p><p>Alexander Lillington wasn\u2019t a man to hide his thoughts; it had quite evidently dawned on him that his own men were forty feet away and that Jamie\u2019s men stood between him and them. His eyes darted toward the mist, where Donald McLeod\u2019s bellowing was being answered by increasing roars from the Highlanders with him, then back at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d Lillington demanded, rising on his toes and frowning toward the far bank, as though concentration might yield him meaning.</p><p>\u201cHe says to them that courage will carry the day.\u201d Jamie glanced toward the crest of the rise behind them. Mother Covington\u2019s long black snout was just visible through the mist. \u201cWould that it could,\u201d he added quietly in Gaelic.</p><p>Alexander Lillington reached out suddenly and grabbed Jamie\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, sir?\u201d he said, suspicion open in eyes and voice. \u201cAre you not a Highlander, as well?\u201d</p><p>Lillington\u2019s other hand was on the pistol in his belt. Roger felt the casual talk among the men behind him stop, and glanced back. All Jamie\u2019s men were watching, with expressions of great interest but no particular alarm. Evidently, they felt Jamie could deal with Lillington by himself.</p><p>\u201cI ask you, sir\u2014to whom is your loyalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do I stand, sir?\u201d Jamie said with elaborate politeness. \u201cOn this side of the creek, or on that?\u201d</p><p>A few men grinned at that, but forbore to laugh; the question of loyalty was a raw one still, and no man would risk it unnecessarily.</p><p>Lillington\u2019s grip on his wrist relaxed, but did not yet let go, though he acknowledged Jamie\u2019s statement with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWell enough. But how are we to know that you do not mean to turn and fall upon us in battle? For you are a Highlander, are you not? And your men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Highlander,\u201d Jamie said bleakly. He glanced once more at the far bank, where occasional glimpses of tartan showed through the mist, and then back. The shouting echoed from the fog. \u201cAnd I am the sire of Americans.\u201d He pulled his wrist from Lillington\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cAnd I give ye leave, sir,\u201d he continued evenly, lifting his rifle and standing it on its butt, \u201cto stand behind me and thrust your sword through my heart if I fire amiss.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned his back on Lillington and loaded his gun, ramming ball, powder, and patch with great precision.</p><p>A voice bellowed from the fog, and a hundred other throats took up the cry in Gaelic. \u201cKING GEORGE AND BROADSWORDS!\u201d</p><p>The last Highland charge had begun.</p><p>THEY BURST OUT OF the mist a hundred feet from the bridge, howling, and his heart jumped in his chest. For an instant\u2014an instant only\u2014he felt he ran with them, and the wind of it snapped in his shirt, cold on his body.</p><p>But he stood stock-still, Murtagh beside him, looking cynically on. Roger Mac coughed, and Jamie raised the rifle to his shoulder, waiting.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d The volley struck them just before they reached the gutted bridge; half a dozen fell in the road, but the others came on. Then the cannon fired from the hill above, one and then the other, and the concussion of their discharge was like a shove against his back.</p><p>He had fired with the volley, aiming above their heads. Now swung the rifle down and pulled the ramrod. There was screaming on both sides, the shriek of wounded and the stronger bellowing of battle.</p><p>\u201cA righ! A righ!\u201d The King! The King!</p><p>McLeod was at the bridge; he\u2019d been hit, there was blood on his coat, but he brandished sword and targe, and ran onto the bridge, stabbing his sword into the wood to anchor himself.</p><p>The cannon spoke again, but were aimed too high; most of the Highlanders had crowded down to the banks of the creek\u2014some were in the water, clinging to the bridge supports, inching across. More were on the timbers, slipping, using their swords like McLeod to keep their balance.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d and he fired, powder smoke blending with the fog. The cannon had the range, they spoke one-two, and he felt the blast push against him, felt as though the shot had torn through him. Most of those on the bridge were in the water now, more threw themselves flat upon the timbers, trying to wriggle their way across, only to be picked off by the muskets, every man firing at will from the redoubt.</p><p>He loaded, and fired.</p><p>There he is, said a voice, dispassionate; he had no notion was it his, or Murtagh\u2019s.</p><p>McLeod was dead, his body floating in the creek for an instant before the weight of the black water pulled him down. Many men were struggling in that water\u2014the creek was deep here, and mortal cold. Few Highlanders could swim.</p><p>He glimpsed Allan MacDonald, Flora\u2019s husband, pale and staring in the crowd on the shore.</p><p>Major Donald MacDonald floundered, rising halfway in the water. His wig was gone and his head showed bare and wounded, blood running from his scalp down over his face. His teeth were bared, clenched in agony or ferocity, there was no telling which. Another shot struck him and he fell with a splash\u2014but rose again, slow, slow, and then pitched forward into water too deep to stand, but rose yet again, splashing frantically, spraying blood from his shattered mouth in the effort to breathe.</p><p>Let it be you, then, lad, said the dispassionate voice. He raised his rifle and shot MacDonald cleanly through the throat. He fell backward and sank at once.</p><p>IT WAS OVER in minutes, the fog thick with powder smoke, the black creek choked with the dying and dead.</p><p>\u201cKing George and broadswords, eh?\u201d said Caswell, bleakly surveying the damage. \u201cBroadswords against cannon. Poor buggers.\u201d</p><p>On the other side, all was confusion. Those who had not fallen at the bridge were in flight. Already, men on this side of the creek were carrying the timbers down to repair the bridge. Those who were running wouldn\u2019t get far.</p><p>He should go, too, summon his men to help in pursuit. But he stood as though turned to stone, the cold wind singing in his ears.</p><p>JACK RANDALL stood still. His sword was in his hand, but he made no effort to raise it. Only stood there, that odd smile on his lips, dark eyes burning in Jamie\u2019s own.</p><p>If he had been able to break that gaze . . . but he couldn\u2019t, and so caught the blur of movement behind Randall. Murtagh, running, bounding tussocks like a sheep. And the glint of his godfather\u2019s blade\u2014had he seen that, or only imagined it? No matter; he\u2019d known without doubt from the c*ck of Murtagh\u2019s arm, and seen before it happened the murderous strike come upward toward the Captain\u2019s red-clad back.</p><p>But Randall spun, warned maybe by some change in his eyes, the sob of Murtagh\u2019s breath\u2014or only by a soldier\u2019s instinct. Too late to avoid the thrust, but soon enough that the dirk missed its fatal aim into the kidney. Randall had grunted with the blow\u2014Christ, he could hear it\u2014and jerked aside staggering, but turning as he fell, grasping Murtagh\u2019s wrist, dragging him down in a shower of spray from the wet gorse they fell through.</p><p>They had rolled away into a hollow, locked together, struggling, and he had flung himself through the clinging plants in pursuit, some weapon\u2014what, what had he held?\u2014in his fist.</p><p>But the feel of it faded against his skin; he felt the weight of the thing in his hand, but there was no shape of hilt or trigger to remind him, and it was gone again.</p><p>Leaving him with that one image: Murtagh. Murtagh, teeth clenched and bared as he struck. Murtagh, running, coming to save him.</p><p>HE BECAME SLOWLY aware again of where he was. There was a hand on his arm\u2014Roger Mac, white-faced, but steady.</p><p>\u201cI am going to see to them,\u201d Roger Mac said, with a brief nod toward the creek. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course,\u201d he said, though with the feeling he so often had in waking from a dream\u2014as though he were not in fact quite real.</p><p>Roger Mac nodded and turned to walk away. Then suddenly turned back, and laying his hand once more on Jamie\u2019s arm, said very quietly, \u201cEgo te absolvo.\u201d Then turned again and went resolutely to tend the dying and bless the dead.</p><p>114</p><p>AMANDA</p><p>FROM L\u2019Oignon\u2013Intelligencer, May 15, 1776</p><p>INDEPENDENCE!!</p><p>In the Wake of the famous Victory at Moore\u2019s Creek Bridge, the Fourth Provincial Congress of North Carolina has voted to adopt the Halifax Resolves. These Resolutions authorize Delegates to the Continental Congress to concur with the other Delegates of the other Colonies in declaring Independency and forming foreign Alliances, reserving to this Colony the sole and exclusive Right of forming a Constitution and Laws for this Colony, and by Passage of the Halifax Resolves, North Carolina thus becomes the first Colony officially to indorse Independency.</p><p>THE FIRST SHIP of a Fleet commanded by Sir Peter Parker has arrived at the Mouth of the Cape Fear River, upon the eighteenth of April. The Fleet consists of nine Ships in total, and is bringing British Troops to pacify and unite the Colony, by the Word of Governor Josiah Martin.</p><p>STOLEN: Goods amounting to twenty-six Pounds, ten Shillings and Fourpence in Total, abstracted from the Warehouse of Mr. Neil Forbes on Water Street. Thieves broke a Hole in the Back of the Warehouse during the Night of May twelfth, and carried the Goods away by means of a Wagon. Two Men, one White, one Black, were seen driving a Wagon away with a Team of bay Mules. Any Word pertaining to this atrocious Crime will be generously Rewarded. Apply to W. Jones, in care of the Gull and Oyster on the Market Square.</p><p>BORN, to Captain Roger MacKenzie of Fraser\u2019s Ridge and his lady, a girl, on the twenty-first of April. Child and Mother are reported in good Health, the Child\u2019s name given as Amanda Claire Hope MacKenzie.</p><p>Roger had never felt so terrified as he did when his newborn daughter was placed in his arms for the first time. Minutes old, skin tender and perfect as an orchid\u2019s, she was so delicate he feared he would leave fingerprints on her\u2014but so alluring that he had to touch her, drawing the back of his knuckle gently, so gently, down the perfect curve of her fat little cheek, stroking the black cobweb silk of her hair with an unbelieving forefinger.</p><p>\u201cShe looks like you.\u201d Brianna, sweaty, disheveled, deflated\u2014and so beautiful he could scarcely bear to look at her\u2014lay back against the pillows with a grin that came and went like the Cheshire Cat\u2019s\u2014never entirely absent, even though it faded now and then from tiredness.</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d He studied the tiny face with complete absorption. Not for any sign of himself\u2014only because he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>He had come to know her intimately, through the months of being roused suddenly by pokes and kicks, of watching the liquid heave of Brianna\u2019s belly, of feeling the little one swell and retreat under his hands as he lay behind his wife, cupping her stomach and making jokes.</p><p>But he\u2019d known her as Little Otto, the private name they\u2019d used for the unborn child. Otto had had a distinct personality\u2014and for a moment, he felt a ridiculous pang of loss, realizing that Otto was gone. This tiny, exquisite being was someone entirely new.</p><p>\u201cIs she Marjorie, do you think?\u201d Bree was lifting her head, peering at the blanket-wrapped bundle. They\u2019d discussed names for months, making lists, arguing, making fun of each other\u2019s choices, choosing ridiculous things like Montgomery or Agatha. At last, tentatively, they\u2019d decided that if it was a boy, the name might be Michael; if a girl, Marjorie, after Roger\u2019s mother.</p><p>His daughter opened her eyes quite suddenly and looked at him. Her eyes were slanted; he wondered if they would stay that way, like her mother\u2019s. A sort of soft, middle blue, like the sky in mid-morning\u2014nothing remarkable, at a glance, but when you looked straight into it . . . vast, illimitable.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, staring into those eyes. Could she see him yet? he wondered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said again. \u201cHer name\u2019s Amanda.\u201d</p><p>I HADN\u2019T SAID anything to begin with. It was a common thing in newborns\u2014especially babies born a bit early, as Amanda had been\u2014nothing to worry about.</p><p>The ductus arteriosus is a small blood vessel that in the fetus joins the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Babies have lungs, of course, but prior to birth don\u2019t use them; all their oxygen comes from the placenta, via the umbilical cord. Ergo, no need for blood to be circulated to the lungs, save to nourish the developing tissue\u2014and so the ductus arteriosus bypasses the pulmonary circulation.</p><p>At birth, though, the baby takes its first breath, and oxygen sensors in this small vessel cause it to contract\u2014and close permanently. With the ductus arteriosus closed, blood heads out from the heart to the lungs, picks up oxygen, and comes back to be pumped out to the rest of the body. A neat and elegant system\u2014save that it doesn\u2019t always work properly.</p><p>The ductus arteriosus doesn\u2019t always close. If it doesn\u2019t, blood still does go to the lungs, of course\u2014but the bypass is still there. Too much blood goes to the lungs, in some cases, and floods them. The lungs swell, become congested, and with diverted blood flow to the body, there are problems with oxygenation\u2014which can become acute.</p><p>I moved my stethoscope over the tiny chest, ear pressed to it, listening intently. It was my best stethoscope, a model from the nineteenth century called a Pinard\u2014a bell with a flattened disc at one end, to which I pressed my ear. I had one carved of wood; this one was made of pewter; Brianna had sand-cast it for me.</p><p>In fact, though, the murmur was so distinct that I felt as though I barely needed a stethoscope. Not a click or a misplaced beat, not a too-long pause or a leaky swish\u2014there were any number of unusual sounds a heart could make, and auscultation was the first step of diagnosis. Atrial defects, ventral defects, malformed valves\u2014all have specific murmurs, some occurring between beats, some blending with the heart sounds.</p><p>When the ductus arteriosus fails to close, it\u2019s said to be \u201cpatent\u201d\u2014open. A patent ductus arteriosus makes a continuous shushing murmur, soft, but audible with a little concentration, particularly in the supraclavicular and cervical regions.</p><p>For the hundredth time in two days, I bent close, ear pressed to the Pinard as I moved it over Amanda\u2019s neck and chest, hoping against hope that the sound would have disappeared.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTurn your head, lovey, yes, that\u2019s right. . . .\u201d I breathed, delicately turning her head away from me, Pinard pressed to the side of her neck. It was hard to get the stethoscope close to her fat little neck . . . there. The murmur increased. Amanda made a little breathy noise that sounded like a giggle. I brought her head back the other way\u2014the sound decreased.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell,\u201d I said softly, so as not to scare her. I put down the Pinard and picked her up, cradling her against my shoulder. We were alone; Brianna had gone up to my room for a nap, and everyone else was out.</p><p>I carried her to the surgery window and looked out; it was a beautiful day in the mountain spring. The wrens were nesting under the eaves again; I could hear them above me, rustling round with sticks, conversing in small, clear chirps.</p><p>\u201cBird,\u201d I said, my lips close to her tiny seashell of an ear. \u201cNoisy bird.\u201d She squirmed lazily, and farted in reply.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, smiling despite myself. I held her out a little, so I could look into her face\u2014lovely, perfect\u2014but not as fat as it had been when she was born a week before.</p><p>It was perfectly normal for babies to lose a little weight at first, I told myself. It was.</p><p>A patent ductus arteriosus may have no symptoms, beyond that odd, continuous murmur. But it may. A bad one deprives the child of needed oxygen; the main symptoms are pulmonary\u2014wheezing; rapid, shallow breathing; bad color\u2014and failure to thrive, because of the energy burned up in the effort to get enough oxygen.</p><p>\u201cJust let Grannie have a little listen again,\u201d I said, laying her down on the quilt I\u2019d spread over the surgery table. She gurgled and kicked as I picked up the Pinard and placed it on her chest again, moving it over neck, shoulder, arm . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t let it be bad.\u201d But the sound of the murmur seemed to grow louder, drowning my prayers.</p><p>I opened my eyes to see Brianna, standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI KNEW THERE was something wrong,\u201d she said steadily, wiping Mandy\u2019s bottom with a damp rag before rediapering her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t nurse like Jemmy did. She acts hungry, but she\u2019ll only nurse for a few minutes before she falls asleep. Then she wakes up and fusses again a few minutes later.\u201d</p><p>She sat down and offered Mandy a breast, as though in illustration of the difficulty. Sure enough, the baby latched on with every evidence of starvation. As she nursed, I picked up one of the tiny fists, unfolding her fingers. The minute nails were faintly tinged with blue.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Brianna said calmly, \u201cwhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d This was the usual answer in most cases, truth be told\u2014but it was always unsatisfactory, and clearly not less so now. \u201cSometimes there are no symptoms, or only very minor ones,\u201d I said, trying for amendment. \u201cIf the opening is very large, and you have pulmonary symptoms\u2014and we have\u2014then . . . she might be all right, only not thriving\u2014not growing properly, because of the feeding difficulties. Or\u201d\u2014I took a deep breath, steeling myself\u2014\u201cshe could develop heart failure. Or pulmonary hypertension\u2014that\u2019s a very high blood pressure in the lungs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d Bree said, her voice tight. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr infective endocarditis. Or\u2014not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she die?\u201d she asked bluntly, looking up at me. Her jaw was set, but I saw the way she held Amanda closer, waiting for an answer. I could give her nothing but the truth.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d The word hung in the air between us, hideous.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Brianna echoed, and I nodded, turning away, unable to look at her face. Without such modern assistances as an echocardiogram, I of course couldn\u2019t judge the extent of the problem. But I had not only the evidence of my eyes and ears, but what I had felt passing from her skin to mine\u2014that sense of not-rightness, that eerie conviction that comes now and then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you fix it?\u201d I heard the tremor in Brianna\u2019s voice, and went at once to put my arms around her. Her head was bent over Amanda, and I saw the tears fall, one, then another, darkening the wispy curls on top of the baby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, holding them both. Despair washed over me, but I tightened my hold, as though I could keep time and blood both at bay. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWELL, THERE\u2019S NO choice, is there?\u201d Roger felt preternaturally calm, recognizing it as the artificial calm produced by shock but wishing to cling to it as long as possible. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>Brianna leveled a look at him, but didn\u2019t reply. Her hand roamed over the baby, sleeping in her lap, smoothing the woolly blanket over and over again.</p> <p>Claire had explained it all to him, more than once, patiently, seeing that he could not take it in. He still did not believe it\u2014but the sight of those tiny fingernails, turning blue as Amanda strove to suck, had sunk into him like an owl\u2019s talons.</p><p>It was, she had said, a simple operation\u2014in a modern operating room.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t . . . ?\u201d he\u2019d asked, with a vague motion toward her surgery. \u201cWith the ether?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d closed her eyes and shaken her head, looking nearly as ill as he felt.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can do very simple things\u2014hernias, appendixes, tonsils\u2014and even those are a risk. But something so invasive, on such a tiny body . . . no,\u201d she repeated, and he saw resignation in her face when she met his eyes. \u201cNo. If she\u2019s to live\u2014you have to take her back.\u201d</p> <p>And so they had begun to discuss the unthinkable. Because there were choices\u2014and decisions to be made. But the unalterable basic fact was clear. Amanda must go through the stones\u2014if she could.</p><p>JAMIE FRASER took his father\u2019s ruby ring, and held it over the face of his granddaughter. Amanda\u2019s eyes fixed on it at once, and she stuck out her tongue with interest. He smiled, despite the heaviness of his heart, and lowered the ring for her to grab at.</p><p>\u201cShe likes that well enough,\u201d he said, skillfully removing it from her grip before she could get it into her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s try the other.\u201d</p><p>The other was Claire\u2019s amulet\u2014the tiny, battered leather pouch given to her by an Indian wisewoman years before. It contained assorted bits and bobs, herbs, he thought, and feathers, perhaps the tiny bones of a bat. But in among them was a lump of stone\u2014nothing much to look at, but a true gemstone, a raw sapphire.</p><p>Amanda turned her head at once, more interested in the pouch than she had been in the shiny ring. She made cooing noises and batted wildly with both hands, trying to reach it.</p><p>Brianna took a deep, half-strangled breath.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, in the voice of one who fears as much as hopes. \u201cBut we can\u2019t tell for sure. What if I\u2014take her, and I go through, but she can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>They all looked at one another in silence, envisioning the possibility.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d come back,\u201d Roger said gruffly, and put a hand on Bree\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019d come right back.\u201d</p><p>The tension in her body eased a little at his touch. \u201cI\u2019d try,\u201d she said, and attempted a smile.</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cIs wee Jem about?\u201d</p><p>Of course he was; he never went far from home or Brianna these days, seeming to sense that something was wrong. He was retrieved from Jamie\u2019s study, where he had been spelling out words in\u2014</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ on a piece of toast!\u201d his grandmother blurted, snatching the book from him. \u201cJamie! How could you?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie felt a deep blush rise over him. How could he, indeed? He\u2019d taken the battered copy of Fanny Hill in trade, part of a parcel of used books bought from a tinker. He hadn\u2019t looked at the books before buying them, and when he did come to look them over . . . Well, it was quite against his instincts to throw away a book\u2014any book.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s P-H-A-L-L-U-S?\u201d Jemmy was asking his father.</p><p>\u201cAnother word for prick,\u201d Roger said briefly. \u201cDon\u2019t bloody use it. Listen\u2014can ye hear anything, when ye listen to that stone?\u201d He indicated Jamie\u2019s ring lying on the table. Jem\u2019s face lighted at sight of it.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, from there?\u201d Brianna said, incredulous. Jem looked around the circle of parents and grandparents, surprised at their interest. \u201cSure,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt sings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ye think wee Mandy can hear it sing, too?\u201d Jamie asked carefully. His heart was beating heavily, afraid to know, either way.</p><p>Jemmy picked up the ring and leaned over Mandy\u2019s basket, holding it directly over her face. She kicked energetically and made noises\u2014but whether because of the ring, or merely at the sight of her brother . . .</p><p>\u201cShe can hear it,\u201d Jem said, smiling into his sister\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Claire asked, curious. Jem looked up at her, surprised.</p><p>\u201cShe says so.\u201d</p><p>NOTHING WAS SETTLED. At the same time, everything was settled. I was in no doubt as to what my ears and my fingers told me\u2014Amanda\u2019s condition was slowly worsening. Very slowly\u2014it might take a year, two years, before serious damage began to show\u2014but it was coming.</p><p>Jem might be right; he might not be. But we had to proceed on the assumption that he was.</p><p>There were arguments, discussions\u2014tears. Not yet any decision as to who should attempt the journey through the stones. Brianna and Amanda must go; that was certain. But ought Roger to go with them? Or Jemmy?</p><p>\u201cI will not let you go without me,\u201d Roger said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go without you!\u201d Bree cried, looking exasperated. \u201cBut how can we leave Jemmy here, without us? And how can we make him go? A baby\u2014we think that can work, because of the legends, but Jem\u2014how will he make it? We can\u2019t let him risk being killed!\u201d</p><p>I looked at the stones on the table\u2014Jamie\u2019s ring, my pouch with the sapphire.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d I said carefully, \u201cthat we need to find two more stones. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>And so, in late June, we came down from the mountain, into turmoil.</p><p>PART TWELVE</p><p>Time Will Not Be</p><p>Ours Forever</p><p>115</p><p>NOSEPICKER</p><p>July 4, 1776</p><p>IT WAS CLOSE AND HOT IN THE INN ROOM, but I couldn\u2019t go out; little Amanda had finally fussed herself to sleep\u2014she had a rash on her bottom, poor thing\u2014and was curled in her basket, tiny thumb in her mouth and a frown on her face.</p><p>I unfolded the gauze mosquito netting and draped it carefully over the basket, then opened the window. The air outside was hot, too, but fresh, and moving. I pulled off my cap\u2014without it, Mandy was fond of clutching my hair in both her hands and yanking; she had an amazing amount of strength, for a child with a heart defect. For the millionth time, I wondered whether I could have been wrong.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. She was asleep now, with the delicate rose bloom of a healthy baby on her cheeks; awake and kicking, that soft flush faded, and an equally beautiful but unearthly blue tinge showed now and then in her lips, in the beds of her tiny nails. She was still lively\u2014but tiny. Bree and Roger were both large people; Jemmy had put on weight like a small hippopotamus through his first several years of life. Mandy weighed scarcely more than she had at birth.</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t wrong. I moved her basket to the table, where the warm breeze could play over her, and sat down beside it, laying my fingers gently on her chest.</p><p>I could feel it. Just as I had in the beginning, but stronger now that I knew what it was. If I had had a proper operating suite, the blood transfusions, the calibrated and carefully administered anesthesia, the oxygen mask, the swift, trained nurses . . . No surgery on the heart is a minor thing, and surgery on an infant is always a great risk\u2014but I could have done it. Could feel in the tips of my fingers exactly what needed to be done, could see in the back of my eyes the heart, smaller than my fist, the slippery, pumping, rubbery muscle and the blood washing through the ductus arteriosus, a small vessel, no bigger than an eighth of an inch in circumference. A small nick in the axillary vessel, a quick ligation of the ductus itself with a number-8 silk ligature. Done.</p><p>I knew. But knowledge is not, alas, always power. Nor is desire. It wouldn\u2019t be me who would save this precious granddaughter.</p><p>Would anyone? I wondered, giving way momentarily to the dark thoughts I fought to keep at bay when anyone else was near. Jemmy might not be right. Any baby might grab at a brightly colored shiny thing like a ruby ring\u2014but then I remembered her cooing, batting at my decrepit leather amulet pouch with the raw sapphire inside.</p><p>Perhaps. I didn\u2019t want to think about the dangers of the passage\u2014or the certainty of permanent separation, no matter whether the journey through the stones was successful or not.</p><p>There were noises outside; I looked toward the harbor, and saw the masts of a large ship, far out to sea. Another, still farther out. My heart skipped a beat.</p><p>They were oceangoing ships, not the little packet boats and fishing smacks that sailed up and down the coast. Could they be part of the fleet, sent in answer to Governor Martin\u2019s plea for help to suppress, subdue, and reclaim the colony? The first ship of that fleet had arrived at Cape Fear in late April\u2014but the troops it carried had been lying low, waiting for the rest.</p><p>I watched for some time, but the ships didn\u2019t come in closer. Perhaps they were hanging off, waiting for the rest of the fleet? Perhaps they weren\u2019t British ships at all, but Americans, escaping the British blockade of New England by sailing south.</p><p>I was distracted from my thoughts by the clumping of male feet on the stairs, accompanied by snorts and that peculiarly Scottish sort of giggling usually depicted in print\u2014but by no means adequately\u2014as \u201cHeuch, heuch, heuch!\u201d</p><p>It was clearly Jamie and Ian, though I couldn\u2019t understand what was giving rise to so much hilarity, since when last seen they had been bound for the docks, charged with dispatching a shipment of tobacco leaves, obtaining pepper, salt, sugar, cinnamon\u2014if findable\u2014and pins\u2014somewhat rarer than cinnamon\u2014for Mrs. Bug, and procuring a large fish of some edible sort for our supper.</p><p>They\u2019d got the fish, at least: a large king mackerel. Jamie was carrying it by the tail, whatever it had been wrapped in having evidently been lost in some accident. His queue had come undone, so that long red strands frayed out over the shoulder of his coat, which in turn had a sleeve half wrenched off, a fold of white shirt protruding through the torn seam. He was covered with dust, as was the fish, and while the latter\u2019s eyes both bulged accusingly, one of his own was swollen nearly shut.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I said, burying my face in one hand. I looked up at him through splayed fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Neil Forbes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, no,\u201d he said, dropping the fish with a splat on the table in front of me. \u201cA wee difference of opinion wi\u2019 the Wilmington Chowder and Marching Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA difference of opinion,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cAye, they thought they\u2019d throw us in the harbor, and we thought they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He slung a chair round with his boot and sat down on it backward, arms crossed on its back. He looked indecently cheerful, face flushed with sun and laughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I said, though of course I did. I glanced at Ian, who was still sniggering quietly to himself, and observed that while he was slightly less battered than Jamie, he had one forefinger lodged in his nose up to the knuckle.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a bloody nose, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still giggling. \u201cNo, Auntie. Some o\u2019 the Society do, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why have you got your finger up your nose, then? Have you picked up a tick or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s keepin\u2019 his brains from falling out,\u201d Jamie said, and went off into another fit. I glanced at the basket, but Mandy slept peacefully on, quite used to racket.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019d best stick both your own fingers up your nose, then,\u201d I suggested. \u201cKeep you out of trouble for a moment or two, at least.\u201d I tilted up Jamie\u2019s chin to get a better look at the eye. \u201cYou hit someone with that fish, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The giggling had died down to a subterranean vibration between them, but threatened at this to break out anew.</p><p>\u201cGilbert Butler,\u201d Jamie said with a masterful effort at self-control. \u201cSmack across the face. Sent him straight across the quay and into the water.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s shoulders shook with remembered ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cBride, what a splash! Oh, it was a braw fight, Auntie! I thought I\u2019d broke my hand on a fellow\u2019s jaw, but it\u2019s all right now the deadness has worn off. Just a bit numb and tingly.\u201d He wiggled the free fingers of his hand at me in illustration, wincing only slightly as he did so.</p><p>\u201cDo take your finger out of your nose, Ian,\u201d I said, anxiety over their condition fading into annoyance at how they\u2019d got that way. \u201cYou look like a half-wit.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, they both found that hysterically funny and laughed like loons. Ian did, however, eventually withdraw the finger, with an expression of wary cautiousness, as though he truly expected his brains to follow in its wake. Nothing did emerge, though, not even the ordinary bits of unsavory excreta one might expect from such a maneuver.</p><p>Ian looked puzzled, then mildly alarmed. He sniffed, prodding experimentally at his nose, then stuck the finger back into his nostril, rooting vigorously.</p><p>Jamie went on grinning, but his amusement began to fade as Ian\u2019s explorations became more frantic.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Ye\u2019ve not lost it, have ye, lad?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNay, I feel it. It\u2019s . . .\u201d He stopped, giving Jamie a panic-stricken look over the embedded finger. \u201cIt\u2019s stuck, Uncle Jamie! I canna get it out!\u201d</p><p>Jamie was on his feet at once. He pulled the finger from its resting-place with a moist, sucking noise, then tilted back Ian\u2019s head, peering urgently up his nose with his one good eye.</p><p>\u201cBring a light, Sassenach, will ye?\u201d</p><p>There was a candlestick on the table, but I knew from experience that the only likely effect of using a candle to look up someone\u2019s nose was to set their nose hairs on fire. Instead, I bent and pulled my medical kit out from under the settle where I had stowed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d I said, with the confidence of one who has removed everything from cherry pits to live insects from the nasal cavities of small children. I drew out my longest pair of thin forceps, and clicked the slender blades together in token of assurance. \u201cWhatever it is. Just keep quite still, Ian.\u201d</p><p>The whites of Ian\u2019s eyes showed briefly in alarm as he looked at the shining metal of the forceps, and he looked pleadingly at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019ve a better idea.\u201d Jamie laid a quelling hand on my arm for an instant, then disappeared out the door. He thundered downstairs, and I heard a sudden burst of laughter from below, as the door to the taproom opened. The sound was as suddenly cut off as the door closed, like the valve on a faucet.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Ian?\u201d There was a smear of red on his upper lip; his nose was beginning to bleed, aggravated by his jabbings and pokings.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do hope so, Auntie.\u201d His original jubilation was beginning to be replaced by a certain expression of worry. \u201cYe dinna think I can have pushed it into my brain, do ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it very unlikely. What on earth\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the door below had opened and closed again, spilling another brief spurt of talk and laughter into the stairwell. Jamie took the stairs two at a time and popped back into the room, smelling of hot bread and ale, and holding a small, battered snuffbox in his hand.</p><p>Ian seized on this with gratitude and, sprinkling a quick pinch of black, dusty grains on the back of his hand, hastily inhaled it.</p><p>For an instant, all three of us held breathless\u2014and then it came, a sneeze of gargantuan proportions that rocked Ian\u2019s body back on its stool, even as his head flew forward\u2014and a small, hard object struck the table with a ping! and bounced off into the hearth.</p><p>Ian went on sneezing, in a fusillade of hapless snorts and explosions, but Jamie and I were both on our knees, scrabbling in the ashes, heedless of filth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it! I think,\u201d I added, sitting back on my heels and peering at the handful of ashes I held, in the midst of which was a small, round, dust-covered object.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it.\u201d Jamie seized my neglected forceps from the table, plucked the object delicately from my hand, and dropped it into my glass of water. A delicate plume of ash and soot floated up through the water to form a dusty gray film on the surface. Below, the object glittered up at us, serene and glowing, its beauty at last revealed. A faceted clear stone, the color of golden sherry, half the size of my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cChrysoberyl,\u201d Jamie said softly, a hand on my back. He looked at Mandy\u2019s basket, the silky black curls lifting gently in the breeze. \u201cD\u2019ye think it will serve?\u201d</p><p>Ian, still wheezing and watery-eyed, and with a red-stained handkerchief pressed to his much-abused proboscis, came to look over my other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHalf-wit, is it?\u201d he said in tones of deep satisfaction. \u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever did you get that? Or rather,\u201d I corrected myself, \u201cwho did you steal it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeil Forbes.\u201d Jamie picked the gem up, turning it gently over in his fingers. \u201cThere were a good deal more o\u2019 the Chowder Society than there were of us, so we ran down the street and round the corner, down between the warehouses there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kent Forbes\u2019s place, aye, because I\u2019d been there before,\u201d Ian put in. One of Mandy\u2019s feet was sticking up out of the basket; he touched the sole of it with a fingertip, and smiled to see her toes extend in reflex. \u201cThere was a great hole in the back where someone had broken down the wall, just covered over with a sheet of canvas, nailed over it, like. So we pulled it loose and ducked inside.\u201d</p><p>Where they had found themselves standing next to the small enclosed space Forbes used for an office\u2014and for the moment, deserted.</p><p>\u201cIt was sitting in a bittie wee box on the desk,\u201d Ian said, coming to look proprietorially at the chrysoberyl. \u201cJust sitting there! I\u2019d just picked it up to look at, when we hear the watchman coming. So\u2014\u201d He shrugged and smiled at me, happiness momentarily transforming his homely features.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the watchman won\u2019t tell him you were there?\u201d I asked skeptically. The two of them could scarcely be more conspicuous.</p><p>\u201cOh, I imagine he will.\u201d Jamie bent over Mandy\u2019s basket, holding the chrysoberyl between thumb and forefinger. \u201cLook what Grandda and Uncle Ian have brought ye, a muirninn,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWe decided that it was a small enough ransom to pay for what he did to Brianna,\u201d Ian said, sobering somewhat. \u201cI expect Mr. Forbes may feel it reasonable, too. And if not\u2014\u201d He smiled again, though not with happiness, and put his hand to his knife. \u201cHe\u2019s got another ear, after all.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, a tiny fist rose through the netting, fingers flexing as they grasped at the stone.</p><p>\u201cIs she still asleep?\u201d I whispered. Jamie nodded, and gently withdrew the stone.</p><p>On the far side of the table, the fish stared austerely at the ceiling, ignoring everything.</p><p>116</p><p>THE NINTH EARL</p><p>OF ELLESMERE</p><p>July 9, 1776</p><p>THE WATER WON\u2019T BE COLD.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d spoken automatically, without thinking.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think that will matter much.\u201d A nerve jumped in Roger\u2019s cheek, and he turned away abruptly. She reached out, touching him delicately, as though he were a bomb that might explode if jarred. He glanced at her, hesitated, then took the hand she offered him, with a small, crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she said softly. They stood close together, fingers knotted, watching the tide recede across the narrow beach, a fraction of an inch uncovered with each lap of the tiny waves.</p><p>The flats were gray and bleak in the evening light, pebble-strewn and rust-stained from the peaty waters of the river. With the tide going out, the harbor water was brown and feculent, the stain reaching past the ships at anchor, nearly to the open sea. When it turned, the clear gray water of the ocean would flow in, sweeping up the Cape Fear, obliterating the mudflats and everything on them.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d she said, still softly, though there was no one near enough to hear them. She tilted her head, indicating a group of weathered mooring posts driven deep into the mud. A skiff was tied to one; two of the pirettas, the four-oared \u201cdragonflies\u201d that plied the harbor, to another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He shifted his weight, glancing up and down the shore.</p><p>The narrow beach fell away into cold pebbles, exposed and gleaming with the leaving of the tide. Small crabs skittered hastily among them, not to waste a moment\u2019s gleaning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. People in the Blue Boar were talking about it. A traveler asked where, and Mrs. Smoots said it was the old mooring posts, near the warehouses.\u201d A torn flounder lay dead among the rocks, white flesh washed clean and bloodless. The small busy claws picked and shredded, tiny maws gaped and gulped, pinching at morsels. She felt her gorge rise at the sight, and swallowed hard. It wouldn\u2019t matter what came after; she knew that. But still . . .</p><p>Roger nodded absently. His eyes narrowed against the harbor wind, calculating distances.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be quite a crowd, I expect.\u201d</p><p>There already was one; the turn of the tide wouldn\u2019t be for an hour or more, but people were drifting down to the harbor in twos and threes and fours, standing in the lee of the chandlery to smoke their pipes, sitting on the barrels of salt fish to talk and gesture. Mrs. Smoots had been right; several were pointing out the mooring posts to their less knowledgeable companions.</p><p>Roger shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be from that side; the best view is from there.\u201d He nodded across the inner arc of the harbor toward the three ships that rocked at the main quay. \u201cFrom one of the ships? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Brianna fumbled in the pocket tied at her waist, and pulled out her small brass telescope. She frowned in concentration, lips pursed as she surveyed the ships\u2014a fishing ketch, Mr. Chester\u2019s brig, and a larger ship, part of the British fleet, that had come in in the early afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Nellie,\u201d she murmured, arresting the sweep of her gaze as the pale blotch of a head filled the lens. \u201cIs that who I think . . . hot dog, it is!\u201d A tiny flame of delight flared in her bosom, warming her.</p><p>\u201cIs who?\u201d Roger squinted, straining to see unaided.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s John! Lord John!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord John Grey? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! On the brig\u2014he must have come down from Virginia. Woops, he\u2019s gone now\u2014but he\u2019s there, I saw him!\u201d She turned to Roger, excited, folding her telescope as she gripped him by the arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s go and find him. He\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Roger followed, though with considerably less enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell him? Do you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He knows me.\u201d</p><p>Roger looked sharply at her, but the dark look on his face thawed into a reluctant smile.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he knows better than to try stopping you doing whatever you\u2019ve made up your bloody-minded mind to do?\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him, thanking him with her eyes. He didn\u2019t like it\u2014in fact, he hated it, and she didn\u2019t blame him\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t try to stop her, either. He knew her, too.</p><p>\u201cYes. Come on, before he disappears!\u201d</p><p>It was a slow slog round the curve of the harbor, pushing through the knots of gathering sightseers. Outside The Breakers, the crowd grew abruptly thicker. A cluster of red-coated soldiers stood and sat in disarray on the pavement, seabags and chests scattered round them, their number too great to fit inside the tavern. Ale pots and pints of cider were being passed from hand to hand from the interior of the public house, slopping freely on the heads of those over whom they passed.</p><p>A sergeant, harrassed but competent, was leaning against the timbered wall of the inn, riffling through a sheaf of papers, issuing orders and eating a meat pie, simultaneously. Brianna wrinkled her nose as they stepped carefully through the obstacle course of scattered men and luggage; a reek of seasickness and unclean flesh rose from the serried ranks.</p><p>A few onlookers muttered under their breath at sight of the soldiers; several more cheered and waved as they passed, to receive genial shouts in return. Newly liberated from the bowels of the Scorpion, the soldiers were too thrilled with their freedom and the taste of fresh food and drink to care who did or said anything whatever.</p><p>Roger stepped in front of her, thrusting a way through the crowd with shoulders and elbows. Appreciative shouts and whistles rose from the soldiers as they saw her, but she kept her head down, eyes fixed on Roger\u2019s feet as he shoved ahead.</p><p>She heaved a sigh of relief as they emerged from the press at the head of the quay. The soldiers\u2019 equipment was being unloaded from the Scorpion at the far side of the dock, but there was little foot traffic near the brig. She paused, looking to and fro for a glimpse of Lord John\u2019s distinctive fair head.</p><p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d Roger tugged at her arm, and she swung in the direction he was pointing, only to collide heavily with him as he stepped abruptly back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d she began crossly, but then stopped, feeling as though she had been punched in the chest.</p><p>\u201cWho in God\u2019s holy name is that?\u201d Roger spoke softly, echoing her thoughts.</p><p>Lord John Grey stood near the far end of the quay, in animated conversation with one of the red-coated soldiers. An officer; gold braid gleamed on his shoulder and he carried a laced tricorne beneath one arm. It wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s uniform that caught her attention, though.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d she whispered, feeling numb around the lips.</p><p>He was tall\u2014very tall\u2014with a breadth of shoulder and a stretch of white-stockinged calf that were attracting admiring glances from a cluster of oyster girls. It was something more than height or build that made gooseflesh ripple down the length of her spine, though; it was the fact of his carriage, his outline, a c*ck of the head and an air of physical self-confidence that drew eyes like a magnet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Da,\u201d she said, knowing even as she spoke that this was ridiculous. Even had Jamie Fraser for some unimaginable reason chosen to disguise himself in a soldier\u2019s uniform and come down to the docks, this man was different. As he turned to look at something across the harbor, she saw that he was different\u2014lean, like her father, and muscular, but still with the slenderness of boyishness. Graceful\u2014like Jamie\u2014but with the slight hesitancy of teenaged awkwardness not long past.</p><p>He turned further, backlit by the glow of light off the water, and she felt her knees go weak. A long, straight nose, rising to a high forehead . . . the sudden curve of a broad Viking cheekbone . . . Roger gripped her tightly by the arm, but his attention was as riveted on the young man as hers was.</p><p>\u201cI . . . will . . . be . . . damned,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gulped air, trying to get enough breath.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. And him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, him, and him!\u201d Lord John, the mysterious young soldier\u2014and most of all, her father. \u201cCome on.\u201d She pulled free and strode down the quay, feeling oddly disembodied, as though she watched herself from a distance.</p><p>It was like watching herself come toward a fun-house mirror, seeing herself\u2014her face, her height, her gestures\u2014suddenly transposed inside a red coat and doeskin breeches. His hair was dark, chestnut-brown, not red, but it was thick like hers, with the same slight wave to it, the same cowlick that lifted it off his brow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord John turned his head slightly, and caught sight of her. His eyes bulged and a look of absolute horror blanched his features. He made a feeble flapping motion with one hand, trying to stop her coming nearer, but he might as well have tried to stop the Cornish Express.</p><p>\u201cHello there!\u201d she said brightly. \u201cFancy meeting you here, Lord John!\u201d</p><p>Lord John made a faint quacking noise, like a stepped-on duck, but she wasn\u2019t paying attention. The young man turned to face her, smiling cordially.</p><p>Holy God, he had her father\u2019s eyes, too. Dark-lashed, and so young the skin near them was fresh and clear, completely unlined\u2014but the same slanted blue Fraser cat eyes. Just like hers.</p> <p>Her heart was hammering so hard in her chest she was sure they could hear it. The young man seemed to find nothing amiss, though; he bowed to her, smiling, but very correct.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. He glanced at Lord John, plainly expecting an introduction.</p><p>Lord John pulled himself together with an obvious effort, and made her a leg.</p><p>\u201cMy dear. How . . . delightful to encounter you again. I had no idea. . . .\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I bet you didn\u2019t, she thought, but went on smiling pleasantly. She could feel Roger beside her, nodding and saying something in response to his Lordship\u2019s greeting, trying his best not to stare.</p> <p>\u201cMy son,\u201d Lord John was saying. \u201cWilliam, Lord Ellesmere.\u201d He eyed her narrowly, as though daring her to say anything. \u201cMight I present Mr. Roger MacKenzie, William? And his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. Mrs. MacKenzie.\u201d The young man took her hand before she realized what he meant to do, and bowed low over it, planting a small formal kiss upon her knuckles.</p><p>She nearly gasped at the unexpected touch of his breath on her skin, but instead gripped his hand, much harder than she\u2019d meant to. He looked momentarily disconcerted, but extricated himself with reasonable grace. He was much younger than she\u2019d thought at first glance; it was the uniform and the air of self-possession that made him seem older. He was looking at her with a slight frown on his clear-cut features, as though trying to place her.</p><p>\u201cI think . . .\u201d he began, hesitant. \u201cHave we met, Mrs. MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, astonished to hear her voice emerge sounding normal. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. I would have remembered.\u201d She darted a daggerlike glance at Lord John, who had gone slightly green around the gills.</p><p>Lord John had been a soldier, too, though. He pulled himself together with a visible effort, putting a hand on William\u2019s arm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go and see to your men, William,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we dine together later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am engaged to the Colonel for supper, Father,\u201d William said. \u201cBut I am sure he would not object, was you to join us. It may be quite late, though,\u201d he added. \u201cI understand there is to be an execution in the morning, and my troops are asked to be at the ready, in case of disturbance in the town. It will take some time to settle and organize everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisturbance.\u201d Lord John was eyeing her over William\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs a disturbance expected, then?\u201d</p><p>William shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI cannot say, Papa. Apparently it is not a political matter, though, but only a pirate. I shouldn\u2019t think there would be any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese days everything is a political matter, Willie,\u201d his father said, rather sharply. \u201cNever forget that. And it\u2019s always wiser to expect trouble than to meet it unprepared.\u201d</p><p>The young man flushed slightly, but kept his countenance.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d he said in clipped tones. \u201cI am sure you have a familiarity with the local conditions which I lack. I am obliged to you for your advice, Father.\u201d He relaxed slightly, and turned to bow to Brianna.</p> <p>\u201cPleased to have your acquaintance, Mrs. MacKenzie. Your servant, sir.\u201d He nodded to Roger, turned, and strode off down the quay, adjusting his tricorne to the proper angle of authority.</p><p>Brianna inhaled deeply, hoping that by the time she let her breath out, she would have words to go with it. Lord John beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. \u201cOf course he is.\u201d</p><p>Amid the logjam of thoughts, reactions, and emotions that clogged her brain, she seized on the one that seemed momentarily most important.</p><p>\u201cDoes my mother know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jamie know?\u201d Roger asked at the same instant. She looked at him in surprise, and he raised one eyebrow at her. Yes, a man could certainly father a child without realizing it. He had.</p><p>Lord John sighed. With William\u2019s departure, he had relaxed somewhat, and the natural color was coming back to his face. He had been a soldier long enough to recognize the inevitable when he saw it.</p><p>\u201cThey both know, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d Roger asked abruptly. Lord John shot him a sharp glance.</p><p>\u201cEighteen. And to save your counting backward, it was 1758. In a place called Helwater, in the Lake District.\u201d</p><p>Brianna took another breath, finding this one came a little easier.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So it\u2014he\u2014it was before my mother . . . came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. From France, supposedly. Where, I gather, you were born and raised.\u201d He gave her a gimlet look; he knew she spoke no more than bastard French.</p><p>She could feel the blood rushing to her face.</p><p>\u201cThis is no time for secrets,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to know about my mother and me, I\u2019ll tell you\u2014but you\u2019re going to tell me about him.\u201d She jerked her head angrily backward, toward the tavern. \u201cAbout my brother!\u201d</p><p>Lord John pursed his lips, regarding her through narrowed eyes as he thought. Finally he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI see no help for it. One thing, though\u2014are your parents here, in Wilmington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In fact . . .\u201d She looked upward, trying to make out the position of the sun through the thin coastal haze. It hung just above the horizon, a disc of burning gold. \u201cWe were going to meet them for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lord John swung round to Roger.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie. You will very much oblige me, sir, if you will go at once to find your father-in-law, and apprise him of the presence of the ninth Earl of Ellesmere. Tell him that I trust his good judgment will dictate an immediate removal from Wilmington upon receipt of this news.\u201d</p><p>Roger stared at him for a moment, brows quirked in interest.</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Ellesmere? How the hell did he manage that?\u201d</p><p>Lord John had recovered all his natural color, and a bit more. He was distinctly pink in the face.</p><p>\u201cNever mind! Will you go? Jamie must leave the town, at once, before they meet by inadvertence\u2014or before someone sees the two of them separately and begins to speculate aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Jamie will leave,\u201d Roger said, looking at Lord John with a certain degree of speculation himself. \u201cNot before tomorrow, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lord John demanded, looking from one to the other. \u201cWhy are you all here in the first place? It isn\u2019t the exe\u2014oh, good Lord, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d He clapped a hand to his face, and dragged it slowly down, glaring through his fingers with the expression of a man tried beyond bearing.</p><p>Brianna bit her lower lip. When she spotted Lord John, she had been not only pleased but relieved of a small bit of her burden of worry, counting on him to help in her plan. With this new complication, though, she felt torn in two, unable to cope with either situation, or even to think about them coherently. She looked over at Roger, seeking advice.</p><p>He met her eyes in one of those long, unspoken marital exchanges. Then he nodded, making the decision for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find Jamie. You have a bit of a chat with his Lordship, eh?\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her, hard, then turned and strode away down the dock, walking in a way that made people draw unconsciously aside, avoiding the touch of his garments.</p><p>Lord John had closed his eyes, and appeared to be praying\u2014presumably for strength. She gripped him by the arm and his eyes sprang open, startled as though he had been bitten by a horse.</p><p>\u201cIs it as striking as I think?\u201d she said. \u201cHim and me?\u201d The word felt funny on her tongue. Him.</p><p>Lord John looked at her, fair brow furrowed in troubled concentration as he searched her face, feature by feature.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cTo me, certainly. To a casual observer, perhaps much less so. There is the difference of coloring, to be sure, and of sex; his uniform . . . but, my dear, you know that your own appearance is so striking\u2014\u201d So freakish, he meant. She sighed, taking his meaning.</p><p>\u201cPeople stare at me anyway,\u201d she finished for him. She pulled down the brim of her hat, drawing it far enough forward to hide not only hair but face, as well, and glowered at him from its shadow. \u201cThen we\u2019d better go where no one who knows him will see me, hadn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>THE QUAY AND THE market streets were thronged. Every public house in town\u2014and not a few private ones\u2014would soon be full of quartered soldiers. Her father and Jem were with Alexander Lillington, her mother and Mandy at Dr. Fentiman\u2019s, both places centers of business and gossip, and she had declared that she possessed no intention of going near either parent in any case\u2014not until she knew all there was to know. Lord John thought that might be rather more than he was himself prepared to tell her, but this was not a time for quibbles.</p><p>Still, the exigencies of privacy left them a choice of graveyard or the deserted racetrack, and Brianna said\u2014a marked edge in her voice\u2014that under the circumstances, she wanted no heavy-handed reminders of mortality.</p><p>\u201cThese mortal circumstances,\u201d he said carefully, leading her around a large puddle. \u201cYou refer to tomorrow\u2019s execution? It is Stephen Bonnet, I collect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, distracted. \u201cThat can wait, though. You aren\u2019t engaged for supper, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d she said, eyes on her shoes as they paced slowly round the sandy oval. \u201cWilliam, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam Clarence Henry George,\u201d Lord John agreed. \u201cViscount Ashness, Master of Helwater, Baron Derwent, and, yes, ninth Earl of Ellesmere.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhich would sort of indicate that the world at large thinks his father is somebody else. Not Jamie Fraser, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas somebody else,\u201d he corrected. \u201cOne Ludovic, eighth Earl of Ellesmere, to be precise. I understand that the eighth earl unfortunately died on the day his . . . er . . . his heir was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied of what? Shock?\u201d She was clearly in a dangerous mood; he was interested to note both her father\u2019s manner of controlled ferocity and her mother\u2019s sharp tongue at work\u2014the combination was both fascinating and alarming. He hadn\u2019t any intention of allowing her to run this interview on her own terms, though.</p><p>\u201cGunshot,\u201d he said with affected cheerfulness. \u201cYour father shot him.\u201d</p><p>She made a small choking noise and stopped dead.</p><p>\u201cThat is not, by the way, common knowledge,\u201d he said, affecting not to notice her reaction. \u201cThe coroner\u2019s court returned a verdict of death by misadventure\u2014which was not incorrect, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot incorrect,\u201d she murmured, sounding a trifle dazed. \u201cI guess being shot is pretty misadventurous, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there was talk,\u201d he said, offhanded, taking her arm and urging her forward again. \u201cBut the only witness, aside from William\u2019s grandparents, was an Irish coachman, who was rather quickly pensioned off to County Sligo, following the incident. The child\u2019s mother having also died that day, gossip was inclined to consider his lordship\u2019s death as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother\u2019s dead, too?\u201d She didn\u2019t stop this time, but turned to give him a penetrating glance from those deep blue eyes. Lord John had had sufficient practice in withstanding Fraser cat looks, though, and was not discomposed.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Geneva Dunsany. She died shortly after William\u2019s birth\u2014of an entirely natural hemorrhage,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cEntirely natural,\u201d she muttered, half under her breath. She shot him another look. \u201cThis Geneva\u2014she was married to the earl? When she and Da . . .\u201d The words seemed to stick in her throat; he could see doubt and repugnance struggling with her memories of William\u2019s undeniable face\u2014and her knowledge of her father\u2019s character.</p><p>\u201cHe has not told me, and I would in no circumstance ask him,\u201d he said firmly. She gave him another of those looks, which he returned with interest. \u201cWhatever the nature of Jamie\u2019s relations with Geneva Dunsany, I cannot conceive of his committing an act of such dishonor as to deceive another man in his marriage.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed fractionally, though her grip on his arm remained.</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d she said, rather grudgingly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d Her lips compressed, relaxed. \u201cWas he in love with her, do you think?\u201d she blurted.</p><p>What startled him was not the question, but the realization that it had never once occurred to him to ask it\u2014certainly not of Jamie, but not even of himself. Why not? he wondered. He had no right to jealousy, and if he was fool enough to suffer it, it would have been considerably ex post facto in the case of Geneva Dunsany; he had had no inkling of William\u2019s origins until several years after the girl\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s fingers drummed restlessly on his arm; she would have pulled free, but he put a hand on hers to still her.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she muttered, but ceased fidgeting, and walked on, matching the length of his shorter stride. Weeds had sprung up in the oval, were sprouting through the sand of the track. She kicked at a clump of wild rye grass, sending a spray of dry seeds flying.</p><p>\u201cIf they were in love, why didn\u2019t he marry her?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>He laughed, in sheer incredulity at the notion.</p><p>\u201cMarry her! My dear girl, he was the family groom!\u201d</p><p>A look of puzzlement flashed in her eye\u2014he would have sworn that if she had spoken, the word would have been \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in the name of God were you raised?\u201d he demanded, stopping dead.</p><p>He could see things moving in her eyes; she had Jamie\u2019s trick of keeping her face a mask, but her mother\u2019s transparency still shone from within. He saw the decision in her eyes, a moment before the slow smile touched her lips.</p><p>\u201cBoston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m an American. But you knew I was a barbarian already, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grunted in response.</p><p>\u201cThat does go some distance toward explaining your remarkably republican attitudes,\u201d he replied very dryly. \u201cThough I would strongly suggest that you disguise these dangerous sentiments, for the sake of your family. Your father is in sufficient trouble on his own account. However, you may accept my assurance that it would not be possible for the daughter of a baronet to marry a groom, no matter how exigent the nature of their emotions.\u201d</p><p>Her turn to grunt at that; a highly expressive, if totally unfeminine sound. He sighed, and took her hand again, tucking it in the curve of his elbow for safekeeping.</p><p>\u201cHe was a paroled prisoner, too\u2014a Jacobite, a traitor. Believe me, marriage would not have occurred to either of them.\u201d</p><p>The damp air was misting on her skin, clinging to the down hairs on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBut that was in another country,\u201d she quoted softly. \u201cAnd besides, the wench is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>They scuffed silently through the damp sand for a few moments, each alone in thought. At last Brianna heaved a sigh, deep enough that he felt as well as heard it.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s dead, anyway, and the earl\u2014do you know why Da killed him? Did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father has never spoken of the matter\u2014of Geneva, of the earl, or even directly of William\u2019s parentage\u2014to me.\u201d He spoke precisely, eyes fixed on a pair of gulls probing the sand near a clump of saw grass. \u201cBut I know, yes.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cWilliam is my son, after all. In the sense of common usage, at least.\u201d In a great deal more than that, but that was not a matter he chose to discuss with Jamie\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cYes. How did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I told you, both of William\u2019s parents\u2014his putative parents\u2014died on the day of his birth. His father\u2014the earl, I mean\u2014had no close kin, so the boy was left to the guardianship of his grandfather, Lord Dunsany. Geneva\u2019s sister, Isobel, became William\u2019s mother in all but fact. And I\u2014\u201d He shrugged, nonchalant. \u201cI married Isobel. I became William\u2019s guardian, with Dunsany\u2019s consent, and he has regarded me as his stepfather since he was six years old\u2014he is my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? You married?\u201d She was goggling down at him, with an air of incredulity that he found offensive.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most peculiar notions concerning marriage,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cIt was an eminently suitable match.\u201d</p><p>One red eyebrow went up in a gesture that was Jamie to the life.</p><p>\u201cDid your wife think so?\u201d she asked, in an uncanny echo of her mother\u2019s voice, asking the same question. When her mother had asked it, he had been nonplussed. This time, he was prepared.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said tersely, \u201cwas in another country. And Isobel . . .\u201d As he had hoped, that silenced her.</p><p>A fire was burning at the far end of the sandy oval, where travelers had made a rough camp. People come downriver to see the execution, he wondered? Men seeking to enlist in the rebel militias? A figure moved, dimly seen through the haze of smoke, and he turned, leading Brianna back along the way they had come. This conversation was sufficiently awkward, without the risk of interruption.</p><p>\u201cYou asked about Ellesmere,\u201d he said, taking control of the conversation once more. \u201cThe story given to the coroner\u2019s court by Lord Dunsany was that Ellesmere had been showing him a new pistol, which discharged by accident. It was the sort of story that is told in order to be disbelieved\u2014giving the impression that in reality the earl had shot himself, doubtless from grief at the death of his wife, but that the Dunsanys wished to avoid the stigma of suicide, for the sake of the child. The coroner naturally perceived both the falsity of the story and the wisdom of allowing it to stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked,\u201d she said, a noticeable edge in her voice. \u201cI asked why my father shot him.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. She could have found gainful employment with the Spanish Inquisition, he thought ruefully; no chance of escape or evasion.</p><p>\u201cI understand that his Lordship, apprehending that the newborn infant was in fact not of his blood, intended to expunge the stain upon his honor by dropping the child out of the window, onto the slates in the courtyard thirty feet below,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>Her face had paled perceptibly.</p><p>\u201cHow did he find out?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAnd if Da was a groom, why was he there? Did the earl know he was\u2014responsible?\u201d She shuddered, plainly envisioning a scene in which Jamie was summoned to the earl\u2019s presence, to witness the death of his illegitimate offspring before facing a similar fate himself. John had no difficulty in discerning her imagination; he had envisioned such a scene himself, more than once.</p><p>\u201cAn acute choice of words,\u201d he replied dryly. \u201cJamie Fraser is \u2018responsible\u2019 for more than any man I know. As to the rest, I have no idea. I know the essentials of what happened, because Isobel knew; her mother was present and presumably told her only the briefest outline of the incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She kicked a small stone, deliberately. It skittered across the packed sand in front of her, ending a few feet away. \u201cAnd you never asked Da about it?\u201d</p><p>The stone lay in his line of march; he kicked it neatly as he walked, rolling it back into her path.</p><p>\u201cI have never spoken to your father regarding Geneva, Ellesmere, or William himself\u2014save to inform him of my marriage to Isobel and to assure him that I would fulfill my responsibilities as William\u2019s guardian to the best of my ability.\u201d</p><p>She set her foot on the stone, driving it into the soft sand, and stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything to him? What did he say to you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He returned her stare.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you marry Isobel?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, but there was no point in evasion.</p><p>\u201cIn order to take care of William.\u201d</p><p>The thick red brows nearly touched her hairline.</p><p>\u201cSo you got married, in spite of\u2014I mean, you turned your whole life upside down, just to take care of Jamie Fraser\u2019s illegitimate son? And neither one of you ever talked about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, baffled. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the brows came down again, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d she said cryptically. She glanced back toward the town. The air was calm, and a haze from the chimneys of Wilmington lay heavy above the trees. No roofs showed; it might have been a dragon that lay sleeping on the shore, for all that could be seen. The low, rumbling noise was not a reptilian snore, though; a small but constant stream of people had been passing by the track, headed for the town, and the reverberations of an increasing crowd were clearly audible, whenever the wind was right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly dark. I have to go back.\u201d She turned toward the lane that led into town, and he followed, relieved for the moment, but under no illusion that the inquisition was over.</p><p>She had only one more question, though.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to tell him?\u201d she asked, turning to look at him as she reached the edge of the trees.</p><p>\u201cTell who what?\u201d he replied, startled.</p><p>\u201cHim.\u201d She frowned at him, irritated. \u201cWilliam. My brother.\u201d The irritation faded as she tasted the word. She was still pale, but a sort of excitement had begun to glow beneath her skin. Lord John felt as though he had eaten something that violently disagreed with him. A cold sweat broke out along his jaw, and his guts clenched into fistlike knots. His knees turned to water.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite mad?\u201d He grasped at her arm, as much to keep from stumbling as to prevent her going off.</p><p>\u201cI gather he doesn\u2019t know who his father really is,\u201d she said with a bit of asperity. \u201cGiven that you and Da never talked to each other about it, you probably didn\u2019t see any point talking to him, either. But he\u2019s grown up now\u2014he has a right to know, surely.\u201d</p><p>Lord John closed his eyes with a low moan.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked. He felt her bending close to inspect him. \u201cYou don\u2019t look very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He sat himself, back to a tree, and pulled her down beside him on the ground. He breathed deeply, keeping his eyes closed while his mind raced. Surely she was joking? Surely not, his cynically observant self assured him. She had a marked sense of humor, but it wasn\u2019t in evidence at the moment.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t let her. It was inconceivable that she\u2014but how could he stop her? If she wouldn\u2019t listen to him, perhaps Jamie or her mother . . .</p><p>A hand touched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop to think.\u201d</p><p>Relief filled him. He felt his bowels begin to uncramp, and opened his eyes to see her gazing at him with a peculiar sort of limpid sympathy that he didn\u2019t understand at all. His bowels promptly convulsed again, making him fear that he was about to suffer an embarrassing attack of flatulence on the spot.</p><p>His bowels had read her better than he had.</p><p>\u201cI should have thought,\u201d she reproached herself. \u201cI should have known how you\u2019d feel about it. You said it yourself\u2014he\u2019s your son. You\u2019ve raised him all this time, I can see how much you love him. It must make you feel terrible to think of William finding out about Da and maybe blaming you for not telling him sooner.\u201d Her hand was massaging his collarbone in what he assumed was meant to be a soothing gesture. If that was her intent, the movement had singularly failed.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d he began, but she had taken his hand in both hers and was squeezing it earnestly, her blue eyes shimmering with tears.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d she assured him. \u201cWilliam would never stop loving you. Believe me. It was the same for me\u2014when I found out about Da. I didn\u2019t want to believe it at first; I had a father, and I loved him, and I didn\u2019t want another one. But then I met Da, and it was\u2014he was . . . who he is\u2014\u201d She shrugged slightly, and lifted one hand to wipe her eyes on the lace at her wrist.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t forgotten my other father,\u201d she said very softly. \u201cI never will. Never.\u201d</p><p>Touched despite the general seriousness of the situation, Lord John cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. I am sure your sentiments do you great credit, my dear. And while I hope that I likewise enjoy William\u2019s affectionate regard at present and will continue to do so in future, that is really not the point I was endeavoring to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d She looked up, wide-eyed, tears clumping her lashes into dark spikes. She was really a lovely young woman, and he felt a small twinge of tenderness.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, quite gently under the circumstances. \u201cLook, my love. I told you who William is\u2014or who he thinks he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViscount Whatnot, you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cQuite. The five people who know of his true parentage have expended considerable effort for the last eighteeen years, to the end that no one\u2014William included\u2014should ever have cause to doubt that he is the ninth Earl of Ellesmere.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at that, her thick brows knitted, lips compressed. Christ, he hoped that her husband had succeeded in locating Jamie Fraser in time. Jamie Fraser was the only person who had a hope of being more effectually stubborn than his daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said finally. She looked up, and he saw that she had come to some decision.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cRoger and I and the\u2014the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said cautiously. This might be good news\u2014on several counts. \u201cWhere do you propose to go? Will you remove to England? Or Scotland? If England or Canada, I have several social connexions who might be of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not there. Not anywhere you have \u2018connexions.\u2019\u201d She smiled painfully at him, then swallowed before continuing.</p><p>\u201cBut you see\u2014we\u2019ll be gone. For\u2014for good. I won\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever see you again.\u201d That realization had just dawned on her; he saw it on her face, and despite the strength of the pang it gave him, he was deeply moved by her obvious distress at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI will miss you very much, Brianna,\u201d he said gently. He had been a soldier most of his life, and then a diplomat. He had learned to live with separation and absence, with the occasional death of friends left behind. But the notion of never seeing this odd girl again caused him a most unexpected degree of grief. Almost, he thought with surprise, as though she were his own daughter.</p><p>But he had a son, as well, and her next words snapped him back to full alertness.</p><p>\u201cSo you see,\u201d she said, leaning toward him with an intentness that he would otherwise have found charming, \u201cI have to talk to William, and tell him. We\u2019ll never have another chance.\u201d Then her face changed, and she put a hand to her bosom.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cMandy\u2014Amanda, my daughter\u2014she needs to be fed.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she was up and gone, scudding across the sand of the racetrack like a storm cloud, leaving the threat of destruction and upheaval in her wake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>117</p><p>SURELY JUSTICE AND MERCY</p><p>SHALL FOLLOW ME</p><p>July 10, 1776</p> <p>THE TIDE TURNED FROM THE EBB just before five o\u2019clock in the morning. The sky was fully light, a clear pale color without clouds, and the mudflats beyond the quay stretched gray and shining, their smoothness marred here and there by weed and stubborn sea grass, sprouting from the mud like clumps of hair.</p><p>Everyone rose with the dawn; there were plenty of people on the quay to see the small procession go out, two officers from the Wilmington Committee of Safety, a representative from the Merchants Association, a minister carrying a Bible, and the prisoner, a tall, wide-shouldered figure, walking bare-headed across the stinking mud. Behind them all came a slave, carrying the ropes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to watch this,\u201d Brianna said under her breath. She was very pale, her arms folded over her middle as though she had a stomachache.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d Roger took her arm, but she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to.\u201d</p> <p>She dropped her arms and stood straight, watching. People around them were jostling for a better view, jeering and catcalling so loudly that whatever was said out there was inaudible. It didn\u2019t take long. The slave, a big man, grabbed the mooring post and shook it, testing for steadfastness. Then stood back, while the two officers backed Stephen Bonnet up to the stake and wrapped his body with rope from chest to knees. The bastard wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>Roger thought he should be searching his heart for compassion, praying for the man. He couldn\u2019t. Tried to ask forgiveness, and couldn\u2019t do that, either. Something like a ball of worms churned in his belly. He felt as though he were himself tied to a stake, waiting to drown.</p><p>The black-coated minister leaned close, his hair whipping in the early morning breeze, mouth moving. Roger didn\u2019t think that Bonnet made any reply, but couldn\u2019t tell for sure. After a few moments, the men doffed their hats, stood while the minister prayed, then put them on again and headed back toward shore, their boots squelching, ankle-deep in the sandy mud.</p><p>The moment the officials had disappeared, a stream of people poured out onto the mud: sightseers, hopping children\u2014and a man with a notebook and pencil, who Roger recognized as Amos Crupp, the current proprietor of the Wilmington Gazette.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019ll be a scoop, won\u2019t it?\u201d Roger muttered. No matter what Bonnet actually said\u2014or didn\u2019t\u2014there would undoubtedly be a broadsheet hawked through the streets tomorrow, containing either a lurid confession or mawkish reports of remorse\u2014perhaps both.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I really can\u2019t watch this.\u201d Abruptly, Brianna turned, taking his arm.</p> <p>She made it past the row of warehouses before turning abruptly to him, burying her face in his chest and bursting into tears.</p><p>\u201cSsh. It\u2019s okay\u2014it\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d He patted her, tried to infuse some conviction into the words, but his own throat had a lump in it the size of a lemon. He finally took her by the shoulders and held her away from him, so that he could look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t have to do it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stopped crying and sniffed, wiping her nose on her sleeve like Jemmy\u2014but wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m okay It\u2019s not even him. It\u2019s just\u2014just everything. M-Mandy\u201d\u2014her voice wavered on the word\u2014\u201cand meeting my brother\u2014Oh, Roger, if I can\u2019t tell him, he\u2019ll never know, and I\u2019ll never see him or Lord John again. Or Mama\u2014\u201d Fresh tears overwhelmed her, welling up in her eyes, but she gulped and swallowed, forcing them back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d she said in a choked, exhausted voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut ye still don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d His stomach still churned, and his hands felt shaky, but resolution filled him.</p><p>\u201cI should have killed him on Ocracoke,\u201d she said, closing her eyes and brushing back strands of loosened hair. The sun was higher now, and bright. \u201cI was a coward. I th-thought it would be easier to let\u2014let the law do it.\u201d She opened her eyes, and now did meet his gaze, her eyes reddened but clear. \u201cI can\u2019t let it happen this way, even if I hadn\u2019t given my word.\u201d</p> <p>Roger understood that; he felt the terror of the tide coming in, that inexorable creep of water, rising in his bones. It would be nearly nine hours before the water reached Bonnet\u2019s chin; he was a tall man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said very firmly.</p><p>She made a small attempt at a smile, but abandoned it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d She looked\u2014and sounded\u2014absolutely drained; neither of them had slept much the night before. But she also sounded determined, and he recognized Jamie Fraser\u2019s stubborn blood.</p><p>Well, what the hell\u2014he had some of that blood, too.</p><p>\u201cI told ye,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat your father said, that time. \u2018It is myself who kills for her.\u2019 If it has to be done\u201d\u2014and he was obliged to agree with her; he couldn\u2019t stand it, either\u2014\u201cthen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She was getting a grip on herself. She wiped her face with a fold of her skirt, and took a deep breath before meeting his eyes again. Hers were deep and vivid blue, much darker than the sky.</p><p>\u201cYou told me. And you told me why he said that, too\u2014what he said to Arch Bug: \u2018There is a vow upon her.\u2019 She\u2019s a doctor; she doesn\u2019t kill people.\u201d</p><p>The hell she doesn\u2019t, Roger thought, but better judgment prevented his saying so. Before he could think of something more tactful, she went on, placing her hands flat on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou have one, too,\u201d she said. That stopped him cold.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you do.\u201d She was quietly emphatic. \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t official yet\u2014but it doesn\u2019t need to be. Maybe it doesn\u2019t even have words, the vow that you took\u2014but you did it, and I know it.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny it, and was moved that she did know it.</p><p>\u201cAye, well . . .\u201d He put his hands over hers, clasping her long, strong fingers. \u201cAnd I made one to you, too, when I told ye. I said I would never put God before my\u2014my love for you.\u201d Love. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was discussing such a thing in terms of love. And yet, he had the queerest feeling that that was exactly how she saw it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that sort of vow,\u201d she said firmly, and pulled her hands out of his. \u201cAnd I gave my word.\u201d</p><p>She had gone with Jamie after dark the night before, to the place where the pirate was being held. Roger had no idea what sort of bribery or force of personality had been employed, but they had been admitted. Jamie had brought her back to their room very late, white-faced, with a sheaf of papers that she handed over to her father. Affidavits, she said; sworn statements of Stephen Bonnet\u2019s business dealings with various merchants up and down the coast.</p><p>Roger had given Jamie a murderous look, and got the same back, with interest. This is war, Fraser\u2019s narrowed eyes had said. And I will use any weapon I can. But all he had said was, \u201cGood night, then, a nighean,\u201d and touched her hair with tenderness before departing.</p><p>Brianna had sat down with Mandy and nursed her, eyes closed, refusing to speak. After a time, her face eased from its white, strained lines, and she burped the baby and laid her sleeping in her basket. Then she came to bed, and made love to him with a silent fierceness that surprised him. But not as much as she surprised him now.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s one other thing,\u201d she said, sober and slightly sad. \u201cI\u2019m the only person in the world for whom this isn\u2019t murder.\u201d</p><p>With that, she turned and walked away fast, toward the inn where Mandy waited to be fed. Out on the mudflats, he could still hear the sound of excited voices, raucous as gulls.</p><p>AT TWO O\u2019CLOCK in the afternoon, Roger helped his wife into a small rowboat, tied to the quay near the row of warehouses. The tide had been coming in all day; the water was more than five feet deep. Out in the midst of the shining gray stood the cluster of mooring posts\u2014and the small dark head of the pirate.</p><p>Brianna was remote as a pagan statue, her face expressionless. She lifted her skirts to step into the boat, and sat down, the weight in her pocket clunking against the wooden slat as she did so.</p><p>Roger took up the oars and rowed, heading toward the posts. They would arouse no particular interest; boats had been going out ever since noon, carrying sightseers who wished to look upon the condemned man\u2019s face, shout taunts, or clip a strand of his hair for a souvenir.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see where he was going; Brianna directed him left or right with a silent tilt of her head. She could see; she sat straight and tall, her right hand hidden in her skirt.</p><p>Then she lifted her left hand suddenly, and Roger lay on the oars, digging with one to slew the tiny craft around.</p><p>Bonnet\u2019s lips were cracked, his face chapped and crusted with salt, his lids so reddened that he could barely open his eyes. But his head lifted as they drew near, and Roger saw a man ravished, helpless and dreading a coming embrace\u2014so much that he half welcomes its seductive touch, yielding his flesh to cold fingers and the overwhelming kiss that steals his breath.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve left it late enough, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said to Brianna, and the cracked lips parted in a grin that split them and left blood on his teeth. \u201cI knew ye\u2019d come, though.\u201d</p><p>Roger paddled with one oar, working the boat close, then closer. He was looking over his shoulder when Brianna drew the gilt-handled pistol from her pocket, and put the barrel to Stephen Bonnet\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cGo with God, Stephen,\u201d she said clearly, in Gaelic, and pulled the trigger. Then she dropped the gun into the water and turned round to face her husband.</p><p>\u201cTake us home,\u201d she said.</p><p>118</p><p>REGRET</p><p>LORD JOHN STEPPED INTO HIS ROOM at the inn, and was surprised\u2014astonished, in fact\u2014to discover that he had a visitor.</p><p>\u201cJohn.\u201d Jamie Fraser turned from the window, and gave him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d He returned it, trying to control the sudden sense of elation he felt. He had used Jamie Fraser\u2019s Christian name perhaps three times in the last twenty-five years; the intimacy of it was exhilarating, but he mustn\u2019t let it show.</p><p>\u201cWill I order us refreshment?\u201d he asked politely. Jamie had not moved from the window; he glanced out, then back at John and shook his head, still smiling faintly.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, no. We are enemies, are we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe find ourselves regrettably upon opposing sides of what I trust will be a short-lived conflict,\u201d Lord John corrected.</p><p>Fraser looked down at him, with an odd, regretful sort of expression.</p><p>\u201cNot short,\u201d he said. \u201cBut regrettable, aye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lord John cleared his throat, and moved to the window, careful not to brush against his visitor. He looked out, and saw the likely reason for Fraser\u2019s visit.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, seeing Brianna Fraser MacKenzie on the wooden sidewalk below. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, in a different tone. For William Clarence Henry George Ransom, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, had just come out of the inn and bowed to her.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d he said, apprehension making his scalp prickle. \u201cWill she tell him?\u201d</p><p>Fraser shook his head, his eyes on the two young people below.</p><p>\u201cShe will not,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe gave me her word.\u201d</p><p>Relief coursed through his veins like water.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. Fraser shrugged slightly, dismissing it. It was, after all, what he desired, as well\u2014or so Lord John assumed.</p><p>The two of them were talking together\u2014William said something and Brianna laughed, throwing back her hair. Jamie watched in fascination. Dear God, they were alike! The small tricks of expression, of posture, of gesture . . . It must be apparent to the most casual observer. In fact, he saw a couple pass them and the woman smile, pleased at the sight of the handsome matched pair.</p><p>\u201cShe will not tell him,\u201d Lord John repeated, somewhat dismayed by the sight. \u201cBut she displays herself to him. Will he not\u2014but no. I don\u2019t suppose he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d Jamie said, eyes still fixed on them. \u201cBut if he does\u2014he still will not know. And she insisted she must see him once more\u2014that was the price of her silence.\u201d</p><p>John nodded, silent. Brianna\u2019s husband was coming now, their little boy held by one hand, his hair as vivid as his mother\u2019s in the bright summer sun. He held a baby in the crook of his arm\u2014Brianna took it from him, turning back the blanket to display the child to William, who inspected it with every indication of politeness.</p><p>He realized suddenly that every fragment of Fraser\u2019s being was focused on the scene outside. Of course; he had not seen Willie since the boy was twelve. And to see the two together\u2014his daughter and the son he could never speak to or acknowledge. He would have touched Fraser, put a hand on his arm in sympathy, but knowing the probable effect of his touch, forbore to do it.</p><p>\u201cI have come,\u201d Fraser said suddenly, \u201cto ask a favor of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your servant, sir,\u201d Lord John said, terribly pleased, but taking refuge in formality.</p><p>\u201cNot for myself,\u201d Fraser said with a glance at him. \u201cFor Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure will be the greater,\u201d John assured him. \u201cI am exceeding fond of your daughter, her temperamental resemblances to her sire notwithstanding.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Fraser\u2019s mouth lifted, and he returned his gaze to the scene below.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, then. I canna tell ye why I require this\u2014but I need a jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jewel?\u201d Lord John\u2019s voice sounded blank, even to his own ears. \u201cWhat sort of jewel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sort.\u201d Fraser shrugged, impatient. \u201cIt doesna matter\u2014so long as it should be some precious gem. I once gave ye such a stone\u2014\u201d His mouth twitched at that; he had handed over the stone, a sapphire, under duress, as a prisoner of the Crown. \u201cThough I dinna suppose ye\u2019d have that by ye, still.\u201d</p><p>In point of fact, he did. That particular sapphire had traveled with him for the last twenty-five years, and was at this moment in the pocket of his waistcoat.</p><p>He glanced at his left hand, which bore a broad gold band, set with a brilliant, faceted sapphire. Hector\u2019s ring. Given to him by his first lover at the age of sixteen. Hector had died at Culloden\u2014the day after John had met James Fraser, in the dark of a Scottish mountain pass.</p><p>Without hesitation, but with some difficulty\u2014the ring had been worn a long time, and had sunk a little way into the flesh of his finger\u2014he twisted it off and dropped it into Jamie\u2019s hand.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s brows rose in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cThis? Are ye sur\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d He reached out then, and closed Jamie\u2019s fingers around it with his own. The contact was fleeting, but his hand tingled, and he closed his own fist, hoping to keep the sensation.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jamie said again, quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2014my very great pleasure.\u201d The party below was breaking up\u2014Brianna was taking her leave, the baby held in her arms, her husband and son already halfway down the walk. William bowed, hat off, the shape of his chestnut head so perfectly echoing that of the red\u2014</p><p>Suddenly, Lord John could not bear to see them part. He wished to keep that, too\u2014the sight of them together. He closed his eyes and stood, hands on the sill, feeling the movement of the breeze past his face. Something touched his shoulder, very briefly, and he felt a sense of movement in the air beside him.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, all three of them were gone.</p><p>119</p><p>LOTH TO DEPART</p><p>September 1776</p><p>ROGER WAS LAYING THE LAST OF the water pipes when Aidan and Jemmy popped up beside him, sudden as a pair of jack-in-the-boxes.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, Bobby\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Bobby Higgins?\u201d Roger straightened up, feeling his back muscles protest, and looked toward the Big House, but saw no sign of a horse. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went up to the graveyard,\u201d Aidan said, looking important. \u201cD\u2019ye think he\u2019s gone to look for the ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Roger said calmly. \u201cWhat ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalva Christie\u2019s,\u201d Aidan said promptly. \u201cShe walks. Everybody says so.\u201d He spoke bravely, but wrapped his arms about himself. Jemmy, who plainly hadn\u2019t heard that bit of news before, looked wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she walk? Where\u2019s she going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was murrrrderrred, silly,\u201d Aidan said. \u201cFolk what are murdered always walk. They\u2019re lookin\u2019 for the one who killed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Roger said firmly, seeing the uneasy look on Jemmy\u2019s face. Jem had known Malva Christie was dead, of course; he\u2019d gone to her funeral, along with all the other children on the Ridge. But he and Brianna had simply told the boy that Malva had died, not that she had been murdered.</p><p>Well, Roger thought grimly, little hope of keeping something like that secret. He hoped Jem wouldn\u2019t have nightmares.</p><p>\u201cMalva\u2019s not walking about looking for anyone,\u201d he said, with as much conviction as he could infuse into his voice. \u201cHer soul is in heaven with Jesus, where she\u2019s happy and peaceful\u2014and her body . . . well, when people die, they don\u2019t need their bodies anymore, and so we bury them, and there they stay, all tidy in their graves, until the Last Day.\u201d</p><p>Aidan looked patently unconvinced by this.</p><p>\u201cJoey McLaughlin saw her, two weeks ago Friday,\u201d he said, bobbing up and down on his toes. \u201cA-flittin\u2019 through the wood, he said, all dressed in black\u2014and howlin\u2019 most mournful!\u201d</p><p>Jemmy was beginning to look truly upset. Roger laid down the spade, and picked Jem up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI expect Joey McLaughlin was a bit the worse for a dram too much,\u201d he said. Both boys were entirely familiar with the concept of drunkenness. \u201cIf it was flitting through the wood howling, it was most likely Rollo he saw. Come on, though, we\u2019ll go find Bobby, and ye\u2019ll see Malva\u2019s grave for yourselves.\u201d</p><p>He put out a hand to Aidan, who took it happily and chattered like a magpie all the way up the hill.</p><p>And what was Aidan going to do, when he left? he wondered. The idea of leaving, at first so abrupt as to seem completely unreal, unthinkable, had been filtering into his consciousness, day by day. As he worked at the chores, dug the trenches for Brianna\u2019s water pipes, carried hay, chopped wood, he would try to think: \u201cNot much longer.\u201d And yet it seemed impossible that one day he would not be on the Ridge, would not push open the door to the cabin and find Brianna involved in some fiendish experiment on the kitchen table, Jem and Aidan madly vrooming around her feet.</p><p>The feeling of unreality was even more pronounced when he preached of a Sunday or went round as minister\u2014if yet without portfolio\u2014to visit the sick or counsel the troubled. Looking into all those faces\u2014attentive, excited, bored, dour, or preoccupied\u2014he simply couldn\u2019t believe that he meant to go, callously to abandon them all. How would he tell them? he wondered, with a sort of anguish at the thought. Especially the ones he felt most responsible for\u2014Aidan and his mother.</p><p>He\u2019d prayed about it, looking for strength, for guidance.</p><p>And yet . . . and yet the vision of Amanda\u2019s tiny blue fingernails, the faint wheeze of her breathing, never left him. And the looming stones by the creek on Ocracoke seemed to grow nearer, more solid, day by day.</p><p>Bobby Higgins was indeed in the graveyard, his horse tethered under the pines. He was sitting by Malva\u2019s grave, head bowed in contemplation, though he looked up at once when Roger and the boys appeared. He looked pale and somber, but scrambled to his feet and shook Roger\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see ye back, Bobby. Here, you lot go and play, aye?\u201d He set Jemmy down, and was pleased to see that after one suspicious glance at Malva\u2019s grave\u2014adorned with a wilted bunch of wildflowers\u2014Jemmy went off quite happily with Aidan to hunt for squirrels and chipmunks in the wood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014er\u2014wasn\u2019t expecting to see you again,\u201d he added a little awkwardly. Bobby looked down, slowly dusting pine needles from his breeches.</p><p>\u201cWell, zur . . . the fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve come to stay. If so be as that\u2019s agreeable,\u201d he added hastily.</p><p>\u201cTo stay? But\u2014of course it\u2019s fine,\u201d Roger said, recovering from his surprise. \u201cHave you\u2014that is\u2014you\u2019ve not had a falling-out with his Lordship, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Bobby looked astonished at the thought, and shook his head decidedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, zur! His Lordship\u2019s been proper kind to me, ever since he took me on.\u201d He hesitated, biting his lower lip. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014well, ye see, zur, there\u2019s a deal of folk what come to stay with his Lordship these days. Politicals, and\u2014and army folk.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, he touched the brand on his cheek, which had faded now to a pinkish scar but was still apparent\u2014and always would be. Roger understood.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t comfortable there any longer, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, zur.\u201d Bobby gave him a grateful look. \u201cTime was, \u2019twas just his Lordship and me and Manoke the cook. Sometimes a guest would come for dinner or to stay a few days, but \u2019twas all easy and what ye might call simple. When I went for to run messages or errands for his Lordship, folk would stare, but only for the first time or two; after that, they\u2019d be used to this\u201d\u2014he touched his face again\u2014\u201cand it was all right. But now . . .\u201d He trailed off unhappily, leaving Roger to imagine the probable response of British army officers, starched, polished, and either openly disapproving of this blot on the service\u2014or painfully polite.</p><p>\u201cHis Lordship saw the difficulty; he\u2019s good that way. And he said as how he would miss me, but if I chose to seek my fortune elsewhere, he would give me ten pounds and his best wishes.\u201d</p><p>Roger whistled respectfully. Ten pounds was a very respectable sum. Not a fortune, but quite enough to set Bobby on his road.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he know ye meant to come here?\u201d</p><p>Bobby shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure myself,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOnce, I should\u2014\u201d He cut himself off abruptly, with a glance at Malva\u2019s grave, then turned back to Roger, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI thought I best talk to Mr. Fraser, before I was to make up my mind. Could be there\u2019s naught for me here any longer, either.\u201d This was phrased as a statement, but the question was clear. Everyone on the Ridge knew Bobby and accepted him; that wasn\u2019t the difficulty. But with Lizzie married and Malva gone . . . Bobby wanted a wife.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . I think ye might find yourself welcome,\u201d Roger said with a thoughtful look at Aidan, hanging upside down by his knees from a tree branch, while Jemmy pegged pinecones at him. A most peculiar feeling went through him\u2014something between gratitude and jealousy\u2014but he pushed the latter feeling firmly down.</p><p>\u201cAidan!\u201d he shouted. \u201cJem! Time to go!\u201d And turned casually back to Bobby, saying, \u201cI think ye\u2019ll maybe not have met Aidan\u2019s mother, Amy McCallum\u2014a young widow, aye, with a house and a bit of land. She\u2019s come to work at the Big House; if ye\u2019ll come sit down to supper there . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019VE THOUGHT OF IT now and then,\u201d Jamie admitted. \u201cWondered, ye ken? What if I could? How would it be?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Brianna, smiling, but a little helpless, and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye think, lass? What should I do there? How would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2014\u201d she began, and stopped, trying to envision him in that world\u2014behind the wheel of a car? Going to an office, in a three-piece suit? That idea was so ludicrous, she laughed. Or sitting in a darkened theater, watching Godzilla films with Jem and Roger?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jamie spelled backward?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEimaj, I suppose,\u201d he replied, bewildered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d do fine,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cNever mind. You\u2019d\u2014well, I suppose you could . . . publish newspapers. The printing presses are bigger and faster, and it takes a lot more people to gather the news, but otherwise\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so different then from what it is now. You know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a crease of concentration forming between the thick brows that were so like hers.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d he said a little dubiously. \u201cCould I be a farmer, d\u2019ye think? Surely folk still eat; someone must feed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could.\u201d She looked round, taking fresh note of all the homely details of the place: the chickens scratching peaceably in the dirt; the soft, weathered boards of the stable; the thrown-up dirt near the foundation of the house where the white pig had burrowed in. \u201cThere are people then who still farm just this way; small places, way up in the mountains. It\u2019s a hard life\u2014\u201d She saw him smile, and laughed in return. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s not any harder than it is now\u2014but it\u2019s a lot easier in the cities.\u201d</p><p>She paused, thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to fight,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>He seemed surprised at that.</p><p>\u201cNo? But ye did say there are wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere certainly are,\u201d she said, needles of ice piercing her belly, as the images pierced her mind: fields of poppies, fields of white crosses\u2014a man on fire, a nak*d child running with burned skin, the contorted face of a man in the instant before the bullet entered his brain. \u201cBut\u2014but then it\u2019s only the young men who fight. And not all of them; only some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He thought for a bit, his brow furrowed, then looked up searching her face.</p><p>\u201cThis world of yours, this America,\u201d he said finally, matter-of-factly. \u201cThe freedom that ye go to. There will be a fearful price to be paid. Will it be worth it, do ye think?\u201d</p><p>It was her turn then to be silent and think. At last she put her hand on his arm\u2014solid, warm, steady as iron.</p><p>\u201cAlmost nothing would be worth losing you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut maybe that comes close.\u201d</p><p>AS THE WORLD turns toward winter and the nights grow long, people begin to wake in the dark. Lying in bed too long cramps the limbs, and dreams dreamt too long turn inward on themselves, grotesque as a Mandarin\u2019s fingernails. By and large, the human body isn\u2019t adapted for more than seven or eight hours\u2019 sleep\u2014but what happens when the nights are longer than that?</p><p>What happens is the second sleep. You fall asleep from tiredness, soon after dark\u2014but then wake again, rising toward the surface of your dreams like a trout coming up to feed. And should your sleeping partner also wake then\u2014and people who have slept together for a good many years know at once when each other wakes\u2014you have a small, private place to share, deep in the night. A place in which to rise, to stretch, to bring a juicy apple back to bed, to share slice by slice, fingers brushing lips. To have the luxury of conversation, uninterrupted by the business of the day. To make love slowly in the light of an autumn moon.</p><p>And then, to lie close, and let a lover\u2019s dreams caress your skin as you begin to sink once more beneath the waves of consciousness, blissful in the knowledge that dawn is far off\u2014that\u2019s second sleep.</p><p>I came very slowly to the surface of my first sleep, to find that the highly erotic dream I had been having had some basis in reality.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never thought myself the sort who\u2019d molest a corpse, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice tickled the tender flesh below my ear, murmuring. \u201cBut I will say the notion has more appeal than I\u2019d thought.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t sufficiently coherent as to respond to this, but thrust my h*ps back toward him in a fashion that he seemed to find as eloquent an invitation as one written in calligraphy on parchment. He took a deep breath, a firm grip on my buttocks, and brought me to an awakening that could be called rude in several senses of the word.</p><p>I squirmed like a worm impaled on a fish-hook, making small urgent noises that he interpreted correctly, rolling me onto my face and proceeding to leave me in no doubt that I was not merely alive and awake, but functioning.</p><p>I emerged at length from a nest of flattened pillows, damp, gasping, quivering in every engorged and slippery nerve-ending, and thoroughly awake.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought that on?\u201d I inquired. He hadn\u2019t pulled away; we lay still joined, washed in the light of a big golden half-moon, riding low in the sky above the chestnut trees. He made a small sound, partly amusement, partly dismay.</p> <p>\u201cI canna look at ye asleep without wanting to wake ye, Sassenach.\u201d His hand cupped my breast, gently now. \u201cI suppose I find myself lonely without ye.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd note in his voice, and I turned my head toward him, but couldn\u2019t see him in the dark behind me. Instead, I put back a hand and touched the leg still wrapped halfway over mine. Even relaxed, it was hard, the long groove of the muscle graceful under my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said, and his arm tightened suddenly round me.</p><p>I HEARD THE BREATH catch in his throat, and my hand tightened on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said.</p> <p>He drew breath, but didn\u2019t answer at once. I felt him draw back a little, and fumble under the pillow. Then his hand came round me again, but this time seeking the hand that lay on his leg. His fingers curled into mine, and I felt a small, hard, roundish object thrust into my hand.</p><p>I heard him swallow.</p><p>The stone, whatever it was, seemed slightly warm to the touch. I ran a thumb slowly over it; a raw stone of some kind, but big, the size of one of my finger-joints.</p><p>\u201cJamie . . .\u201d I said, feeling my throat close.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, so softly that I barely heard him, close as we were.</p><p>I lay still for a moment, feeling the stone grow warmer in the palm of my hand. Surely it was imagination that made it seem to throb in time with my heart. Where on earth had he gotten it?</p> <p>Then I moved\u2014not suddenly, but with deliberation, my body sliding slowly free of his. I rose, feeling light-headed, and crossed the room. Pushed open the window to feel the sharp touch of the autumn wind on my nak*d bed-warm skin, and drawing back my arm, hurled the tiny object into the night.</p><p>Then I came back to bed, saw his hair a dark mass on the pillow, and the shine of his eyes in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered, and slid under the sheet beside him, putting my arms around him, hugging him close, warmer than the stone\u2014so much warmer\u2014and his heart beat with mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m none so brave as I was before, ken?\u201d he said very softly. \u201cNot brave enough to live without ye anymore.\u201d</p><p>But brave enough to try.</p><p>I drew his head down to me, stroking the tumble of his hair, coarse and smooth at once, live beneath my fingers.</p><p>\u201cLay your head, man,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time \u2019til dawn.\u201d</p><p>120</p> <p>IF ONLY FOR MYSELF</p><p>THE SKY WAS A FLAT, LEADEN COLOR, threatening rain, and the wind gusted through the palmettos, rattling the leaves like sabers. Down in the depths of the tidal forest, the four stones loomed beside the creek.</p><p>\u201cI am the wife of the laird of Balnain,\u201d Brianna whispered, next to me. \u201cThe faeries have stolen me over again.\u201d She was white to the lips, Amanda clutched close to her breast.</p><p>We had made our farewells\u2014we had been saying farewell, I thought, since the day I pressed the stethoscope to Mandy\u2019s heart. But Brianna turned and flung herself\u2014baby and all\u2014at Jamie, who pressed her so tight against his heart, I thought one of them must break.</p><p>Then she was flying at me, a cloud of cloak and loosened hair, and her face was cold against mine, her tears and mine mingling on my skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mama! I love you!\u201d she said in desperation, then turned and, without looking back, began to walk the pattern Donner had described, quietly chanting under her breath. A circle right, between two stones, a circle left, and back through the center\u2014and then to the left of the largest stone.</p><p>I had been expecting it; when she began to walk the pattern, I had run away from the stones, stopping at what I thought a safe distance. It wasn\u2019t. The sound of them\u2014a roar, this time, instead of a shriek\u2014thundered through me, stopping my breath and nearly my heart. Pain froze in a band round my chest and I dropped to my knees, swaying and helpless.</p><p>They were gone. I could see Jamie and Roger running to check\u2014terrified of finding bodies, at once desolate and elated to find none. I couldn\u2019t see well\u2014my vision swam, flickering in and out\u2014but didn\u2019t need to. I knew they were gone, from the hole in my heart.</p><p>\u201cTWO DOWN,\u201d Roger whispered. His voice was no more than a faint rasp, and he cleared his throat, hard. \u201cJeremiah.\u201d He looked down at Jem, who blinked and sniffed, and drew himself up tall at the sound of his formal name.</p><p>\u201cYe ken what we\u2019re about now, aye?\u201d Jemmy nodded, though he flicked a scared glance toward the towering stone where his mother and his baby sister had just vanished. He swallowed hard, and wiped the tears off his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Roger reached out a hand and rested it gently on Jemmy\u2019s head. \u201cKnow this, mo mac\u2014I shall love ye all my life, and never forget ye. But this is a terrible thing we\u2019re doing, and ye need not come with me. Ye can stay with your grandda and grannie Claire; it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t I\u2014won\u2019t I see Mama again?\u201d Jemmy\u2019s eyes were huge, and he couldn\u2019t keep from looking at the stone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Roger said, and I could see the tears he was fighting himself, and hear them in his thickened voice. He didn\u2019t know whether he would ever see Brianna again himself, or baby Mandy. \u201cProbably . . . probably not.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked down at Jem, who was clinging to his hand, looking back and forth between father and grandfather, confusion, fright, and longing in his face.</p><p>\u201cIf one day, a bhailach,\u201d Jamie said conversationally, \u201cye should meet a verra large mouse named Michael\u2014ye\u2019ll tell him your grandsire sends his regards.\u201d He opened his hand, then, letting go, and nodded toward Roger.</p><p>Jem stood staring for a moment, then dug in his feet and sprinted toward Roger, sand spurting from under his shoes. He leaped into his father\u2019s arms, clutching him around the neck, and with a final glance backward, Roger turned and stepped behind the stone, and the inside of my head exploded in fire.</p><p>Unimaginable time later, I came slowly back, coming down from the clouds in fragments, like hailstones. And found myself lying with my head in Jamie\u2019s lap. And heard him saying softly, to himself or to me, \u201cFor your sake, I will continue\u2014though for mine alone . . . I would not.\u201d</p><p>121</p><p>ACROSS THE ABYSS</p><p>THREE NIGHTS LATER, I WOKE FROM a restless sleep in an inn in Wilmington, my throat parched as the salt bacon I had eaten in the dinner stew. Sitting up to find water, I found that I was alone\u2014the moonlight through the window shone white on the vacant pillow beside me.</p><p>I found Jamie outside, behind the inn, his nightshirt a pale blotch in the darkness of the innyard. He was sitting on the ground with his back against a chopping block, arms wrapped about his knees.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak as I came toward him, but turned his head, body shifting in a silent welcome. I sat down on the chopping block behind him, and he leaned his head back against my thigh, with a long, deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d I touched him gently, smoothing back the hair from his face. He slept with it unbound, and it fell thick and wild about his shoulders, tangled from bed.</p><p>\u201cNay, I slept,\u201d he said quietly. His eyes were open, looking up at the great gold moon, three-quarters full over the aspens near the inn. \u201cI had a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare?\u201d He had them seldom anymore, but they did come sometimes: the bloody memories of Culloden, of futile death and slaughter; prison dreams of hunger and confinement\u2014and sometimes, very rarely, Jack Randall returned to him in sleep, with loving cruelty. Such dreams would always drive him from his bed to walk to and fro for hours, until exhaustion cleansed him of their visions. But he had not dreamed that way since Moore\u2019s Creek Bridge.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, sounding half-surprised. \u201cNot at all. I dreamed of her\u2014of our lassie\u2014and the bairns.\u201d</p><p>My heart gave an odd little hop, the consequence of startlement and what might almost have been envy.</p><p>\u201cYou dreamed about Brianna and the children? What happened?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, face tranquil and abstracted in the moonlight, as though he still saw some part of the dream before him.</p><p>\u201cIt is all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are safe. I saw them in a town\u2014it seemed like Inverness, but it was different, somehow. They walked up the step of a house\u2014Roger Mac was with them,\u201d he added, offhand. \u201cThey knocked at the door, and a wee brown-haired woman opened to them. She laughed wi\u2019 joy to see them, and brought them in, and they went down a hallway, wi\u2019 strange things like bowls hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThen they were in a room, wi\u2019 sofas and chairs, and the room had great windows all down one wall, from the floor to the ceiling, and the afternoon sun was streaming in, setting Brianna\u2019s hair to fire, and makin\u2019 wee Mandy cry when it got in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid . . . did any of them call the brown-haired woman by name?\u201d I asked, my heart beating in a queer, fast way.</p><p>He frowned, moonlight making a cross of light over nose and brows.</p><p>\u201cAye, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cI canna just\u2014oh, aye; Roger Mac called her Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d I said. My hands rested on his shoulder, and my mouth was a hundred times drier than it had been when I woke up. The night was chilly, but not enough to account for the temperature of my hands.</p><p>I had told Jamie any amount of things about my own time over the years of our marriage. About trains and planes and automobiles and wars and indoor plumbing. But I was nearly sure that I had never told him what the study looked like in the manse where Roger had grown up with his adoptive father.</p><p>The room with the window wall, made to accommodate the Reverend\u2019s painting hobby. The manse with its long hallway, furnished with old-fashioned light fixtures, shaped like hanging bowls. And I knew I had never told him about the Reverend\u2019s last housekeeper, a girl with dark, curly hair, called Fiona.</p><p>\u201cWere they happy?\u201d I asked at last, very quietly.</p><p>\u201cAye. Brianna and the lad\u2014they had some shadows to their faces, but I could see they were glad nonetheless. They all sat down to eat\u2014Brianna and her lad close together, leaning on each other\u2014and wee Jem stuffed his face wi\u2019 cakes and cream.\u201d He smiled at the picture, teeth a brief gleam in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014at the last, just before I woke . . . wee Jem was messin\u2019 about, picking things up and putting them down as he does. There was a . . . thing . . on the table. I couldna say what it was; I\u2019ve never seen the like.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands about six inches apart, frowning at them. \u201cIt was maybe this wide, and just a bit longer\u2014something like a box, maybe, only sort of . . . humped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumped?\u201d I said, puzzled as to what this could be.</p><p>\u201cAye, and it had a thing on top like a wee club, only wi\u2019 a knob to each end, and the club was tied to the box wi\u2019 a sort of black cord, curled up on itself like a piggie\u2019s tail. Jem saw it, and he reached out his hand, and said, \u2018I want to talk to Grandda.\u2019 And then I woke.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head back farther, so as to look up into my face.</p><p>\u201cWould ye ken what a thing like that might be, Sassenach? It was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>The autumn wind came rustling down from the hill, dry leaves hurrying in its wake, quick and light as the footsteps of a ghost, and I felt the hair rise on nape and forearms.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve told you about them, I know.\u201d I didn\u2019t think, though, that I had ever described one to him, in more than general terms. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a telephone.\u201d</p><p>122</p><p>THE GUARDIAN</p><p>IT WAS NOVEMBER; THERE WERE NO FLOWERS. But the holly bushes gleamed dark green, and the berries had begun to ripen. I cut a small bunch, careful of the prickles, added a tender branch of spruce for fragrance, and climbed the steep trail to the tiny graveyard.</p><p>I went every week, to leave some small token on Malva\u2019s grave, and say a prayer. She and her child had not been buried with a cairn\u2014her father hadn\u2019t wanted such a pagan custom\u2014but people came and left pebbles there by way of remembrance. It gave me some small comfort to see them; there were others who remembered her.</p><p>I stopped abruptly at the head of the trail; someone was kneeling by her grave\u2014a young man. I caught the murmur of his voice, low and conversational, and would have turned about to go, save that he raised his head, and the wind caught his hair, short and tufted, like an owl\u2019s feathers. Allan Christie.</p><p>He saw me, too, and stiffened. There was nothing to do but go and speak to him, though, and so I went.</p><p>\u201cMr. Christie,\u201d I said, the words feeling strange in my mouth. That was what I had called his father. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at me blankly; then some sort of awareness seemed to stir in his eyes. Gray eyes, rimmed with black lashes, so much like those of his father and sister. Bloodshot with weeping and lack of sleep, judging from the shocking smudges under them.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cMy loss. Aye.\u201d</p><p>I stepped around him to lay down my evergreen bouquet, and with a small spurt of alarm, saw that there was a pistol on the ground beside him, cocked and primed.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I said as casually as possible, under the circumstances. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as though it really didn\u2019t matter where he\u2019d been\u2014perhaps it didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t looking at me anymore, but at the stone we\u2019d placed at the head of her grave.</p><p>\u201cPlaces,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cBut I had to come back.\u201d He turned away a little, plainly indicating that he wanted me to leave. Instead, I pulled up my skirts and knelt gingerly beside him. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d blow his brains out in front of me. I had no idea what to do, other than to try to make him talk to me and hope that someone else would come along.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad to have you home,\u201d I said, trying for an easy, conversational note.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said vaguely. And again, his eyes going to the headstone, \u201cI had to come back.\u201d His hand wandered toward the pistol, and I seized it, startling him.</p><p>\u201cI know you loved your sister very much,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2014it was a terrible shock to you, I know.\u201d What, what did one say? There were things one might say to a person contemplating suicide, I knew, but what?</p><p>\u201cYour life has value.\u201d I\u2019d said that to Tom Christie, who had only replied, \u201cIf it did not, this would not matter.\u201d But how should I convince his son of that?</p><p>\u201cYour father loved you both,\u201d I said, wondering as I said it whether he knew what his father had done. His fingers were very cold, and I wrapped both my hands round his, trying to offer him a little warmth, hoping that the human contact would help.</p><p>\u201cNot as I loved her,\u201d he said softly, not looking at me. \u201cI loved her all her life, from the time she was born and they gave her me to hold. There was nay other, for either of us. Faither was gone to prison, and then my mither\u2014ah, Mither.\u201d His lips pulled back, as though to laugh, but there was no sound.</p><p>\u201cI know about your mother,\u201d I said. \u201cYour father told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d His head jerked up to look at me, eyes clear and hard. \u201cDid he tell ye they took me and Malva to her execution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no. I don\u2019t think he knew, did he?\u201d My stomach clenched.</p><p>\u201cHe did. I told him, later, when he sent for us, brought us here. He said that was good, we\u2019d seen with our own eyes the ends of wickedness. He bade me remember the lesson\u2014and so I did,\u201d he added more quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014how old were you?\u201d I asked, horrified.</p><p>\u201cTen. Malva was nay more than two; she\u2019d no idea what was happening. She cried out for her Mam when they brought Mither out to the hangsman, and kicked and screamed, reaching out for her.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, and turned his head away.</p><p>\u201cI tried to take her, to push her head into my bosom, so she shouldna see\u2014but they wouldna let me have her. They held her wee head and made her watch, and Auntie Darla saying in her ear that this was what happened to witches, and pinching her legs \u2019til she shrieked. We lived with Auntie Darla for six years after that,\u201d he said, his face remote.</p><p>\u201cShe wasna best pleased about it, but she said she kent her Christian duty. The auld besom barely fed us, and \u2019twas me took care of Malva.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a bit, and so was I, thinking the best\u2014the only\u2014thing I could offer him now was the chance to speak. He pulled his hand from mine, leaned over, and touched the gravestone. It was no more than a lump of granite, but someone had gone to the trouble to carve her name on it\u2014only the one word, MALVA , in crude block letters. It reminded me of the memorials that dotted Culloden, the clanstones, each with a single name.</p><p>\u201cShe was perfect,\u201d he whispered. His finger traced its way over the stone, delicate, as though he touched her flesh. \u201cSo perfect. Her wee privates looked like a flower\u2019s bud, and her skin sae fresh and soft. . . .\u201d</p><p>A sense of coldness grew in the pit of my stomach. Did he mean . . . yes, of course he did. A sense of inevitable despair began to grow within me.</p><p>\u201cShe was mine,\u201d he said, and looking up to see my eye upon him, repeated it more loudly. \u201cShe was mine!\u201d</p><p>He looked down, then, at the grave, and his mouth turned in upon itself, in grief and anger.</p><p>\u201cThe auld man never knew\u2014never guessed what we were to each other.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he? I thought. Tom Christie might have confessed to the crime to save one he loved\u2014but he loved more than one. Having lost a daughter\u2014or rather, a niece\u2014would he not do all he could to save the son who was the last remnant of his blood?</p><p>\u201cYou killed her,\u201d I said quietly. I was in no doubt, and he showed no surprise.</p><p>\u201cHe would ha\u2019 sold her away, given her to some clod of a farmer.\u201d Allan\u2019s fist clenched on his thigh. \u201cI thought of that, as she grew older, and sometimes when I would lie with her, I couldna bear the thought, and would slap her face, only from the rage of thinking of it.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep, ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna her fault, none of it. But I thought it was. And then I caught her wi\u2019 that soldier, and again, wi\u2019 filthy wee Henderson. I beat her for it, but she cried out that she couldna help it\u2014she was with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, slowly.</p><p>\u201cI never thought of it. I should, of course. But I never did. She was always wee Malva, see, a bittie wee lass. I saw her br**sts swell, aye, and the hair come out to mar her sweet flesh\u2014but I just never thought . . .</p><p>He shook his head, unable to deal with the thought, even now.</p><p>\u201cShe said she must marry\u2014and there must be reason for her husband to think the child his, whoever she wed. If she couldna make the soldier wed her, then it must be another. So she took as many lovers as she might, quickly.</p><p>\u201cI put a stop to that, though,\u201d he assured me, a faintly nauseating tone of self-righteousness in his voice. \u201cI told her I wouldna have it\u2014I would think of another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you put her up to saying the child was Jamie\u2019s.\u201d My horror at the story and my anger at what he had done to us was subsumed by a flood of sorrow. Oh, Malva, I thought in despair. Oh, my darling Malva. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? But of course she wouldn\u2019t have told me. Her only confidant was Allan.</p><p>He nodded, and reached out to touch the stone again. A gust of wind quivered through the holly, stirring the stiff leaves.</p><p>\u201cIt would explain the bairn, see, but she wouldna have to wed anyone. I thought\u2014Himself would give her money to go away, and I would go with her. We could go to Canada, perhaps, or to the Indies.\u201d His voice sounded dreamy, as though he envisioned some idyllic life, where no one knew.</p><p>\u201cBut why did you kill her?\u201d I burst out. \u201cWhat made you do that?\u201d The sorrow and the senselessness were overwhelming; I clenched my hands in my apron, not to batter him.</p><p>\u201cI had to,\u201d he said heavily. \u201cShe said she couldna go through with it.\u201d He blinked, looking down, and I saw that his eyes were heavy with tears.</p><p>\u201cShe said\u2014she loved you,\u201d he said, low-voiced and thick. \u201cShe couldna hurt ye so. She meant to tell the truth. No matter what I said to her, she just kept saying that\u2014she loved ye, and she\u2019d tell.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, shoulders slumping. Two tears ran down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hinny?\u201d he cried, crossing his arms over his belly in a spasm of grief. \u201cWhy did ye make me do it? Ye shouldna have loved anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>He sobbed then, like a child, and curled into himself, weeping. I was weeping, too, for the loss and the pointlessness, for the utter, terrible waste of it all. But I reached out and took the gun from the ground. Hands shaking, I dumped out the priming pan, and shook the ball from the barrel, then put the pistol in the pocket of my apron.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d I said, my voice half-choked. \u201cGo away again, Allan. There are too many people dead.\u201d</p><p>He was too grief-stricken to hear me; I shook him by the shoulder and said it again, more strongly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill yourself. I forbid it, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you to say?\u201d he cried, turning on me. His face was contorted with anguish. \u201cI cannot live, I cannot!\u201d</p><p>But Tom Christie had given up his life for his son, as well as for me; I couldn\u2019t let that sacrifice go for naught.</p><p>\u201cYou must,\u201d I said, and stood up, feeling light-headed, unsure whether my knees would hold me. \u201cDo you hear me? You must!\u201d</p><p>He looked up, eyes burning through the tears, but didn\u2019t speak. There was a keening whine like the hum of a mosquito, and a soft, sudden thump. He didn\u2019t change expression, but his eyes slowly died. He stayed on his knees for a moment, but bowed then forward, like a flower nodding on its stem, so I saw the arrow protruding from the center of his back. He coughed, once, sputtering blood, and fell sideways, curled on his sister\u2019s grave. His legs jerked spasmodically, grotesquely froglike. Then he lay still.</p><p>I stood stupidly staring at him for some immeasurable span of time, becoming only gradually aware that Ian had walked out of the wood and stood beside me, bow over his shoulder. Rollo nosed curiously at the body, whining.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Auntie,\u201d Ian said quietly. \u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>123</p><p>RETURN OF THE NATIVE</p><p>OLD GRANNIE ABERNATHY looked at least a hundred and two. She admitted\u2014under pressure\u2014to ninety-one. She was nearly blind and nearly deaf, curled up like a pretzel from osteoporosis, and with skin gone so fragile that the merest scrape tore it like paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nay more than a bag o\u2019 bones,\u201d she said every time I saw her, shaking a head that trembled with palsy. \u201cBut at least I\u2019ve still got maist o\u2019 my teeth!\u201d</p><p>For a wonder, she had; I thought that was the only reason she had made it this far\u2014unlike many people half her age, she wasn\u2019t reduced to living on porridge, but could still stomach meat and greens. Perhaps it was improved nutrition that kept her going\u2014perhaps it was mere stubbornness. Her married name was Abernathy, but she had, she confided, been born a Fraser.</p><p>Smiling at the thought, I finished wrapping the bandage about her sticklike shin. Her legs and feet had almost no flesh upon them, and felt hard and cold as wood. She\u2019d knocked her shin against the leg of the table and taken off a strip of skin the width of a finger; such a minor injury that a younger person would think nothing of it\u2014but her family worried over her, and had sent for me.</p><p>\u201cIt will be slow healing, but if you keep it clean\u2014for God\u2019s sake, do not let her put hog fat on it!\u2014I think it will be all right.\u201d The younger Mrs. Abernathy, known as Young Grannie\u2014herself about seventy\u2014gave me a sharp eye at that; like her mother-in-law, she put a good deal of faith in hog fat and turpentine as cure-alls, but nodded grudgingly. Her daughter, whose high-flown name of Arabella had been shortened to the cozier Grannie Belly, grinned at me behind Young Grannie\u2019s back. She had been less fortunate in the way of teeth\u2014her smile showed significant gaps\u2014but was cheerful and good-natured.</p><p>\u201cWillie B.,\u201d she instructed a teenaged grandson, \u201cjust be steppin\u2019 doon to the root cellar, and bringing up a wee sack of turnips for Herself.\u201d</p><p>I made the usual protestations, but all parties concerned were comfortably aware of the proper protocol in such matters, and within a few minutes, I was on my way home, the richer by five pounds of turnips.</p><p>They were welcome. I had forced myself to go back to my garden in the spring after Malva\u2019s death\u2014I had to; sentiment was all very well, but we had to eat. The subsequent disturbances of life and my prolonged absences, though, had resulted in dreadful neglect of the autumn crop. Despite Mrs. Bug\u2019s best efforts, the turnips had all succumbed to thrips and black rot.</p><p>Our supplies in general were sadly depleted. With Jamie and Ian gone so frequently, not there to harvest or hunt, and without Bree and Roger, the grain crops had been half of their usual yield, and only a pitiful single haunch of venison hung in the smoking shed. We needed nearly all the grain for our own use; there was none to trade or sell, and only a scant few bags of barleycorn sat under canvas near the malting shed\u2014where they were likely to rot, I thought grimly, as no one had had time to see to the malting of a fresh batch before the cold weather set in.</p><p>Mrs. Bug was slowly rebuilding her flock of chickens, after a disastrous attack by a fox that got into the henhouse\u2014but it was slow going, and we got only the occasional egg for breakfast, grudgingly spared.</p><p>On the other hand, I reflected more cheerfully, we did have ham. Lots of ham. Likewise, immense quantities of bacon, headcheese, pork chops, tenderloin . . . to say nothing of suet and rendered fat.</p><p>The thought led me back to hog fat, and to the crowded, overflowingly familiar coziness of the Abernathys\u2019 cluster of cabins\u2014and by contrast, to thought of the dreadful emptiness at the Big House.</p><p>In a place with so many people, how could the loss of only four be so important? I had to stop and lean against a tree, let the sorrow wash through me, making no attempt to stop it. I\u2019d learned. \u201cYe canna hold a ghost at bay,\u201d Jamie had told me. \u201cLet them in.\u201d</p><p>I let them in\u2014I could never keep them out. And took what small comfort I could in hoping\u2014no, I didn\u2019t hope, I told myself fiercely, I knew\u2014that they were not ghosts in fact. Not dead, but only . . . elsewhere.</p><p>After a few moments, the overwhelming grief began to recede, going slowly as the ebbing tide. Sometimes it uncovered treasure: small forgotten images of Jemmy\u2019s face, smeared with honey, Brianna\u2019s laughter, Roger\u2019s hands, deft with a knife, carving one of the little cars\u2014the house was still littered with them\u2014then leaning to spear a muffin from a passing plate. And if to look at these caused fresh pain, at least I had them, and could keep them in my heart, knowing that in the fullness of time, they would bring consolation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I breathed, and felt the tightness in my chest and throat ease. Amanda was not the only one who might benefit from modern surgery, I thought. I couldn\u2019t tell what might be done for Roger\u2019s vocal cords, but maybe . . . and yet, his voice now was good. Full and resonant, if rough. Perhaps he would choose to keep it as it was\u2014he\u2019d fought for it, and earned it.</p><p>The tree I leaned against was a pine; the needles swayed softly above me, then settled, as though in agreement. I had to go; it was late in the day and the air was growing colder.</p><p>Wiping my eyes, I settled the hood of my cloak and went on. It was a long walk from the Abernathys\u2019\u2014I should really have ridden Clarence, but he\u2019d come up lame the day before, and I\u2019d let him rest. I\u2019d have to hurry, though, if I was to reach home before dark.</p><p>I cast a wary eye upward, judging the clouds, which had that soft, uniform gray of coming snow. The air was cold and thick with moisture; when the temperature dropped at nightfall, snow would fall.</p> <p>The sky was still light, but only just, as I came down past the springhouse and into the backyard. Light enough to tell me that something was wrong, though\u2014the back door stood open.</p><p>That set off alarm bells, and I turned to run back into the woods. I turned, and ran smack into a man who had come out of the trees behind me.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I demanded, stepping hastily back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, Mrs.,\u201d he said, and grabbing me by the arm, yelled toward the house, \u201cHey, Donner! I got her!\u201d</p><p>WHATEVER WENDIGO DONNER been doing for the last year, it hadn\u2019t been profitable, by the looks of him. Never a natty dresser at the best of times, he was now so ragged that his coat was literally falling apart, and a slice of stringy buttock showed through a rent in his breeches. His mane of hair was greasy and matted, and he stank.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d he demanded hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cWhere are what?\u201d I swung round to face his companion, who seemed in slightly better condition. \u201cAnd where are my housemaid and her sons?\u201d We were standing in the kitchen, and the hearth fire was out; Mrs. Bug hadn\u2019t come that morning, and wherever Amy and the boys were, they\u2019d been gone for some time.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d The man shrugged, indifferent. \u201cWasn\u2019t nobody to home when we came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the jewels?\u201d Donner grabbed at my arm, jerking me round to face him. His eyes were sunk in his head, and his grip was hot; he was burning with fever.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got any,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re ill. You should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do! I know you do! Everybody knows!\u201d</p> <p>That gave me momentary pause. Gossip being what it was, everybody likely thought they knew that Jamie had a small cache of jewels. Small wonder if word of this hypothetical treasure had reached Donner\u2014and little likelihood that I could convince him otherwise. I had no choice but to try, though.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes at that.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he said.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow in the direction of his accomplice. Did he want the man to know?</p><p>\u201cGo find Richie and Jed,\u201d Donner said briefly to the thug, who shrugged and went out. Richie and Jed? How on earth many people had he brought? Past the first shock of seeing him, I now became aware that there were thumping feet upstairs, and the sound of cupboard doors being banged impatiently down the hall.</p><p>\u201cMy surgery! Get them out of there!\u201d I dove for the door to the hallway, intending to perform this office myself, but Donner grabbed at my cloak to stop me.</p><p>I was bloody tired of being manhandled, and I wasn\u2019t afraid of this miserable excuse for a human being.</p> <p>\u201cLet go!\u201d I snapped, and kicked him briskly in the kneecap to emphasize the point. He yelped, but let go; I could hear him cursing behind me as I rushed through the door and down the hall.</p><p>Papers and books had been flung out into the hallway from Jamie\u2019s office, and a puddle of ink had been poured over them. The explanation of the ink was apparent when I saw the thug rifling my surgery\u2014he had a big blot of ink on the front of his shirt, where he had apparently sequestered the stolen pewter inkwell.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, you nitwit?\u201d I said. The thug, a boy of sixteen or so, blinked at me, mouth open. He had one of Mr. Blogweather\u2019s perfect glass globes in his hand; at this, he grinned maliciously and let it drop to the floor, where it shattered into a spray of fragments. One of the flying shards lanced through his cheek, slicing it open; he didn\u2019t feel it, until the blood began to well. Then he put a hand to the wound, frowning in puzzlement, and bellowed in fright at the blood on his hand.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d said Donner, behind me. He put his arms around me, and dragged me after him back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said urgently, releasing me. \u201cAll I want is two. You can keep the rest. I gotta have one to pay these guys, and one to\u2014to travel with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d I insisted, knowing that he wouldn\u2019t believe me. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got any. My daughter and her family\u2014they\u2019ve gone. Gone back. They used all we had. There aren\u2019t any more.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, disbelief plain in his burning eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, there are,\u201d he said positively. \u201cThere have to be. I gotta get out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind. I gotta go, and quick.\u201d He swallowed, eyes darting around the kitchen, as though the gems might be sitting casually on the sideboard. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>A hideous crash from the surgery, followed by an outbreak of shouted curses, prevented any reply I might have made. I moved by reflex toward the door, but Donner moved in front of me.</p><p>I was infuriated at this invasion, and beginning to be alarmed. While I\u2019d never seen any indication of violence from Donner, I wasn\u2019t so sure about the men he\u2019d brought with him. They might eventually give up and leave, when it became apparent that there were in fact no gems on the premises\u2014or they might try to beat the location of said gems out of me.</p><p>I pulled my cloak more tightly around myself and sat down on a bench, trying to think calmly.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said to Donner. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken the house apart\u2014\u201d A crash from upstairs shook the house, and I jumped. My God, it sounded as though they\u2019d tipped over the wardrobe. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken the house apart,\u201d I repeated, through gritted teeth, \u201cand you haven\u2019t found anything. Wouldn\u2019t I give them to you, if I had any, to save you wrecking the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t reckon you would. I wouldn\u2019t, if I was you.\u201d He rubbed a hand across his mouth. \u201cYou know what\u2019s going on\u2014the war and all.\u201d He shook his head in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be this way. Swear to God, half the people I meet don\u2019t know which way is up anymore. I thought it\u2019d be like, you know, redcoats and all, and you just keep away from anybody in a uniform, keep away from the battles, and it\u2019d be fine. But I haven\u2019t seen a redcoat anywhere, and people\u2014you know, just plain old people\u2014they\u2019re shooting each other and running around burning up each other\u2019s houses. . . .\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a minute. His cheeks went from red one moment to white the next; I could see he was very ill. I could hear him, too; the breath rattled wetly in his chest, and he wheezed faintly. If he fainted, how would I get rid of his companions?</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, opening his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going. Going back. I don\u2019t care what things are like then; it\u2019s a hell of a lot better\u2019n here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Indians?\u201d I inquired, with no more than a touch of sarcasm. \u201cLeaving them to their own devices, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, missing the sarcasm. \u201cTell you the truth, I\u2019m not so keen on Indians anymore, either.\u201d He rubbed absently at his upper chest, and I saw a large, puckered scar through a rent in his shirt.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d he said, longing clear in his voice, \u201cwhat I wouldn\u2019t give for a cold Bud and a baseball game on TV.\u201d Then his wandering attention snapped back to me. \u201cSo,\u201d he said in a halfway reasonable tone, \u201cI need those diamonds. Or whatever. Hand \u2019em over and we\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>I had been turning over various schemes for getting rid of them, to no particular avail, and was getting more uneasy by the moment. We had very little worth stealing, and from the looks of the rifled sideboard, they\u2019d already got what there was\u2014including, I realized, with a fresh stab of alarm, the pistols and powder. Before too much longer, they\u2019d grow impatient.</p><p>Someone might come\u2014Amy and the boys were likely at Brianna\u2019s cabin, which they were in process of moving into; they could come back at any moment. Someone could come looking for Jamie or myself\u2014though the chances of that receded by the moment, with the dying light. Even if someone did, though, the effect was likely to be disastrous.</p><p>Then I heard voices on the front porch, and the stamping of feet, and leapt to my own feet, my heart in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWould you quit doin\u2019 that?\u201d Donner said irritably. \u201cYou\u2019re the jumpiest twat I ever saw.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him, having recognized one of the voices. Sure enough, in the next moment, two of the thugs, brandishing pistols, shoved Jamie into the kitchen.</p><p>He was wary and disheveled, but his eyes went immediately to me, running up and down my body to assure himself that I was all right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said briefly. \u201cThese idiots think we have gemstones, and they want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they said.\u201d He straightened himself, shrugging to settle the coat on his shoulders, and glanced at the cupboards, hanging open, and the despoiled sideboard. Even the pie hutch had been overturned, and the remains of a raisin pie lay squashed on the floor, marked with a large heelprint. \u201cI gather they\u2019ve looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, mate,\u201d said one of the thugs, reasonably, \u201call we want\u2019s the swag. Just tell us where it is, and we go, no \u2019arm done, eh?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed the bridge of his nose, eyeing the man who\u2019d spoken.</p><p>\u201cI imagine my wife has told ye that we have no gems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she would, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d the thug said tolerantly. \u201cWomen, you know.\u201d He seemed to feel that now Jamie had showed up, they could get on with things in a more businesslike fashion, man-to-man.</p><p>Jamie sighed and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWhy d\u2019ye think I\u2019ve got any?\u201d he inquired, rather mildly. \u201cI have had, I admit\u2014but no longer. They\u2019ve been sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the money, then?\u201d The second thug was obviously quite willing to settle for that, no matter what Donner thought.</p><p>\u201cSpent,\u201d Jamie said briefly. \u201cI\u2019m a colonel of militia\u2014surely ye ken that much? It\u2019s an expensive business, provisioning a militia company. Food, guns, powder, shoes\u2014it adds up, aye? Why, the cost in shoe leather alone\u2014and then, to say nothing of shoon for the horses! Wagons, too; ye wouldna believe the scandalous cost of wagons. . . .\u201d</p><p>One of the thugs was frowning, but half-nodding, following this reasonable exegesis. Donner and his other companion were noticeably agitated, though.</p><p>\u201cShut up about the damn wagons,\u201d Donner said rudely, and bending, he snatched up one of Mrs. Bug\u2019s butcher knives from the floor. \u201cNow, look,\u201d he said, scowling and trying to look menacing. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with the stalling around. You tell me where they are, or\u2014or I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll cut her! Yeah, I\u2019ll cut her throat. Swear I will.\u201d With this, he clutched me by the shoulder and put the knife to my throat.</p><p>It had become clear to me some little time ago that Jamie was stalling for time, which meant that he expected something to happen. Which in turn meant he was expecting someone to come. That was reassuring, but I did think the apparent nonchalance of his demeanor in the face of my theoretically impending demise was perhaps carrying things a trifle too far.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, scratching at the side of his neck. \u201cWell, I wouldna do that, if I were you. She\u2019s the one who kens where the gems are, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d I cried indignantly.</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d One of the other thugs brightened at that.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Jamie assured him. \u201cLast time I went out wi\u2019 the militia, she hid them. Wouldna tell me where she\u2019d put them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014I thought you said you sold \u2019em and spent the money,\u201d Donner said, plainly confused.</p><p>\u201cI was lying,\u201d Jamie explained, patient.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if ye\u2019re going to kill my wife, well, then, of course that alters the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Donner, looking somewhat happier. \u201cYeah. Exactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we havena been introduced, sir,\u201d Jamie said politely, extending a hand. \u201cI am James Fraser. And you are . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Donner hesitated for a minute, unsure what to do with the knife in his right hand, but then shifted it awkwardly to his left and leaned forward to shake Jamie\u2019s hand briefly.</p><p>\u201cWendigo Donner,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I made a rude noise, but it was drowned by a series of crashes and the sound of breaking glass from the surgery. The lout in there must be clearing the shelves wholesale, flinging bottles and jars on the floor. I grasped Donner\u2019s hand and pulled the knife away from my throat, then sprang to my feet, in much the same state of insane fury in which I had once torched a field full of grasshoppers.</p><p>This time, it was Jamie who seized me around the middle as I darted toward the door, swinging me half off my feet.</p><p>\u201cLet go! I\u2019ll frigging kill him!\u201d I said, kicking madly.</p><p>\u201cWell, wait just a bit about that, Sassenach,\u201d he said, low-voiced, and lugged me back to the table, where he sat down with his arms wrapped around me, holding me firmly pinned on his lap. Further sounds of depredation came down the hall\u2014the splintering of wood and crunch of glass under a bootheel. Evidently, the young lout had given up searching for anything and was simply destroying for the fun of it.</p><p>I took a deep breath, preparatory to emitting a scream of frustration, but stopped.</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Donner said, wrinkling his nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? Somebody cut one?\u201d He looked accusingly at me, but I paid no attention. It was ether, heavy and sickly sweet.</p><p>Jamie stiffened slightly. He knew what it was, too, and essentially what it did.</p><p>Then he took a deep breath and carefully moved me off his lap, setting me on the bench beside him. I saw his eyes go to the knife sagging in Donner\u2019s hand, and heard what his keener ears had already picked up. Someone was coming.</p><p>He moved a little forward, getting his feet under him to spring, and flicked his eyes toward the cold hearth, where a heavy Dutch oven was sitting in the ashes. I nodded, very briefly, and as the back door opened, made a lunge across the kitchen.</p><p>Donner, with unexpected swiftness, stuck out a leg and tripped me. I fell headlong and slid, fetching up against the settle with a head-ringing thump. I groaned and lay still for a few moments, eyes closed, feeling all at once that I was much too old for this sort of carry-on. I opened my eyes reluctantly, and very stiffly got to my feet, to find the kitchen now full of people.</p><p>Donner\u2019s original sidekick had returned with two others, presumably Richie and Jed, and with them, the Bugs, Murdina looking alarmed, and Arch, coldly furious.</p><p>\u201cA leannan!\u201d Mrs. Bug cried, rushing toward me. \u201cAre ye hurt, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said, still rather dazed. \u201cJust let me . . . sit down for a moment.\u201d I looked at Donner, but he no longer held his knife. He had been frowning at the floor\u2014evidently he had dropped it when he tripped me\u2014but his head jerked up at sight of the newcomers.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you find anything?\u201d he asked eagerly, for both Richie and Jed were beaming with self-importance.</p><p>\u201cSure did,\u201d one of them assured him. \u201cLooka here!\u201d He was holding Mrs. Bug\u2019s workbag, and at this, he upended it and shook the contents out onto the table, where a mass of woolly knitting landed with a massive thunk! Eager hands pawed the wool away, revealing an eight-inch-long ingot of gold, the metal shaved away at one end, and stamped in the center with the royal French fleur-de-lis.</p><p>Stunned silence followed the appearance of this apparition. Even Jamie looked completely nonplussed.</p><p>Mrs. Bug had been pale when they came in; now she had gone the color of chalk, and her lips had disappeared. Arch\u2019s eyes went straight to Jamie\u2019s, dark and defiant.</p><p>The only person unimpressed by sight of the glowing metal was Donner.</p><p>\u201cWell, neato-mosquito,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the jewels? Keep your eye on the goal here, people!\u201d</p><p>His accomplices, however, had lost interest in theoretical jewels, with solid gold actually in hand, and were simultaneously discussing the possibility of more and squabbling over who should have custody of the present ingot.</p><p>My own head was spinning: from the blow, from the sudden appearance of the ingot and its revelations regarding the Bugs\u2014and particularly from the fumes of ether, which were getting notably stronger. No one in the kitchen had noticed, but all sound from the surgery had ceased; the young lout in there had undoubtedly passed out.</p><p>The bottle of ether had been nearly full; enough to anesthetize a dozen elephants, I thought dizzily\u2014or a houseful of people. Already, I could see Donner struggling to keep his head upright. A few minutes more, and all the thugs would likely have subsided into a state of innocuous desuetude\u2014but so would we.</p><p>Ether is heavier than air; the stuff would sink to the floor, where it would gradually rise in a pool around our knees. I stood up, taking a quick breath from the presumably purer air higher up. I had to get the window open.</p><p>Jamie and Arch were speaking Gaelic to each other, much too fast for me to follow, even had my head been in normal working order. Donner was frowning at them, mouth open as though he meant to tell them to stop but couldn\u2019t quite find the words.</p><p>I fumbled with the catch of the inside shutters, having to concentrate very hard in order to make my fingers work. Finally, the latch flipped free and I swung the shutter open\u2014revealing the leering face of an unfamiliar Indian in the twilight outside the window.</p><p>I shrieked and staggered back. Next thing, the back door sprang open and a squat bearded figure rushed in, bellowing in some incomprehensible tongue, followed by Ian, who was followed by yet another strange Indian, screaming and laying about himself with something\u2014tomahawk? club? I couldn\u2019t get my eyes to focus well enough to tell.</p><p>All was pandemonium, seen through glazed eyes. I clutched the windowsill to keep from sinking to the floor, but couldn\u2019t summon the presence of mind to open the damn window. Everyone was struggling and fighting, but the inhabitants of the kitchen were doing it in slow motion, yelling and staggering like drunks. As I watched, my mouth hanging unbecomingly open, Jamie painstakingly drew Donner\u2019s knife out from under his buttocks, brought it up in a slow, graceful arc, and buried it under Donner\u2019s breastbone.</p><p>Something flew past my ear and crashed through the window, destroying what was probably the only intact pane of glass left in the house.</p><p>I breathed in deep gulps of fresh air, trying to clear my head, and made frantic waving motions with my hands, shouting\u2014or trying to shout\u2014\u201cGet out! Get out!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bug was trying to do just that, crawling on hands and knees toward the half-open door. Arch hit the wall and slid slowly down beside her, face gone blank. Donner had fallen face forward over the table, his blood dripping nastily onto the floorboards, and another thug was lying in the extinct hearth, his skull crushed. Jamie was still upright, swaying, and the squat bearded figure was standing beside him, shaking his head and looking confused as the fumes began to affect him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I heard him ask.</p><p>The kitchen was nearly dark now, the figures swaying like fronds of kelp in some underwater forest.</p><p>I closed my eyes for a second. When I opened them again, Ian was saying, \u201cWait, I\u2019ll light a candle.\u201d He had one of Brianna\u2019s matches in his hand, the tin in the other.</p><p>\u201cIAN!\u201d I shrieked, and then he struck the match.</p><p>There was a soft whoof! noise, then a louder whoomp! as the ether in the surgery ignited, and suddenly we were standing in a pool of fire. For a fraction of a second, I felt nothing, and then a burst of searing heat. Jamie seized my arm and hurled me toward the door; I staggered out, fell into the blackberry bushes, and rolled through them, thrashing and flailing at my smoking skirts.</p><p>Panicked and still uncoordinated from the ether, I struggled with the strings of my apron, finally managing to rip loose the strings and wriggle out of it. My linen petticoats were singed, but not charred. I crouched panting in the dead weeds of the dooryard, unable to do anything for the moment but breathe. The smell of smoke was strong and pungent.</p><p>Mrs. Bug was on the back porch on her knees, jerking off her cap, which was on fire.</p><p>Men erupted through the back door, beating at their clothes and hair. Rollo was in the yard, barking hysterically, and on the other side of the house, I could hear the screams of frightened horses. Someone had got Arch Bug out\u2014he was stretched at full length in the dead grass, most of his hair and eyebrows gone, but evidently still alive.</p><p>My legs were red and blistered, but I wasn\u2019t badly burned\u2014thank God for layers of linen and cotton, which burn slowly, I thought groggily. Had I been wearing something modern like rayon, I should have gone up like a torch.</p><p>The thought made me look back toward the house. It was full dark by now, and all the windows on the lower floor were alight. Flame danced in the open door. The place looked like an immense jack-o\u2019-lantern.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re Mistress Fraser, I suppose?\u201d The squat, bearded person bent over me, speaking in a soft Scottish burr.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, coming gradually to myself. \u201cWho are you, and where\u2019s Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie stumbled out of the dark and sat down heavily beside me. He waved a hand at the Scotsman. \u201cMay I present Mr. Alexander Cameron, known more generally as Scotchee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>I was feeling gingerly at my hair. Clumps of it had been singed to crispy thread, but at least I still had some.</p><p>I felt, rather than saw, Jamie look up at the house. I followed the direction of his glance, and saw a dark figure at the window upstairs, framed in the dim glow from the burning downstairs. He shouted something in the incomprehensible tongue, and began throwing things out of the window.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, feeling more than slightly surreal.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jamie rubbed at his face. \u201cThat would be Goose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it would,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a cooked goose, if he stays in there.\u201d This struck me as wildly hilarious, and I doubled up in laughter.</p><p>Evidently, it wasn\u2019t quite as witty as I\u2019d thought; no one else seemed to think it funny. Jamie stood up and shouted something at the dark figure, who waved nonchalantly and turned back into the room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ladder in the barn,\u201d Jamie said calmly to Scotchee, and they moved off into the darkness.</p><p>The house burned fairly slowly for a while; there weren\u2019t a lot of easily flammable objects down below, bar the books and papers in Jamie\u2019s study. A tall figure belted out of the back door, shirt pulled up over his nose with one hand, the tail of his shirt held up with the other to form a bag.</p><p>Ian came to a stop beside me, dropped to his knees, gasping, and let down his shirttail, releasing a pile of small objects.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I could get, I\u2019m afraid, Auntie.\u201d He coughed a few times, waving his hand in front of his face. \u201cD\u2019ye ken what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d I said. The heat was becoming more intense, and I struggled to my knees. \u201cCome on; we\u2019ll need to get Arch further away.\u201d</p><p>The effects of the ether had mostly worn off, but I was still conscious of a strong sense of unreality. I hadn\u2019t anything but cold well water with which to treat burns, but bathed Arch\u2019s neck and hands, which had been badly blistered. Mrs. Bug\u2019s hair had been singed, but she, like me, had been largely protected by her heavy skirts.</p><p>Neither she nor Arch said a word.</p><p>Amy McCallum came running up, face pale in the fiery glow; I told her to take the Bugs to Brianna\u2019s cabin\u2014hers now\u2014and for God\u2019s sake, keep the little boys safe away. She nodded and went, she and Mrs. Bug supporting Arch\u2019s tall form between them.</p><p>No one made any effort to bring out the bodies of Donner and his companions.</p><p>I could see when the fire took hold in the stairwell; there was a sudden strong glow in the upstairs windows, and shortly thereafter, I could see flames in the heart of the house.</p><p>Snow began to fall, in thick, heavy, silent flakes. Within half an hour, the ground, trees, and bushes were dusted with white. The flames glowed red and gold, and the white snow reflected a soft reddish glow; the whole clearing seemed filled with the light of the fire.</p><p>Somewhere around midnight, the roof fell in, with a crash of glowing timbers and a tremendous shower of sparks that fountained high into the night. The sight was so beautiful that everyone watching went \u201cOooooh!\u201d in involuntary awe.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s arm tightened round me. We could not look away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the date today?\u201d I asked suddenly.</p><p>He frowned for a moment, thinking, then said, \u201cDecember twenty-first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we aren\u2019t dead, either. Bloody newspapers,\u201d I said. \u201cThey never get anything right.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, he thought that was very funny indeed, and laughed until he had to sit down on the ground.</p><p>124</p><p>PROPERTY OF THE KING</p><p>WE SPENT THE REMAINDER OF the night sleeping\u2014or at least horizontal\u2014on the floor of the cabin, with the Bugs, Goose and his brother, Light\u2014who confused me initially by referring to themselves as Jamie\u2019s \u201csons\u201d\u2014Scotchee, and Ian. On their way to visit Bird\u2019s village, the Indians\u2014for Alexander Cameron was as much an Indian as the others, I thought\u2014had met Jamie and Ian, hunting, and accepted Jamie\u2019s hospitality.</p><p>\u201cThough it was a warmer welcome than we expected, Bear-Killer!\u201d Goose said, laughing.</p><p>They did not ask who Donner was, nor make any reference to the men whose bodies burned in the funeral pyre of the house\u2014only asked awed questions about the ether, and shook their heads in amazement, watching the fire.</p><p>For Jamie\u2019s part, I noticed that he did not ask why they were going to Bird\u2019s village\u2014and concluded that he did not want to hear that some of the Cherokee had decided to support the King. He listened to the talk, but said little, spending his time fingering through the pile of objects saved from the fire. There was little of value there\u2014a few scorched, loose pages from my casebook, some pewter spoons, a bullet mold. But when he fell asleep at last next to me, I saw that his fist was closed around something, and peering closely in the dark, made out the protruding head of the little cherrywood snake.</p><p>I woke just past dawn to find Aidan peering down at me, Adso in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI found your wee cheetie in my bed,\u201d Aidan whispered. \u201cD\u2019ye want him?\u201d</p><p>I was about to refuse, but then saw the look in Adso\u2019s eye. He was very tolerant of small children normally, but Aidan was holding him round the middle like a bag of laundry, his back legs dangling ludicrously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, my voice hoarse from smoke. \u201cHere\u2014I\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, but having accepted the cat, saw that most of the household was still asleep, rolled in blankets on the floor. Two notable exceptions: Jamie and Arch Bug were missing. I got up, and borrowing Amy\u2019s cloak from beside the door, went out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The snow had stopped during the night, but there were two or three inches on the ground. I put Adso down under the eaves, where the ground was clear, and then\u2014with a deep breath to steady myself\u2014turned to look at the house.</p><p>Steam rose from the charred remains, which stood inkblot black and stark against the white-furred trees behind it. Only about half the house had burned completely; the west wall was still standing, as were the stone chimney stacks. The rest was a mass of charred timbers and mounded ash, already turning gray. The upper story was completely gone, and as for my surgery . . .</p><p>I turned away, hearing voices behind the house. Jamie and Arch were in the woodshed, but the door was open; I could see them inside, face to face. Jamie saw me hovering, and beckoned me in with a nod.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Arch,\u201d I said, peering at our erstwhile factor. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better, a nighean, thank ye kindly,\u201d he said, and coughed. His voice was little more than a harsh whisper, damaged by smoke, and there were enormous, fluid-filled blisters on both hands and face. Bar the loss of his hair and eyebrows, though, I thought he was otherwise all right.</p><p>\u201cArch was just about to explain this to me, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie pointed a toe at the gleaming metal of the gold ingot lying in the sawdust and wood chips at his feet. \u201cWere ye not, Arch?\u201d</p><p>His voice was outwardly pleasant, but I heard the steel in it as clearly as Arch did. Arch Bug was no pushover, though, eyebrows or no eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI owe ye nay explanations of anything, Seaumais mac Brian,\u201d he said with equal pleasantness.</p><p>\u201cI give ye the chance of explanation, man, not the choice.\u201d He\u2019d dropped the pleasant tone. Jamie was smudged with soot, and scorched round the edges, but his eyebrows were intact and being put to good use. He turned to me, gesturing to the gold.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019ve seen it before, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The last time I\u2019d seen it, it had been gleaming in the lantern light, packed solid with its fellows in the bottom of a coffin in Hector Cameron\u2019s mausoleum, but the shape of the ingots and the fleur-de-lis stamp were unmistakable. \u201cUnless Louis of France has been sending someone else vast quantities of gold, it\u2019s part of Jocasta\u2019s hoard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is not, and never was,\u201d Arch corrected me firmly.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie cocked a thick brow at him. \u201cTo whom does it belong, then, if not to Jocasta Cameron? D\u2019ye claim it as your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d He hesitated, but the urge to speak was powerful. \u201cIt is the property of the King,\u201d he said, and his old mouth closed tight on the last word.</p><p>\u201cWhat, the King of\u2014oh,\u201d I said, realizing at long last. \u201cThat king.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLe roi, c\u2019est mort,\u201d Jamie said softly, as though to himself, but Arch turned fiercely to him.</p><p>\u201cIs Scotland dead?\u201d</p><p>Jamie drew breath, but didn\u2019t speak at once. Instead, he gestured me to a seat on the stack of chopped cordwood, and nodded at Arch to take another, before sitting down beside me.</p><p>\u201cScotland will die when her last son does, a charaid,\u201d he said, and waved a hand toward the door, taking in the mountains and hollows around us\u2014and all the people therein. \u201cHow many are here? How many will be? Scotland lives\u2014but not in Italy.\u201d In Rome, he meant, where Charles Stuart eked out what remained to him of a life, drowning his disappointed dreams of a crown in drink.</p><p>Arch narrowed his eyes at this, but kept a stubborn silence.</p><p>\u201cYe were the third man, were ye not?\u201d Jamie asked, disregarding this. \u201cWhen the gold was brought ashore from France. Dougal MacKenzie took one-third, and Hector Cameron another. I couldna say what Dougal did with his\u2014gave it to Charles Stuart, most likely, and may God have mercy on his soul for that. You were tacksman to Malcolm Grant; he sent ye, did he not? You took one-third of the gold on his behalf. Did ye give it to him?\u201d</p><p>Arch nodded, slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt was given in trust,\u201d he said, and his voice cracked. He cleared his throat and spat, the mucus tinged with black. \u201cTo me, and then to the Grant\u2014who should have given it in turn to the King\u2019s son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Jamie asked, interested. \u201cOr did he think, like Hector Cameron, that it was too late?\u201d</p><p>It had been; the cause was already lost at that point\u2014no gold could have made a difference. Arch\u2019s lips pressed so tightly together as almost to be invisible.</p><p>\u201cHe did what he did,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cWhat he thought right. That money was spent for the welfare of the clan. But Hector Cameron was a traitor, and his wife with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you who spoke to Jocasta in her tent,\u201d I said suddenly, realizing. \u201cAt the Gathering where you met Jamie. You\u2019d come there to find her, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Arch seemed surprised that I had spoken, but inclined his head an inch or so in acknowledgment. I wondered whether he had accepted\u2014had sought?\u2014a place with Jamie on account of his relationship with Jocasta.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u201d\u2014I poked a toe at the shaved ingot\u2014\u201cyou found in Jocasta\u2019s house, when you went with Roger and Duncan to bring back the fisher-folk.\u201d Proof\u2014if he had needed it\u2014that Jocasta did indeed still have Hector\u2019s share of the French gold.</p><p>\u201cWhat I am wondering, myself,\u201d Jamie said, rubbing a finger down the long, straight bridge of his nose, \u201cis how the devil ye found the rest of it, and then got it away.\u201d</p><p>Arch\u2019s lips pursed for a moment, then reluctantly unsealed themselves.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas no great feat. I saw the salt at Hector\u2019s tomb\u2014the way the black slaves kept awa\u2019. If he didna rest easy, it was nay wonder\u2014but where would the gold better be, save wi\u2019 him?\u201d A wintry light shone in his faded eyes. \u201cI kent Hector Cameron, a bit. He wasna the man to give up anything, only by reason of bein\u2019 dead.\u201d</p><p>Arch made frequent trips to Cross Creek as factor, to buy and trade. He was not usually a guest at River Run, but had been there often enough to be familiar with the property. If anyone saw a figure near the mausoleum at night\u2014well, everyone knew that Hector Cameron\u2019s ghost \u201cwalked,\u201d confined to one spot only by the lines of salt; no one would ever go close enough to investigate.</p><p>And so he had simply abstracted one ingot on each trip\u2014and not on every trip\u2014eventually removing the whole hoard, before Duncan Innes discovered the loss.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna have kept out that first ingot, I see that,\u201d he said, ruefully nodding at it. \u201cAt the first, though, I thought we might have need of it\u2014Murdina and I. And then, when she was obliged to kill yon Brown\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head jerked up, and we both stared at him. He coughed.</p><p>\u201cThe wicked creature grew well enough to poke about the cabin when she was oot; he found that\u201d\u2014he nodded again at the ingot\u2014\u201cin her workbag, where she\u2019d hidden it. He couldna ken, of course, what it was\u2014but he kent well enough that ragged folk such as we ought not to have such a thing.\u201d His thin mouth pressed tight again, and I remembered that he had been chief tacksman for the Grant of clan Grant\u2014a man of worth. Once.</p><p>\u201cHe asked about it, and she wouldna tell him anything, of course. But then, when he made his way to your house, she feared he would tell what he\u2019d seen. And so she made an end to him.\u201d</p><p>It was said calmly; after all, what else could she do? Not for the first time, I wondered just what other things the Bugs had done\u2014or been forced to do\u2014in the years after Culloden.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye kept the gold out of King George\u2019s hands, at least,\u201d Jamie said, a certain note of bleakness in his voice. I thought he was thinking of the battle at Moore\u2019s Creek Bridge. If Hugh MacDonald had had that gold, with which to buy powder and arms, the victory there would not have been so easily won. Nor would the Highlanders have been slaughtered\u2014again\u2014charging sword in hand into the mouths of cannon.</p><p>\u201cArch,\u201d I said, when the silence threatened to become oppressive, \u201cwhat, exactly, did you plan to do with it?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at that, and looked down at the ingot.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I meant at first only to see if it was true what I\u2019d heard\u2014that Hector Cameron had taken his part of the gold away with him, used it for his own ends. Then I found Hector dead, but \u2019twas clear from the way his wife lived that he had indeed taken it. So I wondered\u2014was there any left?\u201d</p><p>One hand crept up, massaging his withered throat.</p><p>\u201cTo tell ye the truth, mistress\u2014I wished mostly to take it back from Jocasta Cameron. Having done that, though . . .\u201d His voice died away, but then he shook himself.</p><p>\u201cI am a man of my word, Seaumais mac Brian. I swore an oath to my chief\u2014and kept it, \u2019til he died. I swore my oath to the King across the water\u201d\u2014James Stuart, he meant\u2014\u201cbut he is dead, now, too. And then\u2014I swore loyalty to George of England when I came upon this shore. So tell me now where my duty lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe swore an oath to me, too, Archibald mac Donagh,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Arch smiled at that, a wry expression, but a smile nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cAnd by reason of that oath, ye\u2019re still alive, Seaumais mac Brian,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have killed ye last night in your sleep and been well awa\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s mouth twisted in a look that expressed considerable doubt of this statement, but he forbore to contradict.</p><p>\u201cYou are free of your oath to me,\u201d he said formally in Gaelic. \u201cTake your life from my hand.\u201d And inclining his head toward the ingot, said, \u201cTake that\u2014and go.\u201d</p><p>Arch regarded him for a moment, unblinking. Then stooped, picked up the ingot, and went.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask him where the gold is now,\u201d I observed, watching the tall old man make his way round the cabin to rouse his wife.</p><p>\u201cYe think he would ha\u2019 told me?\u201d He stood up then, and stretched himself. Then he shook himself like a dog, and went to stand in the doorway of the shed, arms braced in the door frame, looking out. It was beginning to snow again.</p><p>\u201cI see it\u2019s not only the Frasers who are stubborn as rocks,\u201d I said, coming to stand beside him. \u201cScotland lives, all right.\u201d That made him laugh.</p><p>He put one arm around me, and I rested my head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYour hair smells of smoke, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cEverything smells of smoke,\u201d I replied just as softly.</p><p>The burned ruins of the house were still too warm for snow to stick, but that would pass. If it went on snowing, by tomorrow the house would be obliterated, white as the rocks and trees. We, too\u2014eventually.</p><p>I thought of Jocasta and Duncan, gone to the safety of Canada, the welcome of kinfolk. Where would the Bugs go\u2014back to Scotland? For an instant, I longed to go, too. Away from loss and desolation. Home.</p><p>But then I remembered.</p><p>\u201cSo long as one hundred of us remain alive . . . ,\u201d I quoted.</p><p>Jamie tilted his head against mine for a moment, then raised it and turned to look down at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd when ye go to a sick man\u2019s bed, Sassenach\u2014to a wounding or a birth\u2014how is it, then, that ye can rise from your own bed, even from mortal weariness, and go in the dark, alone? Why is it that ye willna wait, that ye dinna say no, ever? Why is it that ye willna forbear, even when ye know the case to be hopeless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I kept my gaze on the ruin of the house, its ashes growing cold before my eyes. I knew what he meant, the unwelcome truth he would force me to speak\u2014but the truth lay between us, and must be told. \u201cI cannot . . . can not . . . admit . . . that there is anything to do but win.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my chin and tilted my face upward, so that I was obliged to meet his eyes. His own face was worn with tiredness, the lines cut deep by eyes and mouth, but the eyes themselves were clear, cool, and fathomless as the waters of a hidden spring.</p><p>\u201cNor can I,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe can at least promise me the victory,\u201d he said, but his voice held the whisper of a question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and touched his face. I sounded choked, and my vision blurred. \u201cYes, I can promise that. This time.\u201d No mention made of what that promise spared, of the things I could not guarantee. Not life, not safety. Not home, nor family; not law nor legacy. Just the one thing\u2014or maybe two.</p><p>\u201cThe victory,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that I will be with you \u2019til the end.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment. Snowflakes pelted down, melting as they struck his face, sticking for an instant, white on his lashes. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThat is enough,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI ask no more.\u201d</p><p>He reached forward then and took me in his arms, held me close for a moment, the breath of snow and ashes cold around us. Then he kissed me, released me, and I took a deep breath of cold air, harsh with the scent of burning. I brushed a floating smut off my arm.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . good. Bloody good. Er . . .\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWhat do you suggest we do next?\u201d</p><p>He stood looking at the charred ruin, eyes narrowed, then lifted his shoulders and let them fall.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cwe shall go\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly, frowning. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Something was moving at the side of the house. I blinked away the snowflakes, standing on tiptoe to see better.</p><p>\u201cOh, it can\u2019t be!\u201d I said\u2014but it was. With a tremendous upheaval of snow, dirt, and charred wood, the white sow thrust her way into daylight. Fully emerged, she shook her massive shoulders, then, pink snout twitching irritably, moved purposefully off toward the wood. A moment later, a smaller version likewise emerged\u2014and another, and another . . . and eight half-grown piglets, some white, some spotted, and one as black as the timbers of the house, trotted off in a line, following their mother.</p><p>\u201cScotland lives,\u201d I said again, giggling uncontrollably. \u201cEr\u2014where did you say we were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Scotland,\u201d he said as though this were obvious. \u201cTo fetch my printing press.\u201d</p><p>He was still looking at the house, but his eyes were fixed somewhere beyond the ashes, far beyond the present moment. An owl hooted deep in the distant wood, startled from its sleep. He stood silent for a bit, then shook off his reverie, and smiled at me, snow melting in his hair.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d he said simply, \u201cwe shall come back to fight.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and turned away from the house, toward the barn where the horses stood waiting, patient in the cold.</p><p>EPILOGUE I</p><p>LALLYBROCH</p><p>THE PENLIGHT\u2019S BEAM MOVED SLOWLY across the heavy oak rafter, paused at a suspicious hole, then passed on. The heavyset man wore a frown of scrupulous concentration, lips pursed like one momentarily expecting some unpleasant surprise.</p><p>Brianna stood beside him, looking up at the shadowed recesses of the ceiling in the entry hall, wearing a similar frown of concentration. She would not recognize woodworm or termites unless a rafter actually fell on her, she thought, but it seemed polite to behave as though she were paying attention.</p><p>In fact, only half her attention was focused on the heavyset gentleman\u2019s murmured remarks to his helot, a small young woman in an overall too big for her, with pink streaks in her hair. The other half was focused on the noises from upstairs, where the children were theoretically playing hide \u2019n seek among the jumble of packing boxes. Fiona had brought over her brood of three small fiends, and then craftily abandoned them, running off to do an errand of some sort, promising to return by teatime.</p><p>Brianna glanced at her wristwatch, still surprised at seeing it there. Half an hour yet to go. If they could avoid bloodshed until\u2014</p><p>A piercing scream from upstairs made her grimace. The helot, less hardened, dropped her clipboard with a yelp.</p><p>\u201cMAMA!\u201d Jem, in tattling mode.</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d she roared in answer. \u201cI\u2019m BUSY!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mama! Mandy hit me!\u201d came an indignant report from the top of the stairs. Looking up, she could see the top of his head, the light from the window glowing on his hair.</p><p>\u201cShe did? Well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a stick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAND . . .\u201d\u2014a pause before the damning denouement\u2014\u201cSHE DIDN\u2019T SAY SHE WAS SORRY!\u201d</p><p>The builder and his helot had given up looking for woodworm, in favor of following this gripping narrative, and now both of them looked at Brianna, doubtless in expectation of some Solomonic decree.</p><p>Brianna closed her eyes momentarily.</p><p>\u201cMANDY,\u201d she bellowed. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon\u2019t!\u201d came a high-pitched refusal from above.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye will!\u201d came Jem\u2019s voice, followed by scuffling. Brianna headed for the stair, blood in her eye. Just as she set her foot on the tread, Jem uttered a piercing squeal.</p><p>\u201cShe BIT me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah MacKenzie, don\u2019t you dare bite her back!\u201d she shouted. \u201cBoth of you stop it this instant!\u201d</p><p>Jem thrust a disheveled head through the banister, hair sticking up on end. He was wearing bright blue eye shadow, and someone had applied pink lipstick in a crude mouth-shape from one ear to the other.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a feisty wee baggage,\u201d he ferociously informed the fascinated spectators below. \u201cMy grandda said so.\u201d</p><p>Brianna wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh, cry, or utter a loud shriek, but with a hasty wave at the builder and his assistant, she ran up the stairs to sort them out.</p><p>The sorting took rather more time than expected, since she discovered in the process that Fiona\u2019s three little girls, so notably quiet during the latest squabble, had been quiet because\u2014having decorated Jem, Mandy, and themselves\u2014they were busily engaged in painting faces on the bathroom walls with Brianna\u2019s new makeup.</p><p>Coming back down a quarter of an hour later, she discovered the builder sitting peaceably on an upturned coal scuttle, having his tea break, while the helot wandered open-mouthed about the entry hall, a half-eaten scone in one hand.</p><p>\u201cAll those kids yours?\u201d she asked Brianna, with a sympathetic quirk of one pierced brow.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank God. Does everything look all right down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch o\u2019 damp,\u201d the builder said cheerfully. \u201cOnly to be expected, though, old place like this. When\u2019s it built, then, hen, d\u2019ye know?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1721, thickie,\u201d the helot said, with comfortable scorn. \u201cDid ye not see it carved in the lintel, there, where we came in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, then, is it?\u201d The builder looked interested, but not enough to get up and look for himself. \u201cCost a fortune to put back in shape, won\u2019t it?\u201d He nodded at the wall, where one of the oak panels showed the damage of boots and sabers, crisscrossed with slashes whose rawness had darkened with the years, but still showed clear.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t fix that,\u201d Brianna said, a lump in her throat. \u201cThat was done right after the \u201945. It\u2019ll stay that way.\u201d We keep it so, her uncle had told her, to remember always what the English are.</p><p>\u201cOh, historic-like. Right you are, then,\u201d the builder said, nodding wisely. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t often mind about the history so much, do they? Wanting all mod cons, electric cookers, effing automatic thisses and thats. Central heating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle for toilets that flush,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThat, and hot water. Speaking of which, will you have a look at the boiler? It\u2019s in a shed in the yard, and it\u2019s fifty years old if it\u2019s a day. And we\u2019ll want to replace the geyser in the upstairs bath, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d The builder brushed crumbs from his shirt, corked his Thermos flask, and rose ponderously to his feet. \u201cCome on, Angie, let\u2019s have a look, then.\u201d</p><p>Brianna hovered suspiciously at the foot of the stair, listening for any sounds of riot before following, but all was well above; she could hear the crash of building blocks, evidently being thrown at the walls, but no yells of outrage. She turned to follow, just in time to see the builder, who had paused to look up at the lintel.</p><p>\u201cThe \u201945, eh? Ever think what it\u2019d be like?\u201d he was saying. \u201cIf Bonnie Prince Charlie had won, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, in your dreams, Stan! He\u2019d never a chance, bloody Eyetalian ponce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, naw, he\u2019d have done it, sure, was it no for the effing Campbells. Traitors, aye? To a man. And a woman, too, I expect,\u201d he added, laughing\u2014from which Brianna gathered that the helot\u2019s last name was very likely Campbell.</p><p>They passed on toward the shed, their argument growing more heated, but she stopped, not wanting to go after them until she had herself under control.</p><p>Oh, God, she prayed passionately, oh, God\u2014that they might be safe! Please, please, let them be safe. It didn\u2019t matter how ridiculous it might be to pray for the safety of people who had been\u2014who had to be\u2014dead for more than two hundred years. It was the only thing she could do, and did it several times each day, whenever she thought of them. Much more often, now that they had come to Lallybroch.</p><p>She blinked back tears, and saw Roger\u2019s Mini Cooper come down the winding drive. The backseat was piled high with boxes; he was finally clearing out the last bits of rubbish from the Reverend\u2019s garage, salvaging those items that might have value to someone\u2014a dismayingly high proportion of the contents.</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d she said, a little shaky, as he came up the walk smiling, a large box under his arm. She still found him startling with short hair. \u201cTen minutes more, and I\u2019d kill somebody, for sure. Probably Fiona, for starters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d He bent and kissed her with particular enthusiasm, indicating that he probably hadn\u2019t heard what she\u2019d said. \u201cI\u2019ve got something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see. What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know.\u201d</p><p>The box he laid on the ancient dining table was wood, as well; a sizable casket made of maple, darkened by years, soot, and handling, but with the workmanship still apparent to her practiced eye. It was beautifully made, the joints perfectly dovetailed, with a sliding top\u2014but the top didn\u2019t slide, having been at some point sealed with a thick bead of what looked like melted beeswax, gone black with age.</p><p>The most striking thing about it, though, was the top. Burned into the wood was a name: Jeremiah Alexander Ian Fraser MacKenzie.</p><p>She felt a clenching in her lower belly at the sight of it, and glanced up at Roger, who was tense with some suppressed feeling; she could feel it vibrating through him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, and pulled a filthy envelope from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThis was with it, taped to the side. It\u2019s the Reverend\u2019s handwriting, one of the little notes he\u2019d sometimes put with something to explain its significance, just in case. But I can\u2019t say this is an explanation, exactly.\u201d</p><p>The note was brief, stating merely that the box had come from a defunct banking house in Edinburgh. Instructions had been stored with the box, stating that it was not to be opened, save by the person whose name was inscribed thereon. The original instructions had perished, but were passed on verbally by the person from whom he obtained the box.</p><p>\u201cAnd who was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Do you have a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a knife,\u201d she muttered, digging in the pocket of her jeans. \u201cDo I ever not have a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a rhetorical question,\u201d he said, kissing her hand and taking the bright red Swiss Army knife she offered him.</p><p>The beeswax cracked and split away easily; the lid of the box, though, was unwilling to yield after so many years. It took both of them\u2014one clutching the box, the other pushing and pulling on the lid\u2014but finally, it came free with a small squealing noise.</p><p>The ghost of a scent floated out; something indistinguishable, but plantlike in origin.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d she said involuntarily. Roger glanced at her, startled, but she gestured at him urgently to go on. He reached carefully into the box and removed its contents: a stack of letters, folded and sealed with wax, two books\u2014and a small snake made of cherrywood, heavily polished by long handling.</p><p>She made a small, inarticulate sound and seized the top letter, pressing it so hard against her chest that the paper crackled and the wax seal split and fell away. The thick, soft paper, whose fibers showed the faint stains of what had once been flowers.</p><p>Tears were falling down her face, and Roger was saying something, but she didn\u2019t attend the words, and the children were making an uproar upstairs, the builders were still arguing outside, and the only thing in the world she could see were the faded words on the page, written in a sprawling, difficult hand.</p><p>December 31, 1776</p><p>My dear daughter,</p><p>As you will see if ever you receive this, we are alive. . . .</p><p>EPILOGUE II</p><p>THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS</p><p>WHAT\u2019S THIS, THEN?\u201d Amos Crupp squinted at the page laid out in the bed of the press, reading it backward with the ease of long experience.</p><p>\u201cIt is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire . . . Where\u2019d that come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNote from a subscriber,\u201d said Sampson, his new printer\u2019s devil, shrugging as he inked the plate. \u201cGood for a bit of filler, there, I thought; General Washington\u2019s address to the troops run short of the page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. I s\u2019pose. Very old news, though,\u201d Crupp said, glancing at the date. \u201cJanuary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d the devil admitted, heaving down on the lever that lowered the page onto the plate of inked type. The press sprang up again, the letters wet and black on the paper, and he picked the sheet off with nimble fingertips, hanging it up to dry. \u201c\u2019Twas December, by the notice. But I\u2019d set the page in Baskerville twelve-point, and the slugs for November and December are missing in that font. Not room to do it in separate letters, and not worth the labor to reset the whole page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Amos, losing interest in the matter, as he perused the last paragraphs of Washington\u2019s speech. \u201cScarcely signifies, anyway. After all, they\u2019re all dead, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
